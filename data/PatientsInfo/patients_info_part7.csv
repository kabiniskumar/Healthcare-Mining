I was sent to an oral surgeon because my insurance apparently doesn't cover root canals on molar teeth. It was an emergency oral surgeon the office was full of patients and I was literally screaming crouching on floor from pain. My 7 year old and my cousin were present so my well spoken cousin told staff do you not see how much pain she's in can you please do something this is absolutely not fair. They told her I have to wait anyways i continued to cry and scream until the dentist came out to say you can come in now I'm ready for you. She suggested I be sedated I told her I would prefer to be awake after all I got my wisdom done years prior with no sedation. She seemed a bit nervous as if every other patient agrees for sedation with extractions so she advised me it's best I get sedated. I expressed firmly that we won't be doing that today due to my child being present and local anesthesia was fine. She did just that and began the extraction I heard my tooth break seen her scrambling as I made a groaning noise and she said all set. I went home with alot of pain continued for a month. I didnt recall pain being this severe with any extraction. I tried to see my regular dentist but she was on maternity leave. I got appointment with a big clinic associated with my local hospital. Prior i did research due to me feeling with my tongue sharp pieces on side of my gums. A piece of something hard broke during me eating from where my extraction was. The new dentist told me its bone fragment and it will continue to surface and fall out. It's been 3 months my gums are inflamed it feels like thorns are in my gums or pieces of glass. I can't eat and now I have a new open wound exposing me to bacteria. He refused to believe my gums were swollen and now the swelling has spread. I need help and I cant believe I was left to suffer. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Yesterday I noticed that I have a rash that is warm to the touch around the site of the sting (roughly 4 inches in diameter).  It's not centered on the sting site -- the sting was just below the inside of my knee (extreme upper calf), and the rash starts there and goes down my leg.  I noticed it immediately after mowing the lawn in 80+ degrees, which was probably the first time I really broke a good sweat since I was stung.

About a week ago, a pink spot appeared on my right eyebrow. At first I thought nothing of it, but it has now escalated into a full blown rash all across my face. Little skin spots (almost resemble whitehead pimples) filled with really clear liquid appear, and they easily get punctured. When they do, a big open pink spot appears, and then it scabs over. This has spread all over my face, and while it is clearly getting better, I'm still extremely worried. I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow, but during this week I've quite literally moved 250 miles to the bay area, so this could not have had worse timing. I feel 100% fine otherwise, hence why I think it's an allergic reaction. It is primarily only on my face, and based off of research I've been doing, I think it's an allergic reaction to phenoxyethanol, which is a controversial preservative used in ointments and creams. I've stopped using any products with it in it, so it has slowed down, but I'm still worried. Any recommendations would be great. 0 likes, 2 replies "

We eventually settled on Nutramagen which took care of the colic. By 3 months he had his first signs of eczema. He had cradle cap and infected cheeks from scratching.

Hes had 3 rounds of antibiotics before 1 year old. After these hard lessons we developed routines of 2 baths a day with a tea tree oil castille soap mixture so hes clean but not over washed. Then we apply aquaphor asap to lock in his moisture. Weve stayed away from steroids so long as hes not severe.

On the bike ride to work, stick came from under the front wheel and cut me in my leg quite deep. I did not  care much but I had already a infection and over night scratching infected my whole groin area including my little friend:( four months later no change. every day and night is hell. I’m wrapping my groin area with organic cotton shirt and ice packs. I took steroids for two weeks, give me a boost but did not help with the eczema. My current situation is full up with stress embarrassment an emotional disaster which of course doesn’t help my illness. But to be honest I don’t believe any of it. i have been watching myself quite carefully for the past seven years And it doesn’t matter if I’m stressed or totally happy and excited it doesn’t matter if it’s too hot or too cold to humid or to dry I will itch anyway. And now since my private parts are affected sex have became so painful that I don’t enjoy it anymore. As you can see I’m very frustrated but I feel like I reach the end I don’t even want to ask a question How did you kill your genital eczema? Or did it went away after a time? I just wanna let you guys know that there’s no cure. I don’t understand why such a nerve racking chronic illness doesn’t get any attention. Every time someone talks about eczema it’s always babies and beautiful woman with few spots on the face. Nobody talks about blood from scratching, no sleep at night, Frustration from your partner or friends and family that just don’t want to understand this illness, money and time that will never come back, wasted opportunities and events you were not able to attend due to flare up, wait I have more how about seven different doctors in 3 years looking at your private parts without any diagnose !?  But with stupid remarks!? And now how I supposed to meet a new woman and have sex with her and enjoy myself and feel confident..hmm  Well there’s no good answer to this question like all of our doctors would like to tell us to just go home and try to live healthy and stop trying to cure something that they cannot cure! yep all this talking about stress food weather smoking.I give a try to all and i had so much time in the past seven years and nothing works100%  the United States like with everything here they just trying to make money hey by my oil or by my book how about this diet or similar stuff like that make peoples brains to sponges!

Soon a lump on the back of the side of my neck developed and it was very painful. I could not touch it or move my head too much or swiftly. The itchiness intensified extremely just at that moment. I felt   amongst the itchiness on my scalp. The pain from the lump on my neck disappeared just as the itchiness disappeared within a matter of two/three days. The itchiness turned into a constant bearable scraping pain (almost like peeling off scabs) , although it is still slightly itchy at times. I took a picture of it (attached) and the lumps turned into a scab like rash going from the top of my left side of the scalp to the left side of the back of my neck. Do you know what this is, what's it from and what can be done to cure it? Many thanks. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Help!!,"Hi everyone, I recently returned home from university due to the ongoing pandemic. When I’ve returned home slowly I have had spots and kind of rashes popping up randomly on my body. It’s in places such as my lower torso, groin, knee caps and a bit on my arms and calf’s. I’m not sure if this is   or something more serious like   or something. The reason we think it could be contact dermatitis is because my mum and brother are allergic to Persil washing tablets, and before I left university I bought these for the first time and did one wash with them. We have now re-washed all my clothes with fairy but the odd spot pops up and is itchy in random points of the day not necessarily at night time. I’ve attached some photos but obviously they are hard to see from my hair, if anyone could be of any help it would greatly appreciated as this has been ongoing for about 1-2 weeks.   0 likes, 5 replies "

Instead my body becomes severely itchy and I get a full body tingling/pins & needles sensation. It is extremely painful and spreads through my body in a lightning type of pattern. It happens every time I get hot, nervous or physically exert myself. It evens happens if I laugh too much. It seems that in every situation where my body would normally sweat I don't anymore. I also notice when this happens my whole body becomes red and small bumps appear all over my arms and chest area. What I'm assuming is that this is some severe case of clogged sweat pores but all over my body instead of one specific place. Are there any doctors out there that know what this is and/or know of any medications that can open up sweat pores? Cold showers do not work. I am a 20 year old male. 0 likes, 21 replies "

Hello,  I have developed a skin condition on the back of both of my hands that I have been dealing with for a couple of months now. it started as my knuckles being dry and cracking, making it painful and bleeding. it then moved down to the backs of my fingers causing A LOT of tiny cuts. Since then it has slowly spread down the entire back of both hands, the back of my wrists and is now travelling down to my forearms. It has caused all of my knuckles to develope what I can only describe as calluses, except the texture is more dry and flakey, but but does not shed any skin and has turned them a darker brown/gray color. When I wash my hands it flares up, causing the tiny cuts to reappear and quite often bleed. the rash has gone down from my index finger to my thumb with a distinct line where it goes from lobster red to normal skin as if someone had drawn it on. Since the pandemic started I have been washing my hands more often however when I previously worked in corrections there was an outbreak of HEP A so I washed my hands there excessively and never had this issue.

Hello,  I have developed a skin condition on the back of both of my hands that I have been dealing with for a couple of months now. it started as my knuckles being dry and cracking, making it painful and bleeding. it then moved down to the backs of my fingers causing A LOT of tiny cuts. Since then it has slowly spread down the entire back of both hands, the back of my wrists and is now travelling down to my forearms. It has caused all of my knuckles to develope what I can only describe as calluses, except the texture is more dry and flakey, but but does not shed any skin and has turned them a darker brown/gray color. When I wash my hands it flares up, causing the tiny cuts to reappear and quite often bleed. the rash has gone down from my index finger to my thumb with a distinct line where it goes from lobster red to normal skin as if someone had drawn it on. Since the pandemic started I have been washing my hands more often however when I previously worked in corrections there was an outbreak of HEP A so I washed my hands there excessively and never had this issue.

I had so many side effects from the medication that I had it taken out after only a few months of using it. Although some side effects did go away after stopping it, today I still feel like I have this constant brain fog, extreme exhaustion, and my ears have been clogged for 3 months now. I can also flex something in my ear that can make this clicking/crackling sound that others can hear. It's really frustrating as the ear pressure and clicking make my head all congested. I don't have a runny nose, I know this is all from the birth control, I was hoping it would go away after stopping it but 3 months after and it's still here. I've become super depressed because I feel terrible physically. I wake up and all I can think of is ""here we go again"". I had to stop working as my job is a physically demanding job and requires me to be in high altitudes all the time (soooo perfect for my ears). I have no motivation, no energy, broke up with my boyfriend as I can't take care of anyone right now if I can't even take care of myself. All this is making me depressed and to be honest, suicidal. I don't know if this is my new normal and I can't accept that. I've been to my gp, Neuro, and an ENT...all say that I look perfectly fine. Blood work is normal, CT and MRI scan of my brain both came back normal. ENT says my eustachian tubes are fine, but when I asked him to listen to the clicking sound in my ear that I can control, he was baffled. Now I don't know what to do. I'm only in my 20s and I had my whole life ahead of me, now it's like someone just took everything from me...career, relationship, and my future. I know hormones can affect your ears. What is that sound in my ear if my ENT says my ears look fine?!?! I'm going crazy and I can't stand this any longer.  0 likes, 17 replies "

These episodes caused me to have two seizures which I went to my GP about but they didn't seem too concerned about it which surprised me. Since then I have had occasional episodes of blacking out vision and tingling when standing but never full blown seizures. The majority of the time this is never an issue. Last week I began having increasingly worse episodes, along with pretty bad exhaustion as well,  I started taking my blood pressure during and after these episodes. It remained between 109-131 systolic and 71-100 diastolic with an average HR of 80. The readings were normal while sitting and rose slightly higher a period of time after these episodes. I managed to take 3 readings during the episodes 66/48 and 52/37 average HR: 150, the blood pressure readings obviously shocked me. During the third reading I actually had another full blown seizure, fell to my knees, limbs shaking and lost consciousness for about 3 seconds, during this time the BP monitor kept going up to 220+ and very slowly went down, then about two minutes after the seizure it gave me a reading of 82/53. I am a registered paediatric nurse so I am aware of both orthostatic hypotension and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, I believe it more likely to be the former. My question is: is it worth going to the doctors about this? I know there isn't much to be done and the GP wasn't too concerned the last time. I'm just concerned because it's been approximately an hour since the seizure and I just feel exhausted with a strange tingling in my head and limbs, mostly arms and almost light headed along with a feeling of being ""out of it"" and a general sort of off feeling so to speak. However the episodes stopped happening the last time they occurred and I have been under a lot of stress this week, extremely sleep deprived (staying up for 36hrs on two occasions then only getting 2-4hrs sleep to compensate.) and haven't been eating or hydrating very well.

My best friend called 911 - thank god. After keeping me in the hospital for 2 weeks, the doctors discovered that i was drugged at the party, overdosed, and on top of that, I was an undiagnosed type 1 diabetic. There are many questions i have about that night that i probably wont get an answer to... However, I'm hoping someone can help answer this: Are seizures a common symptom of an overdose? what about screaming while your mouth is closed? my friend described mg seizure saying: ""your eyes were rolling back, you lost control over tour bladder, and you were screaming so so loudly but your mouth was closed. You couldn't open it"" I'm just trying to get some clarity and piece this situation together... Any help is greatly appreciated! 0 likes, 0 replies "

Here's what happened: A few nights ago I woke up around 2am, checked the time, had some water and checked on my 3 month old. I then lay back down and closed my eyes. Suddenly I felt the strangest thing, I can't explain it, but I went to call out my husband's name and couldn't. I couldn't speak or move, I had the loudest ringing in my ears and it felt like my whole body was shaking. I was aware and it was terrifying. It passed, it was probably not even 10 seconds. Since this has happened I have had nausea on and off, consistent on and off (mostly on) headaches...kind of like a constant pressure/ache. Panadol doesn't help much. I also have random feelings of having cold water poured over my brain. I've been extremely tired, all I want to do is sleep, feeling weak and slightly out of it...like everything is a mental strain. I barely feel like I'm functioning. I also haven't had much appetite. Things haven't been blurry but trying to read makes my head hurt. Anyway I have never had this before, I don't know what im dealing with, and yes I'm going to get a second opinion. It's been a very stressful time the last 5 months as my husband was diagnosed with a brain tumour and then I had my son 5 weeks early!

I was finally refered to have an Upper GI. Yesterday I had the upper EGD. Was brought into the preproom, had to put on a gown and nurse placed my IV. Then was moved to the room which looked almost like an OR room (without the big OR lights (Ive had C-sections). I had a mouth piece placed in my mouth so my tounge is tucked and allow for the scope entry.  The Doc read outloud my name, medical vitals, time whereafter the sedatives were given via IV.  (I was given percocet and versed and benadryl - this info was in my aftervisit). I started to feel the sedatives take affect where i was dosing in/out of it - I could still hear the music, I dont remember the insertion, but can hear faint noises in the background. I then remember gagging /dry-heaving and burping throughout the procedure where my eyes would open and see the screen - but was so out of it, it was almost like i was having an out of body expenrience.. It was so awful. I think since they didnt sedate me that much and was in a twilight that i remember this... Was given the images of my endoscopy. The report showed no a normal EGD, so no   was taken from the esophagus, however I was told that biopsies were taken from my stomach to rule out Hpiloi?? ( I find it so wierd that i already had this blood test and came out negative ) When i was experiencing that intense gagging during the procedure and while opening my eyes here and there while doing so, i do also remember seeing a dark cluster of something - which i cant say what that was but left me wondering... and the GI doc didnt mention anything (again, so wierd). Anyhow, was told the procedure went well which i find bothersome, since they did not mention anything about me gagging. The rest of the day, I was really out of it - groggy, mild amnesia (on the ride home, i was dosing in/out and woud have vivid dreams with each dose). When i got home (45 min drive), my back (3"" below my shoulder blades) was hurting so bad as if i strained my back really bad. It hurts so bad that would actually feel like it knocks the breath out of me - and when combined with some abdomial pain, it buckles me over. Today I feel the same, horible sore back (same spot) and it comes in intense waves of pain.. I called and was able to speak to the GI doc and all he said was that my procedure went well, look out for crackly sensation to the touch near chest/neck area, high fever or swelling.  I havnt any of these thank GOD, but this back ache is really scaring me .. He also suggested i have a   if it doesnt go away by Monday (which is scary and i dont want any unnecessary radiation) Lastly, he mentioned it may be skeletal/ muscular when they turned me to my side - but that doesnt make sense since I was placed on my side before the procedure and before i was even sedated. I had also asked him how i did during the procedure and told him that i remember some gaging and he was vauge in his reply and said its commom that gagging occurs during EGD's which again is bothersome to me- since i remember this so clearly.  If anyone out there has had this before or have felt muscular soreness please share your story - i need some reassurance this is simply related to fighting this procedure.

Over the last 3 - 4 weeks I have been having what I can only describe as 'head zaps' . They started suddenly whilst I was at the airport about to go on holiday and have been happening around 10 - 30 times a day since.  They feel like sudden jolts of electricity going through my head.. As well as this I have been feeling quite lethargic and having 'brain fog'. I went to the GP last week and he said it sounds like a pinched nerve in my neck. I told him I'm worried it's some kind of seizure and he laughed and reassured me it wasn't. However, the only websites online reporting this symptom are either to do with SSRI withdrawal (I have never taken anti depressants) or epilepsy. I am at a loss of what to do.. but they are really starting to affect my every day life. 0 likes, 5 replies "

(I'm 24 if that's relevant!) Something traumatic (to my mind) happened yesterday and a few hours later when I was (trying) to relax in my room, I suddenly felt like I was somewhere unfamiliar and like I was in a different time, it was such a strong weird feeling, my brain felt so weird and I didn't feel very aware anymore. My face started scruching up but I couldn't help it, it felt like a tick but it was trying to stick like that, then my eyes started to try and close by themselves, they felt very heavy. My arms started getting this feeling of strong tension/clenching that I had no control over and they began to go cold. Suddenly they were jerking and I cant really remember if there was more but I went catatonic afterwards. I'm not sure how long it lasted, minutes possibly. I remembered I actually had this before a few weeks or months ago (either after an argument with my husband or bad memory). Then maybe half an hour later I suddenly came out of this catatonic state I started getting the strongest overwhelming feeling of pure fear. I started hearing voices in my head that were louder than my thinking voice (or they felt like it at least) so I quickly texted my mum to see me. At first it felt like a weird panic attack but then my mum went to hug me which for some reason I find terrifying during a panic attack and my arm muscles suddenly kept slamming together uncontrollably and my whole body started shaking (that part was on and off) and my eyes felt extremely restless and I had to keep moving them over and over in the same patterns, I was breathing fast and felt so out of it I started to fully believe I was dreaming. I couldn't recognize my mums face or the mention of my husband's name, I started sort of seeing random things around the room (as if I was imagining/portraying them but they werent under my control and they kept happening rapidly) they seemed to mostly happen when there were sounds (my mum talking or cars going past). The unfamiliar feeling was overwhelming too. I think I may have had a small black out at some point but I'm not 100% sure. I felt like I had no brain because nothing was registering with me and I couldn't even think, everything was just happening and I was watching it all. I dont know how long this lasted, it might have been around an hour. When I came out of it, it took me a few minutes to be able to talk again (I couldn't at all during it kind of like my catatonic states) and I could barely put words together, I was talking like a toddler. It got better quickly though. My head hurt badly, I was sweating badly and very thirsty and panicky and my memory was muddled. It feels very different from my panic attacks and it's only ever happened these 3 times that I remember. I dont have any history of seizures. I'm diagnosed with PTSD x2,  , aspergers and OCD. Also (undiagnosed) with   and catatonic depression states since this past year. I'm not on any medications at all. I googled about seizures but the ones I can relate to seem to happen just by injury or only happen for a few seconds so I'm really confused. Could it have been a weird panic attack?

I'm just wondering if anyone has dealt with something similar. My son will be 8 this month. Starting at a very young age he began having febrile seizures, and did until he was 3. They stopped at that point until last October. He had a very bad one in October when he was home sick from school.  We called 911 and went to the hospital.  2 days later he was diagnosed with hand foot mouth disease. Which explains why he got so sick and spiked such a high temp. The doctor said it is not typical for a child his age to still have febrile seizures, and didn't think it would happen again. He did order an MRI and EEG as a precaution. Mainly because my son was born with transposition of the great arteries, and had open heart surgery at 7 days old. So he felt the cardiac team would request it. We have not yet gone for the tests, but should be soon. Earlier this evening my son had a temp of 37.7C. I gave him Tylenol and put him in a bath. As I was washing his hair he went limp and fell forward into the water. It seemed like he was starting to seize, but it stopped quickly. I will be calling his pediatrician in the morning. We didn't go to the hospital because he was fine within about 10 seconds, and back to himself after that. I have always found when he gets sick he very quickly spikes a   to 38C, and once he hits that point seizes. But if I can catch it before it spikes and cool him in a lukewarm bath, as well as alternate Tylenol and Advil I can prevent the seizure. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but it feels as though his body struggles with infection/viruses, and then he spikes, and seizes. Or could this be epilepsy, and fever/sickness triggers the seizure? Could it have anything to do with his heart? He has no issues. He has a mild leak I believe in his aortic valve, and mildly enlarged pulmonary artery. When he's much older he may need a valve replacement, but right now it's not a concern. But my brain keeps going to the fact that he always rapidly spikes to 104 when sick. It somehow feels important, but I'm far from a doctor.

For about 10 years I've been getting these random clusters of deja vu, followed by headaches and nausea. The individual headaches can last between 2 minutes to several hours depending on severity. Typically it happens a handful of times a day, for up to a week, once a month (usually as a precursor to my period).  I also get feelings of anxiety (and that feeling like your heart... drops? like you're on a rollercoaster(?)). I can't really focus, think, read, write, or speak (coherently) while it happens, and afterwards I have ""blurry"" memory. Rarely I get the deja vu feeling, without the headaches and nausea, but I start to get   anxious and fearful. I can't sit still so I'll walk around the house, or try to sleep. Because of reasons I do not wish to disclose, it's difficult for me to regularly see health care professionals. I don't know how to end this.... Thank you for reading.

My mum had her first seizure around 5 years ago, but due to a reaction to the medication, the doctor and neurologist decided she was relatively low risk and didn't have to continue to take anything. She remained seizure free up until a year ago. First she started to get migraines that were accompanied by stoke like symptoms (which went back to normal in a couple of days) but this was soon replaced by seizures. After the seizure she would have right sided weakness accompanied by speech and memory problems. Again, this would return to normal within a couple of days. After the last seizure she had, her doctor put her on a low dose of Lamotrigine 50mg. A couple of months later, she displayed the usual pre seizure symptoms but where as within a couple of days, she would bounce back, her mobility on the right side and her memory/speech was still slightly effected. Over the last year, she has had no more seizures but is now unable to walk, unable to use her right had and her memory and speech is severely effected. She knows what she wants to say but the words don't seem to come out. This is all beyond frustrating for her and as her daughter, it's breaking my heart to see her like this. She has had MRI scans on both her brain and spine which has shown nothing. After some research, I noticed that her symptoms     be a side effect of the Lamotrigine? The doctor and neurologist have no idea what could be causing her issues so have advised her to reduced the dose to 25mg and gradually taper off completely. She has now been taking 25mg for 3 weeks and her speech and memory is the worst it's been. My question is, could it be possible that the reduced dose is causing this in a 'gets worse before it gets better' type way? I might be clutching at straws but everything only seemed worse when she started the Lamotrigine and if so, the side effects of it has basically disabled her, not the seizures! ANY thoughts or encouragement welcomed! Thank you 😃 Lisa 0 likes, 6 replies "

To get to the point apparently I had 4/6 seizures followed by complete unconsciousness including a respiratory arrest . I had no reflexes , unable to breathe for myself , didn't respond to pain stimulus or have no memory of the incident . I had the first seizure about 2.45pm and didn't wake fully until 9.30pm . My query about this seizure is --- does anyone else have such alarming symptoms , and if so what can I do to prevent it happening again . I thought the seizures were bad but the respiratory arrest really frightens me , I am covered in bruises especially on my sternum and shoulder where the paramedics tried to rouse me .

She has only ever had one big seizure preceded by many absences over the previous 2 years. She takes 1500mg of Limotrigine per day. Since the diagnosis she has suffered what she can only describe as a ""bouncy brain"" she says it feels like a heart trace looks. During these episodes she is alert but we have noticed that her forehead heats up. The ""bouncier"" her brain the hotter her forehead gets. She also suffers some loss of balance while this is happening. We have spoken to her neurologist about this he just says you are epileptic get used to it. Would anybody have any ideas as to what the actual cause is or is it just a symptom of her epilepsy and something that she will have to get used to. Thanks in advance Brian 0 likes, 7 replies "

Instead of being anxious during the day and it lifting around 5, I've become anxious in the evening and sleeping isn't so easy.  The other thing I noticed a few of you have mentioned is that choking feeling and loose bm's, and I'm nauseous.... Maybe I'm getting the flu, I'm sure that would be easier to get over.  But I am now experiencing both of those.  I feel like I'm starting over.  In a few days it'll be 4 weeks on 20 mg, I think I see improvement, then something crops up.  And on top of it, I'm so sleepy-tired.  More so than just the waking up at night.   I'm ready to give up on this medicine and go back to name brand Effexor XR.    1 like, 373 replies "

My ENT tried many things including decongestants, steroids, nasal steroid sprays, saline spray and rinses, antibiotics, diuretics, allergy shots, hearing tests, and an MRI on my head and neck to rule out the big bad stuff.  He finally gave up and told me he was convinced I had TMJ. Had TMJ surgery that was both ""diagnostic and therapeutic"" at Emory in Atlanta, GA IN Aug 2018. TMJ specialist was honest and said he thought he might have proactively fixed some potential problems i might have had  further on in life with my jaw but didnt feel that i had TMJ which was causing my ear issues.  He was right, no change in any of the ETD symptoms so i move on to another ENT.  More ear examinations and hearing tests showing low frequency hearing loss that was normal for my age. He suggests that putting in tubes may help and schedules procedure. morning of procedure while in his chair he decides its probably not going to help and refers me on to an Otologist instead. Finally get in to see her in Dec 2018 and more hearing tests. However she immediately notes that my medical record showed a substantial weight loss right before my ETD issues started. She looks in my ear and says that she can see my eardrums moving with each breath therefore my Eustachian Tubes are open or Patulous. She tells me to order the PATULEND drops from a Dr in CA and that it may take a couple of months but these drops would close my tubes.  I have religiously done these nasal drops since Dec to no avail.  I called the otologist back this week to report no change and she tells me to call a Dr Poe in Boston because he is a specialist in Patulous Eustachian Tube. I am completely frustrated and at a loss as to what to do for two reasons. 1 - I live in Atlanta and 2 - I cant seem to convince myself that i actually have PET. I do not and have never had any of the hallmark symptoms such as hearing my own voice or hearbeat.  I do internally  hear my the crunching or cracking of my neck or jaw loudly but I dont believe this is autophony.  Bottomline is I'm looking for anyone else out there with my similar situation who has been told they have PET. And if so, does anyone know a good Dr in the southeastern  USA who can help me? I cant travel to Boston and I just cant keep living like this day to day. 0 likes, 15 replies "

Both my general practioner and ENT said no infection however the ENT suggested a left ear grommet due to the lack of clearing and the fact that it had happened earlier in the year under similar circumstances, although for only 3 weeks on and off. Well i had the grommet inserted under anaesthetic last week. Immediately upon waking from the procedure my ear still felt blocked as well as my right!! The ENT is not sure why and had no explanation but sent me for a hearing test. I told him that I can hear but just feel blocked with a muffled sensation in both ears. My hearing test came back normal as I knew it would however it has been 7 days and the blocked feeling persists in both ears. I feel worse now then before the procedure. Can anyone tell me if this blocked sensation will go away and how long I should expect it to last.

So basically I have had not one, but multiple symptoms. I'll describe them, and then hopefully someone who has a bit of experience with these matters will be able to hand me an educated guess. I've been advised against going on-line for health matters as I am prone to health anxiety, but I'll take my chance.  Summer vacation 2019 - I had an ear infection and I was prescribed antihistamines and ear drops - this ear infection was accompanied by tinnitus that kept on for weeks, and then all of a sudden it went away completely, even when I close my ears with my fingers, nada-nothing.  After it went away, I still occasionally (every four-five days) wake up in the morning and have tinnitus, and by the time I wash my teeth, shower and finish my morning routine, it fades away completely. Because it only happens in the morning after sleeping, I guess that laying down has a tendency to cause it, that's what I've been able to conclude.  I notice that when I travel in elevators, or even when I drive down a slightly downward street, I have popping in the ears when I swallow. I only had this happen in airplanes before, but now it seems to happen as I mentioned, even when driving a car on streets that have an altitude difference. I am planning to measure the exact speed and altitude change.  Whenever I let water run in the kitchen, the bathroom, or anywhere, there is a drum beat in my ears, like a little man with drum sticks beating on my eardrums. Bum bum bum bum bum. It happens if I stand near a water fountain, or anything like that, even if I take a plastic bag and play with it, I can still feel a little bit of that going on.  I had this one for a while, but now I don't have it anymore, but I feel it is worth mentioning. For a period of several weeks, I noticed that when I went out in the city with a lot of cars nearby, I would hear some of the car brakes really well, too well. I almost had to turn away when a car brakes. And I could hear the noise electronic devices make really well. That symptom, like I said, has disappeared by now.  The final symptom that I currently experience is that I hear a strange clicking sound when I move my ears around, let me try to explain. It's like the sound that you would hear if you had glue on two sticks, and you put the sticks together, and then took them apart slowly before the glue hardens, while still in a semi-hardened state. It's like a sticky type of sound, like something is sticky. I hope that you understand what I am talking about. Anything else... I think not. Oh, yes, I have always had problems with airplanes and landings. I recall having a 30-minute tinnitus episode after landing sometime in 2009, and also in 2013/14. This is way before the ear infection that I'm talking about. 0 likes, 2 replies "

218,C0271468,Eustachian tube disorder,C0028084,Nightmares,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-first-post-724617,My first post,"Hi. I've trawled the internet for forums on ETD and at last found one. I started to get symptoms in my right ear just before Christmas. So off I went to see the nurse, thinking it was earwax. She said both ears were clear.  So I left it over the holiday until the symptoms became more persistent. I went to see the GP on 2nd January. He suggested I had Eustachian  tube dysfunction and prescribed a steroid nasal spray and advised using steam. If I was no better in 3 weeks I'm to go back.  I've had all sorts of weird sensations. Ear fullness, pressure, ringing, and sensitivity to noise.  Washing up is a nightmare with everything clattering. I don't need to watch the weather forecast now, I just go by my ear which builds up this massive pressure. I have a long standing anxiety/depression diagnosis and it seems to thrive on this ETD. Oh another thing I was reading was that ETD can be triggered by rapid weight loss. Well I've dropped about 3.5st since October 2018 but still weigh about 19.5st. I've thought about stuffing my face again just to get rid of this but that's worse than having this ETD. Does anyone know any answers to this? Its really getting me down now. All the best to everyone here who are suffering. 0 likes, 6 replies "

She woke up with   which lasted about a month, but now has gone away.  Now it's 7 months later and she's complaining of ""clogged ears"". We did get a cat about a month ago, so maybe it's  .  She can unclog her ears any time she wants by doing one of two things: 1) Putting her head between her knees while sitting. It immediately unclogs her ears. Once she sits back up, it will stay unclogged until she swallows; at that point, her ears get re-clogged. 2) Pinching her nose and swallowing. This also unclogs her ears and they remain unclogged indefinitely until she swallows normally (without pinching the nose). Her ears then become clogged again.  Today I just picked up some Clariton for her. She took one pill about 5 hours ago, but so far no effects.  Anyone have similar symptoms or any idea what could be causing this? And of course if anyone has any solutions, that would be great. I'm considering buying a neti pot tonight.  0 likes, 8 replies "

Took tons of medicines - including few types of antibiotics, nasal drops (steroids and other), pain killers, anti-inflammation medicines etc.  Did a lot of exams - Head CT, Head MRI, tympanometry, audio test, ultrasound exam, X-Ray to my neck and spine, FOL (optical fiber) test and other tests that I can't remember.  All of the exams didn't have any conclusion to what was the issue, all the exams came out fine! - meaning, I'm stuck with it.  I must say,  I'm 30 years old, vegetarian, eat healthy, working out, working in non-physical job and pretty much having no other issues.  I'm reaching out for your assistance,  Anyone had experienced it also? Can you assist me with finding what is the root cause of it?  I feel like my life turned 180 degrees, from being a friendly guy and leaving happy life, I turned out to be grumpy, unhappy and most of all, exhausted of this situation.  Hopefully I'll find an answer here,  Thanks,  FM. 2 likes, 250 replies "

Kinda I've Always had heavy periods from starting at age 13. As I approached 18, I was having two periods a month, painful, heavy, sometimes clots, pain during sex, immense back pains and high body temp. Dr's told me I'm young, messy hormones, will settle, here is the mini Pill. Mini Pill made me bleed every day of being on it and made me depressed. I cannot have the combined pill due to migraines and DVT. Due to how heavy my period is, I can't have the copper coil, as I'm already borderline anemic when my periods are bad (when having 2 a month I was anemic) they also tried the pill that stops your period, mostly used for honeymoon and holiday sex, but it was tried to stop my double periods, and the back pain! Unexplainable! I had various blood tests taken, when I had a blood test during the time of having two periods, they said I was showing as potentially infertile? But not to worry, as this could be the ""false"" period. (I worried) I then tried the injection which I also bled for three weeks and spotted. Between all these Hormone treatments, it took about two years of constant back and forth with doctors. Usually I'm assumed to have an STI (brilliant) as their answer (I have never had one but they always test) then, when they're negative ""my hormones will settle, I must be stressed"" . Eventually they said the Hormone Coil is my answer, I obviously am willing to try anything. So it was inserted, that night I had pains, like bad period pains, I assumed it was normal as it had just been put in that morning. The following afternoon (a day before I was due to fly to India for work) the pain was unbearable, and my legs had flared in rashes rejecting the coil. Dr's told me to go straight to AnE. One nurse told me it was infected (I assumed this), but she was in the AnE room, I was then passed on further (charming right). However, I was then kept over night as they said they couldn't see the coil and assumed it was implanted in my womb or had taken itself for a wander. I then had the ultrasound camera the next day to check further. Some cysts were spotted. Confirmed I also had a tilted womb, and could struggle for a baby (not that I'm in any fit state to try). They told me the coil was fine, it was in place and thy could see it and it just had slight infection, but don't fear, that's normal due to being put in? (worrying). Due to still being in pain, I asked them to take it out while at the hospital, but no nurses were available (thankfully) and they sent me on my way saying I'm fine. Day after, I rushed into an emergency appt with my Dr's due to the pain, they said it can't be removed as it was infected and could cause PID if they removed it. Lucky for me the hospital had no nurses the day before, as they didn't diagnose the infection or provide antibiotics. Their actual diagnosis was ""constipation"". Even though, excuse the French, I'd had a s**t an hour before their scan. Utterly fobbed off. I had also just met somebody around this time, so as you can imagine, confidence in the boodwar or in the general vaj region, was not an option, especially due to the infection which took weeks to clear! I had to explain the situation, which isn't something you want to do with a fresh love interest. Sorry I'm abit broken down here. So three weeks of anti biotics later, feeling drained as I bled every single day since it was put in. My Dr's finally agreed to take it out. Buuuuuuuuut they couldn't find it, s**t themselves and sent me to AnE where after all the same scans again, it was basically fish hooked and ripped out of me! Painful and gross! And also followed with another 2 weeks of anti biotics. I lost alot of weight and became very fatigue and caught a shed load of colds from my immune system being killed by 6 weeks of antibiotics! The second round were 2 different types of strong antibiotics, followed with a blood blocker tablet and a cheeky painkiller. After that ordeal and being told it was my last option in Jan 2018 I came to the, I give up stance. I just wanted to recover and would take extra painkillers to endure a normal day of life where my period isn't causing me jip. Since, I have been suffering immense pain in my periods, pelvic pain before and during cycle, sometimes in the middle, which I'm assuming is ovulation pains? I'm talking pains that have your body burning up and wake you up in the night. Apparently (according to my partner) I become restless in my sleep, moany and fidget alot to then wake up in agony. If I take a mefanamic acid as soon as I wake up in pain, after an hour, the pains are not as intense. I have been back to the Dr's since, who prescribed mefanamic acids (highly recommended however I take every 4 hours not 6).I actually bought these myself from India a year before the Dr's decided to prescribe it me, naughty I know, but, I was in pain and a friend recommended them as they worked well for her. I'm also not sure if they cause more pain sometimes due to clotting the blood, which for me, is already the case? The next month, I passed out from the pre period pains on my landing, and decided, the give up attitude is not an option as this was controlling my life. I bleed through clothes, and can bleed through a tampon and pad easy. As you can imagine, with the pain and anxiety of bleeding through my clothes when I'm on, work and social events aren't appealing, nor is sex. Which may I add, can hurt. I basically want to curl in a ball and be alone with a hot water bottle and some strong ass painkillers So, I have been on a waiting list for a potential laproscamy (I can't spell it) for 4 months, but finally, an appointment in August. Now, I'm worried I'm going to be passed about, as every time I have gone back since with my issues, we start from the beginning and go round and round, make little progress, then back to beginning. I've now had back pain for 3 months (rest and painkillers were the answer) and I get pains in my lower abdomen frequently. But I ""shouldn't worry"" apparently. I don't know if I maybe have PID onset, or my endo is growing and applying pressure around my womb and organs, is that a thing? I've shared my story to see if anyone has advice or has had similar issues? Or if there is anything to say that makes a Dr listen! I feel like surely heavy periods, which are now almost regulated to every three weeks, obviously sometimes I get the cheeky week early one that likes to pop up, literal pain in my arse! Surely this irregularness and endo in general affects your mentality? I was never really a low person, but I feel (minus the PMS) I find myself down and drained and just feeling... Meh. My anxiety seems to have got worse, probably due to other life stresses ontop of me wondering if I'm infertile or have a womb covered in endo.I've seen it takes years to diagnose, and I'm currently in the 6th year of going back and forth now. I'm considering private if I get no further after my next appointment, is this advisable? Thanks for reading, I know it's a long one 0 likes, 6 replies "

Unexplainable! I had various blood tests taken, when I had a blood test during the time of having two periods, they said I was showing as potentially infertile? But not to worry, as this could be the ""false"" period. (I worried) I then tried the injection which I also bled for three weeks and spotted. Between all these Hormone treatments, it took about two years of constant back and forth with doctors. Usually I'm assumed to have an STI (brilliant) as their answer (I have never had one but they always test) then, when they're negative ""my hormones will settle, I must be stressed"" . Eventually they said the Hormone Coil is my answer, I obviously am willing to try anything. So it was inserted, that night I had pains, like bad period pains, I assumed it was normal as it had just been put in that morning. The following afternoon (a day before I was due to fly to India for work) the pain was unbearable, and my legs had flared in rashes rejecting the coil. Dr's told me to go straight to AnE. One nurse told me it was infected (I assumed this), but she was in the AnE room, I was then passed on further (charming right). However, I was then kept over night as they said they couldn't see the coil and assumed it was implanted in my womb or had taken itself for a wander. I then had the ultrasound camera the next day to check further. Some cysts were spotted. Confirmed I also had a tilted womb, and could struggle for a baby (not that I'm in any fit state to try). They told me the coil was fine, it was in place and thy could see it and it just had slight infection, but don't fear, that's normal due to being put in? (worrying). Due to still being in pain, I asked them to take it out while at the hospital, but no nurses were available (thankfully) and they sent me on my way saying I'm fine. Day after, I rushed into an emergency appt with my Dr's due to the pain, they said it can't be removed as it was infected and could cause PID if they removed it. Lucky for me the hospital had no nurses the day before, as they didn't diagnose the infection or provide antibiotics. Their actual diagnosis was ""constipation"". Even though, excuse the French, I'd had a s**t an hour before their scan. Utterly fobbed off. I had also just met somebody around this time, so as you can imagine, confidence in the boodwar or in the general vaj region, was not an option, especially due to the infection which took weeks to clear! I had to explain the situation, which isn't something you want to do with a fresh love interest. Sorry I'm abit broken down here. So three weeks of anti biotics later, feeling drained as I bled every single day since it was put in. My Dr's finally agreed to take it out. Buuuuuuuuut they couldn't find it, s**t themselves and sent me to AnE where after all the same scans again, it was basically fish hooked and ripped out of me! Painful and gross! And also followed with another 2 weeks of anti biotics. I lost alot of weight and became very fatigue and caught a shed load of colds from my immune system being killed by 6 weeks of antibiotics! The second round were 2 different types of strong antibiotics, followed with a blood blocker tablet and a cheeky painkiller. After that ordeal and being told it was my last option in Jan 2018 I came to the, I give up stance. I just wanted to recover and would take extra painkillers to endure a normal day of life where my period isn't causing me jip. Since, I have been suffering immense pain in my periods, pelvic pain before and during cycle, sometimes in the middle, which I'm assuming is ovulation pains? I'm talking pains that have your body burning up and wake you up in the night. Apparently (according to my partner) I become restless in my sleep, moany and fidget alot to then wake up in agony. If I take a mefanamic acid as soon as I wake up in pain, after an hour, the pains are not as intense. I have been back to the Dr's since, who prescribed mefanamic acids (highly recommended however I take every 4 hours not 6).I actually bought these myself from India a year before the Dr's decided to prescribe it me, naughty I know, but, I was in pain and a friend recommended them as they worked well for her. I'm also not sure if they cause more pain sometimes due to clotting the blood, which for me, is already the case? The next month, I passed out from the pre period pains on my landing, and decided, the give up attitude is not an option as this was controlling my life. I bleed through clothes, and can bleed through a tampon and pad easy. As you can imagine, with the pain and anxiety of bleeding through my clothes when I'm on, work and social events aren't appealing, nor is sex. Which may I add, can hurt. I basically want to curl in a ball and be alone with a hot water bottle and some strong ass painkillers So, I have been on a waiting list for a potential laproscamy (I can't spell it) for 4 months, but finally, an appointment in August. Now, I'm worried I'm going to be passed about, as every time I have gone back since with my issues, we start from the beginning and go round and round, make little progress, then back to beginning. I've now had back pain for 3 months (rest and painkillers were the answer) and I get pains in my lower abdomen frequently. But I ""shouldn't worry"" apparently. I don't know if I maybe have PID onset, or my endo is growing and applying pressure around my womb and organs, is that a thing? I've shared my story to see if anyone has advice or has had similar issues? Or if there is anything to say that makes a Dr listen! I feel like surely heavy periods, which are now almost regulated to every three weeks, obviously sometimes I get the cheeky week early one that likes to pop up, literal pain in my arse! Surely this irregularness and endo in general affects your mentality? I was never really a low person, but I feel (minus the PMS) I find myself down and drained and just feeling... Meh. My anxiety seems to have got worse, probably due to other life stresses ontop of me wondering if I'm infertile or have a womb covered in endo.I've seen it takes years to diagnose, and I'm currently in the 6th year of going back and forth now. I'm considering private if I get no further after my next appointment, is this advisable? Thanks for reading, I know it's a long one 0 likes, 6 replies "

Usually I'm assumed to have an STI (brilliant) as their answer (I have never had one but they always test) then, when they're negative ""my hormones will settle, I must be stressed"" . Eventually they said the Hormone Coil is my answer, I obviously am willing to try anything. So it was inserted, that night I had pains, like bad period pains, I assumed it was normal as it had just been put in that morning. The following afternoon (a day before I was due to fly to India for work) the pain was unbearable, and my legs had flared in rashes rejecting the coil. Dr's told me to go straight to AnE. One nurse told me it was infected (I assumed this), but she was in the AnE room, I was then passed on further (charming right). However, I was then kept over night as they said they couldn't see the coil and assumed it was implanted in my womb or had taken itself for a wander. I then had the ultrasound camera the next day to check further. Some cysts were spotted. Confirmed I also had a tilted womb, and could struggle for a baby (not that I'm in any fit state to try). They told me the coil was fine, it was in place and thy could see it and it just had slight infection, but don't fear, that's normal due to being put in? (worrying). Due to still being in pain, I asked them to take it out while at the hospital, but no nurses were available (thankfully) and they sent me on my way saying I'm fine. Day after, I rushed into an emergency appt with my Dr's due to the pain, they said it can't be removed as it was infected and could cause PID if they removed it. Lucky for me the hospital had no nurses the day before, as they didn't diagnose the infection or provide antibiotics. Their actual diagnosis was ""constipation"". Even though, excuse the French, I'd had a s**t an hour before their scan. Utterly fobbed off. I had also just met somebody around this time, so as you can imagine, confidence in the boodwar or in the general vaj region, was not an option, especially due to the infection which took weeks to clear! I had to explain the situation, which isn't something you want to do with a fresh love interest. Sorry I'm abit broken down here. So three weeks of anti biotics later, feeling drained as I bled every single day since it was put in. My Dr's finally agreed to take it out. Buuuuuuuuut they couldn't find it, s**t themselves and sent me to AnE where after all the same scans again, it was basically fish hooked and ripped out of me! Painful and gross! And also followed with another 2 weeks of anti biotics. I lost alot of weight and became very fatigue and caught a shed load of colds from my immune system being killed by 6 weeks of antibiotics! The second round were 2 different types of strong antibiotics, followed with a blood blocker tablet and a cheeky painkiller. After that ordeal and being told it was my last option in Jan 2018 I came to the, I give up stance. I just wanted to recover and would take extra painkillers to endure a normal day of life where my period isn't causing me jip. Since, I have been suffering immense pain in my periods, pelvic pain before and during cycle, sometimes in the middle, which I'm assuming is ovulation pains? I'm talking pains that have your body burning up and wake you up in the night. Apparently (according to my partner) I become restless in my sleep, moany and fidget alot to then wake up in agony. If I take a mefanamic acid as soon as I wake up in pain, after an hour, the pains are not as intense. I have been back to the Dr's since, who prescribed mefanamic acids (highly recommended however I take every 4 hours not 6).I actually bought these myself from India a year before the Dr's decided to prescribe it me, naughty I know, but, I was in pain and a friend recommended them as they worked well for her. I'm also not sure if they cause more pain sometimes due to clotting the blood, which for me, is already the case? The next month, I passed out from the pre period pains on my landing, and decided, the give up attitude is not an option as this was controlling my life. I bleed through clothes, and can bleed through a tampon and pad easy. As you can imagine, with the pain and anxiety of bleeding through my clothes when I'm on, work and social events aren't appealing, nor is sex. Which may I add, can hurt. I basically want to curl in a ball and be alone with a hot water bottle and some strong ass painkillers So, I have been on a waiting list for a potential laproscamy (I can't spell it) for 4 months, but finally, an appointment in August. Now, I'm worried I'm going to be passed about, as every time I have gone back since with my issues, we start from the beginning and go round and round, make little progress, then back to beginning. I've now had back pain for 3 months (rest and painkillers were the answer) and I get pains in my lower abdomen frequently. But I ""shouldn't worry"" apparently. I don't know if I maybe have PID onset, or my endo is growing and applying pressure around my womb and organs, is that a thing? I've shared my story to see if anyone has advice or has had similar issues? Or if there is anything to say that makes a Dr listen! I feel like surely heavy periods, which are now almost regulated to every three weeks, obviously sometimes I get the cheeky week early one that likes to pop up, literal pain in my arse! Surely this irregularness and endo in general affects your mentality? I was never really a low person, but I feel (minus the PMS) I find myself down and drained and just feeling... Meh. My anxiety seems to have got worse, probably due to other life stresses ontop of me wondering if I'm infertile or have a womb covered in endo.I've seen it takes years to diagnose, and I'm currently in the 6th year of going back and forth now. I'm considering private if I get no further after my next appointment, is this advisable? Thanks for reading, I know it's a long one 0 likes, 6 replies "

The following afternoon (a day before I was due to fly to India for work) the pain was unbearable, and my legs had flared in rashes rejecting the coil. Dr's told me to go straight to AnE. One nurse told me it was infected (I assumed this), but she was in the AnE room, I was then passed on further (charming right). However, I was then kept over night as they said they couldn't see the coil and assumed it was implanted in my womb or had taken itself for a wander. I then had the ultrasound camera the next day to check further. Some cysts were spotted. Confirmed I also had a tilted womb, and could struggle for a baby (not that I'm in any fit state to try). They told me the coil was fine, it was in place and thy could see it and it just had slight infection, but don't fear, that's normal due to being put in? (worrying). Due to still being in pain, I asked them to take it out while at the hospital, but no nurses were available (thankfully) and they sent me on my way saying I'm fine. Day after, I rushed into an emergency appt with my Dr's due to the pain, they said it can't be removed as it was infected and could cause PID if they removed it. Lucky for me the hospital had no nurses the day before, as they didn't diagnose the infection or provide antibiotics. Their actual diagnosis was ""constipation"". Even though, excuse the French, I'd had a s**t an hour before their scan. Utterly fobbed off. I had also just met somebody around this time, so as you can imagine, confidence in the boodwar or in the general vaj region, was not an option, especially due to the infection which took weeks to clear! I had to explain the situation, which isn't something you want to do with a fresh love interest. Sorry I'm abit broken down here. So three weeks of anti biotics later, feeling drained as I bled every single day since it was put in. My Dr's finally agreed to take it out. Buuuuuuuuut they couldn't find it, s**t themselves and sent me to AnE where after all the same scans again, it was basically fish hooked and ripped out of me! Painful and gross! And also followed with another 2 weeks of anti biotics. I lost alot of weight and became very fatigue and caught a shed load of colds from my immune system being killed by 6 weeks of antibiotics! The second round were 2 different types of strong antibiotics, followed with a blood blocker tablet and a cheeky painkiller. After that ordeal and being told it was my last option in Jan 2018 I came to the, I give up stance. I just wanted to recover and would take extra painkillers to endure a normal day of life where my period isn't causing me jip. Since, I have been suffering immense pain in my periods, pelvic pain before and during cycle, sometimes in the middle, which I'm assuming is ovulation pains? I'm talking pains that have your body burning up and wake you up in the night. Apparently (according to my partner) I become restless in my sleep, moany and fidget alot to then wake up in agony. If I take a mefanamic acid as soon as I wake up in pain, after an hour, the pains are not as intense. I have been back to the Dr's since, who prescribed mefanamic acids (highly recommended however I take every 4 hours not 6).I actually bought these myself from India a year before the Dr's decided to prescribe it me, naughty I know, but, I was in pain and a friend recommended them as they worked well for her. I'm also not sure if they cause more pain sometimes due to clotting the blood, which for me, is already the case? The next month, I passed out from the pre period pains on my landing, and decided, the give up attitude is not an option as this was controlling my life. I bleed through clothes, and can bleed through a tampon and pad easy. As you can imagine, with the pain and anxiety of bleeding through my clothes when I'm on, work and social events aren't appealing, nor is sex. Which may I add, can hurt. I basically want to curl in a ball and be alone with a hot water bottle and some strong ass painkillers So, I have been on a waiting list for a potential laproscamy (I can't spell it) for 4 months, but finally, an appointment in August. Now, I'm worried I'm going to be passed about, as every time I have gone back since with my issues, we start from the beginning and go round and round, make little progress, then back to beginning. I've now had back pain for 3 months (rest and painkillers were the answer) and I get pains in my lower abdomen frequently. But I ""shouldn't worry"" apparently. I don't know if I maybe have PID onset, or my endo is growing and applying pressure around my womb and organs, is that a thing? I've shared my story to see if anyone has advice or has had similar issues? Or if there is anything to say that makes a Dr listen! I feel like surely heavy periods, which are now almost regulated to every three weeks, obviously sometimes I get the cheeky week early one that likes to pop up, literal pain in my arse! Surely this irregularness and endo in general affects your mentality? I was never really a low person, but I feel (minus the PMS) I find myself down and drained and just feeling... Meh. My anxiety seems to have got worse, probably due to other life stresses ontop of me wondering if I'm infertile or have a womb covered in endo.I've seen it takes years to diagnose, and I'm currently in the 6th year of going back and forth now.

Kinda I've Always had heavy periods from starting at age 13. As I approached 18, I was having two periods a month, painful, heavy, sometimes clots, pain during sex, immense back pains and high body temp. Dr's told me I'm young, messy hormones, will settle, here is the mini Pill. Mini Pill made me bleed every day of being on it and made me depressed. I cannot have the combined pill due to migraines and DVT. Due to how heavy my period is, I can't have the copper coil, as I'm already borderline anemic when my periods are bad (when having 2 a month I was anemic) they also tried the pill that stops your period, mostly used for honeymoon and holiday sex, but it was tried to stop my double periods, and the back pain! Unexplainable! I had various blood tests taken, when I had a blood test during the time of having two periods, they said I was showing as potentially infertile? But not to worry, as this could be the ""false"" period. (I worried) I then tried the injection which I also bled for three weeks and spotted. Between all these Hormone treatments, it took about two years of constant back and forth with doctors. Usually I'm assumed to have an STI (brilliant) as their answer (I have never had one but they always test) then, when they're negative ""my hormones will settle, I must be stressed"" . Eventually they said the Hormone Coil is my answer, I obviously am willing to try anything.

I'm a 23yd female, i began my period from 13-14, but from the age of 16 I have suffered excruciating period pains. my first ever experience I remember being struck randomly in the bathroom, stuck in the fetal position sobbing and clutching my abdomen in pain, to a point I thought if I stood I would for sure pass out. My nan was so fearful she rang an ambulance, by the time the ambulance arrived my pain had passed and once at the hospital I was subjected to a few blood tests, but told I probably just experienced period pain and was sent on my way. From then on I have lived with on and off period pains, sometimes so extreme it rips me from my sleep and all I can do is squirm and cry as the pain overcomes me, sometimes for a couple of minutes, sometimes it will last an hour. the pain is so intense it causes my thighs, back and bum to throb. A little bit of back detail, I have always had heavy, 'uncomfortable' periods. I have bled through tampons and pads in a few hours and had mistakes many times in the past. I have also experienced blood clots, one once being the size of a 2p (that didn't feel pleasant). I have a family history of Endometriosis, my mother and nan had been diagnosed, so when I opened to my mother about these issues I had at 16 she took my to my GP who also shunned it down as just intense period pain, I have been on pain relief in the past but as the pain comes on quite suddenly and can only last a set amount of time, taking pain relief only takes effect if the period pains last longer than the initial bouts of intense pain, and at that point the pains I experience are painful yes but bearable. For many years I have dealt with the pain through contraception but as I have gotten older I have found it to become more intense and more frequent. I have been put on contraception since I was 16 to try and minimise my periods and the pain. Though my old contraception which I have been on the last two years, the pill 'cerelle'  up until recently made me excessively bleed almost every two weeks and the pain is still there and coming back more often. When returning to my GP a few weeks ago after getting the all clear from a trans vaginal ultrasound they put me on a two type hormone pill, this pill unfortunately has many side effects and makes me feel sick almost every day, even though they told me it was 'treatment for endometriosis' I know this forum doesn't really have much direction as this is the first time I am trying to voice all my 7 years of suffering into a small forum, I just want to know if anyone else has any related pains who aren't sure if it is endometriosis or if they have been downcast by doctors telling them it is simply period pain? I experience alot of issues 'down there' including reaccurant water infections, water infection symptoms when there is no infection present, reaccurant thrush.. that I wonder if they have any relevance to my constant issues that I have down there. I'm very lost in my mind currently, I have began to doubt myself and what is real and isn't and as a result I have spiraled into a severe depression over everything. If anyone can offer me any insight or their experiences that I could possibly relate to I would be grateful. thanks. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I have a family history of Endometriosis, my mother and nan had been diagnosed, so when I opened to my mother about these issues I had at 16 she took my to my GP who also shunned it down as just intense period pain, I have been on pain relief in the past but as the pain comes on quite suddenly and can only last a set amount of time, taking pain relief only takes effect if the period pains last longer than the initial bouts of intense pain, and at that point the pains I experience are painful yes but bearable. For many years I have dealt with the pain through contraception but as I have gotten older I have found it to become more intense and more frequent. I have been put on contraception since I was 16 to try and minimise my periods and the pain. Though my old contraception which I have been on the last two years, the pill 'cerelle'  up until recently made me excessively bleed almost every two weeks and the pain is still there and coming back more often. When returning to my GP a few weeks ago after getting the all clear from a trans vaginal ultrasound they put me on a two type hormone pill, this pill unfortunately has many side effects and makes me feel sick almost every day, even though they told me it was 'treatment for endometriosis' I know this forum doesn't really have much direction as this is the first time I am trying to voice all my 7 years of suffering into a small forum, I just want to know if anyone else has any related pains who aren't sure if it is endometriosis or if they have been downcast by doctors telling them it is simply period pain? I experience alot of issues 'down there' including reaccurant water infections, water infection symptoms when there is no infection present, reaccurant thrush.. that I wonder if they have any relevance to my constant issues that I have down there. I'm very lost in my mind currently, I have began to doubt myself and what is real and isn't and as a result I have spiraled into a severe depression over everything. If anyone can offer me any insight or their experiences that I could possibly relate to I would be grateful. thanks. 0 likes, 2 replies "

Since this is my first post, it may be a bit long as I try to give some info, so please forgive me and bear with me. I am a 40-year-old male, and my S.O. is 39, and we have been in a long distance relationship for about 4 years now. She has Stage 4 Endometriosis, and has had a number of surgeries over the years to remove cysts, and ended up accidentally having one of her ovaries removed about 2 years ago during one of the surgeries because the surgeon didn’t even know that was her ovary and couldn’t identify it because of all the endometrial mass wrapped up around it, and only found out that it was her ovary afterwards when they did a biopsy. Her doctor had her on medication to stop her periods to help with the endometriosis, which effectively put her into medically induced menopause, which unfortunately comes along with all the side effects of menopause (i.e. mood swings, hormonal acne, hot flashes, sweats, trouble sleeping, etc.) Even with those meds, recently she got her period the last few months, and it was very heavy, and lasted a few weeks, and at times she’s getting spotting. Even with the meds, she still suffered from a lot of pelvic and back pain, and her latest exam showed a lot of endometrial growth also attaching to other organs. During her physical back in April, they found 2 cysts in her ovary from her ultrasound that she did for her yearly physical, and in her pelvic area that showed up from an MRI. The specialist also told her that her pelvis is frozen, and when she did a hysterosalpingogram her fallopian tube is blocked and the dye didn’t go through. Her specialist strongly recommended she has a hysterectomy, and I know this is very difficult for her. The specialist said he does not want to remove her remaining ovary because she’s still young, the only way he’ll do that is if when he goes in there and it’s really damaged, or he finds endometrioma or cancer cells, only then he’ll do that; so he’ll only remove her uterus; and that will just help, but she’ll also have to be on birth control pills. She's scheduled to go in for the hysterectomy tomorrow, but the specialist told her with the amount of endometrial growth inside her, the surgery is very difficult and is a very complicated compared to a surgery someone with cancer would have, and she has to be prepared for the risk involved. So with all of this that she’s going through, and not being able to really be there for her in-person the way that I want to due to the LDR situation, I know she is feeling very scared, angry, frustrated, overwhelmed, nervous, anxious, stressed, worried, and a whole host of other emotions, and I want to know how best I can be understanding and supporting for her? I feel all of this for her also, and it's all I've had on on my mind, but obviously it's so much more intense for her. I so badly wish I could be there for her in-person to comfort her, support, her, and take care of her... but unfortunately due to the nature of our LDR and our situation currently at the moment, I can't right now. 😦 There's nowhere else in the world I'd rather be, than by her side. I have a few questions to try to better understand things better so I can better support my Partner, and would appreciate advice from you ladies who are afflicted with endometriosis, or have been in the past, as well as Partners of those who are suffering with Endo. For the last few years, her mood can go from being okay, to getting very irritated and upset for small things. She has gotten very irritated and moody and feels very down and overwhelmed and just wants to be left alone, and that will last for days, even weeks at times. Are mood swings common with endometriosis? Does it really affect your mood so drastically like that? I’m sure also adding to it is also the fact that since she started taking the meds a few years ago, she hasn’t been able to get a good nights sleep for the longest time due to the hot flashes and sweats waking her up throughout the night, and lack of sleep and exhaustion would really affect anyone. Plus, also the additional hormonal changes in her body due to the medically induced menopause has really got to be affecting her even more. For you ladies who have had hysterectomies, how has it helped with your endometriosis afterwards? Have you found a lot of relief? Did it stop the Endo and the pain, and all the other issues? For those of you who suffered with severe mood swings and depression due to the hormones from your endometriosis, how have you felt after the hysterectomy? Have you found that you no longer are feeling that depression and/or severe mood swings, or have you noticed no change or relief with that? I understand how intrinsically linked a woman’s ability to have children is to her sense of femininity and womanhood. How have you ladies felt emotionally, psychologically, and physically after your hysterectomy? How has it affected you? What was the recovery afterwards like? What is the usual recovery time after a having hysterectomy, and what would help her through her recovery process? How long did it take for each of you, and what was the most challenging, and difficult part? What can I do to help her emotionally throughout all of this? She and I do want to have biological children of our own together with each other in a few years when we are able to be together in-person, so if her ovary is not removed during the hysterectomy and her ovary and eggs are still healthy and fertile, would it still be possible for her and I to have our own biological children via IVF surrogacy? If so, what’s the usual cost for that? I want to be as supportive and understanding to my love as much as I possibly can. She is absolutely the love of my life, and I want to do anything and everything I can to be supporting, and understanding, and be there for her however I am able to be.

I am a 40-year-old male, and my S.O. is 39, and we have been in a long distance relationship for about 4 years now. She has Stage 4 Endometriosis, and has had a number of surgeries over the years to remove cysts, and ended up accidentally having one of her ovaries removed about 2 years ago during one of the surgeries because the surgeon didn’t even know that was her ovary and couldn’t identify it because of all the endometrial mass wrapped up around it, and only found out that it was her ovary afterwards when they did a biopsy. Her doctor had her on medication to stop her periods to help with the endometriosis, which effectively put her into medically induced menopause, which unfortunately comes along with all the side effects of menopause (i.e. mood swings, hormonal acne, hot flashes, sweats, trouble sleeping, etc.) Even with those meds, recently she got her period the last few months, and it was very heavy, and lasted a few weeks, and at times she’s getting spotting. Even with the meds, she still suffered from a lot of pelvic and back pain, and her latest exam showed a lot of endometrial growth also attaching to other organs. During her physical back in April, they found 2 cysts in her ovary from her ultrasound that she did for her yearly physical, and in her pelvic area that showed up from an MRI. The specialist also told her that her pelvis is frozen, and when she did a hysterosalpingogram her fallopian tube is blocked and the dye didn’t go through. Her specialist strongly recommended she has a hysterectomy, and I know this is very difficult for her. The specialist said he does not want to remove her remaining ovary because she’s still young, the only way he’ll do that is if when he goes in there and it’s really damaged, or he finds endometrioma or cancer cells, only then he’ll do that; so he’ll only remove her uterus; and that will just help, but she’ll also have to be on birth control pills. She's scheduled to go in for the hysterectomy tomorrow, but the specialist told her with the amount of endometrial growth inside her, the surgery is very difficult and is a very complicated compared to a surgery someone with cancer would have, and she has to be prepared for the risk involved. So with all of this that she’s going through, and not being able to really be there for her in-person the way that I want to due to the LDR situation, I know she is feeling very scared, angry, frustrated, overwhelmed, nervous, anxious, stressed, worried, and a whole host of other emotions, and I want to know how best I can be understanding and supporting for her? I feel all of this for her also, and it's all I've had on on my mind, but obviously it's so much more intense for her. I so badly wish I could be there for her in-person to comfort her, support, her, and take care of her... but unfortunately due to the nature of our LDR and our situation currently at the moment, I can't right now. 😦 There's nowhere else in the world I'd rather be, than by her side. I have a few questions to try to better understand things better so I can better support my Partner, and would appreciate advice from you ladies who are afflicted with endometriosis, or have been in the past, as well as Partners of those who are suffering with Endo. For the last few years, her mood can go from being okay, to getting very irritated and upset for small things. She has gotten very irritated and moody and feels very down and overwhelmed and just wants to be left alone, and that will last for days, even weeks at times. Are mood swings common with endometriosis? Does it really affect your mood so drastically like that? I’m sure also adding to it is also the fact that since she started taking the meds a few years ago, she hasn’t been able to get a good nights sleep for the longest time due to the hot flashes and sweats waking her up throughout the night, and lack of sleep and exhaustion would really affect anyone. Plus, also the additional hormonal changes in her body due to the medically induced menopause has really got to be affecting her even more. For you ladies who have had hysterectomies, how has it helped with your endometriosis afterwards? Have you found a lot of relief? Did it stop the Endo and the pain, and all the other issues? For those of you who suffered with severe mood swings and depression due to the hormones from your endometriosis, how have you felt after the hysterectomy? Have you found that you no longer are feeling that depression and/or severe mood swings, or have you noticed no change or relief with that? I understand how intrinsically linked a woman’s ability to have children is to her sense of femininity and womanhood. How have you ladies felt emotionally, psychologically, and physically after your hysterectomy? How has it affected you? What was the recovery afterwards like? What is the usual recovery time after a having hysterectomy, and what would help her through her recovery process? How long did it take for each of you, and what was the most challenging, and difficult part? What can I do to help her emotionally throughout all of this? She and I do want to have biological children of our own together with each other in a few years when we are able to be together in-person, so if her ovary is not removed during the hysterectomy and her ovary and eggs are still healthy and fertile, would it still be possible for her and I to have our own biological children via IVF surrogacy? If so, what’s the usual cost for that? I want to be as supportive and understanding to my love as much as I possibly can. She is absolutely the love of my life, and I want to do anything and everything I can to be supporting, and understanding, and be there for her however I am able to be.

I'll try and update this every couple of days, but feel free to ask any questions you might have in the meantime. I've really benefitted from reading people's first hand accounts in the lead up to this op so this is my opportunity to try and give something back to this niche stapedectomy community ;-). Since Dec 2016 I started to notice that I was losing hearing in my right ear. At first it was only minor (20% loss) but by early 2018 I was classified as severly deaf in that ear at around 85-90% loss. The severe hearing loss had a big impact on my social life, my ability to carry out simple tasks (i.e. riding my bike) as well as my work (meetings became a struggle). All of this coincided with a 10 year relationship break up in 2017, which when combined with my hearing problems, made me the social equiavalent of Gollum from Lord of the Rings. Something had to be done... Getting the diagnosis for Otosclerosis in my right ear took a bit of time. Initially I thought it was wax build up and went to see a Dr in Romania while visiting my then girlfriends parents. They couldn't find any wax and recommended an MRI to check it wasn't anything sinister. Returning to the UK I got an appointment with the ENT department who undertook a series of checks and concluded I had Eustachian Tube Dysfunction. Cue several months of steam baths, decongestants, anti-hystamines none of which were effective in improving my hearing. I also had a CT scan which confirmed that there were no tumours present (these tumours are often harmless even if found). Returning to ENT after 6 months ready to demand grommets for my ears I was put through a hearing test again. This confirmed I was now severly deaf in my right ear, but also that my Eustachian Tubes were functioning normally. Hmmm? What had happened? It turns out that the machine that they would have used to check the pressure in my middle ear canal wasn't working during my original appointment and therefore they were unable to discount ETD. Annoying. My crude understanding of how they diagnosed my Otosclerosis is as follows. Ear drum was working fine, my auditory nerve was picking up sound fine (checked through bone conductivity tests if I remember correct) and my middle ear pressure was also good. By process of elimination they were pretty sure it was my a mechanical problem with my 3 ear bones, in particular the stapes. At the time I was given the option of hearing aids (hmm); a Bone anchored hearing aid (i.e. a hearing aid implanted into your skull) or a Stapedectomy. My personal reasons for going for the op were 1. my hearing was so bad in the affected ear that I felt the risk of losing my hearing totally through the op would not have resulted in a much worse situation to the one I was already in. 2. The success rate was for the op appeared to be good and could be undertaken as a day case 3. The op offered the potential to hear completely normally again. The other two options would have provided more artificial hearing benefits. 4. Probably an element of vanity about not wanting to wear hearing aids of have an implant  So I was quite nervous about the prospect of a general anaesthetic (GA). I woke up on the day of my surgery Tues 8th and had to skip my coffee and breakfast as per the rules. The order of play went a bit like this.... 1. Seen by nurse who checked vitals 2. Seen by anaesthesist 3. Seen by surgeon 4. Dress in funny clothes and excellent socks 5. Go into the operating theatre, have a small freak out about how many people are there just for you, get a mask over your face and then passing out. In all seriousness I am a fairly anxious person, but the NHS staff were amazing and knowing what was coming each step of the way really helped quash any mystery about the process. Essentially GA is extremely safe unless you are a 120 year old man being rushed into A&E with half an arm and a penchant for long mid-morning snoozes. The surgery took 2 hours for me, although 45-60mins is more common (i have a small ear canal apparently!). and you'll generally be put under for about 4 hours in total. Waking up you will have a nurse checking your vitals and handing you some water to sip. Everyone has a different post GA experience (inc. hysterical laughing, crying and memory loss) but for me I was just  moderately dizzy and very lethargic. I got wheeled into a recovery room for about an hour an ate everything they had on offer. The first trip to the toilet was difficult as was putting on my clothes due to being so off balance. I was given some paracetemol and Ibuprofen for the pain (at this point there was none) as well as some cotton balls to replace periodically over the next few days. I was told my follow-up appointment would be in 2 weeks where the packing in my ear would be removed. At this point many people talk about being able to hear straight away. I can't say this was my experience, but I largely think this is due to the packing which is fairly tight in your ear. However, I did notice that scratching my ear lobe lightly produced a much louder sound than prior to the surgery which helped to give me some piece of mind that something has worked. Dizzy and tired. Dizzyness comes more from leaning head forward, leaning head backwards or going up and down stairs. This is a very common side effect of the surgery so I'm not worried at this point. I have to move in a more considered way but I don't think I'm at risk of falling over from this feeling of being off balance. There is some pain in the affected ear but it's not too bad. Had a big meal, watched some TV and then feel asleep on my back. Just as dizzy as yesterday, cotton swab has a small amount of blood on it, ear pain definitely worse and can hear my heart beat/blood rushing sensation in my ear. None of this is unbearable and I still manage to talk to my sister on Facebook and listen to Adam Buxton's podcast. It's fairly embarrassing but one piece of advice I would give is get some 'stool softners' and or laxatives. A side effect of GA and pain medicine is constipation. Combine straining with a traumatised ear op and you have a fairly tricky pain balancing act while hovering over the toilet. Heed my words! Bad night of sleeping waking up in pain. Think I'm trying to do to much to soon. No change in hearing, but I'm really not expecting anything until the packing is out. Felling generally a bit deflated after the GA and not being able to do anything active...I am not an indoors person. Had a dizzy walked to the shops looking like a drunkard. slightly better sleep. Still some pain but I've only taken one ibuprofen today so it could definitely be worse. Still some minor bleeding on cotton swab. Ear continuing to make weird farting and squelching noises. I'm pretty relaxed that my ear is in recovery mode so I'm not expecting any miracles at this point. You'll read on other forums that some other people are already back to work at this point. This still feels some way off for me, but from what I've read about this procedure I can say for sure that everyone has very different recovery experience and associated timescales. Life can't be too bad as I've managed to write this post. Will update more over the coming days...   1 like, 149 replies "

I'll try and update this every couple of days, but feel free to ask any questions you might have in the meantime. I've really benefitted from reading people's first hand accounts in the lead up to this op so this is my opportunity to try and give something back to this niche stapedectomy community ;-). Since Dec 2016 I started to notice that I was losing hearing in my right ear. At first it was only minor (20% loss) but by early 2018 I was classified as severly deaf in that ear at around 85-90% loss. The severe hearing loss had a big impact on my social life, my ability to carry out simple tasks (i.e. riding my bike) as well as my work (meetings became a struggle). All of this coincided with a 10 year relationship break up in 2017, which when combined with my hearing problems, made me the social equiavalent of Gollum from Lord of the Rings. Something had to be done... Getting the diagnosis for Otosclerosis in my right ear took a bit of time. Initially I thought it was wax build up and went to see a Dr in Romania while visiting my then girlfriends parents. They couldn't find any wax and recommended an MRI to check it wasn't anything sinister. Returning to the UK I got an appointment with the ENT department who undertook a series of checks and concluded I had Eustachian Tube Dysfunction. Cue several months of steam baths, decongestants, anti-hystamines none of which were effective in improving my hearing. I also had a CT scan which confirmed that there were no tumours present (these tumours are often harmless even if found). Returning to ENT after 6 months ready to demand grommets for my ears I was put through a hearing test again. This confirmed I was now severly deaf in my right ear, but also that my Eustachian Tubes were functioning normally. Hmmm? What had happened? It turns out that the machine that they would have used to check the pressure in my middle ear canal wasn't working during my original appointment and therefore they were unable to discount ETD. Annoying. My crude understanding of how they diagnosed my Otosclerosis is as follows. Ear drum was working fine, my auditory nerve was picking up sound fine (checked through bone conductivity tests if I remember correct) and my middle ear pressure was also good. By process of elimination they were pretty sure it was my a mechanical problem with my 3 ear bones, in particular the stapes. At the time I was given the option of hearing aids (hmm); a Bone anchored hearing aid (i.e. a hearing aid implanted into your skull) or a Stapedectomy. My personal reasons for going for the op were 1. my hearing was so bad in the affected ear that I felt the risk of losing my hearing totally through the op would not have resulted in a much worse situation to the one I was already in. 2. The success rate was for the op appeared to be good and could be undertaken as a day case 3. The op offered the potential to hear completely normally again. The other two options would have provided more artificial hearing benefits. 4. Probably an element of vanity about not wanting to wear hearing aids of have an implant  So I was quite nervous about the prospect of a general anaesthetic (GA).

However, I did notice that scratching my ear lobe lightly produced a much louder sound than prior to the surgery which helped to give me some piece of mind that something has worked. Dizzy and tired. Dizzyness comes more from leaning head forward, leaning head backwards or going up and down stairs. This is a very common side effect of the surgery so I'm not worried at this point. I have to move in a more considered way but I don't think I'm at risk of falling over from this feeling of being off balance. There is some pain in the affected ear but it's not too bad. Had a big meal, watched some TV and then feel asleep on my back. Just as dizzy as yesterday, cotton swab has a small amount of blood on it, ear pain definitely worse and can hear my heart beat/blood rushing sensation in my ear. None of this is unbearable and I still manage to talk to my sister on Facebook and listen to Adam Buxton's podcast. It's fairly embarrassing but one piece of advice I would give is get some 'stool softners' and or laxatives. A side effect of GA and pain medicine is constipation. Combine straining with a traumatised ear op and you have a fairly tricky pain balancing act while hovering over the toilet. Heed my words! Bad night of sleeping waking up in pain. Think I'm trying to do to much to soon. No change in hearing, but I'm really not expecting anything until the packing is out. Felling generally a bit deflated after the GA and not being able to do anything active...I am not an indoors person. Had a dizzy walked to the shops looking like a drunkard. slightly better sleep. Still some pain but I've only taken one ibuprofen today so it could definitely be worse. Still some minor bleeding on cotton swab. Ear continuing to make weird farting and squelching noises. I'm pretty relaxed that my ear is in recovery mode so I'm not expecting any miracles at this point. You'll read on other forums that some other people are already back to work at this point. This still feels some way off for me, but from what I've read about this procedure I can say for sure that everyone has very different recovery experience and associated timescales. Life can't be too bad as I've managed to write this post. Will update more over the coming days...   1 like, 149 replies "

I am always in hunger pain 24/7 because everything i am given to eat, i cannot make myself eat it. It just looks and smells disgusting, and if it feels unclean or makes my hands greasy or teeth feel disgusting, could get in hair, temperature of me/not being clean, etc., I have to force it down and only get halfway before giving up. I have no desire to eat anything in my surroundings and no appetite. I am in pain all of the time, but I don't know what to do about it.  I eat very little throughout each day, I was forcing food down my throat for awhile because I was afraid of losing more weight (I am currently very light) but I've lost the will to do that now. My parents do not believe that I have problems with eating/that my pain is caused by hunger, and when I was taken to the doctor my mom told the doctor there's no way I could be hungry because I shove lots of food into my mouth throughout the day. As a result, doctor prescribed 150 mg of over-the-counter acid reflux pill morning and night, and then possibly an endoscope in the future to check for an ulcer. I am underweight and to me I look too skinny and have been asked if I am anorexic, and I am hungry all day, every day--but I don't know what I should do about it., as I have no money or driving abilities to get my own food and can't cook. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I have had Bulimia on and off for a few year. It was triggered in my mid 20's. I was fairly overweight in my early 20's and i met a partner. I felt like i needed to change and get myself *healthier* so i dieted for around 5 month straight and had zero issues. I dropped 4 stone in weight overall and at the start looked *worse* but after stop dieting my body started to fill out slightly ' My face looks less Guant etc and i was very happy. In this period i had zero Bulimia urges. I then carried on around about the weight i had dropped to and felt very happy. My eating pattern was good and i was healthy.  I dont remember exactly how my Bulimia started but im sure it was due to fear of going back to that old me that was overweight. So i started to purge to keep my weight down. I then got into fitness after i had to get a knee cartlidge surgery. I had a torn knee cartlidge and the nurse says to me if you keep your legs strong and in shape then you wont ever suffer any problems later in life.... So i joined a local gym.  I was managing to keep a good diet and completely transformed my physique. Over the years i have had Bulimia on and off. I have went months without binging and purging and then i relapse and im back to the start. I recently started to binge and purge again and this time its VERY strong and im struggling to grasp it again. I went to my GP around 5 weeks ago and was just honest and i explained everything to her. She has tried me on medication (Doesn't work sadly) so she says i will refer you to an eating disorder clinic. I need to add in. My partner has zero clue about my eating disorder. I hide it very well. My GP referred me and the eating disorder clinic sent me a very specific letter to my home and i *just* managed to hide this and i panicked and cut cords with the clinic and my initial appointment as i want to do it in the background at the moment until i start to feel like i am getting a grip of things again. Im not ready to tell my partner. I am very embaressed about what i do. I know thats the worst thing to think but i genuinely am very embaressed and if my partner was to find out i reckon i would run away   Just opening up to a GP was very hard but i want help. I dont want to live with this Illness for the rest of my life. I have been binging purging for the last 3 months with a few days break randomly inbetween this period. These breaks are where i write up a meal plan and *try* stick to it but after a few days my urges come back STRONGER than ever and i relapse. I feel like i am spinning my wheels and cant get myself stable. Im 5 foot 9 and 31 year old. I try and hit around 3200 calories. I fear gaining the weight but i know i need to eat over and above what i burn and let my body know thiers not a famine happening. But Yesterday i woke up and had a very nice breakfast and i eat a big breakfast also to try and remove my binge urge. I feel absolutely no bulimia urges at all but fast forward to around 6 oclock. Even after breakfast & snacks a large lunch etc the Bulimia hits me hard and i came home and binge'd on a ton of food and purged. I was so angry and guilty with myself. I still had the urge to binge on LOADS more but after dinner which i had packed out with veggies ' Meats ' Carbs etc just to keep nutrition in my body and plenty potassium etc  i fought to keep this dinner down as i knew i needed this nutrition in my body and i held on after eating that dinner.  I want to eat normal again and not have this demon in my mind. I want to be healthy and normal but this has a grip of me very strongly this time. With me doing fitness i know nutrition is key to growth and progress but i cant seem to get a hold of it this time.

Chest Pains' Numb hands and feet every night that wakes me up ' Mouth throat all raw from the stomach acid's ' Constantly cold hands and feet ' Anxiety etc I have recontacted my GP and have an appointment rescheduled (Its 2 weeks away though). Now that i have opened up to them im not embaressed to go and speak to them again and start the ball rolling once more. I need the help and if i dont do it now i could really give myself health problems which i dont want. Any advice on what i could do? I have tried structured eating and incorporating high fats in the diet. I also add in foods that i would stray away from usually to try and stop the major urges for these foods. I feel like i cant get a hold this time. Everyday i wake up i keep saying ok today i will focus on just keeping everything down. What happens is when i eat breakfast or lunch etc my body becomes frantic for more food.

I have had Bulimia on and off for a few year. It was triggered in my mid 20's. I was fairly overweight in my early 20's and i met a partner. I felt like i needed to change and get myself *healthier* so i dieted for around 5 month straight and had zero issues. I dropped 4 stone in weight overall and at the start looked *worse* but after stop dieting my body started to fill out slightly ' My face looks less Guant etc and i was very happy. In this period i had zero Bulimia urges. I then carried on around about the weight i had dropped to and felt very happy. My eating pattern was good and i was healthy.  I dont remember exactly how my Bulimia started but im sure it was due to fear of going back to that old me that was overweight. So i started to purge to keep my weight down. I then got into fitness after i had to get a knee cartlidge surgery. I had a torn knee cartlidge and the nurse says to me if you keep your legs strong and in shape then you wont ever suffer any problems later in life.... So i joined a local gym.  I was managing to keep a good diet and completely transformed my physique. Over the years i have had Bulimia on and off. I have went months without binging and purging and then i relapse and im back to the start. I recently started to binge and purge again and this time its VERY strong and im struggling to grasp it again. I went to my GP around 5 weeks ago and was just honest and i explained everything to her. She has tried me on medication (Doesn't work sadly) so she says i will refer you to an eating disorder clinic. I need to add in. My partner has zero clue about my eating disorder. I hide it very well. My GP referred me and the eating disorder clinic sent me a very specific letter to my home and i *just* managed to hide this and i panicked and cut cords with the clinic and my initial appointment as i want to do it in the background at the moment until i start to feel like i am getting a grip of things again. Im not ready to tell my partner. I am very embaressed about what i do. I know thats the worst thing to think but i genuinely am very embaressed and if my partner was to find out i reckon i would run away   Just opening up to a GP was very hard but i want help. I dont want to live with this Illness for the rest of my life. I have been binging purging for the last 3 months with a few days break randomly inbetween this period. These breaks are where i write up a meal plan and *try* stick to it but after a few days my urges come back STRONGER than ever and i relapse. I feel like i am spinning my wheels and cant get myself stable. Im 5 foot 9 and 31 year old. I try and hit around 3200 calories. I fear gaining the weight but i know i need to eat over and above what i burn and let my body know thiers not a famine happening. But Yesterday i woke up and had a very nice breakfast and i eat a big breakfast also to try and remove my binge urge. I feel absolutely no bulimia urges at all but fast forward to around 6 oclock. Even after breakfast & snacks a large lunch etc the Bulimia hits me hard and i came home and binge'd on a ton of food and purged. I was so angry and guilty with myself. I still had the urge to binge on LOADS more but after dinner which i had packed out with veggies ' Meats ' Carbs etc just to keep nutrition in my body and plenty potassium etc  i fought to keep this dinner down as i knew i needed this nutrition in my body and i held on after eating that dinner.  I want to eat normal again and not have this demon in my mind. I want to be healthy and normal but this has a grip of me very strongly this time. With me doing fitness i know nutrition is key to growth and progress but i cant seem to get a hold of it this time. The hunger signals my brain is sending is beyond strong.  I can easily binge on 8000 calories just to feel satisfied to which i get that guilt and i end up purging.   Any advice?  Im showing some very serious health issues. Chest Pains' Numb hands and feet every night that wakes me up ' Mouth throat all raw from the stomach acid's ' Constantly cold hands and feet ' Anxiety etc I have recontacted my GP and have an appointment rescheduled (Its 2 weeks away though). Now that i have opened up to them im not embaressed to go and speak to them again and start the ball rolling once more. I need the help and if i dont do it now i could really give myself health problems which i dont want. Any advice on what i could do? I have tried structured eating and incorporating high fats in the diet. I also add in foods that i would stray away from usually to try and stop the major urges for these foods. I feel like i cant get a hold this time. Everyday i wake up i keep saying ok today i will focus on just keeping everything down. What happens is when i eat breakfast or lunch etc my body becomes frantic for more food. I have even done 24 hour fasts before just so i can do a massive one meal at night just so i cover all the nutrients i need and also to feel satisfied with the amount of food i am getting at that sitting.

I was also drinking alcohol heavily during these starvation periods.

The past few days I also feel like im ""losing my mind"", as in i cant think, rarely havent been able to recognise things etc. I have tried to start eating slowly again but i cant because it just hurts too much and causes  'tearing' feeling in my back.Ive been fatigued the past week, havent been able to do my normal ctivities and have just felt like im dying.

I know this is not as serious as many problems there are in this world, but I've been having eating disorder. I'm a teenage female. At a BMI reaching  25.5 on the July of 2019, I was miserable in my body and hated every part of me when I look in the mirror. I know people go through this and that it's bad. It's not good for your health, but I disregarded that to get thinner fast. I felt like a truck in an ocean of sticks. I needed to change fast before I hated myself any more, because I've been starting to bully myself emotionally, punish myself by starving sometimes when I've done something bad, such as mess up badly an algebra quiz. On September 2019, I started to make a change for my body. I ate 1,200 calories a day. I did feel super hungry, thought of food all the time. I used to crave chips every day, but I wouldn't let myself break it because I assured myself that the punishment will be greater than the rewarding feeling that comes from eating. On October 2019, I lowered my calorie intake to 800 calories a day. My period cycle has stopped. I felt hungry, but not as much as September. I wanted to break out into eating normally again, but I harnessed myself because of the reward that I was going to get in the end; not hating myself as much, and accepting myself and having people get jealous of my body. I wanted people jealous so badly because I felt like I was always the antisocial odd one out who has never fit in in anything. I felt like people will assume I'm lazy because of my weight. My grades have dropped from 80's and 90's to 60's and 70's. On November 2019, I lowered my calorie intake to 700-600 calories per day. I did not feel as hungry as I was on 800 calories. I felt pleasure in starving and not eating all day because it felt like I was in control. I was powerful and handled my situation a lot better than anyone may have on a diet. I felt like this would make me worth something. I wanted to get rid of all my body fat and to tone up my body. I had more energy than before. It may have been an illusion. My grades dropped to high 60 to low 70 due to missing out on lessons from waking up late and skipping days from being too tired. I cried myself to sleep every night. On December 2019 - December 10th, I promised myself that I will only eat 200-300 calories a day. And, surely, my corrupted mindset and determination got things going well for me. I was freezing all the time. It doesn't help that it's negative degrees outside. Even if a place was at room temperature, or even nearby a fireplace, I'd feel cold and reach out for hoodies. There were dark circles on my eyes. My thighs have a slight gap when I wall-sit, and they almost had a thigh gap. My stomach was super bloated, my stomach was in pain all the time, I was lightheaded, I couldn't focus on anything. I cried myself to sleep every single night, wondering when I'll get skinny, when I can let myself stop because I knew this was not healthy and that I'm setting myself up for failure. My willpower always won, and it said, ""No stopping. You won't eat except a loaf of bread a day, or an egg and 2 apples."" I'm a very lonely person, but people have noticed and told me I look good in my new weight and asked me how I did it. Of course, I said exercise, which is partially true. But they didn't know what was really going on inside. I was exhausted, so done. It felt like nobody cared, or nobody would understand me. My parents kept force feeding me an apple, an egg, or a loaf of bread, which is why I never ate except Lunch so I can act like I'm fine in front of my parents. I knew that they knew, and they took me to the emergency room. We've gotten a faster wait list and a blood test, and surely enough, I've been having about 3 nutrient deficiencies, and a few on edge. On December 10th, 2019, my dad demanded I eat normally again and has finally got to me. I always pushed him away and kept things secret, but he really wanted to help and to understand. After finally squeezing the information out of me, with teary eyes, I said, ""I felt like a truck in an ocean of sticks"". So, he's been helping me eat up. It's day 3 of healthy, clean eating, and I eat about 1,200-1,400 calories per day (spoons of peanut butter really help). My stomach hurts and so does my digestive system, and I do feel exhausted. I've gotten really hungry yesterday due to my metabolism trying to get back up, and surely enough, I ate when I felt hunger. I'm the most bloated I have ever been in my life right now. I need about 1,500-1,600 to maintain my weight as a sedentary individual (which I am not). We're now waiting about a month more to talk with a psychiatrist, and I've been eating well. A part of me also wanted to regrow my thinning hair and to get some muscle and tone by eating clean and doing ab workouts, running, and dancing. But, if I'm being honest with myself, I want to relapse though it's unhealthy. I lost 29 pounds in 3 months and 10 days, which is crazy. I kind of don't regret doing this. I want to be perfect. I do realise that I lost muscle as well, but I couldn't have executed this in such a quick time by only exercising. I don't want to be stick thin, I just would like to tone up and to have my stomach muscle show asap. I feel like I did this because I needed to be perfect (OCD), make people jealous as revenge for having nobody being friends with me, and so I have control over my falling life. I feel like a loner, a failure with no friends, and that I'll never catch up on my school work because I've lost the rope and can't catch up with so many lessons. Thank you so much for reading this, I'm sorry it's been long. 0 likes, 2 replies "

But they didn't know what was really going on inside. I was exhausted, so done. It felt like nobody cared, or nobody would understand me. My parents kept force feeding me an apple, an egg, or a loaf of bread, which is why I never ate except Lunch so I can act like I'm fine in front of my parents. I knew that they knew, and they took me to the emergency room. We've gotten a faster wait list and a blood test, and surely enough, I've been having about 3 nutrient deficiencies, and a few on edge. On December 10th, 2019, my dad demanded I eat normally again and has finally got to me. I always pushed him away and kept things secret, but he really wanted to help and to understand. After finally squeezing the information out of me, with teary eyes, I said, ""I felt like a truck in an ocean of sticks"". So, he's been helping me eat up. It's day 3 of healthy, clean eating, and I eat about 1,200-1,400 calories per day (spoons of peanut butter really help). My stomach hurts and so does my digestive system, and I do feel exhausted. I've gotten really hungry yesterday due to my metabolism trying to get back up, and surely enough, I ate when I felt hunger. I'm the most bloated I have ever been in my life right now. I need about 1,500-1,600 to maintain my weight as a sedentary individual (which I am not). We're now waiting about a month more to talk with a psychiatrist, and I've been eating well. A part of me also wanted to regrow my thinning hair and to get some muscle and tone by eating clean and doing ab workouts, running, and dancing. But, if I'm being honest with myself, I want to relapse though it's unhealthy. I lost 29 pounds in 3 months and 10 days, which is crazy. I kind of don't regret doing this. I want to be perfect. I do realise that I lost muscle as well, but I couldn't have executed this in such a quick time by only exercising. I don't want to be stick thin, I just would like to tone up and to have my stomach muscle show asap. I feel like I did this because I needed to be perfect (OCD), make people jealous as revenge for having nobody being friends with me, and so I have control over my falling life. I feel like a loner, a failure with no friends, and that I'll never catch up on my school work because I've lost the rope and can't catch up with so many lessons.

I know this is not as serious as many problems there are in this world, but I've been having eating disorder. I'm a teenage female. At a BMI reaching  25.5 on the July of 2019, I was miserable in my body and hated every part of me when I look in the mirror. I know people go through this and that it's bad. It's not good for your health, but I disregarded that to get thinner fast. I felt like a truck in an ocean of sticks. I needed to change fast before I hated myself any more, because I've been starting to bully myself emotionally, punish myself by starving sometimes when I've done something bad, such as mess up badly an algebra quiz. On September 2019, I started to make a change for my body. I ate 1,200 calories a day. I did feel super hungry, thought of food all the time. I used to crave chips every day, but I wouldn't let myself break it because I assured myself that the punishment will be greater than the rewarding feeling that comes from eating. On October 2019, I lowered my calorie intake to 800 calories a day. My period cycle has stopped. I felt hungry, but not as much as September. I wanted to break out into eating normally again, but I harnessed myself because of the reward that I was going to get in the end; not hating myself as much, and accepting myself and having people get jealous of my body. I wanted people jealous so badly because I felt like I was always the antisocial odd one out who has never fit in in anything. I felt like people will assume I'm lazy because of my weight. My grades have dropped from 80's and 90's to 60's and 70's. On November 2019, I lowered my calorie intake to 700-600 calories per day. I did not feel as hungry as I was on 800 calories. I felt pleasure in starving and not eating all day because it felt like I was in control. I was powerful and handled my situation a lot better than anyone may have on a diet. I felt like this would make me worth something. I wanted to get rid of all my body fat and to tone up my body. I had more energy than before. It may have been an illusion. My grades dropped to high 60 to low 70 due to missing out on lessons from waking up late and skipping days from being too tired. I cried myself to sleep every night. On December 2019 - December 10th, I promised myself that I will only eat 200-300 calories a day. And, surely, my corrupted mindset and determination got things going well for me. I was freezing all the time. It doesn't help that it's negative degrees outside. Even if a place was at room temperature, or even nearby a fireplace, I'd feel cold and reach out for hoodies. There were dark circles on my eyes. My thighs have a slight gap when I wall-sit, and they almost had a thigh gap. My stomach was super bloated, my stomach was in pain all the time, I was lightheaded, I couldn't focus on anything. I cried myself to sleep every single night, wondering when I'll get skinny, when I can let myself stop because I knew this was not healthy and that I'm setting myself up for failure.

My grades dropped to high 60 to low 70 due to missing out on lessons from waking up late and skipping days from being too tired. I cried myself to sleep every night. On December 2019 - December 10th, I promised myself that I will only eat 200-300 calories a day. And, surely, my corrupted mindset and determination got things going well for me. I was freezing all the time. It doesn't help that it's negative degrees outside. Even if a place was at room temperature, or even nearby a fireplace, I'd feel cold and reach out for hoodies. There were dark circles on my eyes. My thighs have a slight gap when I wall-sit, and they almost had a thigh gap. My stomach was super bloated, my stomach was in pain all the time, I was lightheaded, I couldn't focus on anything. I cried myself to sleep every single night, wondering when I'll get skinny, when I can let myself stop because I knew this was not healthy and that I'm setting myself up for failure. My willpower always won, and it said, ""No stopping. You won't eat except a loaf of bread a day, or an egg and 2 apples."" I'm a very lonely person, but people have noticed and told me I look good in my new weight and asked me how I did it. Of course, I said exercise, which is partially true. But they didn't know what was really going on inside. I was exhausted, so done. It felt like nobody cared, or nobody would understand me. My parents kept force feeding me an apple, an egg, or a loaf of bread, which is why I never ate except Lunch so I can act like I'm fine in front of my parents. I knew that they knew, and they took me to the emergency room. We've gotten a faster wait list and a blood test, and surely enough, I've been having about 3 nutrient deficiencies, and a few on edge. On December 10th, 2019, my dad demanded I eat normally again and has finally got to me. I always pushed him away and kept things secret, but he really wanted to help and to understand. After finally squeezing the information out of me, with teary eyes, I said, ""I felt like a truck in an ocean of sticks"". So, he's been helping me eat up. It's day 3 of healthy, clean eating, and I eat about 1,200-1,400 calories per day (spoons of peanut butter really help). My stomach hurts and so does my digestive system, and I do feel exhausted. I've gotten really hungry yesterday due to my metabolism trying to get back up, and surely enough, I ate when I felt hunger. I'm the most bloated I have ever been in my life right now. I need about 1,500-1,600 to maintain my weight as a sedentary individual (which I am not). We're now waiting about a month more to talk with a psychiatrist, and I've been eating well. A part of me also wanted to regrow my thinning hair and to get some muscle and tone by eating clean and doing ab workouts, running, and dancing. But, if I'm being honest with myself, I want to relapse though it's unhealthy. I lost 29 pounds in 3 months and 10 days, which is crazy. I kind of don't regret doing this. I want to be perfect. I do realise that I lost muscle as well, but I couldn't have executed this in such a quick time by only exercising. I don't want to be stick thin, I just would like to tone up and to have my stomach muscle show asap. I feel like I did this because I needed to be perfect (OCD), make people jealous as revenge for having nobody being friends with me, and so I have control over my falling life. I feel like a loner, a failure with no friends, and that I'll never catch up on my school work because I've lost the rope and can't catch up with so many lessons. Thank you so much for reading this, I'm sorry it's been long. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I have been taking 75mg in the morning but as mentioned in a previous post I'm feeling completely exhausted all of the time. I'm also not sleeping great but even at times when I've slept reasonably ok I'm still physically and mentally worn out the next day. The dr has increased me to 115mg starting from tomorrow and I completely forgot to ask the question whether I should maybe change to taking my medication in the evening rather than the morning and see if that helps. Has anybody else had this problem and had success with changing the time you take it? Really appreciate any advice anybody can give. Many thanks Clare 0 likes, 6 replies "

I felt like I was in the front seat of a car driving down the highway with the back windows open halfway.  I went to doctor and found I had lost some low frequency hearing in right ear.  I was Put on steroids for two weeks.  Got hearing back but left with this loud tuning fork/motor engine sound in my right ear and random hearing distortion in both ears.  I am very sensitive to low-frequency sounds and any kind of motors, airplanes and low voices just don't sound clear.  The motor engine stops when I speak and returns after my last word.  When someone speaks to me loud enough the motor engine will stop also and than return upon their last word.  Sometime sound drives the motor engine into the other  ear and I feel a fluttering/vibration/rumbling sound in the left ear.  If I shake my head back and forth quicky the noise will stop for a second wihile doing it. Had so many tests and scans that don't show anything wrong.  My hearing test are normal now.  It is driving me insane.  Can't eat or concentrate. Severe anxiety.  Went to audiologist and see if I could have it masked but it is to loud.  I can't believe I can still hear over this noise and distortion that is going on in my head. Some days are better than others and I think I may be getting better but it gets worse again.  I have no dizziness at all.  Some doctors told me menieres disease or virus.  I can't stand it anymore.  Does anyone have any suggestions? 0 likes, 58 replies "

When this started, id get a stuffy nose, pulsating in my right ear not my left and pain on and off, which i still do, the pulsating wore off when i went to the doctors as she gave me antibiotics but it flared up again, went  away and over the last couple of days has come back the strange thing is ,what ever it is, it swaps ears and its never at the same time. backround noise, is the same  but not  TWANGY as it is when people speak. I have noticed to that i get a slight burring, i suppose more like a vibrating and this makes my ears more twangy. I take pain killers and it seems to work i think, but it doesnt get rid of the TWANG. Ive always had tinnitus so i know its not that .  sorry if im babbling but im so depressed with it all now, its affecting everyone around me.

There is pain in my ears associated with the popping, and both occur constantly, all day, every day, nonstop. The popping started back in October 2016 and has been going on every single day since (I suspect it was from a flight I took a few months prior, but to be honest, it’s just a hunch. This whole thing really came out of nowhere). From what I’ve gathered and due to symptoms, it seems to be Eustachian Tubular Dysfunction, but after meetings with ENT specialists and unsuccessful cure attempts, my doubts continue to linger. It’s also been brought up that it could be TMJ, but due to the ear popping and pain, I would not think that would be the case. The popping is something I can deal with; the pain, however, is very bothersome and makes life quite miserable no matter what I do (it’s quite painful at times).   Symptoms          Ear popping: multiple times a minute (15, give or take. Fluctuates. Regardless, the point is that it’s A LOT). Typically, what happens is the right ear pops immediately followed by the left ear popping.          Constant ear pain: the best way to describe it is a stinging pressure. It’s as if something is inside my ears is trying to escape out of my eardrums. If I had to guess, the pain is mostly associated in my left ear (and if I had to guess even further, I want to say that my left Eustachian tube is blocked/pinched somehow, causing all of this). But either way, both ears experience pain and are equally discomforting.          Throat pain: this is a bit odd, but I also feel pain/pressure in the very back of the throat. It’s hard to describe, but it somehow feels related to it all and is in sync with this.          No liquid/puss: There is no liquid buildup of any sort behind my eardrums, as observed by the ENT specialists. This has made tracking down the true cause quite difficult.          Depression: I’m typically a very happy dude. I know my mindset is all there, but this is finding ways to impede my emotions and lifestyle, and has succeeded in doing so. Attempted Remedies          Flonase/nasal spray o   Also have used a corticosteroid & antihistamine spray multiple times          Neti pot: of all the remedies, this seems to be on the best track of working. But still leads to a dead end          Valsalva Maneuver (hold nose, then blow through nose): I’ve done this hundreds of times, but it’s also recommended not to do. I’ve not done it hard enough to rupture an eardrum/cause more damage, so no worries there          Toynbee Maneuver (hold nose, close mouth, swallow): I have done this with water (also salt water)          Earpopper: This is an FDA approved item that is basically a mechanized Valsalva Maneuver.          ENT: I’ve seen over 6 specialists, each with different approaches and guesses (one told me it would resolve itself within 1-2 months. You can imagine the frustration). After meeting with each person multiple times, they are baffled as what to do next o   One recommended an allergy test, I have yet to follow through with this          CT Scan: I think this is what was done. It was performed at the ENT building.          Myringotomy (small incision made into eardrum): performed on my left ear. No change in symptoms o   Also considered getting tubes put in, but didn’t think it would be effective   I’m just desperate to figure out a cure. I truly think it’s something simple and we just have yet to discover the cause and relieve it. This constant pain makes the simplest of tasks very difficult for I have to really concentrate and motivate myself to push through the pain and keep moving on. If anybody at all can relate to this, or they think they have an idea of what may be happening here, I beg you to reach out with your suggestions. I’m all ears! Pun intended  0 likes, 9 replies "

Pressure in ears and head. Very fatigued. ,"Looking for an opinion on my last 2 years of being ill. I'm 46 years old, male, and in a good state of fitness. I'm not over-weight, have never smoked, and rarely drink. I've seen numerous doctors and don't seem to be any closer to a diagnosis. I started visiting my GP with what felt like a lingering flu. Early symptoms included being over tired, pressure in ears, and generally not feeling well. I'd been dealing with a very stressful business situation in the 12-18 months before the symptoms started and was advised that I was probably run-down. Each time I went to the doctor they would take a blood test. Over at least 6 tests they would always tell me something different, but it always seemed to be that I had some unknown virus. At times my blood cell count was too many white cells, or too many red cells. The frustration was they could never tell me what was wrong. I had stress tests for my heart, CT scan and MRI. All came back normal. During this period I would sometimes have 2-3 weeks where I felt normal and was able to work and exercise. These periods of good health never lasted. Fast forward to about 6 months ago. My [now new] doctor referred me to an endocrinologist as it was thought there may be a thyroid problem. My first test did indicate that I may be hypothyroid but they didn't want to give me any medication as they thought it wasn't required. I didn't get any better over the next few months with the same symptoms continuing - pressure in my head and ears, fatigued, unable to concentrate etc. At my next visit to the endocrinologist my thyroid function had worsened slightly and I was put on 50mg of euthyroxine. My blood pressure was also fluctuating a lot with periods where it was around 150/104. I was prescribed medication to try and bring this under control. Around 4 weeks ago I was on a trip away from home and started to feel really awful. I felt my head pressure was increasing and when I shut my eyes the only thing I could hear was my heart beating with a pulsing feeling my head. I had frequent hot flushes, dizzy spells, and never ending ear pressure. I was sleeping frequently for hours during the day, but struggling to get a good nights sleep, perhaps due to building anxiety about what was wrong with me.  Now back home, I went back to the doctor and explained how bad I was feeling. The main symptoms now being extreme fatigue, constant pressure in my ears, and a very strange feeling at the top of my head. I felt on a few occasions that I was going to faint, especially in the morning. I had tried exercising [cycling] one morning, and had to abandon after only a short time. I had also started to feel aches and pains in my legs and back. I explained to the doctor that the main symptoms that were worrying me were the inability to work [tired and no concentration span], the pressure in my head and ears, and the strange pounding sensation from my heart. I was thinking at this time that these may all be connected to being hypothyroid. The doctor ordered a new thyroid function test which came back right in the middle of the normal range. That has scared me as I feel dreadful, and have been pretty much consigned to bed for the last week. When I do get up I feel dizzy. My eyesight has changed. Hard to explain but it's just not feeling normal. I also feel that driving has a different sensation and I don't feel entirely safe. I still have episodes of feeling like I will faint, but never do. My doctor had asked me to take Zoloft [as she felt I was over anxious]. I didn't want to take them but did, thinking it would do no harm. The morning after taking it I felt even worse, with the dizzy feelings increased. Even 2 days later I still feel the effects.  I'm trying to find out what could cause my symptoms and came up with various reports on labyrinthitis. As this seems to be a viral problem that can cause the feeling of ear fullness it seems to be a possibility. It's all I've come up now that it doesn't look thyroid is the source of the problem. Right now, I'm in the worst health I've been in years. I can't work, exercise and need to sleep 4-5 hours during the day. I have constant ear pressure, pressure in my head, dizziness, lack of energy, and muscle pain. Can anyone suggest what this could be. It's been 2 years now and I just seem to get worse. Writing this from bed as I don't seem to have the energy to stand up.    1 like, 77 replies "

Pressure in ears and head. Very fatigued. ,"Looking for an opinion on my last 2 years of being ill. I'm 46 years old, male, and in a good state of fitness. I'm not over-weight, have never smoked, and rarely drink. I've seen numerous doctors and don't seem to be any closer to a diagnosis. I started visiting my GP with what felt like a lingering flu. Early symptoms included being over tired, pressure in ears, and generally not feeling well. I'd been dealing with a very stressful business situation in the 12-18 months before the symptoms started and was advised that I was probably run-down. Each time I went to the doctor they would take a blood test. Over at least 6 tests they would always tell me something different, but it always seemed to be that I had some unknown virus. At times my blood cell count was too many white cells, or too many red cells. The frustration was they could never tell me what was wrong. I had stress tests for my heart, CT scan and MRI. All came back normal. During this period I would sometimes have 2-3 weeks where I felt normal and was able to work and exercise. These periods of good health never lasted. Fast forward to about 6 months ago. My [now new] doctor referred me to an endocrinologist as it was thought there may be a thyroid problem. My first test did indicate that I may be hypothyroid but they didn't want to give me any medication as they thought it wasn't required. I didn't get any better over the next few months with the same symptoms continuing - pressure in my head and ears, fatigued, unable to concentrate etc. At my next visit to the endocrinologist my thyroid function had worsened slightly and I was put on 50mg of euthyroxine. My blood pressure was also fluctuating a lot with periods where it was around 150/104. I was prescribed medication to try and bring this under control. Around 4 weeks ago I was on a trip away from home and started to feel really awful. I felt my head pressure was increasing and when I shut my eyes the only thing I could hear was my heart beating with a pulsing feeling my head. I had frequent hot flushes, dizzy spells, and never ending ear pressure. I was sleeping frequently for hours during the day, but struggling to get a good nights sleep, perhaps due to building anxiety about what was wrong with me.  Now back home, I went back to the doctor and explained how bad I was feeling. The main symptoms now being extreme fatigue, constant pressure in my ears, and a very strange feeling at the top of my head. I felt on a few occasions that I was going to faint, especially in the morning. I had tried exercising [cycling] one morning, and had to abandon after only a short time. I had also started to feel aches and pains in my legs and back. I explained to the doctor that the main symptoms that were worrying me were the inability to work [tired and no concentration span], the pressure in my head and ears, and the strange pounding sensation from my heart. I was thinking at this time that these may all be connected to being hypothyroid. The doctor ordered a new thyroid function test which came back right in the middle of the normal range. That has scared me as I feel dreadful, and have been pretty much consigned to bed for the last week. When I do get up I feel dizzy. My eyesight has changed. Hard to explain but it's just not feeling normal. I also feel that driving has a different sensation and I don't feel entirely safe. I still have episodes of feeling like I will faint, but never do.

The best way to describe the feeling is like I have low blood sugar with high blood pressure. Secondly,  I would get a throbbing sensation in hands and feet accompanied by cold sensations and pins and needles. Lastly, I feel like I can hear my heartbeat and it feels like its pumping harder. I'd like to note that all these symptoms come and go throughout the day.  Some hrs are better than others but still constant every day. Doctor likes to say that its my   due to panic attacks.   He says it put a lot of pressure on my nerves.  But I'm not sure. Its just so odd.  I was perfectly fine leading up to the new year (working out 4 out of 7 days a week) then all of a sudden I'm having all these odd symptoms. Is the doctor right in saying this is an inner ear infection mixed with anxiety? Vestibular neuritis? Labyrinthitis? Its on my mind everyday.

Here is some background on what led up to this. I am a 33 year old Male, about a week and a half ago I was working on cutting deer meat when I cut up near the left tip of my middle finger (of the left hand) with a knife.  I cleaned up the cut, applied isopropyl alcohol and Neosporin to the cut and put a bandaid on it. At the time I had no numbness or odd sensations in my hand. About 3-4 days after I took the bandage off and was noticing that I appeared to have some numbness in my hand, along with some pressure around the palm of my hand. I then started experiencing some warmthness in this hand, extending partially up my arm. When this started occuring I went to a Walk In clinic who looked at the cut and my hand and other than the cut didnt see anything abnormal. They prescribed me a 10 day supply of Amoxicillin for an antibiotic (in case there eas an infection from the cut) along with a 5 day supply of Prednisone, along with a Tetnis shot. I am not on my last day of the Prednisone course and I feel like I have much better sensation in my left hand and that my numbess is  gone, however I've had compression in my Ulnar nerve for the past few days. The compression appears to be centered mostly near my elbow, either on the inner side of the Funny bone, or just above it in my upper arm. It feels like in that one spot like the never is being pinched. I have no idea if the cut to my finger in any way could have caused this, or if it's pure coincidence. I will say that I have never experienced anything similar to this before.  From what I understand the Ulnar nerve covers your pinky finger and right side of the ring finger, whereas my cut was to my middle finger so I dont know how the cut to the middle finger would affect the Ulnar nerve. Is it possible that I have some inflammation from the cut that is somehow affecting this nerve? Would you expect to see this compression if you did have an infection I'm trying not to worry too much but at the same time I don't want to ignore the problem. Would a hand Surgeon be a good option to make an appointment with if this doesn't resolve over the next fee days or what would you recommend doing? Thank you very much for your feedback!

I cleaned up the cut, applied isopropyl alcohol and Neosporin to the cut and put a bandaid on it. At the time I had no numbness or odd sensations in my hand. About 3-4 days after I took the bandage off and was noticing that I appeared to have some numbness in my hand, along with some pressure around the palm of my hand. I then started experiencing some warmthness in this hand, extending partially up my arm. When this started occuring I went to a Walk In clinic who looked at the cut and my hand and other than the cut didnt see anything abnormal. They prescribed me a 10 day supply of Amoxicillin for an antibiotic (in case there eas an infection from the cut) along with a 5 day supply of Prednisone, along with a Tetnis shot. I am not on my last day of the Prednisone course and I feel like I have much better sensation in my left hand and that my numbess is  gone, however I've had compression in my Ulnar nerve for the past few days. The compression appears to be centered mostly near my elbow, either on the inner side of the Funny bone, or just above it in my upper arm. It feels like in that one spot like the never is being pinched. I have no idea if the cut to my finger in any way could have caused this, or if it's pure coincidence. I will say that I have never experienced anything similar to this before.  From what I understand the Ulnar nerve covers your pinky finger and right side of the ring finger, whereas my cut was to my middle finger so I dont know how the cut to the middle finger would affect the Ulnar nerve. Is it possible that I have some inflammation from the cut that is somehow affecting this nerve? Would you expect to see this compression if you did have an infection I'm trying not to worry too much but at the same time I don't want to ignore the problem. Would a hand Surgeon be a good option to make an appointment with if this doesn't resolve over the next fee days or what would you recommend doing? Thank you very much for your feedback!

I hope someone takes the time to answer to this as I am completely oblivious to what this might be and am desperate for some sort of guidance. Explaining the picture: Area A: When feeling this area with my fingers I notice a thin ""chain"" connecting to the medial epicondyle and area B which I don't know if it is a tricep or bicep muscle. Area A is where I feel the most pain. Area B: This area is what I think is a muscle and is ""hidden"" behind the major bicep and tricep muscles, and hurts only when applying pressure. Area C: This seems to be the medial triceps head. Along with area A, this is where I feel pain after doing exercise. I am an active guy and I enjoy doing bodyweight workouts and I have also trained in a gym. Since the summer of 2018, when working out my chest or arms, I sometimes feel a pop in my left elbow like something is snapping over the bone. This never bothered me much untill february of 2019 where I started feeling some pain in my elbow and the popping became more frequent. I reduced my training frequency and load but I never stopped training. After a few days of rest I would always test if the popping was still there, and it was. Right now, the popping is not as frequent but whenever I do, for example, push ups or pull ups, AFTER the exercise and the day after the workout I feel pain (not soreness) in area C and A. This happens in BOTH arms, but is more painful on my left arm. I have searched the internet for an answer: golfer's elbow, tricep tendonitis, bicep tendonitis... but nothing seems to fit my symptoms. Golfer's elbow is what it seems to be, but I feel pain behind/above the medial epicondyle (area A, B and C) and none in my forearm. Today I went to a sports masseuse and he did some shock therapy on both arms. My left arm was under ""weaker"" shocks compared to my right arm, and while my right bicep didn't move at all, my left bicep moved a lot with each shock. Then he did some scrapping. After that he used suction cups and we saw that the areas A and C have some inflammation. When he performed manual therapy and trigger point release he went really deep on area A and it hurt a lot. At the time I had no pain on C and B, but A was really hurting. I guess what I want to know is what is this? What even is area A? Is it worth it doing these sports massages? Is there any rehab I can do to help this? Is this a bicep or triceps problem? I am really lost and don't know what this is. Thank you 0 likes, 0 replies "

This surgical procedure was a complete success. On August 19th, I was back in Theatre for a procedure on my right elbow. Loose bodies were removed, osteophytes dealt with, capsule work undertaken and decompression of the ulnar nerve. The joint is arthritic. The subsequent swelling and bruising was horrendous. I expected that. However, of concern is the development of two new symptoms. The top of my forearm is completely numb and the outer side of my arm is painful and extremely hypersensitive. My surgeon ordered an   which revealed an internal bleed on the arm - which would account for the swelling and bruising. The surgeon felt that such a bleed was the cause of my new symptoms.

I've had a lump in my elbow crease for a very long time now (years). Sometimes there is no pain at all but sometimes the pain is quite sharp. I'm guessing that's because it might be pushing down on some nerves in my arm. Every doctor that I've gone to tells me it's not a big deal and I shouldn't worry about it. Lately it's been bothering me more often than not. Sometimes when I wake up and extend my arm it is quite painful. But sometimes it is not painful at all. The swelling seems to come and go. Sometimes it is tender, painless and does not hurt when I push down on it a bit. But other times it swells up, becomes a bit hard and hurts when I push on it. Sometimes when my arm is bent for an extended period of time it hurts to extend it and the lump is swollen. I've included a picture. I plan on going to see a doctor in a couple weeks to get it looked at thoroughly but I cannot do so until May 1st. I just wanted to see if I can get anyone's opinion on this that has experienced anything like this or seen anything similar. Thanks in advance! 0 likes, 14 replies "

I recently injured my right elbow - not participating in sports, but apparently by doing some heavy duty sanding on my kitchen walls!   This was about a month ago and I've been having elbow/forearm pain ever since. I haven't been to my doctor yet, but I may have to. I have sharp pain on the end of my elbow bone (right at the lateral epicondyle)   a duller pain in my upper forearm when I try to fully extend my arm. Rotating my forearm away from my body also causes the dull upper forearm muscle pain. I work in a biomedical research lab and do a LOT of pipetting of chemicals, cells in culture, and various reagents - this involves a lot of hand dexterity and thumb pressing (kind of like pressing the top of a mace cannister or a handheld gameshow buzzer). I also do a good amount of typing and mousing when analyzing data. All of this seems to exacerbate the issue and I can't just rest the elbow or I literally would get NO work done and would have to take a month off of work and just sit on my couch and watch tv. I have been wearing this elbow brace for about a week and half and it doesn't really seem to help at all: (EDIT ok the forum won't let me post a link but it's the Amazon Choice/Best Seller 'Tomight Elbow Brace with Compression Pad' on Amazon.) I was reading that if one of these arm braces does NOT help then you   have   OR your injury is severe. Well every description of tennis elbow I've read sounds just like what I have and the pain isn't absolutely terrible or anything, so I can't imagine I've terribly disabled myself. I've also read that the elbow brace should be at least 3"" wide, but mine isn't even 2"" wide! Could that be why it's not helping? When I put it on, I wiggle my fingers and look at my upper forearm to find where the tendons are moving and I place the pad part of the brace right over those moving tendons. I've tried putting the thing at various distances from my elbow, but no spot really reduces the pain. I've got   wrist rests for my mouse - one back under my elbow and one under the wrist and that seems to help a bit. Don't have one in front of the keyboard though. So what should I do? Am I using the brace right? Should I try a wider one? Do I even   tennis elbow? What else could it be? Should I just bite the bullet and go see my doc who will probably refer me to an orthopedist? SO over this already . . . thanks, guys! Cynthia . 0 likes, 1 reply "

BUT... she continues to scream and scream all night long.   She will be calm, pleasant, and very sleepy during the day. At night, she is awful.  I tried white noise, soothing words, stroking her arm, offering water, etc....   NOTHING worked longer than a few minutes. I'm afraid she is going to get tossed out.    I need advice!!  The staff at the rehab think that since she is well during the day, there can't be anything medically wrong with her.  I don't know if we are unique.  The entire facility is filled with seniors, and I don't hear any yelling at night. I hear plenty of snoring, and I would LOVE to hear my mom snore........  She had no issues with night delirium until her first hosptial stay.   0 likes, 15 replies "

My father has been living on his own a few years now since my mom passed. He is in relatively good health for his age (75+) and I have been living close enough to visit him once a week plus talk to him on the phone a few times a week. A month ago my DH got a new post overseas and we have found ourselves having to move there for 2 year period along with our children by Easter. Although my father is not sick, I have noticed him becoming more frail over they years and I am really afraid what will happen if he has a fall inside the house and requires assistance while I'm overseas.  I have heard terrible stories of seniors falling in their house and in some cases being left there for days before anyone noticed and got to them. My father has a few friends with whom he meets frequently but at times it could be days before he sees anyone in person as he enjoys solitude. I am not even going to refer to moving to shelter homes or relatives' homes etc as it is out of the question for him. He loves his home and would hate to move to a new environment. Besides I have no siblings and his siblings have either passed or live overseas. Does anyone have any other ideas of how I could deal with this situation? I need to make sure I can check on my father and ensure he is alright while I am away. Really worried. Thoughts, ideas, experiences much appreciated... 0 likes, 5 replies "

They said something about her her vein is too small doctors would not be able to find it and inject anything.   Is this true? Is there really no way to feed her some nutrients to give her body a chance to recover or get better?  She seems like she is only dying because she simply isn't eating anything.  Any advice would be helpful!   0 likes, 5 replies "

She has put all my symthoms (including extreme pain during sex and after sex) down to constipation. I am confused because adhesions are literally what endometriosis is characterised by and she had to cut them. And also I feel like just because she has seen fecal loading she has put it down to that. While I’m aware and looking Into being referred to bowel dept I am concerned about the adhesions she cut away because isn’t this endometriosis?

Anyone else have these symptoms?","Since I was 16 (24 now) I’ve had pain during urination. I can manage the pain by drinking enough water, for some reason the fuller my bladder is the less painful it is to go. But if I don’t drink enough, or if I’ve drank alcohol, I get a pain which is just like having a urine infection. Right before the wee comes out (sorry tmi!) I feel a slight resistance, as if there’s something in my urethra, it’s really hard to describe. The pain starts as the urine is travelling down the urethra. I’ve had urine tests, ultrasounds and a cystoscopy but everything comes back clear. I also have pain during sex/when trying to use a tampon, this has been happening since I first tried to use a tampon ages 14. I also have pain during bowel movements and have seen a colorectal surgeon who says I don’t have fissures, although I have had them in the past as he can see where some have healed. I wonder whether the fissures are secondary to pain caused by endo.. I.e tensing up because of the pain, leading to fissures. I don’t know, I’m trying to figure it all out at the moment and keeping a diary to see if it’s worse with my period. The symptoms are there all the time but not sure whether they’re worse when I’m on, I’ve only just recently been offered endo as a possible diagnosis from my GP so never tracked the symptoms properly before!

And I am no stranger to what level 10 pain feels like--I have herniated disks and have been left without painkillers after surgery, broken teeth, etc. And this was bad, level 10 stabbing pains every 10-20 seconds. So I went to the ER, after taking 1600 mg ibuprofen and two midol in under 6 hours with no change to my pain levels. They gave me a non-opiate painkiller, which did nothing for my pain, then did a CT with contrast and a transvaginal ultrasound, both of which turned up nothing. Then the ER doc gave me a shot of dicyclomine, and the pain didn't go away, but the stabbing jolts of level 10 pain went from every 10-20 seconds to every 1-2 minutes. The doctor impressed on me, multiple times, that I needed to see an OB/GYN. And it had to be a doctor, not a NP or PA. The pain hasn't gone away since that day. Sometimes it's a dull ache, and sometimes it feels like my guts are being torn out (usually around my very-unpredictable period, which had come 4 times between December and February. ) In early January, I saw my GP. In late January, I saw a new OB/GYN and had an  . In mid-February, the OB/GYN performed an ablation, removed my fallopian tubes, and then did some exploring. A week after the surgery, I got a call: My fallopian tubes were normal. No other info. So, I thought everything she saw was normal. I had my follow-up visit, and everything is not, in fact, normal. The OB/GYN showed me pictures of the various endometrial lesions she found, as well as removing a benign cyst. She said she was able to cauterize most of the lesions, but there were ""a few"" she couldn't due to placement. She had hoped that the others being cauterized would have helped with the pain, but my pain level hadn't decreased. So, she prescribed Orilissa. Also, I've had rectal bleeding just before my period, every time, for years. A gastroenterologist said he found a ""lesion"" during my colonoscopy. I think it's likely The lesion is endometrial. I read up about it. I'm taking calcium to combat bone loss. I haven't had any side-effects besides some dizziness. But every night about an hour or two before my dose is due, I start having the pain again. So, questions: Thanks in advance. 0 likes, 1 reply "

442,C0158300,Adhesive Capsulitis,"C0231218, C0030193, C0683369","Malaise, Pain, Clouded consciousness",https://patient.info/forums/discuss/helpful-tips-28439,Helpful Tips,"Be patient. This is a LONG disease. Remember, adhesive capsulitis is a disease, not a syndrome or a condition; it has a beginning, middle and END. Wherever you are in the cycle, you're moving toward the END. –  Educate yourself! There's lots of information on the internet about adhesive capsulitis, and many different ideas and approaches. Read everything you can. --  Be aware that the medical community does not agree about the best way to treat FS. One doctor may say, \""Do nothing, it will get better on its own.\"" Another doctor might say, \""Let’s operate!\"" One doctor might say, \""Start physical therapy right away.\"" Another might say, \""PT won't help till you're in the thawing stage.\"" You must educate yourself to know what is truly the best approach for YOU.   If you don't like your doctor or your physical therapist, change! Find caregivers who know this disease. Not all of them do! Don't let ANYONE rush you into anything. You have time to decide what's best for you. –  Get painkillers. If one kind doesn't work, try another. Don’t give up. There’s no reason to be in a lot of pain. There are lots of different kinds of painkillers, so work with your doctor until you find one that works for you. Be assertive about your treatment choices. There are studies showing that FS eventually gets better no matter what you do or don't do, so make the choices yours. –   Slow down mentally and emotionally. Develop patience and serenity. Be kind to yourself. -- Slow down physically. Without the use of your arm, you don't have your usual physical balance, and you could get hurt if you try to maintain your usual pace. – Take lots of naps. Your whole body is ill, not just your shoulder.  Eat healthy food. Drink LOTS of water. Take vitamins.    Use cold packs and hot packs. They help. Frozen peas are great for icing -- you can thaw and refreeze them over and over. (Just don't get confused and eat them!)   Be sure you do your exercises, icing, and heat with the good shoulder as well as the bad -- it's getting an extra workout, and deserves to be pampered. -- But don't work your good shoulder TOO hard. Studies show that people who get FS in one shoulder are more likely to get it in the other shoulder later on.   Take baths -- long ones, as hot as you can stand. Immerse your shoulder. Play soothing music and light a scented candle. Use an inflatable bath pillow.  Sleep with lots of little pillows. Tuck them all around you. Experiment with the pillows till you find a comfortable arrangement. -- Have a favourite pillow. Tuck it under your arm when you sleep. Take it with you to the movies, or on car rides; use it to prop up your arm whenever you'll be sitting for a long time. -- Put a big pillow between yourself and your bedfellow so they don't roll over and bump into you. -- It's okay to sleep in the recliner for awhile.   -- Pamper yourself. Ask your loved ones to pamper you. -- Don't hesitate to remind your friends and colleagues that you have a problem. To them, you look normal and healthy.  -- Learn to ignore housecleaning, errands, dishes, cooking -- these things are not important. And if someone dares to complain... – Ask for help. It seems like strong, active people are prone to this disease -- and strong, active people are not so good at asking for help. Learn to ask. -- Show your spouse and children how to help you with your coat, how to open doors for you, how to carry groceries, how to cook and clean... What a great opportunity to teach them new skills! –  Rearrange workspaces so that things are easier to reach. BBQ tongs are great for reaching. Use a stool. But be careful! With only one arm, your balance is impaired.  -- Get yourself a good one-handed haircut, something that doesn't require blow-drying or extra fuss. -- Consider buying a free-standing hairdryer stand, “as seen on TV”.  -- When dressing, always put the bad arm in its sleeve before the good arm. -- Forget the jeans, wear pull-ups or sweatpants. -- Find a bra that clips in the front. Or try this: put your bra on around your waist, back to front. Clip it with the clip in front of you, and then rotate the clip around to the back. Then slide the bra up, slip the arm straps up over your shoulders, and voila! Better yet, you may find a sports bra is easier to put on.

442,C4522181,Brachial Amyotrophic Diplegia,"C0231218, C0030193, C0683369","Malaise, Pain, Clouded consciousness",https://patient.info/forums/discuss/helpful-tips-28439,Helpful Tips,"Be patient. This is a LONG disease. Remember, adhesive capsulitis is a disease, not a syndrome or a condition; it has a beginning, middle and END. Wherever you are in the cycle, you're moving toward the END. –  Educate yourself! There's lots of information on the internet about adhesive capsulitis, and many different ideas and approaches. Read everything you can. --  Be aware that the medical community does not agree about the best way to treat FS. One doctor may say, \""Do nothing, it will get better on its own.\"" Another doctor might say, \""Let’s operate!\"" One doctor might say, \""Start physical therapy right away.\"" Another might say, \""PT won't help till you're in the thawing stage.\"" You must educate yourself to know what is truly the best approach for YOU.   If you don't like your doctor or your physical therapist, change! Find caregivers who know this disease. Not all of them do! Don't let ANYONE rush you into anything. You have time to decide what's best for you. –  Get painkillers. If one kind doesn't work, try another. Don’t give up. There’s no reason to be in a lot of pain. There are lots of different kinds of painkillers, so work with your doctor until you find one that works for you. Be assertive about your treatment choices. There are studies showing that FS eventually gets better no matter what you do or don't do, so make the choices yours. –   Slow down mentally and emotionally. Develop patience and serenity. Be kind to yourself. -- Slow down physically. Without the use of your arm, you don't have your usual physical balance, and you could get hurt if you try to maintain your usual pace. – Take lots of naps. Your whole body is ill, not just your shoulder.  Eat healthy food. Drink LOTS of water. Take vitamins.    Use cold packs and hot packs. They help. Frozen peas are great for icing -- you can thaw and refreeze them over and over. (Just don't get confused and eat them!)   Be sure you do your exercises, icing, and heat with the good shoulder as well as the bad -- it's getting an extra workout, and deserves to be pampered. -- But don't work your good shoulder TOO hard. Studies show that people who get FS in one shoulder are more likely to get it in the other shoulder later on.   Take baths -- long ones, as hot as you can stand. Immerse your shoulder. Play soothing music and light a scented candle. Use an inflatable bath pillow.  Sleep with lots of little pillows. Tuck them all around you. Experiment with the pillows till you find a comfortable arrangement. -- Have a favourite pillow. Tuck it under your arm when you sleep. Take it with you to the movies, or on car rides; use it to prop up your arm whenever you'll be sitting for a long time. -- Put a big pillow between yourself and your bedfellow so they don't roll over and bump into you. -- It's okay to sleep in the recliner for awhile.   -- Pamper yourself. Ask your loved ones to pamper you. -- Don't hesitate to remind your friends and colleagues that you have a problem. To them, you look normal and healthy.  -- Learn to ignore housecleaning, errands, dishes, cooking -- these things are not important. And if someone dares to complain... – Ask for help. It seems like strong, active people are prone to this disease -- and strong, active people are not so good at asking for help. Learn to ask. -- Show your spouse and children how to help you with your coat, how to open doors for you, how to carry groceries, how to cook and clean... What a great opportunity to teach them new skills! –  Rearrange workspaces so that things are easier to reach. BBQ tongs are great for reaching. Use a stool. But be careful! With only one arm, your balance is impaired.  -- Get yourself a good one-handed haircut, something that doesn't require blow-drying or extra fuss. -- Consider buying a free-standing hairdryer stand, “as seen on TV”.  -- When dressing, always put the bad arm in its sleeve before the good arm. -- Forget the jeans, wear pull-ups or sweatpants. -- Find a bra that clips in the front. Or try this: put your bra on around your waist, back to front. Clip it with the clip in front of you, and then rotate the clip around to the back. Then slide the bra up, slip the arm straps up over your shoulders, and voila! Better yet, you may find a sports bra is easier to put on. And if this still doesn’t work, or is too painful… -- No one will notice if you go without a bra. Camisoles are also great! -- For a bathing suit, a tankini is an excellent choice.   Having a hard time washing under your arms? Try holding a washcloth in plastic salad tongs. Tongs are also good for applying deodorant. Deodorant not working well? Try baby powder. -- After bathing, if you have trouble drying under your arm, use a blowdryer set on \""cool\"". -- Ladies, to shave under your arm, try the \""Finishing Touch\"" razor. It's battery operated and about the size of a ballpoint pen. It really gets into tight places! -- Use a wallet instead of a purse. Fanny packs are also great. -- Slip-on shoes make things easier. You can also try a long shoehorn. -- Get your medication in a flip-off lid.  Watch your posture during everyday activities. Slouching makes things worse. -- Stay active in other ways. Walking (if you can) is especially good. -- Try massage therapy. Lots of FS sufferers swear by it.   Remember that there will be good days and bad days, but eventually, slowly, it WILL get better.

After 5 days I couldn't go on, so agreed I would stop - then after a couple of weeks the pain hit - severe muscle cramps, pain in joints, leg pain, headaches, neck pain, and worst of all severe anxiety, some of this has cleared up but 5 months later I'm still suffering. I noticed there haven't been any posts on here for a while - is there anything happening in the uk to make people, Doctors etc more aware of this poison, are there any known legal actions against the makers by someone in the uk? It seems Cipro is prescribed as a first line drug for relatively minor problems when something else would be better - to be honest I would rather have put up with the original symtoms than go through this.

The doctor took x-rays which didn't show anything in the area but diagnosed based on the physical exam and symptoms.  There has been a clicking/popping between my 3rd and 4th toes on my right foot for the last 4 months and with a feeling of something like a small pebble in my shoe at times.  I run a couple of times/week and land on the front to mid of the foot. The doctor I saw said I can keep doing my activities that I am doing like running and if it gets worse, he offers steroid injections or surgery.  I have read about a couple of other therapies - alcohol injections, radio frequency and shockwave therapies which I think are all done with the goal of deadening the nerve. From some of the orthotics  websites, they suggest not running with Morton's Neuroma but I don't have any extra discomfort after running and don't want to give it up if I don't have to.  I am also wondering how successful surgery is?  If it has a high success rate, I will be more inclined to keep doing what I am doing,  with the confidence that it can be fixed if it gets worse.   I have appointments with 3 more doctors in the next few weeks to get more opinions. I have switched running shoes to Altra which have a nice wide toe box.

Their word cannot be used in court as the public's attorney would immediately call attention to these numbers (the sum totals of their investigations). How many of the college's rare rulings (against a doctor) are related to a sexual offense as opposed to quackery? The fact of the matter is if we applied pure math to the college's numbers it would be necessary to throw them all out. Recalling our last dicussion on collegian calculus we discovered the vast majority of of the college's rulings (against a doctor) were of a sexual nature and had little to do with the practice of medicine or public safety.  How could this be possible? These numbers represent an anomaly too large to ignore and as a result bring into question every decision the college ever made.  Why was the college's weak protocol ever substituted for the manufacturer recommendations for Cipro? Someone at the college suggested medicine is not an exact science but is that still valid when it is engineered to be so? Would it be difficult or confusing to direct blame of a malpractice if doctors follow this thin, engineered protocol rather than the CPS. Is this the real reason why somehow the college's protocol which relies on only a single vague possibility (empirical treatment for possible UTI) came to replace the CPS and has allowed great quantities of Cipro to be pumped compared to if the necessary safety protocols had to be followed? For instance the manufacturer advises susceptibility tests be performed (in a test tube, not the college's way). In addition if NGU is suspected, which is the leading cause of bladder infection in young adult males (possible UTI), then a concurrent regimen of doxycycline would be necessary to prevent risk of a superinfection which is an exponential   resulting in cell destruction and mutation. The reason being that any bacteria unsusceptible to Cipro is propogated exponentially as a mutated strain instead of being killed. So how does that translate to a human testsubject? If you consider the path of NGU (travels through the penis, then testicles then prostate), when Cipro is introduced the NGU is propogated exponentially creating a localized trauma (in your penis).  The results of this experiment can be seen in nature. Say you have a crossbow with a stored energy of 200 lbs. It has stirrups for your feet and your boots are too big. As you are pulling back the bolt to full draw, the stirrups slip off your toes and the knock is driven back into your penis with a concentrated force. A couple days later your penis may appear swollen but the next morning you awake to find your penis looking shriveled and deflated. This condition does not improve and when you see the doctor he tells you there is a 50/50 chance your penis could eventually grow back as it has sustained significant localized trauma. The similarity to a superinfection ends there as one is an unfortunate accident and the other is a deviant malpractice. In truth this could be accomplished with a single well placed blow with a 24 oz framing hammer which represents the blunt instrument that is the college's protocol.  The college would have you believe that the sheer sophistication of their doctors would completely make up for their primitive protocol but the only way to know if a bacteria is susceptible to Cipro is with a susceptibility test.  To believe this could be detected by the naked eye or by using some innate sixth sense or superior powers of reasoning and deduction is more evidence of the college's elitist counter culture. Obviously it is crucial our institutions are legitimate even if their word is no good in an actual court of law. The college's counter culture is too cynical, partisan, biased and incapable of empathy for the public if they can only see what is vaguely possible and not the actual truth. There is no point sitting back waiting for the rest of the civilized world to decide when empirical treatment with Cipro will be banned as this only lends to the illusion our institutions have not been complicit in these cruelly calculated experiments when they most certainly are. Supposedly this is a complicated issue but can no one recall "" What a tangled web we Weave "" or Pandora's box? That is where our governments store their Cipro.  At this juncture I am asking for a federal intervention in the form of a nation wide ban on empirical treatment with Cipro.  The practice of medicine is provincial jurisdiction but reporting the side effects of Cipro is federally mandated.  The college's elitist counter culture and their refusal to table the relevant warnings in the CPS or the German studies I submitted to both the college and the ministry of health in 2001/2002 , preclude them from being able to draw the necessary parallels to ascertain what the side effects of Cipro even are. That and the fact that their own experiment, where the outcome is already assumed, lacks the controls of a proper experiment and compromises the people's empirical data  . In the many letters I wrote to the college/ government in that time period I implored them to explain how this protocol could be adequate or even consistent with basic human rights. But in 16 years time I have received no answer.  There can be no meaningful discussion in Alberta or anywhere in Canada if our regional authorities have nothing to say because there is nobody capable of plugging the gaping hole in their feeble protocol (bluntest of instruments). Until empirical treatment with Cipro is banned, the public will continue to be at the mercy of the whims of the college's sophisticates who believe they can ascertain susceptibility to Cipro through visual examinations and superior instincts and reasoning.

I use the word fun loosely. Got offered a place this sumer 2018 on a Back Skills Training course, basically eight weeks with other people in constant pain and on painkillers to try and see a reduction in pain and painkillers. For me it has sort of worked through doing daily exercise and going through the pain I have come off the painkillers although I will have low level pain for life. The test will be the winter when i always usually ralpse because of less work and the damp I suspect. heyho we do what we can eh. 0 likes, 2 replies "

About 4 weeks ago I was given a course of penicillin after many visits to gp for a cold which was lasted over 5 weeks as it turned out.  I had a very red throat and most awful choking cough and lost my voice completely not good as I sing in a choir and it is back but not quite 100%.  After I finished the penicillin I had an upset digestive system like all antibiotics but also developed was I thought was an UTI (have had them before after colds).  I saw a doctor not my usual one but had seen him in the past. He thought thrush and prescribed for that ( I did not think it was however) I returned a week later when I got blood in urine and a sample was taken and sent to lab.  He said in the meantime I will prescribe antibiotics.  So far so good.  I collected the prescription and went home.  I was alarmed when I saw he had prescribed ciprofloxacin 500 2 a day for 7 days.  I would have been none the wiser except my husband had a really bad reaction to these some years ago.  Was burning hot itched and said he felt like he would explode fortunately the gp stopped the cipro and gave him antihistamine and he was soon better.  I took one tablet and whether or not it was just anxiety I started to feel a bit spaced out.  I went back in the afternoon  to ask the gp for advice he said it was just anxiety and not a reaction.  He said it was quite safe  and he himself had taken it and in all his years as a gp had only one person have a reaction.  I felt somewhat reassured but not completely happy.  I completed the course and did not really have any side effects except for some digestive discomfort which I would expect but no Diarrhoea.  After finishing the last tablet I returned to gp and he confirmed the sample was positive for an infection.  This was one week ago.  I have  had some trouble in the last week with digestive system to be expected as I have existing digestive problems but is settling down now. I thought my neck arthritis was flaring up as during the time I was ill I was doing a lot of laying around and no neck exercises which I usually do.  The pain was exactly the same.  Now I am feeling stressed waking really early (have had this before).  Rhinitis is flaring up but that could be to do with a change of medication.  I have odd itching sensations which last seconds and can be anywhere on the body.  My scalp is itchy and I have like tension headache and sinus facial pain, although the neck arthritis causes headaches and head pain.   Once again I have had all these in the past either as anxiety or separate problem.   I am so concerned that this might be the start of long term effects of this drug as I have read so many terrible experiences from patients who have taken cipro.   I have an appointment in 2 weeks with my usual gp and I am going to tell her that I never want to take them again.  What do you all think, could this be that start of problems related to this drug or just my normal symptoms.  I thankfully don't take nsaids and I am a steroid  responder so will not take these unless there is no alternative.  I understand these can make symptoms worse.

About 4 weeks ago I was given a course of penicillin after many visits to gp for a cold which was lasted over 5 weeks as it turned out.  I had a very red throat and most awful choking cough and lost my voice completely not good as I sing in a choir and it is back but not quite 100%.  After I finished the penicillin I had an upset digestive system like all antibiotics but also developed was I thought was an UTI (have had them before after colds).  I saw a doctor not my usual one but had seen him in the past. He thought thrush and prescribed for that ( I did not think it was however) I returned a week later when I got blood in urine and a sample was taken and sent to lab.  He said in the meantime I will prescribe antibiotics.  So far so good.  I collected the prescription and went home.  I was alarmed when I saw he had prescribed ciprofloxacin 500 2 a day for 7 days.  I would have been none the wiser except my husband had a really bad reaction to these some years ago.  Was burning hot itched and said he felt like he would explode fortunately the gp stopped the cipro and gave him antihistamine and he was soon better.  I took one tablet and whether or not it was just anxiety I started to feel a bit spaced out.  I went back in the afternoon  to ask the gp for advice he said it was just anxiety and not a reaction.  He said it was quite safe  and he himself had taken it and in all his years as a gp had only one person have a reaction.  I felt somewhat reassured but not completely happy.  I completed the course and did not really have any side effects except for some digestive discomfort which I would expect but no Diarrhoea.  After finishing the last tablet I returned to gp and he confirmed the sample was positive for an infection.  This was one week ago.  I have  had some trouble in the last week with digestive system to be expected as I have existing digestive problems but is settling down now. I thought my neck arthritis was flaring up as during the time I was ill I was doing a lot of laying around and no neck exercises which I usually do.  The pain was exactly the same.  Now I am feeling stressed waking really early (have had this before).  Rhinitis is flaring up but that could be to do with a change of medication.  I have odd itching sensations which last seconds and can be anywhere on the body.  My scalp is itchy and I have like tension headache and sinus facial pain, although the neck arthritis causes headaches and head pain.   Once again I have had all these in the past either as anxiety or separate problem.   I am so concerned that this might be the start of long term effects of this drug as I have read so many terrible experiences from patients who have taken cipro.   I have an appointment in 2 weeks with my usual gp and I am going to tell her that I never want to take them again.  What do you all think, could this be that start of problems related to this drug or just my normal symptoms.  I thankfully don't take nsaids and I am a steroid  responder so will not take these unless there is no alternative.  I understand these can make symptoms worse.

About 4 weeks ago I was given a course of penicillin after many visits to gp for a cold which was lasted over 5 weeks as it turned out.  I had a very red throat and most awful choking cough and lost my voice completely not good as I sing in a choir and it is back but not quite 100%.  After I finished the penicillin I had an upset digestive system like all antibiotics but also developed was I thought was an UTI (have had them before after colds).  I saw a doctor not my usual one but had seen him in the past. He thought thrush and prescribed for that ( I did not think it was however) I returned a week later when I got blood in urine and a sample was taken and sent to lab.  He said in the meantime I will prescribe antibiotics.  So far so good.  I collected the prescription and went home.  I was alarmed when I saw he had prescribed ciprofloxacin 500 2 a day for 7 days.  I would have been none the wiser except my husband had a really bad reaction to these some years ago.  Was burning hot itched and said he felt like he would explode fortunately the gp stopped the cipro and gave him antihistamine and he was soon better.  I took one tablet and whether or not it was just anxiety I started to feel a bit spaced out.  I went back in the afternoon  to ask the gp for advice he said it was just anxiety and not a reaction.  He said it was quite safe  and he himself had taken it and in all his years as a gp had only one person have a reaction.  I felt somewhat reassured but not completely happy.  I completed the course and did not really have any side effects except for some digestive discomfort which I would expect but no Diarrhoea.  After finishing the last tablet I returned to gp and he confirmed the sample was positive for an infection.  This was one week ago.  I have  had some trouble in the last week with digestive system to be expected as I have existing digestive problems but is settling down now. I thought my neck arthritis was flaring up as during the time I was ill I was doing a lot of laying around and no neck exercises which I usually do.  The pain was exactly the same.  Now I am feeling stressed waking really early (have had this before).  Rhinitis is flaring up but that could be to do with a change of medication.  I have odd itching sensations which last seconds and can be anywhere on the body.  My scalp is itchy and I have like tension headache and sinus facial pain, although the neck arthritis causes headaches and head pain.   Once again I have had all these in the past either as anxiety or separate problem.   I am so concerned that this might be the start of long term effects of this drug as I have read so many terrible experiences from patients who have taken cipro.

I've taken it before with success a few years ago. But that time I started on 20mg and then upped my dose. A week ago I was constipated and so took 2 senna tablets, they worked. Then that night I went to bed for 2 hours. I woke up and went to the toilet, as I stood up I felt really lightheaded and faint. I sat down, fainted, then vomited in the toilet. I thought it was perhaps dehydration from the laxative, so I drank lots of water and sports drinks, however even after well hydrating myself I haven't improved. Upon waking up (without even standing up) I feel extremely lightheaded, my vision get distorted and I feel nauseous, and have an urgency to go to the toilet. This has happened everyday since. I called a doctor to visit my place as I wasn't even well enough to go to the doctor or hospital. He was shocked and said ""you shouldn't be on 40mg, it's too much, especially that you're small"" (I'm 51kg) he said I had to reduce my dose to 20mg. So for the last 3 days I have taken 20mg. I still feel exactly the same, I'm really worried there's something seriously wrong with me, I've never experienced this in my life before. Although the timing makes sense for it to be the medication, I'm terrified I won't get better. I can't find anything online about fainting with fluoxetine. I've been off work for days now and I'm desperate to be back to normal. Does this sound like it could be the dose being too high? 0 likes, 4 replies "

I am on day 18 of Fluoxetine 20mg. Its not the first time I am taking this med, for many years I took it for my panic disorder and then for my OCD lately but stopped it last summer when i got married.. I was not taking meds regularly as prescribed and my OCD gotten worse in last two years. I decided to quit meds and start therapy which was obviously not a good idea. Last month my OCD became too much to handle so this time I was convinced I seriously need medication treatment. So my therapist and my psychiatrist agreed on Fluoxetine. As I said I am only on day 18. I had all the worst side effects until 2-3 days ago. Anxiety, increased ocd, racing heart, disrupted sleep, lack of appetite and diarrhea (i am taking .5 lorazepam twice a day to ease the anxiety and it works). Two days ago some started to improve like the diarrhea and appetite. Also for two days I felt good and even energized with a decrease on intrusive thoughts. But today I am again anxious and low, with heart   and restlesness, no sleep and my lovely OCD.  I know it still have time to kick in but with OCD I understand now it is much more difficult to handle these side effects. Because before I was able to handle these side effects more easily. I was wondering how other people with OCD progressed through fluoxetine and when did you see the real improvement? 0 likes, 2 replies "

The pain was very severe for a while.  I had to see a dr on an emergency basis and finally got an ice pack and crutches.  The crutches were horrible,  meaning I ended up hurting my other foot trying to use them.. That was 3 weeks ago but the pain persists. I was told 4-6 months for healing..is this is the case? Any tips other than just elevating and ice? I hesitate to get into medicines (I will discuss over the counter ones if you want) but I did use arnica cream because of a recommendation by the foot dr i went to recently  and it didn't really work.

After years of trying a variety of natural means for a cure, I finally got some concrete info regarding my scalp issues. I've had itchy, consistent cyst-like break outs for about 10 years. They're often painful,  puss-filled   and not a lot of fun as you can imagine. I also get random breakouts on my face and the occasional large puss-filled growth on my back. And my scalp itches constantly (no dandruff). I had a small chunk of scalp biopsied recently and the results were that I have 'non-infectious folliculitis'. My breakouts aren't caused by bacteria or a virus or fungus, according to the dermatologist. It's simply follicle 'inflammation', but with no direct cause that I can pinpoint. Quite infuriating.

I've been diagnosed with folliculitis, it's been an ongoing problem for me for many years. My legs are most affected by it and I'm struggling to find a suitable hair removal method that will help. When at its worst my legs are covered in blister like spots that are red, swollen and can even weep watery liquid. I've had   but it wasn't as affective as I'd have hoped. I've tried waxing and that's not worked either and I know that shaving is a no no. I was hoping someone could help or give advice on the best hair removal method I could use, one that minimises the regrowth cycle, at least slowing it down so hair removal isn't needed as often. I hope someone can help. Thanks. Emma. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Here's what I did,"I am officially thawing! I don't want to jinx this because I have a real fear my hips freeze one day (I've had some minor hip discomfort lately but that could just be because I go on daily walks and I just tweaked something), but my shoulders are thawing. I see light at the end of the tunnel finally. Little background: in my 33rd year on this planet, my left shoulder became symptomatic on June 6th, 2016 (I keep a journal so I know the exact day this started) and has been in pain until about only 10-14 days ago. It's been thawing maybe for the last three months or so at least, but the thawing phase has been painful for me. They said it wouldn't be painful at this point in the process, but the ""experts"" are obviously clueless about this disease. The thawing phase has been painful for me. As I said, the pain first started to go away in the left shoulder only about 10-14 days ago. I suddenly have some mobility again too, but not much: no external rotation still and I can't come close to lifting my arm above my head, but at least the shoulder ""folds inward"" now when I raise the arm. For a very long time (two years or so), the upper part of the shoulder did not fold inward when I attempted to raise my arm. The entire thing would simply move as one. My right shoulder became symptomatic in early December 2017 and has began thawing in just the last one or two days, but is still mildly painful. It is clearly ""folding inward"" as well when I attempt to raise my arm up though, so that's a clear sign to me it's also thawing. I wish I knew the exact medical term for what I'm trying to describe. The right shoulder also has zero external rotation, but has more overall mobility than the left shoulder (probably because I realized with the second frozen shoulder to not listen to my doctors). The treatments I've done: The first series of shoulder doctors I saw all insisted on intense physical therapy, so that's what I did for months from around March thru August of 2017. I did a short round of prednisone too during that time. The most aggressive procedure I had done was in June of 2017 when I had two PRP injections into the left shoulder: one into the bursa and one directly into the capsule itself. The executive summary of all these things is that they made everything significantly worse and if I had to do it over, I wouldn't have done any of this. These doctors were and are absolutely clueless about how to treat adhesive capsulitis. Prednisone didn't have any negative side effects, but it was totally ineffective for me I think. It was during this period where my left shoulder felt horrific every day. I describe the feeling as ""rotting from the inside out."" It was a very scary feeling. It felt like my arm would fall off every single day, and this intense pain lasted over a year. On December 23rd, 2017, when my right shoulder was just in the beginning stages of freezing, was the day I realized that this is a disease and not an injury. I had read many blogs that said people realize after a while to do nothing, so on this day (according to my journal) I decided once for all to stop messing with it. On December 23rd, 2017, I decided I would officially ""do nothing"" and let the disease run its course. My doctors looked at me like I was an idiot. They treated me with disrespect. Numerous people in my life tried to pressure me into surgery and/or physical therapy, but I blocked them all out. At that point, I knew my best option had to be to ""do nothing."" I had to do what I had to do. Period. Today is November 17th, 2018, and the pain in the left (first) frozen shoulder has finally gone. As I said, it's been thawing for several months already, but the thawing phase has been painful; not as painful as previous stages, but still painful, especially when ""testing"" it out. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be rehabbing it when it started thawing too, but I ended up choosing to continue to do nothing. I think that was the right choice, but I have no idea. Keep in mind, a lot of what I'm reporting here is just my anecdotal experience. The second frozen shoulder was still painful but not nearly as bad as the first. Why that is the case is anyone's guess, but here's what I did for the second one: I never once did any physical therapy for it. I did do a round of prednisone for six days early in the freezing stage, so maybe that helped, but at the time, I felt it was useless. Other than that, I just iced it when it hurt a lot or took a pain killer. I only took pain killers maybe once or twice a week to avoid dependence. It's a little short of a year since the right shoulder started to freeze, so clearly it's been much milder. The first frozen shoulder has taken 2.5 years to reach the same point. The second shoulder was still very, very painful and brutal but it never reached the extreme heights of pain or chronic length of the first one. Starting in April of 2017 or so I began taking regular vitamins: a daily multi, magnesium, omega-3, vitamin D, and vitamin K. I did take MSM maybe once or twice a week. I tried glucosamine and chondroitin as well, but for maybe only two or three months before giving it up. I've been taking flaxseed oil with omega-3 pills over the last month or so. I've also drank occasional tumeric shots over the last month or so. Oh yea, I took aleve sometimes over the course of the last 2.5 years too. I'm not sure if that helped it heal, but it would reduce my pain sometimes. I tried to eat healthy foods during the last 2.5 years, but I often just comfort ate bad food because that helped me psychologically. I gained 30 pounds in the last 2.5 years, so I comfort ate a lot and sat in a comfortable chair using my computer for many, many hours. For a long time, even just walking around was painful on my shoulder(s). Even in the last two-three months during my regular walks, there would be pain, but I could tolerate it. I knew it was just a symptom of the disease, so at this point, I just continued my walks. As soon as the walk ended, the pain would subside and go away within fifteen minutes. The only reason I would ""push through"" in this situation is because I came to the conclusion a few months ago that this type of pain wasn't making anything worse. I felt the benefits from walking and getting some sun outweighed the mild pain I would get while walking. I've since been able to lose 11 pounds in the last two months, so that's good. Anyway, I have still very limited mobility in both shoulders. Hopefully they keep thawing. I have no idea what the next few years will bring with this and how much mobility I'll ultimately regain. But there is some hope now. I have no idea if the things I did made this better or worse. It's possible that we all have varying severities of the disease and that our genetic makeup largely determines the length of the illness. I really don't know. But this is what I did and am continuing to do. I'll continue with my regimen of vitamins and (mostly) healthy eating. I enjoy going on daily walks so I'll continue that as well. And whenever I feel ready for it, I'll get back into the gym and gradually start rebuilding my upper body which has atrophied quite a bit. Thanks for reading, guys.

Here's what I did,"I am officially thawing! I don't want to jinx this because I have a real fear my hips freeze one day (I've had some minor hip discomfort lately but that could just be because I go on daily walks and I just tweaked something), but my shoulders are thawing. I see light at the end of the tunnel finally. Little background: in my 33rd year on this planet, my left shoulder became symptomatic on June 6th, 2016 (I keep a journal so I know the exact day this started) and has been in pain until about only 10-14 days ago. It's been thawing maybe for the last three months or so at least, but the thawing phase has been painful for me. They said it wouldn't be painful at this point in the process, but the ""experts"" are obviously clueless about this disease. The thawing phase has been painful for me. As I said, the pain first started to go away in the left shoulder only about 10-14 days ago. I suddenly have some mobility again too, but not much: no external rotation still and I can't come close to lifting my arm above my head, but at least the shoulder ""folds inward"" now when I raise the arm. For a very long time (two years or so), the upper part of the shoulder did not fold inward when I attempted to raise my arm. The entire thing would simply move as one. My right shoulder became symptomatic in early December 2017 and has began thawing in just the last one or two days, but is still mildly painful. It is clearly ""folding inward"" as well when I attempt to raise my arm up though, so that's a clear sign to me it's also thawing. I wish I knew the exact medical term for what I'm trying to describe. The right shoulder also has zero external rotation, but has more overall mobility than the left shoulder (probably because I realized with the second frozen shoulder to not listen to my doctors). The treatments I've done: The first series of shoulder doctors I saw all insisted on intense physical therapy, so that's what I did for months from around March thru August of 2017. I did a short round of prednisone too during that time. The most aggressive procedure I had done was in June of 2017 when I had two PRP injections into the left shoulder: one into the bursa and one directly into the capsule itself. The executive summary of all these things is that they made everything significantly worse and if I had to do it over, I wouldn't have done any of this. These doctors were and are absolutely clueless about how to treat adhesive capsulitis. Prednisone didn't have any negative side effects, but it was totally ineffective for me I think. It was during this period where my left shoulder felt horrific every day. I describe the feeling as ""rotting from the inside out."" It was a very scary feeling. It felt like my arm would fall off every single day, and this intense pain lasted over a year. On December 23rd, 2017, when my right shoulder was just in the beginning stages of freezing, was the day I realized that this is a disease and not an injury. I had read many blogs that said people realize after a while to do nothing, so on this day (according to my journal) I decided once for all to stop messing with it. On December 23rd, 2017, I decided I would officially ""do nothing"" and let the disease run its course. My doctors looked at me like I was an idiot. They treated me with disrespect. Numerous people in my life tried to pressure me into surgery and/or physical therapy, but I blocked them all out. At that point, I knew my best option had to be to ""do nothing."" I had to do what I had to do. Period. Today is November 17th, 2018, and the pain in the left (first) frozen shoulder has finally gone. As I said, it's been thawing for several months already, but the thawing phase has been painful; not as painful as previous stages, but still painful, especially when ""testing"" it out. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be rehabbing it when it started thawing too, but I ended up choosing to continue to do nothing. I think that was the right choice, but I have no idea. Keep in mind, a lot of what I'm reporting here is just my anecdotal experience. The second frozen shoulder was still painful but not nearly as bad as the first. Why that is the case is anyone's guess, but here's what I did for the second one: I never once did any physical therapy for it. I did do a round of prednisone for six days early in the freezing stage, so maybe that helped, but at the time, I felt it was useless. Other than that, I just iced it when it hurt a lot or took a pain killer. I only took pain killers maybe once or twice a week to avoid dependence. It's a little short of a year since the right shoulder started to freeze, so clearly it's been much milder. The first frozen shoulder has taken 2.5 years to reach the same point. The second shoulder was still very, very painful and brutal but it never reached the extreme heights of pain or chronic length of the first one. Starting in April of 2017 or so I began taking regular vitamins: a daily multi, magnesium, omega-3, vitamin D, and vitamin K. I did take MSM maybe once or twice a week. I tried glucosamine and chondroitin as well, but for maybe only two or three months before giving it up. I've been taking flaxseed oil with omega-3 pills over the last month or so. I've also drank occasional tumeric shots over the last month or so. Oh yea, I took aleve sometimes over the course of the last 2.5 years too. I'm not sure if that helped it heal, but it would reduce my pain sometimes. I tried to eat healthy foods during the last 2.5 years, but I often just comfort ate bad food because that helped me psychologically. I gained 30 pounds in the last 2.5 years, so I comfort ate a lot and sat in a comfortable chair using my computer for many, many hours. For a long time, even just walking around was painful on my shoulder(s). Even in the last two-three months during my regular walks, there would be pain, but I could tolerate it. I knew it was just a symptom of the disease, so at this point, I just continued my walks. As soon as the walk ended, the pain would subside and go away within fifteen minutes. The only reason I would ""push through"" in this situation is because I came to the conclusion a few months ago that this type of pain wasn't making anything worse. I felt the benefits from walking and getting some sun outweighed the mild pain I would get while walking. I've since been able to lose 11 pounds in the last two months, so that's good. Anyway, I have still very limited mobility in both shoulders. Hopefully they keep thawing. I have no idea what the next few years will bring with this and how much mobility I'll ultimately regain. But there is some hope now. I have no idea if the things I did made this better or worse. It's possible that we all have varying severities of the disease and that our genetic makeup largely determines the length of the illness. I really don't know. But this is what I did and am continuing to do. I'll continue with my regimen of vitamins and (mostly) healthy eating. I enjoy going on daily walks so I'll continue that as well. And whenever I feel ready for it, I'll get back into the gym and gradually start rebuilding my upper body which has atrophied quite a bit. Thanks for reading, guys.

Other than that, I just iced it when it hurt a lot or took a pain killer. I only took pain killers maybe once or twice a week to avoid dependence. It's a little short of a year since the right shoulder started to freeze, so clearly it's been much milder. The first frozen shoulder has taken 2.5 years to reach the same point. The second shoulder was still very, very painful and brutal but it never reached the extreme heights of pain or chronic length of the first one. Starting in April of 2017 or so I began taking regular vitamins: a daily multi, magnesium, omega-3, vitamin D, and vitamin K. I did take MSM maybe once or twice a week. I tried glucosamine and chondroitin as well, but for maybe only two or three months before giving it up. I've been taking flaxseed oil with omega-3 pills over the last month or so. I've also drank occasional tumeric shots over the last month or so. Oh yea, I took aleve sometimes over the course of the last 2.5 years too. I'm not sure if that helped it heal, but it would reduce my pain sometimes. I tried to eat healthy foods during the last 2.5 years, but I often just comfort ate bad food because that helped me psychologically. I gained 30 pounds in the last 2.5 years, so I comfort ate a lot and sat in a comfortable chair using my computer for many, many hours. For a long time, even just walking around was painful on my shoulder(s). Even in the last two-three months during my regular walks, there would be pain, but I could tolerate it. I knew it was just a symptom of the disease, so at this point, I just continued my walks. As soon as the walk ended, the pain would subside and go away within fifteen minutes. The only reason I would ""push through"" in this situation is because I came to the conclusion a few months ago that this type of pain wasn't making anything worse. I felt the benefits from walking and getting some sun outweighed the mild pain I would get while walking. I've since been able to lose 11 pounds in the last two months, so that's good. Anyway, I have still very limited mobility in both shoulders. Hopefully they keep thawing. I have no idea what the next few years will bring with this and how much mobility I'll ultimately regain. But there is some hope now. I have no idea if the things I did made this better or worse. It's possible that we all have varying severities of the disease and that our genetic makeup largely determines the length of the illness. I really don't know. But this is what I did and am continuing to do. I'll continue with my regimen of vitamins and (mostly) healthy eating. I enjoy going on daily walks so I'll continue that as well. And whenever I feel ready for it, I'll get back into the gym and gradually start rebuilding my upper body which has atrophied quite a bit. Thanks for reading, guys. I will follow up this post with updates at some point. As I said, the right shoulder is still painful, but it's very very tolerable pain. It's nothing I can't handle at this point as I'm obviously used to much, much worse. There is hope. You can't see it now, but there is hope. Please hold on to it. Don't let it go. Please don't let it go. I'm with you in spirit, wherever you are. A lot of us are. PS- A small note on what I mean when I say ""doing nothing."" I let my arms swing when I go on walks. I was able to still carry grocery bags, but that type of action doesn't require any shoulder mobility. I did stuff like that, but I wouldn't move it all around or stretch it ever. If walking was too painful, I would just sit down and start icing it for twenty minutes to help it calm down. During the most painful stretches of the disease, I did as little as I possibly could. I've probably watched every good movie and TV show ever made in the last 2.5 years to the point where I ran out of decent entertainment a few months ago. I read so many books.

As I said, the pain first started to go away in the left shoulder only about 10-14 days ago. I suddenly have some mobility again too, but not much: no external rotation still and I can't come close to lifting my arm above my head, but at least the shoulder ""folds inward"" now when I raise the arm. For a very long time (two years or so), the upper part of the shoulder did not fold inward when I attempted to raise my arm. The entire thing would simply move as one. My right shoulder became symptomatic in early December 2017 and has began thawing in just the last one or two days, but is still mildly painful.

I wish I knew the exact medical term for what I'm trying to describe. The right shoulder also has zero external rotation, but has more overall mobility than the left shoulder (probably because I realized with the second frozen shoulder to not listen to my doctors). The treatments I've done: The first series of shoulder doctors I saw all insisted on intense physical therapy, so that's what I did for months from around March thru August of 2017. I did a short round of prednisone too during that time. The most aggressive procedure I had done was in June of 2017 when I had two PRP injections into the left shoulder: one into the bursa and one directly into the capsule itself. The executive summary of all these things is that they made everything significantly worse and if I had to do it over, I wouldn't have done any of this. These doctors were and are absolutely clueless about how to treat adhesive capsulitis. Prednisone didn't have any negative side effects, but it was totally ineffective for me I think. It was during this period where my left shoulder felt horrific every day. I describe the feeling as ""rotting from the inside out."" It was a very scary feeling. It felt like my arm would fall off every single day, and this intense pain lasted over a year. On December 23rd, 2017, when my right shoulder was just in the beginning stages of freezing, was the day I realized that this is a disease and not an injury. I had read many blogs that said people realize after a while to do nothing, so on this day (according to my journal) I decided once for all to stop messing with it. On December 23rd, 2017, I decided I would officially ""do nothing"" and let the disease run its course. My doctors looked at me like I was an idiot. They treated me with disrespect.

This is my first post on these forums. There seems to be much controversy as to whether PT works for frozen shoulder and if so, during which phases. This should come as no surprise to those of us suffering from this plague given the medical community overall, in my humble opinion, is clueless regarding just about everything related to this disease. Same applies to lower back and other musculoskeletal issues. For example, you may have noticed that the description of the 3 FS phases repeats itself verbatim from website to website - a classic example of content being stolen, borrowed, and recycled. Any errors and inaccuracies are thus perpetuated throughout the web - possibly forever and certainly to the detriment of sufferers. Having said that there are a few reputable sites (Harvard Medical, Mayo Clinic) and clinical papers that do support the role of PT in this horrible disease. Ok more to the point. Hopefully others can share there experiences to date so they might help fellow sufferers, focusing on the positive rather than the dramatic, and avoiding platitudes like ""be patient, it will get better"". Before we go, what exactly is PT?  Hearing another patient saying they did PT is unfortunately useless because it is not one exercise or one approach. In fact, during the last 7 months I have discovered and cataloged (i created my own resource library) over 300 different exercises for impingement and/or frozen shoulder. These can all be put in categories such as range of motion (ROM, itself broken down in active and passive), misc stretching, and strengthening etc. They can be further supported and varied by the use of equipment: therabands, towels, pulleys, yoga belts, canes/poles, dumbbells, braces, etc. There is also evidence that brachiation/hanging from bars can be helpful (Dr. Kirsch), if we consider this as PT. Here are three general and one specific things I've found along this journey. 2:  Try different exercises There is no one size fits all here. If those prescribed don't work, try something else as long as they don't cause significant pain. As mentioned above you can find hundreds of distinct and/or variations of exercises. 3:  Gauge your progress There is a saying, there is no progress without measurement. The only way you can tell if something is working is by measurement. This can be height reached lifting shoulder, increasing angle or ROM, or pain. I use marks on the wall to see my progress with ROM. For example, I woke up exhausted and with severe pain (like most of you I""m sure). I was about to get some ice packs when i tried something else instead. First I did a wall walk and noticed my ROM was less than day before. So I did pendulums, passive, with a 3 lb weight for about a minute. Repeating the wall walk resulted in less pain and increased ROM. It was that simple, not a miracle, but evidence pendulum had indeed helped. Would love to hear from others what actually works for them realizing our conditions are different. I don't believe you can do a damaging exercise for a very simple reason. Anyone here with FS knows clearly that if they do the wrong exercise they will swiftly be reminded by pain which can be off the scale. Please don't share your failures, let's focus on success here and specific exercises. In particular would love to hear from anyone with success regarding be able to move your hand behind your back (internal rotation). This is where many of us have the least ROM and the most pain. 1 like, 5 replies "

Here's what I did.,"First off, I want to console you poor souls who are still in the grips of agony.   It gets better. I am a research scientist by profession, so when I got my first out-of-the-blue Frozen Shoulder (left shoulder) at age 47, I dived into the research.  I read frozen shoulder blogs, learned about the newest treatments (Xiaflex), performed my exercises, joined this forum, pulled research papers, went to Physical Therapy, watched videos and did everything I could do to make the pain stop.   And during that time, I lost range of motion, lost months of sleep, and, many times I lost hope.  After about a year of agony, PT, a cortisone shot and a new appreciation for folks in chronic pain, I sloooooowly got better.  And eventually regained all of my ROM back.  Yay! But I'm a scientist, remember?  I took notes.  The research states that for women who get idiopathic (""out of the blue"") FS, we have a 20-50 percent chance of getting it in the other shoulder.    😦 Knowing that there are conflicting approaches to treatment (""PT all the way!"" vs ""Leave it alone!""), I thought that if I ever got it again, I'd try a different approach and document those results too. Four years later, after weeks of denial, I got it in the other (right shoulder).  Oh, rapture. This time, no PT.  Cortisone shot early in the process.  Another cortisone shot 3 months later.  Many soft/gentle massages.  No stretching during initial freezing or frozen stage. And, here are my results: In a nutshell:     Both shoulders locked up (""Frozen"" blue line) and recovered at about the same rate whether I did the exercises or not! But the pain (""Pain"" red line) was A LOT less the second time around. Perhaps it was the early cortisone shot, or perhaps it was the ""leave it alone"" approach.   All I can say is that, FOR ME, the exercises didn't seem to change the outcome much, but the cortisone shots really helped with the pain. So, what does this mean for you? Read as much as you can and find what has worked for others and apply it to your situation.  Idiopathic FS, like mine, is very different from injury-induced FS, and those often require some of the more aggressive treatments (like MUA or surgery).   I attribute my sanity to the honest folks on this forum who shared their successes and misses.   There are ages of real home-tested tricks that work. (The best being Frosty's helpful hints - do a search for that thread). Take comfort that most contributors come and go -- because they got better! Chances are you will too.  But until then, soldier on and find the gems in the group wisdom.   (And, I apologize for the weird formatting!! This thing messes it all up!) 4 likes, 24 replies "

I had my Hydrodilatation this afternoon - 14th December.  A few hours on and I'm feeling fine.  I was very nervous but the procedure itself went well and took 15-20 minutes in total.  I'd worn a vest top, which meant I didn't need to wear a gown and just dropped my straps off my bad shoulder.  I was asked to lie on my front, with a pillow for support.  I'd thought the procedure was done via x-ray guidance but it was in fact ultrasound guided.  The doctor explained what was about to happen and did an initial scan of my shoulder area before giving me a local anaesthetic.  He then put in the needle for the hydrodilatation, which administered first some cortisone and then saline.  He said I might feel some pushing and to let him know if it became painful.  There was some discomfort but I wouldn't describe it as painful and within a few minutes, he said the saline had started to leak out of the joint and the procedure was over.  He did another scan and checked my movement before and after - there was perhaps a couple of degrees improvement but nothing drastic.  I left the hospital with a plaster on my shoulder and feeling fine.  He said I might experience a bit of aching once the local anaesthetic wears off but the cortisone should kick in within a day or two and should improve things pain-wise. Physiotherapy is recommended within a few days of the procedure and I have an appointment with the physio on Friday morning and another to see the consultant again in about 6 weeks.  So far, so good but it remains to be seen how sucessful it has been in improving pain and getting my movement back.  I can currently lift my arm about 90 degrees in front, slightly less at the side and very little behind my back. I will document my progress over the next few days and weeks, for anyone else considering this treatment.  Hope this information is of help to someone and fingers crossed that the procedure works for me! 6 likes, 206 replies "

The first symptom was about 14 days or so after sex with a new partner. 14 days after my penis had a burning sensation. Got tested and everything was fine. (Tested @ 30 days/60 days/90 days) About 60 days in or so I tried about 1.5 weeks of 1% Clotrimazole cream which seemed to help. Burning feeling went away. At about day 70 my heart randomly racing and going to town for no reason. Sometimes it wakes me up at night. I went to the doctor, had an ultra sound and an MRI. Everything seems to check out fine. I am now at day ~160 I have had a constant sore throat for 3 months. I have a slight fungi something on my tongue but nothing the docs are actively concerned about when they look in my mouth. I have a random burning feeling on the left outside side of my mouth. About 1cm from where the top and bottom lips meet. This can last 5 minutes to hours. There is visually nothing wrong. I am also having ravings for candy or something sugary. I now noticed my penis is very shiny when erect and kind of sparkly and far more wrinkly than normal when not hard. There is no burning pain in the penis gland however. I dont feel stressed or worried about anything either.... I am more annoyed at this point that I can't seem to find an answer but oddly enough, started right after a new sex partner and all the STD tests come back clean. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Thanks for this forum...I know what has happened and am horrified that it might take me several months to recover... I usually stay  well away from medications but I was worried that  a ringworm infection was not improving with the cream I was given and  would spread so took what the doc gave me. Took the Terbinafine for about 3 weeks and had 4 to go when out of the blue this happened. As soon as I realized it could be medication I stopped taking it. I am 60.. a little plump (I love all kinds of food and am a vegan and my hubby is a wonderful cook) but otherwise very healthy. It is shocking and very upsetting to think this might go on for several months...The only good thing is I will probably loose weight because I almost dread eating... I am stunned the doc did not warn me and am heading back to demand some help.... Does Zinc work or does it have side effects also? Like other posters I  took my taste buds for granted and the thought of never being able to taste food or ending up with a bitter aftertaste is depressing to say the least.....

I need some help, I'm currently freaking out. I am a 17 year old minor and I have recently become sexually active with my boyfriend. He is my first. He has no visible STI's in/on his mouth and penis. I am on birth control and we don't use condoms as we don't have access to them during this COVID-19 pandemic. I don't get extremely wet before we start intercourse, we also have never used lubricant, and we always have really rough sex, which probably isn't a great mix. Him and I go 2-4 rounds every time I see him which is usually 2x a week (since we are extremely horny teens) After the first few times we had sex, I got a yeast infection, which was pretty painful - but I've had one before so I knew what it was instantly. When I get yeast infections, I get this peeling effect all over my labia, which leaves it raw. I had sex with him while it was healing, which wasn't a good idea. The yeast infection went away and I thought I was all in the clear. On Wednesday (4/1/2020) we had sex around 4 times, the pain progressively got worse to the point where he couldn't even put his penis inside. It stung and burned. The next day, I felt some really bad stinging as I was peeing and moving around. I did a self-exam and found these open sores on one side of the opening of my vagina. I instantly ran to webMD and started deep diving into STDs and STIs. I was terrified when I saw   because it kind of resembled my sores. I started to panic and confided in my best friends older sister, she said to me that it is probably extremely irritated from the constant sex, no lube, and the unhealed yeast infection. I agreed and I began to put neosporin and fragrance-free baby petroleum jelly on the sores with cotton swabs, I never touched the sores with my fingers.

I've been using Neosporin/Vaseline on the sores for 2 days and I will reapply them once every 2-3 hours or so, or just when it begins to get uncomfortable. When I reapply, before and after, I just check around, I can't tell if they're getting better or not, it's not as red looking and not as swollen but still hurts. My labia itself looks rough due to the constant lubrication.

I need some help, I'm currently freaking out. I am a 17 year old minor and I have recently become sexually active with my boyfriend. He is my first. He has no visible STI's in/on his mouth and penis. I am on birth control and we don't use condoms as we don't have access to them during this COVID-19 pandemic. I don't get extremely wet before we start intercourse, we also have never used lubricant, and we always have really rough sex, which probably isn't a great mix. Him and I go 2-4 rounds every time I see him which is usually 2x a week (since we are extremely horny teens) After the first few times we had sex, I got a yeast infection, which was pretty painful - but I've had one before so I knew what it was instantly. When I get yeast infections, I get this peeling effect all over my labia, which leaves it raw. I had sex with him while it was healing, which wasn't a good idea. The yeast infection went away and I thought I was all in the clear. On Wednesday (4/1/2020) we had sex around 4 times, the pain progressively got worse to the point where he couldn't even put his penis inside. It stung and burned. The next day, I felt some really bad stinging as I was peeing and moving around. I did a self-exam and found these open sores on one side of the opening of my vagina. I instantly ran to webMD and started deep diving into STDs and STIs. I was terrified when I saw   because it kind of resembled my sores. I started to panic and confided in my best friends older sister, she said to me that it is probably extremely irritated from the constant sex, no lube, and the unhealed yeast infection. I agreed and I began to put neosporin and fragrance-free baby petroleum jelly on the sores with cotton swabs, I never touched the sores with my fingers.

But my main symptoms are intense burning in arms and legs (mostly thighs) when laying down. If i fall asleep on the couch it doesnt happen or when i first go to bed ill be fine..the burning usually happens later on like after getting up in the middleof  the night..I also have very visible veins in the arms and legs as well. It seems like the veins show up where it hurts. Theyre especially prominent on my feet...my hands and feet will also hurt either when laying down or during the day...And i noticed my feet have higher arches now, it looks like the skin at the arch is thinning and i see a lot of veins there and even my fingers and toes have veins that werent visible before. Every morning my legs look purplish and has a mottled look to it but that eventually subsides, its mostly on the thighs...a couple months ago this all started with pain in only the hands and feet and then progressed to this...is this simmilar to fm?? 0 likes, 49 replies "

New symptom now - Dry mouth, low saliva.","Hi all. Hope this finds you well. Up till now I have been doing some posting to the Sjögrens Syndrome community. However turns out I did not get that diagnosis. Very recently I had testing for that. Blood test and then the lip biopsy. Both turned out negative. I am male, age 44. I was diagnosed with fibro about 20 years ago. I have however had many good years since then. 2 years ago i started crossfit even. Was in the best shape of my life. Then this summer in July i began to get a dry sore tongue. Had never ever had anything like this. Mouth dryness became worse and worse. Now its to the point where I have got my first dose of Salagen to start creating saliva. Talking has been difficult unless I have gum or something to moisten my mouth. Saliva is clearly much much less. Has been extremely hard mentally and physically. I would like to know how many of you may deal with something similar. What scares me is that this has just gotten worse and almost 4 months. Which makes me think this is no flare. Usually they come and go with any other symptom I have had. This is different. Never had a symptom like this before but reading on the net I see that there does seem to be people out there with fibro who suffer from dry mouth. I guess I keep praying that this is only temporary but the fact that it has been going on for this amount of time really freaks me out. Originally i had thought maybe it was down to stress. Sore mouth, sore tongue, dry sore lips, dry throat at times and bit of burning in my nasal passages. Does this resonate with anyone on here. Have you been through something similar? Thank you very much for your any comments. 0 likes, 4 replies "

Lately however, I have had pain in my right shoulder and left elbow that seem to be very prolonged and almost constant. The pain in my right shoulder is an achy, pulled muscle type pain that hurts more when I move and has been going on for a couple of weeks now. The pain in my left elbow is similar to the shoulder pain although it generally has a sharper feel to it and has been gong on a lot longer, probably a couple of months. The pains aren't crippling and are manageable, they are just there and cause quite a bit of discomfort. On top of this I do feel like my generally health as declined somewhat and I just don't feel as well as I normally do, especially my digestive system. All my vital signs look good and I know my doctor will say that this is all part of Fibromyalgia, but I was just wondering if any fellow Fibromyalgia sufferers experience similar to what I am going through at the moment. I would be grateful for any comments, and hearing any of your experiences of Fibromyalgia. Many thanks in advance. 0 likes, 5 replies "

I was prescribed a 15mg, every 72 hour patch for Lupus pain, which steadily was increased to 150 mg, every 48 hours in 5 months. The pain was never really in control, but my Dr was afraid of Percocet, so gave me Fentanyl, without knowing anything about it. Very gradually, I became deathly illl. I lost 50 pounds, had very low bp, began fainting, became paranoid, was unable to work or drive and nearly ended my incredible 36 year marriage. Saw 6 different specialists. All blamed Lupus, none blamed the Fentanyl. My husband did research and found Fentanyl could be the cause. He took me to a pain clinic to get help detoxing, since the prescribing Dr didn't know how! The pain clinic treated me like a street addict and tried to cut my dosage WAY too fast, without help from other medications. I became so despondent, that I tried to quit cold turkey (from 125 mg!) and almost died on the way to the ER. They replaced the patch and sent me back to the prescribing Dr., I then tried another pain clinic. WHAT a difference! They devised a 4 month step down plan, giving me Percocet 10/325, 4 per day, the rationale being that it is much safer and easier to get off the Percocet, eventually. I had only mild discomfort for a couple of days each time I would step down off the patch. In 4 months, I was Fentanyl free and NEVER had a desire for it. It's now a year later. I do still take the Percocet and my pain is in control. My bp, weight are healthy. No more fainting. No more paranoia. Great marriage again. Seeking employment. Keep seeking help. Tell someone you trust that you need help. I am still quite upset with the Dr who first put me on it, who assured me of its safety.

I first made the mistake of moving from CA to WA to take care of my mom, but luckily I quickly found a wonderful doctor in WA to continue my medication therapies. During this last late July and early August I slowly moved to TX because my daughter got into college here and it's been the worst experience of my life. 10+ doctors, over $2500 out of pocket expenses and more coming due to ER visits and nobody wants anything to do with me. So no tapering down, no medical detox, no possibility of even assisting therapy such as clonodine. I went from at least 75mcg with added breakthrough meds to absolutely nothing (they won't even continue the Estrogen I have taken since my complete hysterectomy in 2012 so let's add hormone imbalance along with cold turkey detox, yay). The withdrawals are absolutely feeling like if it doesn't kill me I might like it to just to end this hell. On top of the typical withdrawal hell and miserable pain that I know won't go away much after the withdrawal because I've done this before, only medically controlled, I've been having seizures along with times where it feels like my brain is stroking off and I can't move or speak or control my breathing. I'm so broke that I've had to deny 911 and ER visits now (like when I publicly collapsed with another seizure in Kroger's), and since I have no history of epilepsy I'm terrified they'll take my drivers license away and also terrified if I drive I could have another episode and hurt someone or myself or worse.  I've been working through my old CBT pain therapy workbooks on my own as well as meditating as often as I can but I still feel like nothing is helping. I have never felt so helpless and scared in my life. I know my brain is stuck in fight or flight mode because of the chemistry changes but I can't stand the idea that this could last for years in addition to the constant state of pain.

I'll try to be brief. I'm a 52 year old female. Fit, active. Never have been addicted to anything I guess until now, I'm sad to say.  Severe   in early 2000 resulted in a failed cervical fusion in 2009. And that resulted in increased pain as my hardware shifted and my spinal cord Is being compressed. I'm in a rural area in WV, known for opioid/drug abuse and a high number of drug-related deaths. If was accepted into a pain clinic not far from my home. I began a series of injections, dry needling, ablation, physical therapy, yoga... You know the drill. Ended up on Percocet for a few years and they became less helpful. Enter the fentanyl patch. Started on 12.5 every 48 hours and ended up on 75mcg of the Mylan brand every 48 hours. It certainly helped, and continued helping for a couple of years. Last year legislation passed new regulations for our state due to the high incidence of abuse and deaths. My pain Dr. relocated too far away for me to follow him. I met with my new Dr. (Or Nurse Practioner I believe) a week or two and was informed I would no longer receive ANY patches in ANY dose, just my Percocet. That's it. I was speechless and scared. Expressed my fear of withdrawal to her and after much back and forth she did give me clonidine.  I never failed a monthly pill count, never missed one appointment, and never failed a scheduled or random urinalysis. She says it was just new policy, because in their opinion my neck ""shouldn't hurt that much."" So, I strategically cut the remaining patches into smaller and smaller sections every 48 hours. And as I'm sure you can imagine, I'm really sick right now, and scared, and tearful. I'm have sweats with intermitant chills that are so bad I was covered in 5 layers this morning. Very bad diarrhea, minimal appetite. I am trying to stay hydrated. My B/P it's usually in the good-low range. It's running very high. Bottom# in upper 90's or lie 100's. Pulse very high. Heart palpitations, panic attacks, bad night sweats. Very runny nose and crazy yawning. I'm take no other meds other minipress as needed for nightmares.. Prescribed years ago.  I'm den new to one corner of the 75mcg patch. I would estimate its 18mcg's and put it on thus a.m. Any feedback or suggestions wold be wonderful. How long will this last? Should I do anything differently? Am I in danger at this point? Thank you all in advance!   2 likes, 23 replies "

I recently realized that no one has suggested Lyrica and I'm hoping my primary care doctor will let me try it.  As others have mentioned, my pain travels from one part of my body to another so the patches and shots Ive tried are very ineffective.  For instance, yesterday my pain was mostly in my neck and upper back.  Today, that area is still soar but my upper arm muscles are also in extreme pain.  I'm not getting any younger and dealing with pain every day is sucking the life out of me.

I had a year of chemo, radio and surgery in 2011 causing this to be prescribed  and this withdrawal experience has bee worse than that entire year. Fentanyl should only be used in palative care or to end of life use, If you can stand the paranoia , innumeracy, and alarming spending habits it creates. Actually I never found it to be a great painkiller but its hard to admit during the intial euphoria it creates. which you quickly get used to. DONT TAKE FENTANYL it is so pure and strong it will destroy your natural happy systems forever. The NHS knoe how to prescribe it but no idea how to get you off it, Forget the fliue like withdrawal systems its brutal and dangerous and flue very pleasant by comparison.  I hope taking the time to do this stops just one person taking. 5 likes, 252 replies "

I wasn't particularly painful or swollen but I decided a trip to A + E was in order. The finger was eventually looked at and an x-ray taken.  There was no fracture but a diagnosis of mallet finger.  I was surprised when they said the treatment was to splint the finger for up to 12 weeks, the first 8 full time! The plastic splint they put on was too big but they could not get the smaller one on my finger so they added a tubular gauze finger strip under the splint. Instructions were to keep the end joint of the finger straight at all times and to wash the finger and splint once a day. This is where the ""fun"" started.....  I found it virtually impossible to keep the joint straight whilst removing and reapplying the splint and particularly the finger gauze.  The finger could also move inside the oversized splint and there was a tendency for the splint to work its way down my finger particularly if the tape holding it on began loosing its stick especially if it got at all wet. Had a hospital one week review yesterday and got a smaller splint without the gauze.  Still having difficulty in keeping the joint straight when washing. Is this a problem even if the finger bends a little once a day when being cleaned or will the tendon never heal unless the joint is kept straight 100% of the time? Any advice or comments would be appreciated 0 likes, 0 replies "

The symptoms were just so scary and never ending (from the typical fatigue, sore throat and dizziness to sensory hypersensitivity, painful scalp, dry mouth, hives, rash and awful anxiety) and I felt the life I led before the virus had all but disappeared. For these reasons I also spiralled into depression which of course didn’t help anything. But there is hope! I'm pretty much back to 100% again now, working 36 hours a week, socialising like before and I even went on two overseas trips last year. The awful lingering symptoms of anxiety and dizziness have now FINALLY gone and I'm getting on with living my life again. An important lesson I have learned for the best recovery is this: do not expect recovery to be a sprint race – it is a marathon for sure. You can’t fast track recovery by trying to push through and rush back to what you were doing before. It’s a grinding zig zag process of feeling like you’re recovering and then feeling like you’re right back at square one again, over and over. This is the normal recovery trajectory for this virus. Please continue to listen to your body and if you are tired, experiencing symptoms, not coping, then it’s probably your body telling you that you need more rest and care. I ended up taking 10 months off work in total. This virus isn’t anything to take lightly either. It’s been linked to more serious conditions which makes it all that much more important to take care of yourself now.

I havent posted or even checked this forum for a solid two weeks, I decided I needed a mental break to really focus on getting better and I truly think it has helped me a lot. My anxiety has gotten MUCH better, and I am worrying less about everything. My new medicine, and counseling is helping a lot. I also feel a lot better, I got my appetite back for the most part, and the leg pain is gone. I still do have some symptoms such as random chest pain, back pain, headaches, extremely tired still, and stomach pain. But I am getting used to it, sad to say. I have had multiple tests done for my health such as: an MRI of my head, multiple CT scans and X-rays of my chest, legs, etc. I have had multiple ultrasounds done as well of everywhere, my legs, breasts, pelvic region all because of pain. All came back normal. Blood work shows past infection no current but I am still struggling with symtpoms to this day. Liver enzyme levels are really high still, and some other off bloodwork. But im focusing on trying to get better the best I can. I officially go back to work March 2nd. Just wanted to check in, and let you all know how I am coming along. Still a long ways to go I am sure but it is getting a little better. 4 likes, 1 reply "

There were many different types of bugs seen between the bark and the rest of the wood. I used a chain saw, and I believed I may have breathed in dust from cutting the wood.  About one or two weeks later I started sneezing and sneezing.  As I sneezed, tiny rice shaped objects flew out of my nose.  I had no idea what it was, so I took them into my doctors office. My regular MD was no available, so I had someone new. I believed he was going to sent them for analysis to pathology lab.  He did no. The dummy threw them out. A week later I woke up in the middle of the night feeling something on my eye. I looked into my lighted make up mirror. There was a very thin worm about an inch long on my eye lash and another one on the side of my cheek. As I was looking, I actually saw one come out of my cheek at a 90 degree angle. It came straight out about 1/2 inch from my skin and started to wind about like a snake. I wiped them away with a Kleenex. Of course I wanted to save them, but they are so thin that the are not visible on Kleenex or on a tip. A few days after that I started having white stuff coming from my left eye.  I actually started irrigating my eyes 3 times daily. It was necessary to get out the tiny rice shaped objects.  They were also still in my nose. I was also cleaning my nose several times daily.  The rice  shaped objects were still  there along with some small round yellow balls  about 4 mm.  After another week the rice  shaped  objects were gone and replaced by the occasional  thin worm in my nose, mouth  and eyes. I went to the doctor for a second time. The doctor thought it could be lice, because lice can get into the eyes. He gave me  a script for something to be put into my hair and advised me to Use Vaseline on my eye lashes to prevent them from laying eggs on the eye lashes.  Then I must have swallowed the yellow little rount thing from my nose. I was getting little bumps  on my skin.  Thought maybe it was lice stuck onto my skin, so I picked them off. Under a thin layer of skin was the little round yellow balls of various sizes. Some were as large as 10 mm. They were fluctuant. I took in about 15 to the lab. The report said plant 'material, no parasite seen'.  I took a worm into the lab. Report said inanimate object.  Infectious disease refused to see me because of that report.  My doctor refused to give me anything for worms because of that report. I called the lab and asked them what would be the proper way to collect the worm. They said to put it in alcohol.  I went to a lady MD who is a personal friend of mine. She gave Ve me a prescription for albendazol.  Mabendazole no longer available in the US. Albendazol cost $250.00 per pill in the U.S. with my insurance. My lady doctor friend faxed  a script for albendazol  to a foreign drug  service. It was for 200 pills and cost me $160.00.  It took 3 weeks to get it.  I was now itching around my neck, around my ears and my scalp. They say when the worms move, it makes you itch.  I used the medication as prescribed 10 days in a row without improvement. I did this twice, without improvement.  Then I took it upon myself to double the prescribed dose. The itching almost subsided. I got 3 things from my wood cutting day. Plant material under my skin which cleared up by itself. I washed clothes, bed clothes, towels and myself and hair daily for two months to get rid of the lice. The I started washing myself and hair twice daily.  That twice daily got rid of it in one week.  The worms remain in my eyes.  The rice shaped objects were the worm larva. I read that worms crawl into your skin while you are outside. Eggs hatch in the lungs. Larva go to your mouth and is swallowed. Mine went into my nose. My sleep apnea mask blew them into my eyes.  So now I frequently feel movement in my eyes. I look in my magnifying mirror and may see the end of a worm coming out of my eye. I try to grabit with a tweezers. It either goes back into the tear ducts, or only part of it breaks off. When I feel a burning sensation in the corner of my eye, I know that eggs are being laid and I wipe them out with a q tip. When I feel a sharp sensation in the eye itself, I know the work is entering the eyeball, itself. The only thing that has really helped me in the eye are called zapper. I have 2 of them. They apparently were  developed by a German lady years ago to kill parasites. The two small   that I have, each use a 5 volt battery. I put one above the eye and one below, or one to each side. I hold them in place for hours. I feel a very slight tingling. This is supposed to kill the parasites. I believe this is the only thing that keeps them under control. The little charge does no harm to me but kills them. Some times my eyelid becomes swollen and uncomfortable. I know it is the worms. After a few hours using the zapper it will go down. So now I am stuck with these worms in my left eye. They seem to be in the tear duct. The albendazol did not kill them, but the   keep their numbers under control. 1 like, 9 replies "

I went to a lady MD who is a personal friend of mine. She gave Ve me a prescription for albendazol.  Mabendazole no longer available in the US. Albendazol cost $250.00 per pill in the U.S. with my insurance. My lady doctor friend faxed  a script for albendazol  to a foreign drug  service. It was for 200 pills and cost me $160.00.  It took 3 weeks to get it.  I was now itching around my neck, around my ears and my scalp. They say when the worms move, it makes you itch.  I used the medication as prescribed 10 days in a row without improvement. I did this twice, without improvement.  Then I took it upon myself to double the prescribed dose. The itching almost subsided. I got 3 things from my wood cutting day. Plant material under my skin which cleared up by itself. I washed clothes, bed clothes, towels and myself and hair daily for two months to get rid of the lice. The I started washing myself and hair twice daily.  That twice daily got rid of it in one week.  The worms remain in my eyes.  The rice shaped objects were the worm larva. I read that worms crawl into your skin while you are outside. Eggs hatch in the lungs. Larva go to your mouth and is swallowed. Mine went into my nose. My sleep apnea mask blew them into my eyes.  So now I frequently feel movement in my eyes. I look in my magnifying mirror and may see the end of a worm coming out of my eye. I try to grabit with a tweezers. It either goes back into the tear ducts, or only part of it breaks off. When I feel a burning sensation in the corner of my eye, I know that eggs are being laid and I wipe them out with a q tip. When I feel a sharp sensation in the eye itself, I know the work is entering the eyeball, itself. The only thing that has really helped me in the eye are called zapper. I have 2 of them. They apparently were  developed by a German lady years ago to kill parasites. The two small   that I have, each use a 5 volt battery. I put one above the eye and one below, or one to each side.

The little charge does no harm to me but kills them. Some times my eyelid becomes swollen and uncomfortable. I know it is the worms. After a few hours using the zapper it will go down. So now I am stuck with these worms in my left eye. They seem to be in the tear duct. The albendazol did not kill them, but the   keep their numbers under control. 1 like, 9 replies "

There were many different types of bugs seen between the bark and the rest of the wood. I used a chain saw, and I believed I may have breathed in dust from cutting the wood.  About one or two weeks later I started sneezing and sneezing.  As I sneezed, tiny rice shaped objects flew out of my nose.  I had no idea what it was, so I took them into my doctors office. My regular MD was no available, so I had someone new. I believed he was going to sent them for analysis to pathology lab.  He did no. The dummy threw them out. A week later I woke up in the middle of the night feeling something on my eye. I looked into my lighted make up mirror. There was a very thin worm about an inch long on my eye lash and another one on the side of my cheek. As I was looking, I actually saw one come out of my cheek at a 90 degree angle. It came straight out about 1/2 inch from my skin and started to wind about like a snake. I wiped them away with a Kleenex. Of course I wanted to save them, but they are so thin that the are not visible on Kleenex or on a tip. A few days after that I started having white stuff coming from my left eye.  I actually started irrigating my eyes 3 times daily. It was necessary to get out the tiny rice shaped objects.  They were also still in my nose. I was also cleaning my nose several times daily.  The rice  shaped objects were still  there along with some small round yellow balls  about 4 mm.  After another week the rice  shaped  objects were gone and replaced by the occasional  thin worm in my nose, mouth  and eyes. I went to the doctor for a second time. The doctor thought it could be lice, because lice can get into the eyes. He gave me  a script for something to be put into my hair and advised me to Use Vaseline on my eye lashes to prevent them from laying eggs on the eye lashes.  Then I must have swallowed the yellow little rount thing from my nose. I was getting little bumps  on my skin.  Thought maybe it was lice stuck onto my skin, so I picked them off. Under a thin layer of skin was the little round yellow balls of various sizes. Some were as large as 10 mm. They were fluctuant. I took in about 15 to the lab. The report said plant 'material, no parasite seen'.  I took a worm into the lab. Report said inanimate object.  Infectious disease refused to see me because of that report.

I am a 71-year-old male living in Thailand. In 2005, in Canada, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and was treated with brachytherapy. Twelve years later, I had problems with my bladder and my urinary tract, problems that the doctors think were side effects of the radiation I received in 2005. My problems turned into urinary incontinence. I wear diapers 24/7. I also have some fecal incontinence. I've had it for at least six months. So far, it appears limited to urgency –– i.e., when I feel that I have to go to the toilet, I have only about 90 seconds to get there. I am wearing diapers anyhow, for the urinary incontinence. But so far, I haven't had any ""leakage"" of stools into the diapers. I have always managed to get to a toilet in time. And the urge seems to happen only when I am at home. I have been thinking about having an artificial (urinary) sphincter implanted. But one of the main reasons for doing so is so that I don't have to wear diapers all of the time. But if I have the procedure, I wonder whether I will have to wear diapers anyhow because of my other problem. If my fecal urgency does not get any worse, I could wear a diaper, for safety, but not have to be changing diapers all day and all night. Does anyone here have experience with this? Is my fecal urgency problem likely to get worse? Am I likely to have other problems associated with fecal incontinence? Am I better off just sticking with the diapers? Thanks. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Denial is a blissful state. It’s too easy to deny the inevitable until reality confronts you with limited options.  Medically, we think the next pill will alleviate all our symptoms and lead us to glowing health. As we age, one hundred percent solutions become a little more elusive. Case in point, my bladder problem was not getting any better. Late night “tete-a-tetes with the john”; the occasional leakage when facilities were not immediately accessible; and, the endless delay of slow voiding. On my 45th high school reunion in 2014, I got compliments from my classmates that I hadn’t changed much. I told them that our family secret was to fall apart all at once, we didn’t believe in gradual aging. That reunion was five years ago. On visiting my urologist and having a bladder scan showing water retention of over one-half liter, my doctor advised me the best option was self-catheterization. My mind froze, but I couldn’t deny the reality of the condition any longer. He told me it would be best to catheterize myself five times a day to drain the residual urine from my bladder to prevent infection and accidental overflow. This felt like a terminal sentence to an aging Baby-Boomer. I’ve always joked that as you get older the first thing you ask yourself in the morning when you discover a new ache or pain is “Is this temporary or will I have to live with it?” I think this one has my name on it. As a physically active 68-year-old male, I love to walk, be outdoors, and ride my bike. I just wasn’t sure what this pronouncement would mean to my life and lifestyle. A myriad of questions began to invade my mind: •	Once I start this catherization regime, would I even be able to void on my own or would I always need my catherization aids with me? •	Would I get recurrent Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) from inserting foreign objects into delicate places? •	What would happen if I were somewhere without my plumbing gear? Would this cause painful incontinence or an overflow situation? •	How would life go on normally in various settings with a routine of five catheterizations a day? As the nurse instructed me through my first self-catheterization, I was sweating bullets. It was everything I feared.  It hurt and I badly wanted to go home without these free samples. I could not imagine getting through a day doing this procedure five times. More question came to me as I left for home: •	Would I be able to work normally at the office? •	Would I be able to create sterile conditions for self-catherization in work bathrooms? •	How would I get all the equipment that I would need—150 sterile catheters a month? •	What would be the cost for all this stuff I never ever desired? When I got home and for the next few days, my wife noticed that a pall and a funk had descended on me. Golden years were not looking so golden. I had been hoping to retire in a few years with good health and continue my physical outings. To make matters worse in the next week, I contracted what I thought was a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). For three days I had a fever and felt weak. Then the symptoms abated. Maybe it was a UTI or maybe it wasn’t. In the next couple of weeks, a few things began to come together. I started to see a little light in my fog: •	The supplies were easy to obtain. With my primary insurance and Medicare, I only had a $133 copay for the first monthly shipment; the next months were free. The shipments come to my door automatically by Fed-Ex every month. •	In the catherization procedure, you void first and then catheterize, so my fear of not being able to void once I started the procedures was ill-founded. •	Work was not that hard to accommodate. •	The procedure only takes about four minutes and I no longer sweat. •	I’ve continued my physical activity. About three weeks after starting these procedures, the following routine and somewhat mundane experience helped me see my life wasn’t ending. It was on a Saturday Morning after a drab week of rain. The sun had decided to show it face, and life seemed normal.  I casually went about my regular shopping errands. While waiting for my car to be washed and sipping delicious coffee, I realized that life still had some good moments for me. Somehow, the clouds in my mind of the last three weeks parted just a little. I’m ok for now--but life has changed: Normal is different. As we age, normal will always be evolving but that doesn’t mean enjoyment, pleasure, and meaning can’t be part of the journey. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I first noticed any bodily changes around late 2018. Me and my ex partner were drinking quite heavily and we were cheering England on in the World Cup. Around this time my bowel habits changed (greasy, fatty, foul, floating). Plus I was so dizzy once at work my manager let me go home. I didnt know - and still dont - what that was. This progressed to the point where I lost a bit of weight - not a ungodly amount, so I went to my GP and then was referred onto to a Gastro specialist in Hexham, who said my symptoms were classic Celiac. Because nobody in my family had Celiac, I was - and still am - sceptical. Ultimately I had the antibody test which was Negative (I was not eating gluten however, yes stupid), I had the genetic HLA testing (HLA DQ2 & HLA DQ8 positive, maybe predisposing me to it later in life), and then finally the dreaded Endoscopy, which only found Duodenitis (Once again I did not eat much gluten). The diagnosis was gluten sensitivity and I was discharged. I continued to avoid gluten, but my symptoms got worse. They morphed also from basic abdominal discomfort and bloating, to these episodes of intense shivers, massive stool output and more weight loss. I remember once at work, only being there for around 2 hours, I had opened my bowels 5 times before midday, and was left feeling so drained and dehydrated. I nearly passed out at work that day so my boss let me go so I could visit A&E and demand answers. They had none, and discharged me. This continued and continued. Some days I was good, some days not so good. I gave up drinking completely (still T total) and stopped socialising as much because of the uncertainty around what the hell this was. High stool output, weight loss, some shivers, confusion-like episodes (severe dizziness and disorientation) and just vague malaise ensued. I did not go abroad or eat any crazy foods nor did I run through fields and lie in the grass for hours on end (Lyme Disease and other tick-borne critters). Well before this, my ex and I bought a lovely little week old kitten. She was feisty and would often bite me and scratch me (Its what cats do, right?). She slowly grew up and at one point, was very badly ill with bloody diaorrhea, worms crawling around and a massive flea infestation. One day I actually remember being up early for work, and finding a long tapeworm, dead and dried up on our worktop. Around this time is vaguely when I remember having Celiac screening. I dont remember vomitting, or fevers, virus like symptoms or any rashes. What I do remember is feeling generally unwell quite a bit, tired, dizzy and I would often find swollen lumps under my armpit. I passed them off as ingrowing hairs. My fatigue, dizziness and brain fog got worse until one day at work, I was quite severly confused. I would pick up something at work, turn around and for a split second I wouldnt know where I was - almost as though turning around and shutting and opening my eyes reset my spatial memory, proprioception and bodily awareness. One episode was quite scary. My ex left work at night. I sat on the couch and started getting this horrible nerve like pain in my hand. Then I came over all.. shivery, cold, clammy and mildly confused. I rushed round to my grans who made me tea and it eased off. This is when me and my ex broke up, I moved out and moved back in with my gran. I hoped that moving away would eradicate my symptoms but it didnt. They got worse. They gradually, and vaguely progressed until around mid 2019, when it went from having chills here and there to chills every night. Where it went from feeling cold to rushing to A&E with my Mum because I went into temporary hypothermia (34 degrees, shallow breathing and confused=scary). It went from me having good days and bad days to every day being hard work at my job, short of breath and soooo tired - unusually so. I went to my GP and explained my symptoms. I got a few funny looks when I mentioned confusion. All manner of tests were ordered. Vitamin and minerals, urea & electrolytes, full blood counts, etc. They all came back relatively ok, apart from me having consistently low Lymphocytes, and the night I went to A&E, my white cell and Neutrophils were raised. Fast forward to just before Christmas 2019 and I had lost a lot of weight (10 stone 7 to 8 stone 10) and had developed some pretty nasty symptoms ; vague hand tremors, bodily twitches, nerve zaps in my head and neck, chills were more ferocious and the dizziness just did not budge. Oh and nausea appeared early 2020, which was horrific. Almost as though every two minutes I thought I would throw up. During this time I got utterly obsessed with visiting A&E to try to get answers - they were utterly useless, as the most they did was put me on a drip and send me home with Buccastem for vertigo and passed it off as Menieres. At this point my mental health detoriated quite badly, I remember hitching a ride to Hexham off a family friend to try to get answers, only to find a village doctor (just one) in urgen care was so laid back and Doc Martin-like it was silly, so I hopped on a bus to the RVI in Newcastle for answers. They took my bloods, poo and pee and said because I was a) far from home and b) my immediate bloods were 'fine', they discharged me... infuriating. I did not want to leave to I trailed around Newcastle until the early hours and then re-appeared with claims of vomiting so they would see me and solve this mystery, they discharged me.

I first noticed any bodily changes around late 2018. Me and my ex partner were drinking quite heavily and we were cheering England on in the World Cup. Around this time my bowel habits changed (greasy, fatty, foul, floating). Plus I was so dizzy once at work my manager let me go home. I didnt know - and still dont - what that was. This progressed to the point where I lost a bit of weight - not a ungodly amount, so I went to my GP and then was referred onto to a Gastro specialist in Hexham, who said my symptoms were classic Celiac. Because nobody in my family had Celiac, I was - and still am - sceptical. Ultimately I had the antibody test which was Negative (I was not eating gluten however, yes stupid), I had the genetic HLA testing (HLA DQ2 & HLA DQ8 positive, maybe predisposing me to it later in life), and then finally the dreaded Endoscopy, which only found Duodenitis (Once again I did not eat much gluten). The diagnosis was gluten sensitivity and I was discharged. I continued to avoid gluten, but my symptoms got worse. They morphed also from basic abdominal discomfort and bloating, to these episodes of intense shivers, massive stool output and more weight loss. I remember once at work, only being there for around 2 hours, I had opened my bowels 5 times before midday, and was left feeling so drained and dehydrated. I nearly passed out at work that day so my boss let me go so I could visit A&E and demand answers. They had none, and discharged me. This continued and continued. Some days I was good, some days not so good. I gave up drinking completely (still T total) and stopped socialising as much because of the uncertainty around what the hell this was. High stool output, weight loss, some shivers, confusion-like episodes (severe dizziness and disorientation) and just vague malaise ensued. I did not go abroad or eat any crazy foods nor did I run through fields and lie in the grass for hours on end (Lyme Disease and other tick-borne critters). Well before this, my ex and I bought a lovely little week old kitten. She was feisty and would often bite me and scratch me (Its what cats do, right?). She slowly grew up and at one point, was very badly ill with bloody diaorrhea, worms crawling around and a massive flea infestation. One day I actually remember being up early for work, and finding a long tapeworm, dead and dried up on our worktop. Around this time is vaguely when I remember having Celiac screening. I dont remember vomitting, or fevers, virus like symptoms or any rashes. What I do remember is feeling generally unwell quite a bit, tired, dizzy and I would often find swollen lumps under my armpit. I passed them off as ingrowing hairs. My fatigue, dizziness and brain fog got worse until one day at work, I was quite severly confused. I would pick up something at work, turn around and for a split second I wouldnt know where I was - almost as though turning around and shutting and opening my eyes reset my spatial memory, proprioception and bodily awareness. One episode was quite scary. My ex left work at night. I sat on the couch and started getting this horrible nerve like pain in my hand. Then I came over all.. shivery, cold, clammy and mildly confused. I rushed round to my grans who made me tea and it eased off. This is when me and my ex broke up, I moved out and moved back in with my gran. I hoped that moving away would eradicate my symptoms but it didnt. They got worse. They gradually, and vaguely progressed until around mid 2019, when it went from having chills here and there to chills every night. Where it went from feeling cold to rushing to A&E with my Mum because I went into temporary hypothermia (34 degrees, shallow breathing and confused=scary). It went from me having good days and bad days to every day being hard work at my job, short of breath and soooo tired - unusually so. I went to my GP and explained my symptoms. I got a few funny looks when I mentioned confusion. All manner of tests were ordered. Vitamin and minerals, urea & electrolytes, full blood counts, etc. They all came back relatively ok, apart from me having consistently low Lymphocytes, and the night I went to A&E, my white cell and Neutrophils were raised. Fast forward to just before Christmas 2019 and I had lost a lot of weight (10 stone 7 to 8 stone 10) and had developed some pretty nasty symptoms ; vague hand tremors, bodily twitches, nerve zaps in my head and neck, chills were more ferocious and the dizziness just did not budge. Oh and nausea appeared early 2020, which was horrific. Almost as though every two minutes I thought I would throw up. During this time I got utterly obsessed with visiting A&E to try to get answers - they were utterly useless, as the most they did was put me on a drip and send me home with Buccastem for vertigo and passed it off as Menieres. At this point my mental health detoriated quite badly, I remember hitching a ride to Hexham off a family friend to try to get answers, only to find a village doctor (just one) in urgen care was so laid back and Doc Martin-like it was silly, so I hopped on a bus to the RVI in Newcastle for answers. They took my bloods, poo and pee and said because I was a) far from home and b) my immediate bloods were 'fine', they discharged me... infuriating.

During this time I got utterly obsessed with visiting A&E to try to get answers - they were utterly useless, as the most they did was put me on a drip and send me home with Buccastem for vertigo and passed it off as Menieres. At this point my mental health detoriated quite badly, I remember hitching a ride to Hexham off a family friend to try to get answers, only to find a village doctor (just one) in urgen care was so laid back and Doc Martin-like it was silly, so I hopped on a bus to the RVI in Newcastle for answers. They took my bloods, poo and pee and said because I was a) far from home and b) my immediate bloods were 'fine', they discharged me... infuriating. I did not want to leave to I trailed around Newcastle until the early hours and then re-appeared with claims of vomiting so they would see me and solve this mystery, they discharged me. I was not only worried and obssesed about my physical state, I was beginning to act a bit.. manic, erratic and dazed. Around this time I started a new job, and they sought me unfit for work because of how I looked, felt and was generally - but kept the job open for me in future. Heartbreaking. I cried alot Fast forward to now and I have severe dizziness, nerve pains in my head and neck, horrible neck, back, frontal muscle aches, general malaise and uneasiness (almost as though something is crawling in me) and a whole host of other symptoms, like personality changes and depression and panic attacks and autonomic dysfunction etc etc. Oh and my hands are very blotchy. I have had two brains MRI's, a CT on my kidneys and a frontal CT. The last CT found nothing bar a calcified granuloma in my liver, which in itself isnt an issue to me, but is a sign that my body has tried - and failed - to kill an invader and its become calcified over time. I am adamant the invder is stil here, an unwanted guest, acting shady and mysterious and sapping my energy and thieving my need for energy and new cell creation. Now I am pushing GP's who are painfully 'general' to a fault, and wish they would stop wanting to pin it on anxiety (dont ever tell a doc youre anxious!), A&E are under-resourced and basic, CHOC (Minor Injuries at Hospital) are powerless and void of any meaning and my specialist is a very, very busy man  - all while I am sat here wondering if this is Lymphoma, Toxoplasmosis, Bartonella / CSD, Lyme, a brain tumour that hasnt been spotted or something else - whether worse or 'better'. I have collapsed once already and woke up severly dizzy, confused and felt abit in shock. I hope that this story doesnt end with me collapsing in a heap amidst family members screaming 'oh what a shock' because to me it just would not be. I hope I get an answer soon because whatever this is will not stop until it kills me - it feels like it anyway. To be continued. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I first noticed any bodily changes around late 2018. Me and my ex partner were drinking quite heavily and we were cheering England on in the World Cup. Around this time my bowel habits changed (greasy, fatty, foul, floating). Plus I was so dizzy once at work my manager let me go home. I didnt know - and still dont - what that was. This progressed to the point where I lost a bit of weight - not a ungodly amount, so I went to my GP and then was referred onto to a Gastro specialist in Hexham, who said my symptoms were classic Celiac. Because nobody in my family had Celiac, I was - and still am - sceptical. Ultimately I had the antibody test which was Negative (I was not eating gluten however, yes stupid), I had the genetic HLA testing (HLA DQ2 & HLA DQ8 positive, maybe predisposing me to it later in life), and then finally the dreaded Endoscopy, which only found Duodenitis (Once again I did not eat much gluten). The diagnosis was gluten sensitivity and I was discharged. I continued to avoid gluten, but my symptoms got worse. They morphed also from basic abdominal discomfort and bloating, to these episodes of intense shivers, massive stool output and more weight loss. I remember once at work, only being there for around 2 hours, I had opened my bowels 5 times before midday, and was left feeling so drained and dehydrated. I nearly passed out at work that day so my boss let me go so I could visit A&E and demand answers. They had none, and discharged me. This continued and continued. Some days I was good, some days not so good. I gave up drinking completely (still T total) and stopped socialising as much because of the uncertainty around what the hell this was. High stool output, weight loss, some shivers, confusion-like episodes (severe dizziness and disorientation) and just vague malaise ensued. I did not go abroad or eat any crazy foods nor did I run through fields and lie in the grass for hours on end (Lyme Disease and other tick-borne critters). Well before this, my ex and I bought a lovely little week old kitten. She was feisty and would often bite me and scratch me (Its what cats do, right?). She slowly grew up and at one point, was very badly ill with bloody diaorrhea, worms crawling around and a massive flea infestation. One day I actually remember being up early for work, and finding a long tapeworm, dead and dried up on our worktop. Around this time is vaguely when I remember having Celiac screening. I dont remember vomitting, or fevers, virus like symptoms or any rashes. What I do remember is feeling generally unwell quite a bit, tired, dizzy and I would often find swollen lumps under my armpit. I passed them off as ingrowing hairs. My fatigue, dizziness and brain fog got worse until one day at work, I was quite severly confused. I would pick up something at work, turn around and for a split second I wouldnt know where I was - almost as though turning around and shutting and opening my eyes reset my spatial memory, proprioception and bodily awareness. One episode was quite scary. My ex left work at night. I sat on the couch and started getting this horrible nerve like pain in my hand. Then I came over all.. shivery, cold, clammy and mildly confused. I rushed round to my grans who made me tea and it eased off. This is when me and my ex broke up, I moved out and moved back in with my gran. I hoped that moving away would eradicate my symptoms but it didnt. They got worse. They gradually, and vaguely progressed until around mid 2019, when it went from having chills here and there to chills every night. Where it went from feeling cold to rushing to A&E with my Mum because I went into temporary hypothermia (34 degrees, shallow breathing and confused=scary). It went from me having good days and bad days to every day being hard work at my job, short of breath and soooo tired - unusually so. I went to my GP and explained my symptoms. I got a few funny looks when I mentioned confusion. All manner of tests were ordered.

This is when me and my ex broke up, I moved out and moved back in with my gran. I hoped that moving away would eradicate my symptoms but it didnt. They got worse. They gradually, and vaguely progressed until around mid 2019, when it went from having chills here and there to chills every night. Where it went from feeling cold to rushing to A&E with my Mum because I went into temporary hypothermia (34 degrees, shallow breathing and confused=scary). It went from me having good days and bad days to every day being hard work at my job, short of breath and soooo tired - unusually so. I went to my GP and explained my symptoms. I got a few funny looks when I mentioned confusion. All manner of tests were ordered. Vitamin and minerals, urea & electrolytes, full blood counts, etc. They all came back relatively ok, apart from me having consistently low Lymphocytes, and the night I went to A&E, my white cell and Neutrophils were raised. Fast forward to just before Christmas 2019 and I had lost a lot of weight (10 stone 7 to 8 stone 10) and had developed some pretty nasty symptoms ; vague hand tremors, bodily twitches, nerve zaps in my head and neck, chills were more ferocious and the dizziness just did not budge. Oh and nausea appeared early 2020, which was horrific. Almost as though every two minutes I thought I would throw up. During this time I got utterly obsessed with visiting A&E to try to get answers - they were utterly useless, as the most they did was put me on a drip and send me home with Buccastem for vertigo and passed it off as Menieres. At this point my mental health detoriated quite badly, I remember hitching a ride to Hexham off a family friend to try to get answers, only to find a village doctor (just one) in urgen care was so laid back and Doc Martin-like it was silly, so I hopped on a bus to the RVI in Newcastle for answers. They took my bloods, poo and pee and said because I was a) far from home and b) my immediate bloods were 'fine', they discharged me... infuriating. I did not want to leave to I trailed around Newcastle until the early hours and then re-appeared with claims of vomiting so they would see me and solve this mystery, they discharged me. I was not only worried and obssesed about my physical state, I was beginning to act a bit.. manic, erratic and dazed. Around this time I started a new job, and they sought me unfit for work because of how I looked, felt and was generally - but kept the job open for me in future. Heartbreaking. I cried alot Fast forward to now and I have severe dizziness, nerve pains in my head and neck, horrible neck, back, frontal muscle aches, general malaise and uneasiness (almost as though something is crawling in me) and a whole host of other symptoms, like personality changes and depression and panic attacks and autonomic dysfunction etc etc. Oh and my hands are very blotchy. I have had two brains MRI's, a CT on my kidneys and a frontal CT. The last CT found nothing bar a calcified granuloma in my liver, which in itself isnt an issue to me, but is a sign that my body has tried - and failed - to kill an invader and its become calcified over time. I am adamant the invder is stil here, an unwanted guest, acting shady and mysterious and sapping my energy and thieving my need for energy and new cell creation. Now I am pushing GP's who are painfully 'general' to a fault, and wish they would stop wanting to pin it on anxiety (dont ever tell a doc youre anxious!), A&E are under-resourced and basic, CHOC (Minor Injuries at Hospital) are powerless and void of any meaning and my specialist is a very, very busy man  - all while I am sat here wondering if this is Lymphoma, Toxoplasmosis, Bartonella / CSD, Lyme, a brain tumour that hasnt been spotted or something else - whether worse or 'better'. I have collapsed once already and woke up severly dizzy, confused and felt abit in shock. I hope that this story doesnt end with me collapsing in a heap amidst family members screaming 'oh what a shock' because to me it just would not be. I hope I get an answer soon because whatever this is will not stop until it kills me - it feels like it anyway. To be continued. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I first noticed any bodily changes around late 2018. Me and my ex partner were drinking quite heavily and we were cheering England on in the World Cup. Around this time my bowel habits changed (greasy, fatty, foul, floating). Plus I was so dizzy once at work my manager let me go home. I didnt know - and still dont - what that was. This progressed to the point where I lost a bit of weight - not a ungodly amount, so I went to my GP and then was referred onto to a Gastro specialist in Hexham, who said my symptoms were classic Celiac. Because nobody in my family had Celiac, I was - and still am - sceptical. Ultimately I had the antibody test which was Negative (I was not eating gluten however, yes stupid), I had the genetic HLA testing (HLA DQ2 & HLA DQ8 positive, maybe predisposing me to it later in life), and then finally the dreaded Endoscopy, which only found Duodenitis (Once again I did not eat much gluten). The diagnosis was gluten sensitivity and I was discharged. I continued to avoid gluten, but my symptoms got worse. They morphed also from basic abdominal discomfort and bloating, to these episodes of intense shivers, massive stool output and more weight loss. I remember once at work, only being there for around 2 hours, I had opened my bowels 5 times before midday, and was left feeling so drained and dehydrated. I nearly passed out at work that day so my boss let me go so I could visit A&E and demand answers. They had none, and discharged me. This continued and continued. Some days I was good, some days not so good. I gave up drinking completely (still T total) and stopped socialising as much because of the uncertainty around what the hell this was. High stool output, weight loss, some shivers, confusion-like episodes (severe dizziness and disorientation) and just vague malaise ensued. I did not go abroad or eat any crazy foods nor did I run through fields and lie in the grass for hours on end (Lyme Disease and other tick-borne critters). Well before this, my ex and I bought a lovely little week old kitten. She was feisty and would often bite me and scratch me (Its what cats do, right?). She slowly grew up and at one point, was very badly ill with bloody diaorrhea, worms crawling around and a massive flea infestation. One day I actually remember being up early for work, and finding a long tapeworm, dead and dried up on our worktop. Around this time is vaguely when I remember having Celiac screening. I dont remember vomitting, or fevers, virus like symptoms or any rashes. What I do remember is feeling generally unwell quite a bit, tired, dizzy and I would often find swollen lumps under my armpit. I passed them off as ingrowing hairs. My fatigue, dizziness and brain fog got worse until one day at work, I was quite severly confused. I would pick up something at work, turn around and for a split second I wouldnt know where I was - almost as though turning around and shutting and opening my eyes reset my spatial memory, proprioception and bodily awareness.

She slowly grew up and at one point, was very badly ill with bloody diaorrhea, worms crawling around and a massive flea infestation. One day I actually remember being up early for work, and finding a long tapeworm, dead and dried up on our worktop. Around this time is vaguely when I remember having Celiac screening. I dont remember vomitting, or fevers, virus like symptoms or any rashes. What I do remember is feeling generally unwell quite a bit, tired, dizzy and I would often find swollen lumps under my armpit. I passed them off as ingrowing hairs. My fatigue, dizziness and brain fog got worse until one day at work, I was quite severly confused. I would pick up something at work, turn around and for a split second I wouldnt know where I was - almost as though turning around and shutting and opening my eyes reset my spatial memory, proprioception and bodily awareness. One episode was quite scary. My ex left work at night. I sat on the couch and started getting this horrible nerve like pain in my hand. Then I came over all.. shivery, cold, clammy and mildly confused. I rushed round to my grans who made me tea and it eased off. This is when me and my ex broke up, I moved out and moved back in with my gran. I hoped that moving away would eradicate my symptoms but it didnt. They got worse. They gradually, and vaguely progressed until around mid 2019, when it went from having chills here and there to chills every night. Where it went from feeling cold to rushing to A&E with my Mum because I went into temporary hypothermia (34 degrees, shallow breathing and confused=scary). It went from me having good days and bad days to every day being hard work at my job, short of breath and soooo tired - unusually so. I went to my GP and explained my symptoms. I got a few funny looks when I mentioned confusion. All manner of tests were ordered. Vitamin and minerals, urea & electrolytes, full blood counts, etc. They all came back relatively ok, apart from me having consistently low Lymphocytes, and the night I went to A&E, my white cell and Neutrophils were raised. Fast forward to just before Christmas 2019 and I had lost a lot of weight (10 stone 7 to 8 stone 10) and had developed some pretty nasty symptoms ; vague hand tremors, bodily twitches, nerve zaps in my head and neck, chills were more ferocious and the dizziness just did not budge. Oh and nausea appeared early 2020, which was horrific. Almost as though every two minutes I thought I would throw up. During this time I got utterly obsessed with visiting A&E to try to get answers - they were utterly useless, as the most they did was put me on a drip and send me home with Buccastem for vertigo and passed it off as Menieres. At this point my mental health detoriated quite badly, I remember hitching a ride to Hexham off a family friend to try to get answers, only to find a village doctor (just one) in urgen care was so laid back and Doc Martin-like it was silly, so I hopped on a bus to the RVI in Newcastle for answers. They took my bloods, poo and pee and said because I was a) far from home and b) my immediate bloods were 'fine', they discharged me... infuriating. I did not want to leave to I trailed around Newcastle until the early hours and then re-appeared with claims of vomiting so they would see me and solve this mystery, they discharged me. I was not only worried and obssesed about my physical state, I was beginning to act a bit.. manic, erratic and dazed. Around this time I started a new job, and they sought me unfit for work because of how I looked, felt and was generally - but kept the job open for me in future. Heartbreaking. I cried alot Fast forward to now and I have severe dizziness, nerve pains in my head and neck, horrible neck, back, frontal muscle aches, general malaise and uneasiness (almost as though something is crawling in me) and a whole host of other symptoms, like personality changes and depression and panic attacks and autonomic dysfunction etc etc. Oh and my hands are very blotchy. I have had two brains MRI's, a CT on my kidneys and a frontal CT. The last CT found nothing bar a calcified granuloma in my liver, which in itself isnt an issue to me, but is a sign that my body has tried - and failed - to kill an invader and its become calcified over time. I am adamant the invder is stil here, an unwanted guest, acting shady and mysterious and sapping my energy and thieving my need for energy and new cell creation. Now I am pushing GP's who are painfully 'general' to a fault, and wish they would stop wanting to pin it on anxiety (dont ever tell a doc youre anxious!), A&E are under-resourced and basic, CHOC (Minor Injuries at Hospital) are powerless and void of any meaning and my specialist is a very, very busy man  - all while I am sat here wondering if this is Lymphoma, Toxoplasmosis, Bartonella / CSD, Lyme, a brain tumour that hasnt been spotted or something else - whether worse or 'better'. I have collapsed once already and woke up severly dizzy, confused and felt abit in shock. I hope that this story doesnt end with me collapsing in a heap amidst family members screaming 'oh what a shock' because to me it just would not be. I hope I get an answer soon because whatever this is will not stop until it kills me - it feels like it anyway. To be continued. 0 likes, 1 reply "

This is driving me crazy because I have never had something like this. It feels like my body does not want to listen to me any more.

Ive been struggling for a long time and today I realized Ive been dealing with cfs for some time now and not mono. The reason behind this is that my symptoms tends to be influenced by only one thing, which is stimulation of my autonomic system. Also it seems that my autonomic system is not working properly (any activity creates disproportional stress response even without me being actually stressed/nervous, and rest and relax response doesnt occur automatically like it should. . For example, yesterday I had a reaction to my immuno boosting meds, which basically make me tired, achy and a bit of fever as well, but I feel completely normal, just ill. I was like this the whole day not being able to move because of exhaustion (but felt like Im resting) . As soon as my friend came over and I got excited and going, the fatigue disappearred after crossing a treshold and I havent felt it even when I tried to to sleep that night. Consequently, I slept very badly, still stuck in the excited mode and even though I am usually not morning person, who likes to sleep in and lay in bed, I couldnt and had to get up because I was still wired from last night. There is a debate that this kind if prolonged activation of stress neural network is causing cfs. I will crash after this today or tommorow after the excitement high disappears. I can influence it a bit by active relaxation, but its happening automatically in my body, unrelated to how nervous I actually am. I havent been evaluated for it yet cause I was just too tired to go to another doctor, but Im gonna try to go next week. Take care everyone and I would like to thank you for all the support throughtout the years. Very special thanks to craig and his caring heart, I have you in my prayers dont worry. 1 like, 12 replies "

It has been a tough time lately, and now I am starting to think it's because I am having a rebound. here's a run down of everything. Got mono in may 2018, was very weak and sick that whole summer, symptoms lessened throughout the year and finally in summer 2019 I felt up to 90% better, yay! then in September started noticing more fatigue again. I specifically remember a day where I randomly woke up feeling super tired for no reason- my sleep had been very good. I felt off and had to take a nap before my class in the afternoon. Didn't think much of it. but now recalling that incident, ever since then I have had more fatigue. I would sleep 8-9 hours but still woke up feeling tired which didn't happen in the summer. My anxiety/depression has also been slowly getting worse over the winter months and especially so in the past few weeks. it is really mimicking the same type of feelings I had the first time. I also have trouble sleeping again just like the first time I got this virus as well. has anyone else had an experience like this? it has been almost two years since it all happened, i'm just pretty sick of it. I was feeling very good in the summer and I was quite active. maybe that was too much? I just thought it would only be up from there for sure.

After a while of obsessively looking for recovery stories on the forum, and feeling discouraged when I didn't find many, I promised myself I wouldn't return to the forum until I was well and could provide you all with an uplifting recovery story of my own. Well, since I am still not well and have come to realise a few things about this virus, I have to break that promise in order to discuss my thoughts on this virus/illness/condition with you. Not sure what I am looking to achieve, but hopefully get some further understanding on the mechanisms of this mystery virus, or whatever it is that is causing these strange symptoms. Summer 2016: Brain fog, memory problems and a buzzing/electrical feeling in my whole body started. Occasional nausea and irregular heartbeats. Chalked it up to not enough sleep.  Oct 2016 - April 2017: New job and new relationship. Started getting sick a lot with flus, colds, stomach problems, fungal infections and recurring cold sores (had them all my life but they increased in frequency). March 2017: Stressed out from my new competitive job and from having to call in sick all the time. Developed shingles (not common at the age of 26) along with headache and flu like symptoms.  April 2017: After the shingles had healed I started feeling dizzy, nauseous, nervous, had joint and muscle pain and was extremely fatigued. Quit my job as I felt my body was breaking down and I couldn't keep up with work. May 2017 - Aug 2017: Started a new low-stress job. Had occasional joint pain, pain between my shoulder blades and random burning on my skin during the summer. General health check only showed slightly elevated liver enzymes. Sep 2017: Moved in with boyfriend and started exercising several days a week. Soon got neck pain and a pressure like headache that stayed with me 24/7 for seven weeks straight and wasn't relieved by pain killers. Oct 2017: Caught a nasty flu-like virus with cold symptoms that stayed with me for 4 weeks. Nov 2017 - Apr 2018: The October flu never really went away, or rather, it morphed into the following symptoms: - Muscle twitches and a restless/buzzing feeling in the whole body - Muscle weakness - All over joint pain and burning muscle pain - Sharp nerve pains in forearms, hands and head - Tingling, pain and numbness in whole left facial nerve + jaw tremors - Intense pain and soreness in thoracic spine - Burning sensations on skin (felt like shingles but without the rash) - Blurry vision, light flashes, eye floaters, sensitvity to light - Sound sensitivity and high pitched tinnitus - Nausea and loss of appetite - Periodically severe anxiety and feelings of depersonalization - Brain fog and dizziness - Racing heart for no reason, irregular heartbeats - Breathing problems, felt like the breathing reflex sometimes just stopped working - Insomnia despite exhausted, night sweats - Low grade fevers and sore throat almost daily - ""Chemical smelling breath""  according to boyfriend - White tongue (brushing and scraping made no difference). - Petechiae in throat and on neck, chest, arms and dermatographia - Hair loss and beau's lines on my nails All symptoms worsened dramatically after any kind of physical exertion.  I saw several different doctors and specialists and had ALL the tests done (Lyme disease, MRI of brain, spinal tap, ophthalmologist, blood panel, liver enzymes, STDs, allergies etc etc... ) Everything looked absolutely normal. In april 2018 I demanded a monospot test despite already having had mononucleosis in my teens. The test turned out to be positive and I was SO relived to finally have an answer to my symptoms and knowing I would eventually get well. But the months came and went and I still had severe relapses after any kind of physical exertion. At best I felt 85% better for up to 5  days before crashing again. I saw an infectious disease doctor and told him about my never ending symptoms and the positive monospot. He said it was highly unlikely that I had had active EBV for over a year and that what was causing these kinds of symptoms. He said that the monospot test is very unreliable and often shows false positive due to other reasons such as inflammation/other viruses etc. He thought it sounded more like ME/CFS, and said that one CFS-theory is that an infection throws the immune system off balance and causes it to attack the bodys own nervous system. When they didn't find any measurable amount of EBV in my blood nor spinal fluid I went with the CFS/ME theory. I started taking really good care of myself in hopes of being one of those who actually recover from it within the first few years, before it becomes chronic. The severity of my symptoms have definitely lessened since April. My hair has stopped falling out (phew!), my body aches have lessened, brain fog is lighter etc... But I still have some level symtoms each day and I can definitely not do any kind of straining activity without relapsing big time. So yeah, it does seems to be along the lines of CFS/ME.  But here comes the mysterious part... My boyfriend has been experiencing a few similar symptoms to what I have had the last year: Night sweats, sharp shooting pains in his jaw and ear, muscle twitches, pain in hands and forearms and dizziness. They seem to have been mild, he has only mentioned them occasionally and he hasn't felt sick or flu like with them, so I have hoped that they were only coincidences and convinced myself  that I was being paranoid about them sounding similar to mine. (Note: he hasn't been aware that I have had these specific symptoms as I have had so many different ones that I have feared sounding like a crazy person if I told him about them all..) Anyways, now one of my closest friends has told me about these exact same ""mystery symptoms"" that she has been experiencing on and off for the last two years! (again, she doesn't know that I have had these specific symptoms either. I have just told everybody that I have had mono for a ridiculously long time as this is what I have believed). And now that I start thinking about it, I can think of a couple of more people in my social surrounding that have fallen sick with  some unknown virus this last year and been sick for an unreasonably long time. These people are all over the age of 27 which makes it highly unlikely that it is EBV going around since 95% of adults already have had the virus and reactivation is very uncommon. And the symptoms don't really match up with those of mononucleosis, as much I would like to tell myself that they do. When I read on CFS/ME forums (warning: don't do it!) they do have the exact same symptoms as I do... But so do war veterans affected by ""Gulf War illness""... And so do people who believe that they have ""chronic lyme disease""... And so do people who believe that they have ""chronic EBV""....  Could all of the above really be caused by the same thing? What they all have in common are the symptoms and that no one has yet to found an explanation for them. They all seem to be somewhat contagious, since they all seems to cause occasional cluster outbreaks. This makes me wonder if there is some sort of undetectable virus that some people are more vulnerable to, and others are immune to, since not everybody are affected? What are your thoughts? And to those of you who have the same kind of symptoms as I listed, does anyone else in your social environment also seem to be affected? All I know is I don't believe that my symptoms and the symptoms affecting some of my friends are due to EBV. But what then...? 0 likes, 29 replies "

Nov 2017 - Apr 2018: The October flu never really went away, or rather, it morphed into the following symptoms: - Muscle twitches and a restless/buzzing feeling in the whole body - Muscle weakness - All over joint pain and burning muscle pain - Sharp nerve pains in forearms, hands and head - Tingling, pain and numbness in whole left facial nerve + jaw tremors - Intense pain and soreness in thoracic spine - Burning sensations on skin (felt like shingles but without the rash) - Blurry vision, light flashes, eye floaters, sensitvity to light - Sound sensitivity and high pitched tinnitus - Nausea and loss of appetite - Periodically severe anxiety and feelings of depersonalization - Brain fog and dizziness - Racing heart for no reason, irregular heartbeats - Breathing problems, felt like the breathing reflex sometimes just stopped working - Insomnia despite exhausted, night sweats - Low grade fevers and sore throat almost daily - ""Chemical smelling breath""  according to boyfriend - White tongue (brushing and scraping made no difference). - Petechiae in throat and on neck, chest, arms and dermatographia - Hair loss and beau's lines on my nails All symptoms worsened dramatically after any kind of physical exertion.  I saw several different doctors and specialists and had ALL the tests done (Lyme disease, MRI of brain, spinal tap, ophthalmologist, blood panel, liver enzymes, STDs, allergies etc etc... ) Everything looked absolutely normal. In april 2018 I demanded a monospot test despite already having had mononucleosis in my teens. The test turned out to be positive and I was SO relived to finally have an answer to my symptoms and knowing I would eventually get well. But the months came and went and I still had severe relapses after any kind of physical exertion. At best I felt 85% better for up to 5  days before crashing again. I saw an infectious disease doctor and told him about my never ending symptoms and the positive monospot. He said it was highly unlikely that I had had active EBV for over a year and that what was causing these kinds of symptoms. He said that the monospot test is very unreliable and often shows false positive due to other reasons such as inflammation/other viruses etc. He thought it sounded more like ME/CFS, and said that one CFS-theory is that an infection throws the immune system off balance and causes it to attack the bodys own nervous system. When they didn't find any measurable amount of EBV in my blood nor spinal fluid I went with the CFS/ME theory. I started taking really good care of myself in hopes of being one of those who actually recover from it within the first few years, before it becomes chronic. The severity of my symptoms have definitely lessened since April. My hair has stopped falling out (phew!), my body aches have lessened, brain fog is lighter etc... But I still have some level symtoms each day and I can definitely not do any kind of straining activity without relapsing big time. So yeah, it does seems to be along the lines of CFS/ME.  But here comes the mysterious part... My boyfriend has been experiencing a few similar symptoms to what I have had the last year: Night sweats, sharp shooting pains in his jaw and ear, muscle twitches, pain in hands and forearms and dizziness. They seem to have been mild, he has only mentioned them occasionally and he hasn't felt sick or flu like with them, so I have hoped that they were only coincidences and convinced myself  that I was being paranoid about them sounding similar to mine. (Note: he hasn't been aware that I have had these specific symptoms as I have had so many different ones that I have feared sounding like a crazy person if I told him about them all..) Anyways, now one of my closest friends has told me about these exact same ""mystery symptoms"" that she has been experiencing on and off for the last two years! (again, she doesn't know that I have had these specific symptoms either. I have just told everybody that I have had mono for a ridiculously long time as this is what I have believed). And now that I start thinking about it, I can think of a couple of more people in my social surrounding that have fallen sick with  some unknown virus this last year and been sick for an unreasonably long time. These people are all over the age of 27 which makes it highly unlikely that it is EBV going around since 95% of adults already have had the virus and reactivation is very uncommon. And the symptoms don't really match up with those of mononucleosis, as much I would like to tell myself that they do. When I read on CFS/ME forums (warning: don't do it!) they do have the exact same symptoms as I do... But so do war veterans affected by ""Gulf War illness""... And so do people who believe that they have ""chronic lyme disease""... And so do people who believe that they have ""chronic EBV""....  Could all of the above really be caused by the same thing? What they all have in common are the symptoms and that no one has yet to found an explanation for them. They all seem to be somewhat contagious, since they all seems to cause occasional cluster outbreaks. This makes me wonder if there is some sort of undetectable virus that some people are more vulnerable to, and others are immune to, since not everybody are affected? What are your thoughts? And to those of you who have the same kind of symptoms as I listed, does anyone else in your social environment also seem to be affected? All I know is I don't believe that my symptoms and the symptoms affecting some of my friends are due to EBV. But what then...? 0 likes, 29 replies "

And so do people who believe that they have ""chronic lyme disease""... And so do people who believe that they have ""chronic EBV""....  Could all of the above really be caused by the same thing? What they all have in common are the symptoms and that no one has yet to found an explanation for them. They all seem to be somewhat contagious, since they all seems to cause occasional cluster outbreaks. This makes me wonder if there is some sort of undetectable virus that some people are more vulnerable to, and others are immune to, since not everybody are affected? What are your thoughts? And to those of you who have the same kind of symptoms as I listed, does anyone else in your social environment also seem to be affected?

After a while of obsessively looking for recovery stories on the forum, and feeling discouraged when I didn't find many, I promised myself I wouldn't return to the forum until I was well and could provide you all with an uplifting recovery story of my own. Well, since I am still not well and have come to realise a few things about this virus, I have to break that promise in order to discuss my thoughts on this virus/illness/condition with you. Not sure what I am looking to achieve, but hopefully get some further understanding on the mechanisms of this mystery virus, or whatever it is that is causing these strange symptoms. Summer 2016: Brain fog, memory problems and a buzzing/electrical feeling in my whole body started. Occasional nausea and irregular heartbeats. Chalked it up to not enough sleep.  Oct 2016 - April 2017: New job and new relationship. Started getting sick a lot with flus, colds, stomach problems, fungal infections and recurring cold sores (had them all my life but they increased in frequency). March 2017: Stressed out from my new competitive job and from having to call in sick all the time. Developed shingles (not common at the age of 26) along with headache and flu like symptoms.  April 2017: After the shingles had healed I started feeling dizzy, nauseous, nervous, had joint and muscle pain and was extremely fatigued. Quit my job as I felt my body was breaking down and I couldn't keep up with work. May 2017 - Aug 2017: Started a new low-stress job. Had occasional joint pain, pain between my shoulder blades and random burning on my skin during the summer. General health check only showed slightly elevated liver enzymes. Sep 2017: Moved in with boyfriend and started exercising several days a week. Soon got neck pain and a pressure like headache that stayed with me 24/7 for seven weeks straight and wasn't relieved by pain killers. Oct 2017: Caught a nasty flu-like virus with cold symptoms that stayed with me for 4 weeks. Nov 2017 - Apr 2018: The October flu never really went away, or rather, it morphed into the following symptoms: - Muscle twitches and a restless/buzzing feeling in the whole body - Muscle weakness - All over joint pain and burning muscle pain - Sharp nerve pains in forearms, hands and head - Tingling, pain and numbness in whole left facial nerve + jaw tremors - Intense pain and soreness in thoracic spine - Burning sensations on skin (felt like shingles but without the rash) - Blurry vision, light flashes, eye floaters, sensitvity to light - Sound sensitivity and high pitched tinnitus - Nausea and loss of appetite - Periodically severe anxiety and feelings of depersonalization - Brain fog and dizziness - Racing heart for no reason, irregular heartbeats - Breathing problems, felt like the breathing reflex sometimes just stopped working - Insomnia despite exhausted, night sweats - Low grade fevers and sore throat almost daily - ""Chemical smelling breath""  according to boyfriend - White tongue (brushing and scraping made no difference). - Petechiae in throat and on neck, chest, arms and dermatographia - Hair loss and beau's lines on my nails All symptoms worsened dramatically after any kind of physical exertion.  I saw several different doctors and specialists and had ALL the tests done (Lyme disease, MRI of brain, spinal tap, ophthalmologist, blood panel, liver enzymes, STDs, allergies etc etc... ) Everything looked absolutely normal. In april 2018 I demanded a monospot test despite already having had mononucleosis in my teens. The test turned out to be positive and I was SO relived to finally have an answer to my symptoms and knowing I would eventually get well. But the months came and went and I still had severe relapses after any kind of physical exertion. At best I felt 85% better for up to 5  days before crashing again. I saw an infectious disease doctor and told him about my never ending symptoms and the positive monospot. He said it was highly unlikely that I had had active EBV for over a year and that what was causing these kinds of symptoms. He said that the monospot test is very unreliable and often shows false positive due to other reasons such as inflammation/other viruses etc. He thought it sounded more like ME/CFS, and said that one CFS-theory is that an infection throws the immune system off balance and causes it to attack the bodys own nervous system. When they didn't find any measurable amount of EBV in my blood nor spinal fluid I went with the CFS/ME theory. I started taking really good care of myself in hopes of being one of those who actually recover from it within the first few years, before it becomes chronic. The severity of my symptoms have definitely lessened since April. My hair has stopped falling out (phew!), my body aches have lessened, brain fog is lighter etc... But I still have some level symtoms each day and I can definitely not do any kind of straining activity without relapsing big time. So yeah, it does seems to be along the lines of CFS/ME.  But here comes the mysterious part... My boyfriend has been experiencing a few similar symptoms to what I have had the last year: Night sweats, sharp shooting pains in his jaw and ear, muscle twitches, pain in hands and forearms and dizziness. They seem to have been mild, he has only mentioned them occasionally and he hasn't felt sick or flu like with them, so I have hoped that they were only coincidences and convinced myself  that I was being paranoid about them sounding similar to mine. (Note: he hasn't been aware that I have had these specific symptoms as I have had so many different ones that I have feared sounding like a crazy person if I told him about them all..) Anyways, now one of my closest friends has told me about these exact same ""mystery symptoms"" that she has been experiencing on and off for the last two years! (again, she doesn't know that I have had these specific symptoms either. I have just told everybody that I have had mono for a ridiculously long time as this is what I have believed). And now that I start thinking about it, I can think of a couple of more people in my social surrounding that have fallen sick with  some unknown virus this last year and been sick for an unreasonably long time. These people are all over the age of 27 which makes it highly unlikely that it is EBV going around since 95% of adults already have had the virus and reactivation is very uncommon. And the symptoms don't really match up with those of mononucleosis, as much I would like to tell myself that they do. When I read on CFS/ME forums (warning: don't do it!) they do have the exact same symptoms as I do... But so do war veterans affected by ""Gulf War illness""...

Developed shingles (not common at the age of 26) along with headache and flu like symptoms.  April 2017: After the shingles had healed I started feeling dizzy, nauseous, nervous, had joint and muscle pain and was extremely fatigued. Quit my job as I felt my body was breaking down and I couldn't keep up with work. May 2017 - Aug 2017: Started a new low-stress job. Had occasional joint pain, pain between my shoulder blades and random burning on my skin during the summer. General health check only showed slightly elevated liver enzymes. Sep 2017: Moved in with boyfriend and started exercising several days a week. Soon got neck pain and a pressure like headache that stayed with me 24/7 for seven weeks straight and wasn't relieved by pain killers. Oct 2017: Caught a nasty flu-like virus with cold symptoms that stayed with me for 4 weeks. Nov 2017 - Apr 2018: The October flu never really went away, or rather, it morphed into the following symptoms: - Muscle twitches and a restless/buzzing feeling in the whole body - Muscle weakness - All over joint pain and burning muscle pain - Sharp nerve pains in forearms, hands and head - Tingling, pain and numbness in whole left facial nerve + jaw tremors - Intense pain and soreness in thoracic spine - Burning sensations on skin (felt like shingles but without the rash) - Blurry vision, light flashes, eye floaters, sensitvity to light - Sound sensitivity and high pitched tinnitus - Nausea and loss of appetite - Periodically severe anxiety and feelings of depersonalization - Brain fog and dizziness - Racing heart for no reason, irregular heartbeats - Breathing problems, felt like the breathing reflex sometimes just stopped working - Insomnia despite exhausted, night sweats - Low grade fevers and sore throat almost daily - ""Chemical smelling breath""  according to boyfriend - White tongue (brushing and scraping made no difference). - Petechiae in throat and on neck, chest, arms and dermatographia - Hair loss and beau's lines on my nails All symptoms worsened dramatically after any kind of physical exertion.  I saw several different doctors and specialists and had ALL the tests done (Lyme disease, MRI of brain, spinal tap, ophthalmologist, blood panel, liver enzymes, STDs, allergies etc etc... ) Everything looked absolutely normal. In april 2018 I demanded a monospot test despite already having had mononucleosis in my teens. The test turned out to be positive and I was SO relived to finally have an answer to my symptoms and knowing I would eventually get well. But the months came and went and I still had severe relapses after any kind of physical exertion. At best I felt 85% better for up to 5  days before crashing again. I saw an infectious disease doctor and told him about my never ending symptoms and the positive monospot. He said it was highly unlikely that I had had active EBV for over a year and that what was causing these kinds of symptoms. He said that the monospot test is very unreliable and often shows false positive due to other reasons such as inflammation/other viruses etc. He thought it sounded more like ME/CFS, and said that one CFS-theory is that an infection throws the immune system off balance and causes it to attack the bodys own nervous system. When they didn't find any measurable amount of EBV in my blood nor spinal fluid I went with the CFS/ME theory. I started taking really good care of myself in hopes of being one of those who actually recover from it within the first few years, before it becomes chronic. The severity of my symptoms have definitely lessened since April. My hair has stopped falling out (phew!), my body aches have lessened, brain fog is lighter etc... But I still have some level symtoms each day and I can definitely not do any kind of straining activity without relapsing big time. So yeah, it does seems to be along the lines of CFS/ME.  But here comes the mysterious part... My boyfriend has been experiencing a few similar symptoms to what I have had the last year: Night sweats, sharp shooting pains in his jaw and ear, muscle twitches, pain in hands and forearms and dizziness. They seem to have been mild, he has only mentioned them occasionally and he hasn't felt sick or flu like with them, so I have hoped that they were only coincidences and convinced myself  that I was being paranoid about them sounding similar to mine. (Note: he hasn't been aware that I have had these specific symptoms as I have had so many different ones that I have feared sounding like a crazy person if I told him about them all..) Anyways, now one of my closest friends has told me about these exact same ""mystery symptoms"" that she has been experiencing on and off for the last two years! (again, she doesn't know that I have had these specific symptoms either. I have just told everybody that I have had mono for a ridiculously long time as this is what I have believed). And now that I start thinking about it, I can think of a couple of more people in my social surrounding that have fallen sick with  some unknown virus this last year and been sick for an unreasonably long time. These people are all over the age of 27 which makes it highly unlikely that it is EBV going around since 95% of adults already have had the virus and reactivation is very uncommon. And the symptoms don't really match up with those of mononucleosis, as much I would like to tell myself that they do. When I read on CFS/ME forums (warning: don't do it!) they do have the exact same symptoms as I do... But so do war veterans affected by ""Gulf War illness""... And so do people who believe that they have ""chronic lyme disease""... And so do people who believe that they have ""chronic EBV""....  Could all of the above really be caused by the same thing? What they all have in common are the symptoms and that no one has yet to found an explanation for them. They all seem to be somewhat contagious, since they all seems to cause occasional cluster outbreaks. This makes me wonder if there is some sort of undetectable virus that some people are more vulnerable to, and others are immune to, since not everybody are affected? What are your thoughts? And to those of you who have the same kind of symptoms as I listed, does anyone else in your social environment also seem to be affected? All I know is I don't believe that my symptoms and the symptoms affecting some of my friends are due to EBV. But what then...? 0 likes, 29 replies "

I have just told everybody that I have had mono for a ridiculously long time as this is what I have believed). And now that I start thinking about it, I can think of a couple of more people in my social surrounding that have fallen sick with  some unknown virus this last year and been sick for an unreasonably long time. These people are all over the age of 27 which makes it highly unlikely that it is EBV going around since 95% of adults already have had the virus and reactivation is very uncommon. And the symptoms don't really match up with those of mononucleosis, as much I would like to tell myself that they do. When I read on CFS/ME forums (warning: don't do it!) they do have the exact same symptoms as I do... But so do war veterans affected by ""Gulf War illness""... And so do people who believe that they have ""chronic lyme disease""... And so do people who believe that they have ""chronic EBV""....  Could all of the above really be caused by the same thing? What they all have in common are the symptoms and that no one has yet to found an explanation for them. They all seem to be somewhat contagious, since they all seems to cause occasional cluster outbreaks. This makes me wonder if there is some sort of undetectable virus that some people are more vulnerable to, and others are immune to, since not everybody are affected? What are your thoughts? And to those of you who have the same kind of symptoms as I listed, does anyone else in your social environment also seem to be affected? All I know is I don't believe that my symptoms and the symptoms affecting some of my friends are due to EBV. But what then...? 0 likes, 29 replies "

After a while of obsessively looking for recovery stories on the forum, and feeling discouraged when I didn't find many, I promised myself I wouldn't return to the forum until I was well and could provide you all with an uplifting recovery story of my own. Well, since I am still not well and have come to realise a few things about this virus, I have to break that promise in order to discuss my thoughts on this virus/illness/condition with you. Not sure what I am looking to achieve, but hopefully get some further understanding on the mechanisms of this mystery virus, or whatever it is that is causing these strange symptoms. Summer 2016: Brain fog, memory problems and a buzzing/electrical feeling in my whole body started. Occasional nausea and irregular heartbeats. Chalked it up to not enough sleep.  Oct 2016 - April 2017: New job and new relationship. Started getting sick a lot with flus, colds, stomach problems, fungal infections and recurring cold sores (had them all my life but they increased in frequency). March 2017: Stressed out from my new competitive job and from having to call in sick all the time. Developed shingles (not common at the age of 26) along with headache and flu like symptoms.  April 2017: After the shingles had healed I started feeling dizzy, nauseous, nervous, had joint and muscle pain and was extremely fatigued. Quit my job as I felt my body was breaking down and I couldn't keep up with work. May 2017 - Aug 2017: Started a new low-stress job. Had occasional joint pain, pain between my shoulder blades and random burning on my skin during the summer. General health check only showed slightly elevated liver enzymes. Sep 2017: Moved in with boyfriend and started exercising several days a week. Soon got neck pain and a pressure like headache that stayed with me 24/7 for seven weeks straight and wasn't relieved by pain killers. Oct 2017: Caught a nasty flu-like virus with cold symptoms that stayed with me for 4 weeks. Nov 2017 - Apr 2018: The October flu never really went away, or rather, it morphed into the following symptoms: - Muscle twitches and a restless/buzzing feeling in the whole body - Muscle weakness - All over joint pain and burning muscle pain - Sharp nerve pains in forearms, hands and head - Tingling, pain and numbness in whole left facial nerve + jaw tremors - Intense pain and soreness in thoracic spine - Burning sensations on skin (felt like shingles but without the rash) - Blurry vision, light flashes, eye floaters, sensitvity to light - Sound sensitivity and high pitched tinnitus - Nausea and loss of appetite - Periodically severe anxiety and feelings of depersonalization - Brain fog and dizziness - Racing heart for no reason, irregular heartbeats - Breathing problems, felt like the breathing reflex sometimes just stopped working - Insomnia despite exhausted, night sweats - Low grade fevers and sore throat almost daily - ""Chemical smelling breath""  according to boyfriend - White tongue (brushing and scraping made no difference). - Petechiae in throat and on neck, chest, arms and dermatographia - Hair loss and beau's lines on my nails All symptoms worsened dramatically after any kind of physical exertion.  I saw several different doctors and specialists and had ALL the tests done (Lyme disease, MRI of brain, spinal tap, ophthalmologist, blood panel, liver enzymes, STDs, allergies etc etc... ) Everything looked absolutely normal. In april 2018 I demanded a monospot test despite already having had mononucleosis in my teens. The test turned out to be positive and I was SO relived to finally have an answer to my symptoms and knowing I would eventually get well. But the months came and went and I still had severe relapses after any kind of physical exertion. At best I felt 85% better for up to 5  days before crashing again. I saw an infectious disease doctor and told him about my never ending symptoms and the positive monospot. He said it was highly unlikely that I had had active EBV for over a year and that what was causing these kinds of symptoms. He said that the monospot test is very unreliable and often shows false positive due to other reasons such as inflammation/other viruses etc. He thought it sounded more like ME/CFS, and said that one CFS-theory is that an infection throws the immune system off balance and causes it to attack the bodys own nervous system. When they didn't find any measurable amount of EBV in my blood nor spinal fluid I went with the CFS/ME theory. I started taking really good care of myself in hopes of being one of those who actually recover from it within the first few years, before it becomes chronic. The severity of my symptoms have definitely lessened since April. My hair has stopped falling out (phew!), my body aches have lessened, brain fog is lighter etc... But I still have some level symtoms each day and I can definitely not do any kind of straining activity without relapsing big time. So yeah, it does seems to be along the lines of CFS/ME.  But here comes the mysterious part... My boyfriend has been experiencing a few similar symptoms to what I have had the last year: Night sweats, sharp shooting pains in his jaw and ear, muscle twitches, pain in hands and forearms and dizziness. They seem to have been mild, he has only mentioned them occasionally and he hasn't felt sick or flu like with them, so I have hoped that they were only coincidences and convinced myself  that I was being paranoid about them sounding similar to mine. (Note: he hasn't been aware that I have had these specific symptoms as I have had so many different ones that I have feared sounding like a crazy person if I told him about them all..) Anyways, now one of my closest friends has told me about these exact same ""mystery symptoms"" that she has been experiencing on and off for the last two years! (again, she doesn't know that I have had these specific symptoms either.

After a while of obsessively looking for recovery stories on the forum, and feeling discouraged when I didn't find many, I promised myself I wouldn't return to the forum until I was well and could provide you all with an uplifting recovery story of my own. Well, since I am still not well and have come to realise a few things about this virus, I have to break that promise in order to discuss my thoughts on this virus/illness/condition with you. Not sure what I am looking to achieve, but hopefully get some further understanding on the mechanisms of this mystery virus, or whatever it is that is causing these strange symptoms. Summer 2016: Brain fog, memory problems and a buzzing/electrical feeling in my whole body started. Occasional nausea and irregular heartbeats. Chalked it up to not enough sleep.  Oct 2016 - April 2017: New job and new relationship. Started getting sick a lot with flus, colds, stomach problems, fungal infections and recurring cold sores (had them all my life but they increased in frequency). March 2017: Stressed out from my new competitive job and from having to call in sick all the time. Developed shingles (not common at the age of 26) along with headache and flu like symptoms.  April 2017: After the shingles had healed I started feeling dizzy, nauseous, nervous, had joint and muscle pain and was extremely fatigued. Quit my job as I felt my body was breaking down and I couldn't keep up with work. May 2017 - Aug 2017: Started a new low-stress job. Had occasional joint pain, pain between my shoulder blades and random burning on my skin during the summer. General health check only showed slightly elevated liver enzymes. Sep 2017: Moved in with boyfriend and started exercising several days a week. Soon got neck pain and a pressure like headache that stayed with me 24/7 for seven weeks straight and wasn't relieved by pain killers. Oct 2017: Caught a nasty flu-like virus with cold symptoms that stayed with me for 4 weeks. Nov 2017 - Apr 2018: The October flu never really went away, or rather, it morphed into the following symptoms: - Muscle twitches and a restless/buzzing feeling in the whole body - Muscle weakness - All over joint pain and burning muscle pain - Sharp nerve pains in forearms, hands and head - Tingling, pain and numbness in whole left facial nerve + jaw tremors - Intense pain and soreness in thoracic spine - Burning sensations on skin (felt like shingles but without the rash) - Blurry vision, light flashes, eye floaters, sensitvity to light - Sound sensitivity and high pitched tinnitus - Nausea and loss of appetite - Periodically severe anxiety and feelings of depersonalization - Brain fog and dizziness - Racing heart for no reason, irregular heartbeats - Breathing problems, felt like the breathing reflex sometimes just stopped working - Insomnia despite exhausted, night sweats - Low grade fevers and sore throat almost daily - ""Chemical smelling breath""  according to boyfriend - White tongue (brushing and scraping made no difference). - Petechiae in throat and on neck, chest, arms and dermatographia - Hair loss and beau's lines on my nails All symptoms worsened dramatically after any kind of physical exertion.  I saw several different doctors and specialists and had ALL the tests done (Lyme disease, MRI of brain, spinal tap, ophthalmologist, blood panel, liver enzymes, STDs, allergies etc etc... ) Everything looked absolutely normal. In april 2018 I demanded a monospot test despite already having had mononucleosis in my teens. The test turned out to be positive and I was SO relived to finally have an answer to my symptoms and knowing I would eventually get well. But the months came and went and I still had severe relapses after any kind of physical exertion. At best I felt 85% better for up to 5  days before crashing again. I saw an infectious disease doctor and told him about my never ending symptoms and the positive monospot. He said it was highly unlikely that I had had active EBV for over a year and that what was causing these kinds of symptoms. He said that the monospot test is very unreliable and often shows false positive due to other reasons such as inflammation/other viruses etc. He thought it sounded more like ME/CFS, and said that one CFS-theory is that an infection throws the immune system off balance and causes it to attack the bodys own nervous system. When they didn't find any measurable amount of EBV in my blood nor spinal fluid I went with the CFS/ME theory. I started taking really good care of myself in hopes of being one of those who actually recover from it within the first few years, before it becomes chronic. The severity of my symptoms have definitely lessened since April. My hair has stopped falling out (phew!), my body aches have lessened, brain fog is lighter etc... But I still have some level symtoms each day and I can definitely not do any kind of straining activity without relapsing big time. So yeah, it does seems to be along the lines of CFS/ME.  But here comes the mysterious part... My boyfriend has been experiencing a few similar symptoms to what I have had the last year: Night sweats, sharp shooting pains in his jaw and ear, muscle twitches, pain in hands and forearms and dizziness. They seem to have been mild, he has only mentioned them occasionally and he hasn't felt sick or flu like with them, so I have hoped that they were only coincidences and convinced myself  that I was being paranoid about them sounding similar to mine. (Note: he hasn't been aware that I have had these specific symptoms as I have had so many different ones that I have feared sounding like a crazy person if I told him about them all..) Anyways, now one of my closest friends has told me about these exact same ""mystery symptoms"" that she has been experiencing on and off for the last two years! (again, she doesn't know that I have had these specific symptoms either. I have just told everybody that I have had mono for a ridiculously long time as this is what I have believed). And now that I start thinking about it, I can think of a couple of more people in my social surrounding that have fallen sick with  some unknown virus this last year and been sick for an unreasonably long time. These people are all over the age of 27 which makes it highly unlikely that it is EBV going around since 95% of adults already have had the virus and reactivation is very uncommon. And the symptoms don't really match up with those of mononucleosis, as much I would like to tell myself that they do. When I read on CFS/ME forums (warning: don't do it!) they do have the exact same symptoms as I do... But so do war veterans affected by ""Gulf War illness""... And so do people who believe that they have ""chronic lyme disease""... And so do people who believe that they have ""chronic EBV""....  Could all of the above really be caused by the same thing? What they all have in common are the symptoms and that no one has yet to found an explanation for them. They all seem to be somewhat contagious, since they all seems to cause occasional cluster outbreaks. This makes me wonder if there is some sort of undetectable virus that some people are more vulnerable to, and others are immune to, since not everybody are affected? What are your thoughts? And to those of you who have the same kind of symptoms as I listed, does anyone else in your social environment also seem to be affected? All I know is I don't believe that my symptoms and the symptoms affecting some of my friends are due to EBV. But what then...? 0 likes, 29 replies "

Nov 2017 - Apr 2018: The October flu never really went away, or rather, it morphed into the following symptoms: - Muscle twitches and a restless/buzzing feeling in the whole body - Muscle weakness - All over joint pain and burning muscle pain - Sharp nerve pains in forearms, hands and head - Tingling, pain and numbness in whole left facial nerve + jaw tremors - Intense pain and soreness in thoracic spine - Burning sensations on skin (felt like shingles but without the rash) - Blurry vision, light flashes, eye floaters, sensitvity to light - Sound sensitivity and high pitched tinnitus - Nausea and loss of appetite - Periodically severe anxiety and feelings of depersonalization - Brain fog and dizziness - Racing heart for no reason, irregular heartbeats - Breathing problems, felt like the breathing reflex sometimes just stopped working - Insomnia despite exhausted, night sweats - Low grade fevers and sore throat almost daily - ""Chemical smelling breath""  according to boyfriend - White tongue (brushing and scraping made no difference). - Petechiae in throat and on neck, chest, arms and dermatographia - Hair loss and beau's lines on my nails All symptoms worsened dramatically after any kind of physical exertion.  I saw several different doctors and specialists and had ALL the tests done (Lyme disease, MRI of brain, spinal tap, ophthalmologist, blood panel, liver enzymes, STDs, allergies etc etc... ) Everything looked absolutely normal. In april 2018 I demanded a monospot test despite already having had mononucleosis in my teens. The test turned out to be positive and I was SO relived to finally have an answer to my symptoms and knowing I would eventually get well. But the months came and went and I still had severe relapses after any kind of physical exertion. At best I felt 85% better for up to 5  days before crashing again. I saw an infectious disease doctor and told him about my never ending symptoms and the positive monospot. He said it was highly unlikely that I had had active EBV for over a year and that what was causing these kinds of symptoms. He said that the monospot test is very unreliable and often shows false positive due to other reasons such as inflammation/other viruses etc. He thought it sounded more like ME/CFS, and said that one CFS-theory is that an infection throws the immune system off balance and causes it to attack the bodys own nervous system. When they didn't find any measurable amount of EBV in my blood nor spinal fluid I went with the CFS/ME theory. I started taking really good care of myself in hopes of being one of those who actually recover from it within the first few years, before it becomes chronic. The severity of my symptoms have definitely lessened since April. My hair has stopped falling out (phew!), my body aches have lessened, brain fog is lighter etc... But I still have some level symtoms each day and I can definitely not do any kind of straining activity without relapsing big time. So yeah, it does seems to be along the lines of CFS/ME.  But here comes the mysterious part... My boyfriend has been experiencing a few similar symptoms to what I have had the last year: Night sweats, sharp shooting pains in his jaw and ear, muscle twitches, pain in hands and forearms and dizziness. They seem to have been mild, he has only mentioned them occasionally and he hasn't felt sick or flu like with them, so I have hoped that they were only coincidences and convinced myself  that I was being paranoid about them sounding similar to mine. (Note: he hasn't been aware that I have had these specific symptoms as I have had so many different ones that I have feared sounding like a crazy person if I told him about them all..) Anyways, now one of my closest friends has told me about these exact same ""mystery symptoms"" that she has been experiencing on and off for the last two years! (again, she doesn't know that I have had these specific symptoms either. I have just told everybody that I have had mono for a ridiculously long time as this is what I have believed). And now that I start thinking about it, I can think of a couple of more people in my social surrounding that have fallen sick with  some unknown virus this last year and been sick for an unreasonably long time. These people are all over the age of 27 which makes it highly unlikely that it is EBV going around since 95% of adults already have had the virus and reactivation is very uncommon. And the symptoms don't really match up with those of mononucleosis, as much I would like to tell myself that they do. When I read on CFS/ME forums (warning: don't do it!) they do have the exact same symptoms as I do... But so do war veterans affected by ""Gulf War illness""... And so do people who believe that they have ""chronic lyme disease""... And so do people who believe that they have ""chronic EBV""....  Could all of the above really be caused by the same thing? What they all have in common are the symptoms and that no one has yet to found an explanation for them. They all seem to be somewhat contagious, since they all seems to cause occasional cluster outbreaks. This makes me wonder if there is some sort of undetectable virus that some people are more vulnerable to, and others are immune to, since not everybody are affected? What are your thoughts? And to those of you who have the same kind of symptoms as I listed, does anyone else in your social environment also seem to be affected? All I know is I don't believe that my symptoms and the symptoms affecting some of my friends are due to EBV. But what then...? 0 likes, 29 replies "

After a while of obsessively looking for recovery stories on the forum, and feeling discouraged when I didn't find many, I promised myself I wouldn't return to the forum until I was well and could provide you all with an uplifting recovery story of my own. Well, since I am still not well and have come to realise a few things about this virus, I have to break that promise in order to discuss my thoughts on this virus/illness/condition with you. Not sure what I am looking to achieve, but hopefully get some further understanding on the mechanisms of this mystery virus, or whatever it is that is causing these strange symptoms. Summer 2016: Brain fog, memory problems and a buzzing/electrical feeling in my whole body started. Occasional nausea and irregular heartbeats. Chalked it up to not enough sleep.  Oct 2016 - April 2017: New job and new relationship. Started getting sick a lot with flus, colds, stomach problems, fungal infections and recurring cold sores (had them all my life but they increased in frequency). March 2017: Stressed out from my new competitive job and from having to call in sick all the time. Developed shingles (not common at the age of 26) along with headache and flu like symptoms.  April 2017: After the shingles had healed I started feeling dizzy, nauseous, nervous, had joint and muscle pain and was extremely fatigued. Quit my job as I felt my body was breaking down and I couldn't keep up with work. May 2017 - Aug 2017: Started a new low-stress job. Had occasional joint pain, pain between my shoulder blades and random burning on my skin during the summer. General health check only showed slightly elevated liver enzymes. Sep 2017: Moved in with boyfriend and started exercising several days a week. Soon got neck pain and a pressure like headache that stayed with me 24/7 for seven weeks straight and wasn't relieved by pain killers.

I think there's a negative post bias that understandably happens where most people post when they're concerned, but not when they've recovered. This can give someone viewing the posts a pessimistic impression of recovery. On the other hand reading someone's recovery story, including the darkest parts of the illness, can give hope and aid in the healing process. I'm still in recovery myself, so I don't have a story yet, but I invite you all to post your recovery story, or other stories you've found / been told.  Thanks! -Jesse 6 likes, 266 replies "

I am a 28 year old male and used to be very healthy and in the best shape of my life before I suddenly came down with this and the last couple months of my life has been like hell and the worst thing I've ever gone through. I was wondering if someone could tell me if they think I have it or not...or if someone has any idea what I am suffering from. Please bear with me for this is going to be quite long. It all started when I caught a weird flu-like bug going on vacation to korea back in december and experienced sudden flu-like and food poisoning symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, severe bodyaches, chills, severe fatigue and weakness, loss of appetite, and sometimes shortness of breath that landed me in the ER a couple times. Despite the couple trips, doctors couldn't find what was wrong with me as urine samples, blood tests, flu tests, and xrays all returned negative.  So I cut my vacation short and returned back to the states to get re-evaluated by my PCP. Immediately upon my return, I saw my PCP who told me he thinks I'm just going through the remnants of a bug I caught in Korea and should be back to normal soon after it runs its course. Couple days upon coming back, I realized a brief reprieve in some of my symptoms, diarrhea had subsided, appetite was slowly coming back, and I started experiencing some upper respiratory symptoms for a couple days such as cough, runny nose, congestion, but the debilitating fatigue, bodyaches, and weakness seemed to have dissipated.. then there were a couple days of feeling 90% normal aside for a very slight sense of dizziness which I attributed to just being bed-ridden for awhile and jet lag. Overjoyed with my recovery, I went out to go shopping at outlets, went out to meet with friends, and did some music practice...things I did normally before I became ill. I was still on vacation from work so there was nothing stressing me.. until I got into a big fight with my girlfriend and thought we were going to break up...which got me extremely sad...I remember crying myself to sleep that night. The following day I remember a relapse of symptoms similar to how I felt in Korea which included the severe fatigue, nausea, weakness, body aches, some heartburn-like IBS symptoms but no diarrhea, and again a decline in appetite, and on top of this, I had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Waking up in the mornings I felt unrefreshed, dizzy, and not too different from how I went to sleep the night before. Needless to say, I went back to my doctor who prescribed me so antidepressants (zoloft) to try and also did a full workup of my blood which came back normal again. He told me to give it another week or two and that I should feel gradually better. So for the next couple weeks I went through periods of briefly feeling better where I can run a couple errands outside like groceries and do some light exercise (walks) and ""crashes"" where I would be house-ridden and able only to do basic things like eat, wash up, watch tv, etc. I took a disability leave from work as I was unable to focus at work and the one day I tried to return, I ended up in urgent care with another attack similar to what I experienced in korea only to have the doctor send me back home saying everything is checking out fine. After about 8-9 weeks of this I did notice some gradual recovery with some lesser relapses in between: - I would be asymptomatic for longer periods during the day (I would have a 3-4 hour window of ""no symptoms"" in the beginning of jan when symptoms first re-emerged...then at this point it was more like I would have 3-4 hours total during a bad day I would feel symptoms and sometimes no symptoms at all on good days) -I started getting 7-14 day streaks of no symptoms. -On days I would exhibit symptoms it would be a less severe form of it which would include: -fatigue, but not quite as debilitating -slight loss of appetite -no more ibs or trouble falling asleep -no more diarrhea -no upper respiratory symptoms at all However, about every other week, I would experience a return of symptoms lasting a couple days (occuring in 1-3 hr episodes during the day) that included: -extremely tired (physically/mentally) -unmotivated to do anything, would dread doing things at times as if impending doom -usually cold -slightly nauseous -feel sensation of stuffiness but cold as if indigested -tingly sensation throughout arms and body as if bloodflow is restricted -happens more often in the afternoons after some exertion -feel slight pressure in the sinuses -usually accompanied with loss of appetite -lightheaded/dizzy -usually sad/moody/depressed/easily irritable/very sensitive Reported all this to my doctor and although he still stood by his initial guess that it was just a bug that was working itself through my system, he referred me to an ID specialist who ran about 15 different viral/immune tests on my blood including HIV, EBV, CMV, HHV6, syphilis, ESR, ANA, blood cultures for blood bacteria, IgG, IgM, and a couple others which all came back negative. Following all the tests, both doctors stood by their initial guesses that I just may have caught a very bad form of the flu (influenza) that may have not been properly detected in korea that is taking a particularly long time to clear out of my system given I was under stress and time zone changes and different environment (record cold temperatures in korea...I was never exposed to such cold temperatures in my life as I am from Southern California). Since the results of the viral testing has come back I haven't noticed (at least to me) any significant improvements in my symptoms... and so decided to try acupuncture for a few weeks which I have not noticed too much of a noticeable improvement in symptoms...stil couple days to a week of good followed by symptomatic days where I would experience the symptoms I mentioned above in varying intensities for 1-3 hours a day. My girlfriend and family suggested that I return to work and try to expose my body to normality again as I used to be a very active/healthy guy (would go to gym to do strength training 6 times a week, and sometimes play couple hours of full court, high intensity basketball on weekends on top of a 40+ hour work day and very involved in my local church community) and perhaps my body was just deconditioned from such a long period of inactivity and that maybe it was a mental/psychological thing. So here I am having completed one full week of work (9 hour days) now and noticed the following things: -I can get through a full day of work, albeit barely (yay!) -some days are better than others. -I am extremely exhausted after work...feel like I can't move a muscle. -Current symptoms include: *a constant dull pulsating pressure sensation behind my nose(sinuses) that causes mild to moderate dizziness and sometimes mild nausea, can last all morning and afternoon..I feel like this is the only symptom that has increased in severity perhaps because my uptick in activity? *a drastic increase in appetite (i feel frequently hungry) *increased urination..need to urinate every hour it seems like *constantly slightly tired (sleepy) *slight fatigue/body aches during the morning/afternoon..to pretty severe for about an hour or 2 after work. *moments of unmotivatedness/difficulty concentrating *moments of constricting of airways in nose making it difficult to breath productively but no mucus It just feels like it's 2-3 times harder to go through a normal day of work than it used to be before I got this illness. I am no longer sad so I stopped taking my antidepressants and feel like I'm constantly operating on a deficit of energy since returning to work... I am so sick of tracking how I am feeling and not being able to exercise like I used to or hanging out with people like I used to because I'm so ""tired"" all the time...Now I'm telling people at work that I am ""better"" but I'm definitely not and feel like I may hit another major crash going on like this... Obviously CFS is a far-off assumption (says my doctors) but I have been really identifying with some hallmark CFS symptoms like post exertional malaise, extreme unrelenting fatigue, and unrefreshing sleep... however I have experienced a gradual degree of improvement too? Sometimes when I'm in the middle of my pain I forget the strides I have made. Regardless, there are some things that I have yet to be checked as my doctors have employed a ""watchful waiting"" strategy which has been very frustrating to me...but here are some things I am suspicious of: -hormonal issues (thyroid problems or adrenal insufficiency/fatigue?) -heart issues (sometimes i feel stuffiness in my chest as well as tingling sensation in my arms as if circulation is not happening as it should...I have an odd feeling my ongoing dizziness might be related) -sinus issues (I have a history of sinus infections and thinking maybe it may be related...although my sinus pressure/dizziness doesn't come with any mucus, runny nose, discharge, or any of the classic sinusitis symptoms) -neurological issues (I have had a history of 2-3 months of severe headache/facial pain episodes, some people told me the pressure in my sinus/head can be a migraine) Seeing my doctor this coming Thurs and going to demand referrals to an ENT, neurologist, and an ECG, along with a hormonal test which I'm not sure why he did not do earlier... I mentioned some of these before but he would simply just brush me off saying those were highly unlikely and since I'm a healthy young guy, I don't fit the usual ""demographic"" of CFS or any other of these symptoms and keep insisting this is just a long-lasting flu. But 3.5 months to now nearly 4 months...really?  Somebody please let me know if I am just going crazy or maybe it's time to change my PCP... but if somebody has gone through something similar like this for 3-4 months and recovered, please let me know so that I know I'm not going crazy.  Also, I really value honest opinions and not people who just want to make me feel better. I really don't mind if what you have to say is negative as long as it's constructive...I have been suffering with this for awhile but if what worked for you is just having a simple change of attitude, please let me know what kind of treatment techniques worked for you or it just simply got better over time!

I am a 28 year old male and used to be very healthy and in the best shape of my life before I suddenly came down with this and the last couple months of my life has been like hell and the worst thing I've ever gone through. I was wondering if someone could tell me if they think I have it or not...or if someone has any idea what I am suffering from. Please bear with me for this is going to be quite long. It all started when I caught a weird flu-like bug going on vacation to korea back in december and experienced sudden flu-like and food poisoning symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, severe bodyaches, chills, severe fatigue and weakness, loss of appetite, and sometimes shortness of breath that landed me in the ER a couple times. Despite the couple trips, doctors couldn't find what was wrong with me as urine samples, blood tests, flu tests, and xrays all returned negative.  So I cut my vacation short and returned back to the states to get re-evaluated by my PCP. Immediately upon my return, I saw my PCP who told me he thinks I'm just going through the remnants of a bug I caught in Korea and should be back to normal soon after it runs its course. Couple days upon coming back, I realized a brief reprieve in some of my symptoms, diarrhea had subsided, appetite was slowly coming back, and I started experiencing some upper respiratory symptoms for a couple days such as cough, runny nose, congestion, but the debilitating fatigue, bodyaches, and weakness seemed to have dissipated.. then there were a couple days of feeling 90% normal aside for a very slight sense of dizziness which I attributed to just being bed-ridden for awhile and jet lag. Overjoyed with my recovery, I went out to go shopping at outlets, went out to meet with friends, and did some music practice...things I did normally before I became ill. I was still on vacation from work so there was nothing stressing me.. until I got into a big fight with my girlfriend and thought we were going to break up...which got me extremely sad...I remember crying myself to sleep that night. The following day I remember a relapse of symptoms similar to how I felt in Korea which included the severe fatigue, nausea, weakness, body aches, some heartburn-like IBS symptoms but no diarrhea, and again a decline in appetite, and on top of this, I had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Waking up in the mornings I felt unrefreshed, dizzy, and not too different from how I went to sleep the night before. Needless to say, I went back to my doctor who prescribed me so antidepressants (zoloft) to try and also did a full workup of my blood which came back normal again. He told me to give it another week or two and that I should feel gradually better. So for the next couple weeks I went through periods of briefly feeling better where I can run a couple errands outside like groceries and do some light exercise (walks) and ""crashes"" where I would be house-ridden and able only to do basic things like eat, wash up, watch tv, etc. I took a disability leave from work as I was unable to focus at work and the one day I tried to return, I ended up in urgent care with another attack similar to what I experienced in korea only to have the doctor send me back home saying everything is checking out fine. After about 8-9 weeks of this I did notice some gradual recovery with some lesser relapses in between: - I would be asymptomatic for longer periods during the day (I would have a 3-4 hour window of ""no symptoms"" in the beginning of jan when symptoms first re-emerged...then at this point it was more like I would have 3-4 hours total during a bad day I would feel symptoms and sometimes no symptoms at all on good days) -I started getting 7-14 day streaks of no symptoms. -On days I would exhibit symptoms it would be a less severe form of it which would include: -fatigue, but not quite as debilitating -slight loss of appetite -no more ibs or trouble falling asleep -no more diarrhea -no upper respiratory symptoms at all However, about every other week, I would experience a return of symptoms lasting a couple days (occuring in 1-3 hr episodes during the day) that included: -extremely tired (physically/mentally) -unmotivated to do anything, would dread doing things at times as if impending doom -usually cold -slightly nauseous -feel sensation of stuffiness but cold as if indigested -tingly sensation throughout arms and body as if bloodflow is restricted -happens more often in the afternoons after some exertion -feel slight pressure in the sinuses -usually accompanied with loss of appetite -lightheaded/dizzy -usually sad/moody/depressed/easily irritable/very sensitive Reported all this to my doctor and although he still stood by his initial guess that it was just a bug that was working itself through my system, he referred me to an ID specialist who ran about 15 different viral/immune tests on my blood including HIV, EBV, CMV, HHV6, syphilis, ESR, ANA, blood cultures for blood bacteria, IgG, IgM, and a couple others which all came back negative. Following all the tests, both doctors stood by their initial guesses that I just may have caught a very bad form of the flu (influenza) that may have not been properly detected in korea that is taking a particularly long time to clear out of my system given I was under stress and time zone changes and different environment (record cold temperatures in korea...I was never exposed to such cold temperatures in my life as I am from Southern California). Since the results of the viral testing has come back I haven't noticed (at least to me) any significant improvements in my symptoms... and so decided to try acupuncture for a few weeks which I have not noticed too much of a noticeable improvement in symptoms...stil couple days to a week of good followed by symptomatic days where I would experience the symptoms I mentioned above in varying intensities for 1-3 hours a day. My girlfriend and family suggested that I return to work and try to expose my body to normality again as I used to be a very active/healthy guy (would go to gym to do strength training 6 times a week, and sometimes play couple hours of full court, high intensity basketball on weekends on top of a 40+ hour work day and very involved in my local church community) and perhaps my body was just deconditioned from such a long period of inactivity and that maybe it was a mental/psychological thing. So here I am having completed one full week of work (9 hour days) now and noticed the following things: -I can get through a full day of work, albeit barely (yay!) -some days are better than others. -I am extremely exhausted after work...feel like I can't move a muscle. -Current symptoms include: *a constant dull pulsating pressure sensation behind my nose(sinuses) that causes mild to moderate dizziness and sometimes mild nausea, can last all morning and afternoon..I feel like this is the only symptom that has increased in severity perhaps because my uptick in activity? *a drastic increase in appetite (i feel frequently hungry) *increased urination..need to urinate every hour it seems like *constantly slightly tired (sleepy) *slight fatigue/body aches during the morning/afternoon..to pretty severe for about an hour or 2 after work. *moments of unmotivatedness/difficulty concentrating *moments of constricting of airways in nose making it difficult to breath productively but no mucus It just feels like it's 2-3 times harder to go through a normal day of work than it used to be before I got this illness. I am no longer sad so I stopped taking my antidepressants and feel like I'm constantly operating on a deficit of energy since returning to work... I am so sick of tracking how I am feeling and not being able to exercise like I used to or hanging out with people like I used to because I'm so ""tired"" all the time...Now I'm telling people at work that I am ""better"" but I'm definitely not and feel like I may hit another major crash going on like this... Obviously CFS is a far-off assumption (says my doctors) but I have been really identifying with some hallmark CFS symptoms like post exertional malaise, extreme unrelenting fatigue, and unrefreshing sleep... however I have experienced a gradual degree of improvement too? Sometimes when I'm in the middle of my pain I forget the strides I have made. Regardless, there are some things that I have yet to be checked as my doctors have employed a ""watchful waiting"" strategy which has been very frustrating to me...but here are some things I am suspicious of: -hormonal issues (thyroid problems or adrenal insufficiency/fatigue?) -heart issues (sometimes i feel stuffiness in my chest as well as tingling sensation in my arms as if circulation is not happening as it should...I have an odd feeling my ongoing dizziness might be related) -sinus issues (I have a history of sinus infections and thinking maybe it may be related...although my sinus pressure/dizziness doesn't come with any mucus, runny nose, discharge, or any of the classic sinusitis symptoms) -neurological issues (I have had a history of 2-3 months of severe headache/facial pain episodes, some people told me the pressure in my sinus/head can be a migraine) Seeing my doctor this coming Thurs and going to demand referrals to an ENT, neurologist, and an ECG, along with a hormonal test which I'm not sure why he did not do earlier... I mentioned some of these before but he would simply just brush me off saying those were highly unlikely and since I'm a healthy young guy, I don't fit the usual ""demographic"" of CFS or any other of these symptoms and keep insisting this is just a long-lasting flu. But 3.5 months to now nearly 4 months...really?  Somebody please let me know if I am just going crazy or maybe it's time to change my PCP... but if somebody has gone through something similar like this for 3-4 months and recovered, please let me know so that I know I'm not going crazy.  Also, I really value honest opinions and not people who just want to make me feel better. I really don't mind if what you have to say is negative as long as it's constructive...I have been suffering with this for awhile but if what worked for you is just having a simple change of attitude, please let me know what kind of treatment techniques worked for you or it just simply got better over time! I find that recovery stories are the most helpful and best thing to read about here. If you made it this far..thanks so much for reading and I am looking forward to your responses.

I am a 28 year old male and used to be very healthy and in the best shape of my life before I suddenly came down with this and the last couple months of my life has been like hell and the worst thing I've ever gone through. I was wondering if someone could tell me if they think I have it or not...or if someone has any idea what I am suffering from. Please bear with me for this is going to be quite long. It all started when I caught a weird flu-like bug going on vacation to korea back in december and experienced sudden flu-like and food poisoning symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, severe bodyaches, chills, severe fatigue and weakness, loss of appetite, and sometimes shortness of breath that landed me in the ER a couple times. Despite the couple trips, doctors couldn't find what was wrong with me as urine samples, blood tests, flu tests, and xrays all returned negative.  So I cut my vacation short and returned back to the states to get re-evaluated by my PCP. Immediately upon my return, I saw my PCP who told me he thinks I'm just going through the remnants of a bug I caught in Korea and should be back to normal soon after it runs its course. Couple days upon coming back, I realized a brief reprieve in some of my symptoms, diarrhea had subsided, appetite was slowly coming back, and I started experiencing some upper respiratory symptoms for a couple days such as cough, runny nose, congestion, but the debilitating fatigue, bodyaches, and weakness seemed to have dissipated.. then there were a couple days of feeling 90% normal aside for a very slight sense of dizziness which I attributed to just being bed-ridden for awhile and jet lag. Overjoyed with my recovery, I went out to go shopping at outlets, went out to meet with friends, and did some music practice...things I did normally before I became ill. I was still on vacation from work so there was nothing stressing me.. until I got into a big fight with my girlfriend and thought we were going to break up...which got me extremely sad...I remember crying myself to sleep that night. The following day I remember a relapse of symptoms similar to how I felt in Korea which included the severe fatigue, nausea, weakness, body aches, some heartburn-like IBS symptoms but no diarrhea, and again a decline in appetite, and on top of this, I had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Waking up in the mornings I felt unrefreshed, dizzy, and not too different from how I went to sleep the night before. Needless to say, I went back to my doctor who prescribed me so antidepressants (zoloft) to try and also did a full workup of my blood which came back normal again. He told me to give it another week or two and that I should feel gradually better. So for the next couple weeks I went through periods of briefly feeling better where I can run a couple errands outside like groceries and do some light exercise (walks) and ""crashes"" where I would be house-ridden and able only to do basic things like eat, wash up, watch tv, etc. I took a disability leave from work as I was unable to focus at work and the one day I tried to return, I ended up in urgent care with another attack similar to what I experienced in korea only to have the doctor send me back home saying everything is checking out fine. After about 8-9 weeks of this I did notice some gradual recovery with some lesser relapses in between: - I would be asymptomatic for longer periods during the day (I would have a 3-4 hour window of ""no symptoms"" in the beginning of jan when symptoms first re-emerged...then at this point it was more like I would have 3-4 hours total during a bad day I would feel symptoms and sometimes no symptoms at all on good days) -I started getting 7-14 day streaks of no symptoms. -On days I would exhibit symptoms it would be a less severe form of it which would include: -fatigue, but not quite as debilitating -slight loss of appetite -no more ibs or trouble falling asleep -no more diarrhea -no upper respiratory symptoms at all However, about every other week, I would experience a return of symptoms lasting a couple days (occuring in 1-3 hr episodes during the day) that included: -extremely tired (physically/mentally) -unmotivated to do anything, would dread doing things at times as if impending doom -usually cold -slightly nauseous -feel sensation of stuffiness but cold as if indigested -tingly sensation throughout arms and body as if bloodflow is restricted -happens more often in the afternoons after some exertion -feel slight pressure in the sinuses -usually accompanied with loss of appetite -lightheaded/dizzy -usually sad/moody/depressed/easily irritable/very sensitive Reported all this to my doctor and although he still stood by his initial guess that it was just a bug that was working itself through my system, he referred me to an ID specialist who ran about 15 different viral/immune tests on my blood including HIV, EBV, CMV, HHV6, syphilis, ESR, ANA, blood cultures for blood bacteria, IgG, IgM, and a couple others which all came back negative. Following all the tests, both doctors stood by their initial guesses that I just may have caught a very bad form of the flu (influenza) that may have not been properly detected in korea that is taking a particularly long time to clear out of my system given I was under stress and time zone changes and different environment (record cold temperatures in korea...I was never exposed to such cold temperatures in my life as I am from Southern California). Since the results of the viral testing has come back I haven't noticed (at least to me) any significant improvements in my symptoms... and so decided to try acupuncture for a few weeks which I have not noticed too much of a noticeable improvement in symptoms...stil couple days to a week of good followed by symptomatic days where I would experience the symptoms I mentioned above in varying intensities for 1-3 hours a day. My girlfriend and family suggested that I return to work and try to expose my body to normality again as I used to be a very active/healthy guy (would go to gym to do strength training 6 times a week, and sometimes play couple hours of full court, high intensity basketball on weekends on top of a 40+ hour work day and very involved in my local church community) and perhaps my body was just deconditioned from such a long period of inactivity and that maybe it was a mental/psychological thing. So here I am having completed one full week of work (9 hour days) now and noticed the following things: -I can get through a full day of work, albeit barely (yay!) -some days are better than others. -I am extremely exhausted after work...feel like I can't move a muscle. -Current symptoms include: *a constant dull pulsating pressure sensation behind my nose(sinuses) that causes mild to moderate dizziness and sometimes mild nausea, can last all morning and afternoon..I feel like this is the only symptom that has increased in severity perhaps because my uptick in activity? *a drastic increase in appetite (i feel frequently hungry) *increased urination..need to urinate every hour it seems like *constantly slightly tired (sleepy) *slight fatigue/body aches during the morning/afternoon..to pretty severe for about an hour or 2 after work. *moments of unmotivatedness/difficulty concentrating *moments of constricting of airways in nose making it difficult to breath productively but no mucus It just feels like it's 2-3 times harder to go through a normal day of work than it used to be before I got this illness. I am no longer sad so I stopped taking my antidepressants and feel like I'm constantly operating on a deficit of energy since returning to work... I am so sick of tracking how I am feeling and not being able to exercise like I used to or hanging out with people like I used to because I'm so ""tired"" all the time...Now I'm telling people at work that I am ""better"" but I'm definitely not and feel like I may hit another major crash going on like this...

My girlfriend and family suggested that I return to work and try to expose my body to normality again as I used to be a very active/healthy guy (would go to gym to do strength training 6 times a week, and sometimes play couple hours of full court, high intensity basketball on weekends on top of a 40+ hour work day and very involved in my local church community) and perhaps my body was just deconditioned from such a long period of inactivity and that maybe it was a mental/psychological thing. So here I am having completed one full week of work (9 hour days) now and noticed the following things: -I can get through a full day of work, albeit barely (yay!) -some days are better than others. -I am extremely exhausted after work...feel like I can't move a muscle. -Current symptoms include: *a constant dull pulsating pressure sensation behind my nose(sinuses) that causes mild to moderate dizziness and sometimes mild nausea, can last all morning and afternoon..I feel like this is the only symptom that has increased in severity perhaps because my uptick in activity? *a drastic increase in appetite (i feel frequently hungry) *increased urination..need to urinate every hour it seems like *constantly slightly tired (sleepy) *slight fatigue/body aches during the morning/afternoon..to pretty severe for about an hour or 2 after work. *moments of unmotivatedness/difficulty concentrating *moments of constricting of airways in nose making it difficult to breath productively but no mucus It just feels like it's 2-3 times harder to go through a normal day of work than it used to be before I got this illness. I am no longer sad so I stopped taking my antidepressants and feel like I'm constantly operating on a deficit of energy since returning to work... I am so sick of tracking how I am feeling and not being able to exercise like I used to or hanging out with people like I used to because I'm so ""tired"" all the time...Now I'm telling people at work that I am ""better"" but I'm definitely not and feel like I may hit another major crash going on like this... Obviously CFS is a far-off assumption (says my doctors) but I have been really identifying with some hallmark CFS symptoms like post exertional malaise, extreme unrelenting fatigue, and unrefreshing sleep... however I have experienced a gradual degree of improvement too? Sometimes when I'm in the middle of my pain I forget the strides I have made. Regardless, there are some things that I have yet to be checked as my doctors have employed a ""watchful waiting"" strategy which has been very frustrating to me...but here are some things I am suspicious of: -hormonal issues (thyroid problems or adrenal insufficiency/fatigue?) -heart issues (sometimes i feel stuffiness in my chest as well as tingling sensation in my arms as if circulation is not happening as it should...I have an odd feeling my ongoing dizziness might be related) -sinus issues (I have a history of sinus infections and thinking maybe it may be related...although my sinus pressure/dizziness doesn't come with any mucus, runny nose, discharge, or any of the classic sinusitis symptoms) -neurological issues (I have had a history of 2-3 months of severe headache/facial pain episodes, some people told me the pressure in my sinus/head can be a migraine) Seeing my doctor this coming Thurs and going to demand referrals to an ENT, neurologist, and an ECG, along with a hormonal test which I'm not sure why he did not do earlier... I mentioned some of these before but he would simply just brush me off saying those were highly unlikely and since I'm a healthy young guy, I don't fit the usual ""demographic"" of CFS or any other of these symptoms and keep insisting this is just a long-lasting flu. But 3.5 months to now nearly 4 months...really?  Somebody please let me know if I am just going crazy or maybe it's time to change my PCP... but if somebody has gone through something similar like this for 3-4 months and recovered, please let me know so that I know I'm not going crazy.  Also, I really value honest opinions and not people who just want to make me feel better. I really don't mind if what you have to say is negative as long as it's constructive...I have been suffering with this for awhile but if what worked for you is just having a simple change of attitude, please let me know what kind of treatment techniques worked for you or it just simply got better over time! I find that recovery stories are the most helpful and best thing to read about here. If you made it this far..thanks so much for reading and I am looking forward to your responses. My doctors are ""confident that I will make a full recovery and that this will be just a season for me"" and I am surely hoping so...Thanks so much!! 0 likes, 2 replies "

I am a 28 year old male and used to be very healthy and in the best shape of my life before I suddenly came down with this and the last couple months of my life has been like hell and the worst thing I've ever gone through. I was wondering if someone could tell me if they think I have it or not...or if someone has any idea what I am suffering from. Please bear with me for this is going to be quite long. It all started when I caught a weird flu-like bug going on vacation to korea back in december and experienced sudden flu-like and food poisoning symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, severe bodyaches, chills, severe fatigue and weakness, loss of appetite, and sometimes shortness of breath that landed me in the ER a couple times. Despite the couple trips, doctors couldn't find what was wrong with me as urine samples, blood tests, flu tests, and xrays all returned negative.  So I cut my vacation short and returned back to the states to get re-evaluated by my PCP. Immediately upon my return, I saw my PCP who told me he thinks I'm just going through the remnants of a bug I caught in Korea and should be back to normal soon after it runs its course. Couple days upon coming back, I realized a brief reprieve in some of my symptoms, diarrhea had subsided, appetite was slowly coming back, and I started experiencing some upper respiratory symptoms for a couple days such as cough, runny nose, congestion, but the debilitating fatigue, bodyaches, and weakness seemed to have dissipated.. then there were a couple days of feeling 90% normal aside for a very slight sense of dizziness which I attributed to just being bed-ridden for awhile and jet lag. Overjoyed with my recovery, I went out to go shopping at outlets, went out to meet with friends, and did some music practice...things I did normally before I became ill. I was still on vacation from work so there was nothing stressing me.. until I got into a big fight with my girlfriend and thought we were going to break up...which got me extremely sad...I remember crying myself to sleep that night. The following day I remember a relapse of symptoms similar to how I felt in Korea which included the severe fatigue, nausea, weakness, body aches, some heartburn-like IBS symptoms but no diarrhea, and again a decline in appetite, and on top of this, I had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Waking up in the mornings I felt unrefreshed, dizzy, and not too different from how I went to sleep the night before. Needless to say, I went back to my doctor who prescribed me so antidepressants (zoloft) to try and also did a full workup of my blood which came back normal again. He told me to give it another week or two and that I should feel gradually better. So for the next couple weeks I went through periods of briefly feeling better where I can run a couple errands outside like groceries and do some light exercise (walks) and ""crashes"" where I would be house-ridden and able only to do basic things like eat, wash up, watch tv, etc. I took a disability leave from work as I was unable to focus at work and the one day I tried to return, I ended up in urgent care with another attack similar to what I experienced in korea only to have the doctor send me back home saying everything is checking out fine. After about 8-9 weeks of this I did notice some gradual recovery with some lesser relapses in between: - I would be asymptomatic for longer periods during the day (I would have a 3-4 hour window of ""no symptoms"" in the beginning of jan when symptoms first re-emerged...then at this point it was more like I would have 3-4 hours total during a bad day I would feel symptoms and sometimes no symptoms at all on good days) -I started getting 7-14 day streaks of no symptoms. -On days I would exhibit symptoms it would be a less severe form of it which would include: -fatigue, but not quite as debilitating -slight loss of appetite -no more ibs or trouble falling asleep -no more diarrhea -no upper respiratory symptoms at all However, about every other week, I would experience a return of symptoms lasting a couple days (occuring in 1-3 hr episodes during the day) that included: -extremely tired (physically/mentally) -unmotivated to do anything, would dread doing things at times as if impending doom -usually cold -slightly nauseous -feel sensation of stuffiness but cold as if indigested -tingly sensation throughout arms and body as if bloodflow is restricted -happens more often in the afternoons after some exertion -feel slight pressure in the sinuses -usually accompanied with loss of appetite -lightheaded/dizzy -usually sad/moody/depressed/easily irritable/very sensitive Reported all this to my doctor and although he still stood by his initial guess that it was just a bug that was working itself through my system, he referred me to an ID specialist who ran about 15 different viral/immune tests on my blood including HIV, EBV, CMV, HHV6, syphilis, ESR, ANA, blood cultures for blood bacteria, IgG, IgM, and a couple others which all came back negative.

So for the next couple weeks I went through periods of briefly feeling better where I can run a couple errands outside like groceries and do some light exercise (walks) and ""crashes"" where I would be house-ridden and able only to do basic things like eat, wash up, watch tv, etc. I took a disability leave from work as I was unable to focus at work and the one day I tried to return, I ended up in urgent care with another attack similar to what I experienced in korea only to have the doctor send me back home saying everything is checking out fine. After about 8-9 weeks of this I did notice some gradual recovery with some lesser relapses in between: - I would be asymptomatic for longer periods during the day (I would have a 3-4 hour window of ""no symptoms"" in the beginning of jan when symptoms first re-emerged...then at this point it was more like I would have 3-4 hours total during a bad day I would feel symptoms and sometimes no symptoms at all on good days) -I started getting 7-14 day streaks of no symptoms. -On days I would exhibit symptoms it would be a less severe form of it which would include: -fatigue, but not quite as debilitating -slight loss of appetite -no more ibs or trouble falling asleep -no more diarrhea -no upper respiratory symptoms at all However, about every other week, I would experience a return of symptoms lasting a couple days (occuring in 1-3 hr episodes during the day) that included: -extremely tired (physically/mentally) -unmotivated to do anything, would dread doing things at times as if impending doom -usually cold -slightly nauseous -feel sensation of stuffiness but cold as if indigested -tingly sensation throughout arms and body as if bloodflow is restricted -happens more often in the afternoons after some exertion -feel slight pressure in the sinuses -usually accompanied with loss of appetite -lightheaded/dizzy -usually sad/moody/depressed/easily irritable/very sensitive Reported all this to my doctor and although he still stood by his initial guess that it was just a bug that was working itself through my system, he referred me to an ID specialist who ran about 15 different viral/immune tests on my blood including HIV, EBV, CMV, HHV6, syphilis, ESR, ANA, blood cultures for blood bacteria, IgG, IgM, and a couple others which all came back negative. Following all the tests, both doctors stood by their initial guesses that I just may have caught a very bad form of the flu (influenza) that may have not been properly detected in korea that is taking a particularly long time to clear out of my system given I was under stress and time zone changes and different environment (record cold temperatures in korea...I was never exposed to such cold temperatures in my life as I am from Southern California). Since the results of the viral testing has come back I haven't noticed (at least to me) any significant improvements in my symptoms... and so decided to try acupuncture for a few weeks which I have not noticed too much of a noticeable improvement in symptoms...stil couple days to a week of good followed by symptomatic days where I would experience the symptoms I mentioned above in varying intensities for 1-3 hours a day. My girlfriend and family suggested that I return to work and try to expose my body to normality again as I used to be a very active/healthy guy (would go to gym to do strength training 6 times a week, and sometimes play couple hours of full court, high intensity basketball on weekends on top of a 40+ hour work day and very involved in my local church community) and perhaps my body was just deconditioned from such a long period of inactivity and that maybe it was a mental/psychological thing. So here I am having completed one full week of work (9 hour days) now and noticed the following things: -I can get through a full day of work, albeit barely (yay!) -some days are better than others. -I am extremely exhausted after work...feel like I can't move a muscle. -Current symptoms include: *a constant dull pulsating pressure sensation behind my nose(sinuses) that causes mild to moderate dizziness and sometimes mild nausea, can last all morning and afternoon..I feel like this is the only symptom that has increased in severity perhaps because my uptick in activity? *a drastic increase in appetite (i feel frequently hungry) *increased urination..need to urinate every hour it seems like *constantly slightly tired (sleepy) *slight fatigue/body aches during the morning/afternoon..to pretty severe for about an hour or 2 after work. *moments of unmotivatedness/difficulty concentrating *moments of constricting of airways in nose making it difficult to breath productively but no mucus It just feels like it's 2-3 times harder to go through a normal day of work than it used to be before I got this illness. I am no longer sad so I stopped taking my antidepressants and feel like I'm constantly operating on a deficit of energy since returning to work... I am so sick of tracking how I am feeling and not being able to exercise like I used to or hanging out with people like I used to because I'm so ""tired"" all the time...Now I'm telling people at work that I am ""better"" but I'm definitely not and feel like I may hit another major crash going on like this... Obviously CFS is a far-off assumption (says my doctors) but I have been really identifying with some hallmark CFS symptoms like post exertional malaise, extreme unrelenting fatigue, and unrefreshing sleep... however I have experienced a gradual degree of improvement too? Sometimes when I'm in the middle of my pain I forget the strides I have made. Regardless, there are some things that I have yet to be checked as my doctors have employed a ""watchful waiting"" strategy which has been very frustrating to me...but here are some things I am suspicious of: -hormonal issues (thyroid problems or adrenal insufficiency/fatigue?) -heart issues (sometimes i feel stuffiness in my chest as well as tingling sensation in my arms as if circulation is not happening as it should...I have an odd feeling my ongoing dizziness might be related) -sinus issues (I have a history of sinus infections and thinking maybe it may be related...although my sinus pressure/dizziness doesn't come with any mucus, runny nose, discharge, or any of the classic sinusitis symptoms) -neurological issues (I have had a history of 2-3 months of severe headache/facial pain episodes, some people told me the pressure in my sinus/head can be a migraine) Seeing my doctor this coming Thurs and going to demand referrals to an ENT, neurologist, and an ECG, along with a hormonal test which I'm not sure why he did not do earlier... I mentioned some of these before but he would simply just brush me off saying those were highly unlikely and since I'm a healthy young guy, I don't fit the usual ""demographic"" of CFS or any other of these symptoms and keep insisting this is just a long-lasting flu. But 3.5 months to now nearly 4 months...really?  Somebody please let me know if I am just going crazy or maybe it's time to change my PCP... but if somebody has gone through something similar like this for 3-4 months and recovered, please let me know so that I know I'm not going crazy.  Also, I really value honest opinions and not people who just want to make me feel better. I really don't mind if what you have to say is negative as long as it's constructive...I have been suffering with this for awhile but if what worked for you is just having a simple change of attitude, please let me know what kind of treatment techniques worked for you or it just simply got better over time! I find that recovery stories are the most helpful and best thing to read about here. If you made it this far..thanks so much for reading and I am looking forward to your responses. My doctors are ""confident that I will make a full recovery and that this will be just a season for me"" and I am surely hoping so...Thanks so much!! 0 likes, 2 replies "

I am a 28 year old male and used to be very healthy and in the best shape of my life before I suddenly came down with this and the last couple months of my life has been like hell and the worst thing I've ever gone through. I was wondering if someone could tell me if they think I have it or not...or if someone has any idea what I am suffering from. Please bear with me for this is going to be quite long. It all started when I caught a weird flu-like bug going on vacation to korea back in december and experienced sudden flu-like and food poisoning symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, severe bodyaches, chills, severe fatigue and weakness, loss of appetite, and sometimes shortness of breath that landed me in the ER a couple times. Despite the couple trips, doctors couldn't find what was wrong with me as urine samples, blood tests, flu tests, and xrays all returned negative.  So I cut my vacation short and returned back to the states to get re-evaluated by my PCP. Immediately upon my return, I saw my PCP who told me he thinks I'm just going through the remnants of a bug I caught in Korea and should be back to normal soon after it runs its course. Couple days upon coming back, I realized a brief reprieve in some of my symptoms, diarrhea had subsided, appetite was slowly coming back, and I started experiencing some upper respiratory symptoms for a couple days such as cough, runny nose, congestion, but the debilitating fatigue, bodyaches, and weakness seemed to have dissipated.. then there were a couple days of feeling 90% normal aside for a very slight sense of dizziness which I attributed to just being bed-ridden for awhile and jet lag. Overjoyed with my recovery, I went out to go shopping at outlets, went out to meet with friends, and did some music practice...things I did normally before I became ill. I was still on vacation from work so there was nothing stressing me.. until I got into a big fight with my girlfriend and thought we were going to break up...which got me extremely sad...I remember crying myself to sleep that night. The following day I remember a relapse of symptoms similar to how I felt in Korea which included the severe fatigue, nausea, weakness, body aches, some heartburn-like IBS symptoms but no diarrhea, and again a decline in appetite, and on top of this, I had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Waking up in the mornings I felt unrefreshed, dizzy, and not too different from how I went to sleep the night before.

It all started when I caught a weird flu-like bug going on vacation to korea back in december and experienced sudden flu-like and food poisoning symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, severe bodyaches, chills, severe fatigue and weakness, loss of appetite, and sometimes shortness of breath that landed me in the ER a couple times. Despite the couple trips, doctors couldn't find what was wrong with me as urine samples, blood tests, flu tests, and xrays all returned negative.  So I cut my vacation short and returned back to the states to get re-evaluated by my PCP. Immediately upon my return, I saw my PCP who told me he thinks I'm just going through the remnants of a bug I caught in Korea and should be back to normal soon after it runs its course. Couple days upon coming back, I realized a brief reprieve in some of my symptoms, diarrhea had subsided, appetite was slowly coming back, and I started experiencing some upper respiratory symptoms for a couple days such as cough, runny nose, congestion, but the debilitating fatigue, bodyaches, and weakness seemed to have dissipated.. then there were a couple days of feeling 90% normal aside for a very slight sense of dizziness which I attributed to just being bed-ridden for awhile and jet lag. Overjoyed with my recovery, I went out to go shopping at outlets, went out to meet with friends, and did some music practice...things I did normally before I became ill. I was still on vacation from work so there was nothing stressing me.. until I got into a big fight with my girlfriend and thought we were going to break up...which got me extremely sad...I remember crying myself to sleep that night. The following day I remember a relapse of symptoms similar to how I felt in Korea which included the severe fatigue, nausea, weakness, body aches, some heartburn-like IBS symptoms but no diarrhea, and again a decline in appetite, and on top of this, I had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Waking up in the mornings I felt unrefreshed, dizzy, and not too different from how I went to sleep the night before. Needless to say, I went back to my doctor who prescribed me so antidepressants (zoloft) to try and also did a full workup of my blood which came back normal again. He told me to give it another week or two and that I should feel gradually better. So for the next couple weeks I went through periods of briefly feeling better where I can run a couple errands outside like groceries and do some light exercise (walks) and ""crashes"" where I would be house-ridden and able only to do basic things like eat, wash up, watch tv, etc. I took a disability leave from work as I was unable to focus at work and the one day I tried to return, I ended up in urgent care with another attack similar to what I experienced in korea only to have the doctor send me back home saying everything is checking out fine. After about 8-9 weeks of this I did notice some gradual recovery with some lesser relapses in between: - I would be asymptomatic for longer periods during the day (I would have a 3-4 hour window of ""no symptoms"" in the beginning of jan when symptoms first re-emerged...then at this point it was more like I would have 3-4 hours total during a bad day I would feel symptoms and sometimes no symptoms at all on good days) -I started getting 7-14 day streaks of no symptoms. -On days I would exhibit symptoms it would be a less severe form of it which would include: -fatigue, but not quite as debilitating -slight loss of appetite -no more ibs or trouble falling asleep -no more diarrhea -no upper respiratory symptoms at all However, about every other week, I would experience a return of symptoms lasting a couple days (occuring in 1-3 hr episodes during the day) that included: -extremely tired (physically/mentally) -unmotivated to do anything, would dread doing things at times as if impending doom -usually cold -slightly nauseous -feel sensation of stuffiness but cold as if indigested -tingly sensation throughout arms and body as if bloodflow is restricted -happens more often in the afternoons after some exertion -feel slight pressure in the sinuses -usually accompanied with loss of appetite -lightheaded/dizzy -usually sad/moody/depressed/easily irritable/very sensitive Reported all this to my doctor and although he still stood by his initial guess that it was just a bug that was working itself through my system, he referred me to an ID specialist who ran about 15 different viral/immune tests on my blood including HIV, EBV, CMV, HHV6, syphilis, ESR, ANA, blood cultures for blood bacteria, IgG, IgM, and a couple others which all came back negative. Following all the tests, both doctors stood by their initial guesses that I just may have caught a very bad form of the flu (influenza) that may have not been properly detected in korea that is taking a particularly long time to clear out of my system given I was under stress and time zone changes and different environment (record cold temperatures in korea...I was never exposed to such cold temperatures in my life as I am from Southern California). Since the results of the viral testing has come back I haven't noticed (at least to me) any significant improvements in my symptoms... and so decided to try acupuncture for a few weeks which I have not noticed too much of a noticeable improvement in symptoms...stil couple days to a week of good followed by symptomatic days where I would experience the symptoms I mentioned above in varying intensities for 1-3 hours a day. My girlfriend and family suggested that I return to work and try to expose my body to normality again as I used to be a very active/healthy guy (would go to gym to do strength training 6 times a week, and sometimes play couple hours of full court, high intensity basketball on weekends on top of a 40+ hour work day and very involved in my local church community) and perhaps my body was just deconditioned from such a long period of inactivity and that maybe it was a mental/psychological thing. So here I am having completed one full week of work (9 hour days) now and noticed the following things: -I can get through a full day of work, albeit barely (yay!) -some days are better than others. -I am extremely exhausted after work...feel like I can't move a muscle. -Current symptoms include: *a constant dull pulsating pressure sensation behind my nose(sinuses) that causes mild to moderate dizziness and sometimes mild nausea, can last all morning and afternoon..I feel like this is the only symptom that has increased in severity perhaps because my uptick in activity? *a drastic increase in appetite (i feel frequently hungry) *increased urination..need to urinate every hour it seems like *constantly slightly tired (sleepy) *slight fatigue/body aches during the morning/afternoon..to pretty severe for about an hour or 2 after work. *moments of unmotivatedness/difficulty concentrating *moments of constricting of airways in nose making it difficult to breath productively but no mucus It just feels like it's 2-3 times harder to go through a normal day of work than it used to be before I got this illness. I am no longer sad so I stopped taking my antidepressants and feel like I'm constantly operating on a deficit of energy since returning to work... I am so sick of tracking how I am feeling and not being able to exercise like I used to or hanging out with people like I used to because I'm so ""tired"" all the time...Now I'm telling people at work that I am ""better"" but I'm definitely not and feel like I may hit another major crash going on like this... Obviously CFS is a far-off assumption (says my doctors) but I have been really identifying with some hallmark CFS symptoms like post exertional malaise, extreme unrelenting fatigue, and unrefreshing sleep... however I have experienced a gradual degree of improvement too? Sometimes when I'm in the middle of my pain I forget the strides I have made. Regardless, there are some things that I have yet to be checked as my doctors have employed a ""watchful waiting"" strategy which has been very frustrating to me...but here are some things I am suspicious of: -hormonal issues (thyroid problems or adrenal insufficiency/fatigue?) -heart issues (sometimes i feel stuffiness in my chest as well as tingling sensation in my arms as if circulation is not happening as it should...I have an odd feeling my ongoing dizziness might be related) -sinus issues (I have a history of sinus infections and thinking maybe it may be related...although my sinus pressure/dizziness doesn't come with any mucus, runny nose, discharge, or any of the classic sinusitis symptoms) -neurological issues (I have had a history of 2-3 months of severe headache/facial pain episodes, some people told me the pressure in my sinus/head can be a migraine) Seeing my doctor this coming Thurs and going to demand referrals to an ENT, neurologist, and an ECG, along with a hormonal test which I'm not sure why he did not do earlier... I mentioned some of these before but he would simply just brush me off saying those were highly unlikely and since I'm a healthy young guy, I don't fit the usual ""demographic"" of CFS or any other of these symptoms and keep insisting this is just a long-lasting flu. But 3.5 months to now nearly 4 months...really?  Somebody please let me know if I am just going crazy or maybe it's time to change my PCP... but if somebody has gone through something similar like this for 3-4 months and recovered, please let me know so that I know I'm not going crazy.  Also, I really value honest opinions and not people who just want to make me feel better. I really don't mind if what you have to say is negative as long as it's constructive...I have been suffering with this for awhile but if what worked for you is just having a simple change of attitude, please let me know what kind of treatment techniques worked for you or it just simply got better over time! I find that recovery stories are the most helpful and best thing to read about here. If you made it this far..thanks so much for reading and I am looking forward to your responses. My doctors are ""confident that I will make a full recovery and that this will be just a season for me"" and I am surely hoping so...Thanks so much!! 0 likes, 2 replies "

I am a 28 year old male and used to be very healthy and in the best shape of my life before I suddenly came down with this and the last couple months of my life has been like hell and the worst thing I've ever gone through. I was wondering if someone could tell me if they think I have it or not...or if someone has any idea what I am suffering from. Please bear with me for this is going to be quite long. It all started when I caught a weird flu-like bug going on vacation to korea back in december and experienced sudden flu-like and food poisoning symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, severe bodyaches, chills, severe fatigue and weakness, loss of appetite, and sometimes shortness of breath that landed me in the ER a couple times. Despite the couple trips, doctors couldn't find what was wrong with me as urine samples, blood tests, flu tests, and xrays all returned negative.  So I cut my vacation short and returned back to the states to get re-evaluated by my PCP. Immediately upon my return, I saw my PCP who told me he thinks I'm just going through the remnants of a bug I caught in Korea and should be back to normal soon after it runs its course. Couple days upon coming back, I realized a brief reprieve in some of my symptoms, diarrhea had subsided, appetite was slowly coming back, and I started experiencing some upper respiratory symptoms for a couple days such as cough, runny nose, congestion, but the debilitating fatigue, bodyaches, and weakness seemed to have dissipated.. then there were a couple days of feeling 90% normal aside for a very slight sense of dizziness which I attributed to just being bed-ridden for awhile and jet lag. Overjoyed with my recovery, I went out to go shopping at outlets, went out to meet with friends, and did some music practice...things I did normally before I became ill. I was still on vacation from work so there was nothing stressing me.. until I got into a big fight with my girlfriend and thought we were going to break up...which got me extremely sad...I remember crying myself to sleep that night. The following day I remember a relapse of symptoms similar to how I felt in Korea which included the severe fatigue, nausea, weakness, body aches, some heartburn-like IBS symptoms but no diarrhea, and again a decline in appetite, and on top of this, I had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Waking up in the mornings I felt unrefreshed, dizzy, and not too different from how I went to sleep the night before. Needless to say, I went back to my doctor who prescribed me so antidepressants (zoloft) to try and also did a full workup of my blood which came back normal again. He told me to give it another week or two and that I should feel gradually better. So for the next couple weeks I went through periods of briefly feeling better where I can run a couple errands outside like groceries and do some light exercise (walks) and ""crashes"" where I would be house-ridden and able only to do basic things like eat, wash up, watch tv, etc. I took a disability leave from work as I was unable to focus at work and the one day I tried to return, I ended up in urgent care with another attack similar to what I experienced in korea only to have the doctor send me back home saying everything is checking out fine. After about 8-9 weeks of this I did notice some gradual recovery with some lesser relapses in between: - I would be asymptomatic for longer periods during the day (I would have a 3-4 hour window of ""no symptoms"" in the beginning of jan when symptoms first re-emerged...then at this point it was more like I would have 3-4 hours total during a bad day I would feel symptoms and sometimes no symptoms at all on good days) -I started getting 7-14 day streaks of no symptoms. -On days I would exhibit symptoms it would be a less severe form of it which would include: -fatigue, but not quite as debilitating -slight loss of appetite -no more ibs or trouble falling asleep -no more diarrhea -no upper respiratory symptoms at all However, about every other week, I would experience a return of symptoms lasting a couple days (occuring in 1-3 hr episodes during the day) that included: -extremely tired (physically/mentally) -unmotivated to do anything, would dread doing things at times as if impending doom -usually cold -slightly nauseous -feel sensation of stuffiness but cold as if indigested -tingly sensation throughout arms and body as if bloodflow is restricted -happens more often in the afternoons after some exertion -feel slight pressure in the sinuses -usually accompanied with loss of appetite -lightheaded/dizzy -usually sad/moody/depressed/easily irritable/very sensitive Reported all this to my doctor and although he still stood by his initial guess that it was just a bug that was working itself through my system, he referred me to an ID specialist who ran about 15 different viral/immune tests on my blood including HIV, EBV, CMV, HHV6, syphilis, ESR, ANA, blood cultures for blood bacteria, IgG, IgM, and a couple others which all came back negative. Following all the tests, both doctors stood by their initial guesses that I just may have caught a very bad form of the flu (influenza) that may have not been properly detected in korea that is taking a particularly long time to clear out of my system given I was under stress and time zone changes and different environment (record cold temperatures in korea...I was never exposed to such cold temperatures in my life as I am from Southern California). Since the results of the viral testing has come back I haven't noticed (at least to me) any significant improvements in my symptoms... and so decided to try acupuncture for a few weeks which I have not noticed too much of a noticeable improvement in symptoms...stil couple days to a week of good followed by symptomatic days where I would experience the symptoms I mentioned above in varying intensities for 1-3 hours a day. My girlfriend and family suggested that I return to work and try to expose my body to normality again as I used to be a very active/healthy guy (would go to gym to do strength training 6 times a week, and sometimes play couple hours of full court, high intensity basketball on weekends on top of a 40+ hour work day and very involved in my local church community) and perhaps my body was just deconditioned from such a long period of inactivity and that maybe it was a mental/psychological thing. So here I am having completed one full week of work (9 hour days) now and noticed the following things: -I can get through a full day of work, albeit barely (yay!) -some days are better than others. -I am extremely exhausted after work...feel like I can't move a muscle. -Current symptoms include: *a constant dull pulsating pressure sensation behind my nose(sinuses) that causes mild to moderate dizziness and sometimes mild nausea, can last all morning and afternoon..I feel like this is the only symptom that has increased in severity perhaps because my uptick in activity? *a drastic increase in appetite (i feel frequently hungry) *increased urination..need to urinate every hour it seems like *constantly slightly tired (sleepy) *slight fatigue/body aches during the morning/afternoon..to pretty severe for about an hour or 2 after work. *moments of unmotivatedness/difficulty concentrating *moments of constricting of airways in nose making it difficult to breath productively but no mucus It just feels like it's 2-3 times harder to go through a normal day of work than it used to be before I got this illness. I am no longer sad so I stopped taking my antidepressants and feel like I'm constantly operating on a deficit of energy since returning to work... I am so sick of tracking how I am feeling and not being able to exercise like I used to or hanging out with people like I used to because I'm so ""tired"" all the time...Now I'm telling people at work that I am ""better"" but I'm definitely not and feel like I may hit another major crash going on like this... Obviously CFS is a far-off assumption (says my doctors) but I have been really identifying with some hallmark CFS symptoms like post exertional malaise, extreme unrelenting fatigue, and unrefreshing sleep... however I have experienced a gradual degree of improvement too? Sometimes when I'm in the middle of my pain I forget the strides I have made. Regardless, there are some things that I have yet to be checked as my doctors have employed a ""watchful waiting"" strategy which has been very frustrating to me...but here are some things I am suspicious of: -hormonal issues (thyroid problems or adrenal insufficiency/fatigue?) -heart issues (sometimes i feel stuffiness in my chest as well as tingling sensation in my arms as if circulation is not happening as it should...I have an odd feeling my ongoing dizziness might be related) -sinus issues (I have a history of sinus infections and thinking maybe it may be related...although my sinus pressure/dizziness doesn't come with any mucus, runny nose, discharge, or any of the classic sinusitis symptoms) -neurological issues (I have had a history of 2-3 months of severe headache/facial pain episodes, some people told me the pressure in my sinus/head can be a migraine) Seeing my doctor this coming Thurs and going to demand referrals to an ENT, neurologist, and an ECG, along with a hormonal test which I'm not sure why he did not do earlier... I mentioned some of these before but he would simply just brush me off saying those were highly unlikely and since I'm a healthy young guy, I don't fit the usual ""demographic"" of CFS or any other of these symptoms and keep insisting this is just a long-lasting flu. But 3.5 months to now nearly 4 months...really?  Somebody please let me know if I am just going crazy or maybe it's time to change my PCP... but if somebody has gone through something similar like this for 3-4 months and recovered, please let me know so that I know I'm not going crazy.  Also, I really value honest opinions and not people who just want to make me feel better. I really don't mind if what you have to say is negative as long as it's constructive...I have been suffering with this for awhile but if what worked for you is just having a simple change of attitude, please let me know what kind of treatment techniques worked for you or it just simply got better over time! I find that recovery stories are the most helpful and best thing to read about here. If you made it this far..thanks so much for reading and I am looking forward to your responses. My doctors are ""confident that I will make a full recovery and that this will be just a season for me"" and I am surely hoping so...Thanks so much!! 0 likes, 2 replies "

When I arrived home last Friday in the morning, everything was fine. By the end of the day, I've got very tired but it didn't concerned me too much as this usual for me after having too much sun. Saturday morning when I woke up, all the typical flu symptoms were present: sore throat, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, pain behind the eyes (especially when moving them). The symptoms evolved in the next days, and I've started to cough compulsively especially during the night and to have fever. Now the cough is still there, but very manageable. At least I can sleep. The fever seems to be gone as well. The thing I'm most concern about is my heart rate and my blood pressure. For some 2-3 days in a row now, my blood pressure is elevated but my heart rate seems to be too low.  Here are some readings. Before having the flu: 10/06/2018 - 124/80 78HR 12/06/2018 - 122/71 87HR When flu present: 20/06/2018 18:23 - 182/108 61HR (I was feeling weird; like something was pumping in my stomach and very sleepy; multiple measurements were done to confirm)  18:34 - 161/94 64HR 19:21 - 149/95 56HR 20:04 - 128/86 65HR 20:30 - 133/91 68HR 20:55 - 143/94 58HR 21:21 - 148/89 58HR 21/06/2018 02:10 - 127/81 63HR 13:39 - 144/93 71HR 15:35 - 146/93 62HR 17:36 - 144/89 59HR 18:18 - 146/91 56HR 19:54 - 138/85 64HR 22/06/2018 01:52 - 126/83 61HR 11:20 - 153/100 62HR 12:06 - 154/102 63HR The reason I keep an eye on my blood pressure is because I'm a diabetic type 1 for some 30 years now. In time, I've developed kidney complications that lead to higher than normal blood pressure. Normally, I use Irbesartan to treat this, but it's an on and off thing, as I'm not very consistent. The reading you see there before my holiday, is my normal blood pressure without medication of any sort. What I could see is, the higher the blood pressure goes, the lower the heart rate goes. My normal heart rate when resting and fully awake and alert never goes below 70. Only when I'm about to fall asleep, it drops below 70. So any idea what this can be? It isn't anxiety or anything like that. Most probably that would involve an elevated heart rate. Actually I'm quite calm, even too calm. I'm always sleepy, and sometimes even a bit confused. I feel this pressure in my skull somehow. Weird stuff.   Another weird thing is the fact that most of the day, I can hear my blood flow through my ears, pumping, but not like percussion. It's slower than that I've read a lot of scary things about Legionella. Could this be the case? Any idea people? The GP is the UK is pretty much useless.

Then I had a high fever and felt all kinds of terrible with bronchitis symptoms.  It then seemed to spread downwards and I had trouble in that department both front and back. Whatever it was that was attacking me also had me getting chills, and sweating far too much, even at night. Plus, it seemed to kick off a bad case of anxiety and I had anxiety-related symptoms. Others I mustn't forgot to mention are: aches, painful joints, red eye, dry mouth. I got tested for Flu and also Mono/GF, but both were negative. So it must have been virus! I'm still having some symptoms too, but overall feel better than I did, just haven't gotten rid of it yet I don't think. The closest thing I can find to something similar is adenovirus, but that should only last around 1 week? Not sure! Have you had anything similar? How long did it last? Or are you still suffering now?  Any replies much appreciated! 1 like, 2 replies "

Here is my situation; my mother is living in a retirement home and she was sick with vomiting and diarrhea. She recovered a week ago. since then the virus has spread and is continuing to spread around the home with many of the residents having those symptoms. The staff has cancelled activities and limited resident contact to the dining area only. They have also asked that friends and family not visit for the time being. My mother called me yesterday to ask if she could come and stay with me so she doesnt contract the virus and I imagine she is quite bored. She suffers from Alzheimer's so she doesnt remember she was already sick. My question is....if she comes here and is not presently showing symptoms can she still spread to us? Im wondering that if after you have had it do you become immune for a while as well. My wife and I are leaving fir Florida soon and would hate to start our vacation with vomiting and diarrhea!

This Blood Transfusions was given to me on 08/15/2017 four days after having a Triple Heart Bypass (CABGx3) at the Hospital of University of Pennsylvania (HUP) in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. I had been post opt 4 days I had started  Rehabilitation from the surgery moving around walking around on the floor of which is strongly encourage as part of the  recovery, I had been looking forward to being discharge and talking with whom ever would obliged me in other words I was totally coherent. When I was approached in the hallway while I was walking around by my nurse and she asked me to return to my room and to lay down on my bed that she has something for me and that she will be there shortly. I must have fallen asleep while waiting but when I woke up there was Blood going into my IV line almost 4 hours after receiving this Blood  I suffered a what I was told was a   when my vision in my right eye was obstructed and till this day is still and according to Eye Doctors will forever be obstructed as it is not reversible my condition. It appears that a Blood Clot traveled to my right optic nerve of my Eye and is lodged there, so as any one person of sound mind I need to know WHY I was given this Blood WHO order the Blood  and WHERE was my options, why was I not given a choice, and WHO ADMINISTER THE BLOOD to me. Now these are legitimate question that a person should have answered but for whatever reason if there is one this hospital has not offered one to me if anything when I saw my Thoracic Surgeon that operated on me he knew nothing about a Blood Transfusion and he surely knew nothing about a Stroke especially my Blindness. The only thing I do know is that on the day of my discharge I had requested my entire medical record including the LABS, the NURSES NOTES the FLOW SHEETS and most importantly the BLOOD TAGS or the IDENTIFYING INFORMATION of the BLOOD but for whatever ever reason the hospital will not provide me with this information, although I  have in person visit the MEDICAL RECORDS and requested the information 3 times in person I have called numerous times I have sent a request in writing through the USPS with a return receipt requested. I have visit the BLOOD BANK at the hospital who refused to give me any information at all including if I am on their system as a receiving BLOOD I also visit the Patient Relations now 8 working days ago, but still NOTHING. Last I did complaint to  the HEALTH and HUMAN SERVICES of the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 2 months ago but have not heard anything from them since. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I had blood tests and stool tests done, which came back normal and was told I may have IBS. I was prescribed peppermint tablets, which didn't really help, and my symptoms weren't too severe so i didn't worry. About 2 months ago i was prescribed NSAIDs for an unrelated condition, along with medication to protect my stomach to prevent ulcers. Within 2 doses i was having bad stomach cramps, and booked an emergency GP appointment. The GP noticed abdominal tenderness, a borderline fever, and was concerned, so sent me to the SAU. My bloods cane back normal, with borderline high white blood cell levels. The next day i was given an ultrasound which was normal, and a faecal calprotectin test, which came back inconclusive (52 ug/g?? i think), so they ordered a repeat in 6 weeks it took me about a month to recover from this, with severe nausea and loss of appetite, diarrhea, extreme fatigue (I was exhausted however much i slept). I was really affected by whatever it was. I had a flexi sigmoidoscopy for suspected IBD which i found very painful, so they had to stop before they got past my rectum, but they found inflammation that i have been told is proctitis. They didn't manage to get to the area where I actually have the pain, which is what I am worried about. I had the follow up calprotectin test, which came back as 166 (ug/g???), which I am told is abnormal. I am still having some pain on my left side. I am seeing a gastroenterologist in a few weeks, but I want to know what to expect - will i need another endoscopy? Has anyone else had a similar experience? Does this sound like IBD? thanks 😃 0 likes, 0 replies "

The next day i was given an ultrasound which was normal, and a faecal calprotectin test, which came back inconclusive (52 ug/g?? i think), so they ordered a repeat in 6 weeks it took me about a month to recover from this, with severe nausea and loss of appetite, diarrhea, extreme fatigue (I was exhausted however much i slept). I was really affected by whatever it was. I had a flexi sigmoidoscopy for suspected IBD which i found very painful, so they had to stop before they got past my rectum, but they found inflammation that i have been told is proctitis. They didn't manage to get to the area where I actually have the pain, which is what I am worried about. I had the follow up calprotectin test, which came back as 166 (ug/g???), which I am told is abnormal. I am still having some pain on my left side. I am seeing a gastroenterologist in a few weeks, but I want to know what to expect - will i need another endoscopy? Has anyone else had a similar experience? Does this sound like IBD? thanks 😃 0 likes, 0 replies "

I've been having a numbness in my head once in a while and one day it shot down my left arm and leg.  So I went to the ER to get checked out.  They did blood work, an EKG and I got a Cat Scan. Everything came back fine. But they still wanted me to do an MRI with contrast just to be safe. I have avoided contrast all my life but had to have it done late this Spring when I had sever pain and bloating in my intestinal area.  They did a scan of my abdominal area and I was diagnosed with Diverticulitis. I begged the Doctor not use contrast but she said it had to be done. I was in so much pain as is, I didn't even notice it was being administered.  I had to have another scan 4 weeks later as a follow-up. This time, my heart started beating really fast right after they injected me with the contrast. Not one of the side effects listed anywhere online. So I assume it was just nerves. But I'm still nervous to have it done again. Since I didn't have any serious side effects the first two times, I assume I'll be o.k.

I had an MRI on my brain to try to explain the migraines and vertigo I have been experiencing over the last couple of months. During the first part of my procedure (without the contrast) I felt very uncomfortable in the machine. So I closed my eyes to try to relax.  Anyone who has had an MRI knows that the machine is very loud even with the earplugs in. While the machine was scanning, with my eyes closed, I started seeing extremely bright color patterns. Bright hues of blue and purple in varying presentations. First like lightning behind clouds then more like glowing purple ink flowing across glass. Moving with the sounds of the machine. At one particular sequence of the machine, there were black dashes/ dots across a dull gray background that flashed with the sounds of the machine.  Then, in the last few minutes there was one certain noise that the machine was making, Like it was pulsating. During this time, I could see a pink/purple light in the center of my vision. every time the machine would make the pulse sound, dozens of neon blue/turquoise dots would flash. It was intense. Needless to say, instead of making my anxiety worse about the process, the lights and patterns were extremely relaxing and very enjoyable. After I was finished, I felt like I had been meditating or something. I asked the radiology assistant if those visions were normal. She said that in 15 years of doing MRIs that no one had ever mentioned it.  That kind of worries me a little! Lol. The second part (with the contrast dye) I actually fell asleep. But no crazy colors. I don’t know how to explain what happened, or what caused it. But I will never forget it. I will get my results back later this week. Maybe that will explain it.

My diarrhea has been so bad that I can go over 20 times a day. They now have subscribed me Loperamide, prescription immodium. I take 8 pills a day which does always work. They said to take PeptoBismol tablets if necessary, up to 4 a day. Between all the meds it has slowed the diarrhea done to about 10 times a day. My biggest issue is the pain and gurgling. I'm always in pain no matter what I eat or drink. The gurgling is so loud that if I leave my house others can hear my stomach. Doctors can explain the pain or the gurgling. Recently when I have a BM, it is a darker brown with a lot of yellow cream colored mucus that is very thick. Contacted doctor about that but still no response. If anyone has had this or has any suggestions of how to relieve it I would appreciate the advice. Thank you 0 likes, 10 replies "

I went to a therapist and I fixed a lot of issues I had and I have to say I rarely get mild anxiety now but insomnia persists when I eat foods from a long list. Basically I can eat chicken,grapes ,past with low fat cheese, low fat fish. Most foods take 5 hours to digest and even when the bloating goes away, I wake up in the middle of the night with increased heart rate and Im unable to fall asleep again. Im constipated the other day. I have a light case hemorrhoids that rarely bothers me, if at all. Lately I ve doing great but sometimes if I try to eat a bit more or something  of my list I get symptoms again. I know its going to take more time but its been 3 years already...

I have constant pressure in my stomach that radiates to my back and causes pain. But, if I rub my back I burp and I feel better for a few moments or if I pass gas I'll feel better for a little while but the pain is Intense.  it'll go away if I don't eat but soon as I do eat something it's a right back. I can't believe all of this bloating and gas is just IBS, is this what it feels? I have constant burping, stuffed feeling, mid  and lower back pain that come and goes (better with bowel movement, passing gas, or burping), constipation, and diarrhea. Are these the symptoms? Does anybody else feel the same type of pressure in their abdomen? I like to add, sometimes the pain is so intense I consider going to the hospital but then feels silly like who goes to the hospital for IBS? Other times it tiggers my anxiety because I'm getting nervous that there's something else wrong with me. I have this pain before I got my gallbladder removed and and thought it would go away and it didn't. I'm so over this I just want to feel better. If anyone can relate, has any helpful tips, or at least share some of the same symptoms I look forward to your reply. I truly need the support. 0 likes, 9 replies "

Today is the 3rd day (Friday) and I woke up at 5 am with dirarrhea, and have had another bout just now (8am) so it obviously is not showing signs of letting up. I have been drinking lemonade (but adding sugar to get rid of the fizz) and water. Is it normal for it to last for 3 days like this, with bad diarrhea? And am I doing the right thing in eating?

I felt a sharp pain when going to the bathroom and saw some blood after wiping. I didn't think much of it and everything was fine till 2 days later when I had quite a bit more blood/some pain after going to the bathroom (but no constipation since the 2 days prior). Then I started my period earlier this week and dealt with lots of diarrhea  the day before starting and the first day, which I attributed to IBS. But when I went to pee on the first morning and there was so much blood the water was pink. I've never had this before and was nervous but attributed it to being particularly hydrated (clear urine) and having a heavy flow... But then today (day 5) I have diarrhea again and today, and several times throughout my period regardless of medium/heavy days, I've been getting stomach discomfort/cramps and notice blood in the toilet- instead of just on the TP- when I go to the bathroom regardless of if I just pee or not. I'm trying not to worry, but it's very odd for me to see so much blood in the toilet bowl.  I was recently laid off and don't have insurance any more so I know I'm under more stress than usual, but that also means I can't go to the doctor. I guess I'm just wondering if others see blood in the toilet even on medium days; should I be particularly on ""edge"" about the amount of blood the first night...? This doesn't seem ""normal"" for me, but nothing does with IBS. . . 0 likes, 7 replies "

The doctor told me that a colonoscopy makes no sense, because i already had one in 2017 and one end 2018. Everything was good. A pill cam would examine the small intestine. i dont know what to do more. maybe i need more patience because i have started one week ago with fodmap diet and it helped, but the vitamin c capsule started a flare and destroyed my positivesness. What are your advices or thoughts? thanks My guess is the antibiotics or metamucil or the stress did cause my IBS. 1 like, 9 replies "

I was 20. Neither me or my GI doctor were even considering colon cancer but he  did a colonoscopy and it came up clean according to him. Then, a couple months later, a general surgeon from the same hospital who i was seeing for a seperate reason brought up the colonoscopy saying that I had polyps? I dont remember much else of that conversation, so he must not have emphasized any real concern about them.  I just forgot about it. Throughout the years since then, I continued to have bowel issues like diahrrea and for the last 2-3 years at least  ive noticed thin and usually flat broken up stools, often loose in consistency. I forced myself not to worry too much and just figured it was probably due to my heavy drinking problem. However, one morning a couple weeks ago i woke up and strained to push out a pencil thin stool very light in color.  At that point i decided to look up my symptoms and freaked out when i realized a lot of my symptoms matched colorectal cancer symptoms. I decided to stop drinking and on the third day of not drinking i pushed out a dense, rather thin stool that was coated in blood. I could see blood in the toilet water. At this point i diagnosed myself with cancer. Not having insurance i rushed to a community health center walk in clinic. The doctor gave me reassurance and said most likely hemorroids and prescribed a fiber supplement. I decided to take metamucil wich definitely made my stool significantly thicker but still misshapen and concave. The doctor i saw for my follow up appoint was much less reassuring so i got state insurance and am in the process of scheduling a new colonoscopy. I requested a copy of the report of my previous colonoscopy and it makes no mention of polyps. In fact it states that everything looked normal and no polyps were noted. So why did the other doctor say i had some? im so confused and worried that something that could have been avoided is now haunting me. i feel like im screwed. im worried sick and cant sleep. help 0 likes, 9 replies "

I have been suffering with pain in upper left abdomen below the ribs for 7 months now. I've had loads of tests and nothing has come back showing anything. Had faecal calprotectin test done and that was normal so the docs have not done an endoscopy. Sometimes the pain ramps up to where I can constantly feel it and I can agrivate it with movement such as twisting or stretching Other times it just rumbles along and I hardly notice it but it's always there. Do any of you guys ever get this? The best way that I can explain the location of the pain is like this. Make a fist with your left hand and place it half way down your left rib line just underneath. Where your little finger rests is where the pain is mostly. I does travel about a little bit but it's mostly there. This normal for ibs?  0 likes, 97 replies "

I went to my GP a few times and they just said it's a common migraine or a virus and gave me some meds. A few days later, I was looking arouses and I was seeing double. It got worse and worse throughout the day. The next few days it was permanent.  At this moment I had double vision, headaches, nerve pains and nausea. I went to my GP again and he suggested I see a neurologist. Unfortunately, it was extremely difficult to see one as it was the holiday period and all the doctors were away.  Eventually I was able to find a neurosurgeon and was immediately admitted to hospital where I had a million blood tests, brain tests, MRI and others. They were eventually able to diagnose me with IIH and was immediately put into diamox.  Diamox:  Let me just say that this is prohibited the most horrible medication I've known. Yes it's worth it because I took away all my pain and symptoms. But the diamox had symptoms of its own. I experienced numbness, pins and needles, loss of appetite, weakness, etc.  With the condition, it also caused severe pressure on my eyes. The nerves of my eyes became weak and damaged, that they actually became scew.  I saw my opthalmologist and neurologist back and forth every 2-3 months. I've been on the diamox now for exactly 2 and a half years. Today I took my last tablet and I'll be seeing my doctor's for my final check-up in a month! Extras: For me, there the condition was completely benign. I had no characteristics that would normally bee associated with the condition such as overweight etc.  I started with 250mg diamox twice a day and that was increased to 3x a day a me then 6x a day. So just imagine all the side effects of the meds!! As I got better the doctors finally decided to slowly taper down the diamox. And now I'm diamox free.  I was 16 when I got sick and I did have to miss a year of school because of all the symptoms and the anxiety of all that was happening.  I just wanted to share my story.

The first was Amlodipine (2.5 mg), it gave me heart palpitations and chest pains. The second was Lisinopril (2.5 mg), that gave me the same effects with a change in my digestive track, so to speak. I am now taking Bystolic (2.5 mg) and they've been doing really good in lowering my blood pressure. I went one day without pills before I started taking the Bystolic and my blood pressure was 131/101. Now my blood pressure is around 100-120/50-70. I've been seeing floaters and stars, not frequently but I have noticed them here recently. I would like to note that the floaters are ""locational"". What I mean by that is when I'm in my house I may have like one or two in my eye from time to time, but when I go other places I'll see more as if the air is dirty or something lol. I also have been experiencing dizziness and feeling tired and really really dull head pains and I would check my blood pressure and it would read around 110/55-65. I am at home for break right now so my eating choices have changed obviously lol, but when I go back to college I eat very healthy now watching my salt intake (no more than 1500 mg a day) eating a big salad with every meal and I drink nothing but water (backwards, I know). Not really worried about it though, I just came here for a lil third party advice on what I should do if my medication is now dropping my blood pressure a lil too low and any additional advice on maintaining a healthy blood pressure to soon be able to get off of blood pressure pills permanently. 0 likes, 2 replies "
