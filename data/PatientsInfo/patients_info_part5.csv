Don't know where it is coming from.,"I had a car accident 11-12 months ago. I was on bike and car hit me from back. My head hit with something and started bleeding. I had 6 stitches in head that time. After that consulted with neurosurgeon and he suggested some medicines like muscle relaxants (baclofen) and pain killers. You can say, it's kind of whiplash injury. Now I think everything related to head or brain is fine except some dizziness. It was some background. Now the problem is, after 2 months of accident, I noticed blood started coming from my mouth with saliva in following conditions. 2. Sometimes blood comes in my mouth may be one or two times in a day while standing or sitting. 3. Always comes when I lay down in a position shown in attached picture.  But I can tell you that it's coming from downside (downside means from throat or somewhere else from down), not from upside (head or brain). But I don't know why and where it is coming from exactly. I have discussed this with many doctors 2 neurosurgeon, 1 neurologist, 2 ent specialists. First ent specialist have checked my throat but said throat is fine. Second ent specialist said that I am spitting blood because of acidity problem. Every doctor is saying that spitting blood is normal and will get fine by time. But it's 8 to 9 months have passed, I am still spitting blood almost everyday. I am tense about this situation because I can hear and feel different voices in my neck or throat. Feels irritation is my throat. Feels dizziness and numbness in my arms. Feels like my arms are not with me but sometimes feels normal.  I don't know from where and why blood coming from. Spitting blood has any relation to that accident? Do I have any internal injury in throat, cervical spine or specially spinal cord? Can anybody help me to get rid of this situation? Any doctor please? I don't want to see spitting blood everyday. It feels scary and weird. Thanks, momersaleem 0 likes, 0 replies "

She had just given birth to our second child, and thats when she started having her headaches. She thought it was a sinus infection, so she kept on pushing along, but the headaches became worse. Her left leg started to twitch, so we knew at that time something wasn't right.  We started to the hospital that second, and she experienced a seizure on the way to the ER. Obviously I was terrified and our newborn was in the backseat. I called the ambulance, and they picked her up and rushed her to the hospital. It wasn't long after, that the Dr came to talk to me and let me know she had a clot in her dural sinus. Thinking back, Im so glad they were able to diagnose it so fast. She spent a few weeks in ICU and then acute care after that. She was put on warfarin and keppra for a while, but we were unable to get her INR levels right. They switched her to Arixtra which is an injection blood thinner, but we went with this one so she could continue breast feeding while using this one...this was very important to her.  It has been a journey regarding her building her strength and energy back up. She utilized a walker for a long time after the event, and her walking was showing much improvement for a while. But after about 12 months, the Dr took her off the keppra, and her walking showed immediate improvement. She still has residual effects when she goes in high sensory places with alot of movement...malls, restaurants, etc. Her head hurts a little, and her left leg starts to get weak. She has been getting stronger, and we are hopeful she continues to get better. Last month she had a checkup with her neurologist, and we found out that her clot had dissolved which we were very happy about. We will just continue working on her getting stronger, and hoping the residual stuff improves. She has recently accepted a job offer starting in August, so we will see how that goes. I feel she is getting closer to where she was, but no doubt there is still some work to go.  Just looking to chat with other people that have had similar situations. I find it therapeutic to get guidance and news/ updates from others. Thank you guys.   0 likes, 0 replies "

Told me it was cellulitis and gave me antibiotics.  Rash got worse and spread on to chest. Saw another doctor who said it was an allergy. Gave me antihistamines.  Few day later went back as lower legs had swollen and doctor sent me to A&E. Had blood test and told to go back for result in 10 days. Went back Friday and after long wait results hadn't come back. Saw a different doctor who said it looked like vaculitis. Legs still pink and slightly purple and now on inner arms and chest. Should get blood result on Monday but my anxiety is through the roof.

The support and encouragement that is shared is extremely positive - it gives our family lots of energy to deal with this horrible disease. I'm mainly writing for my father - who was diagnosed November 2017 with MPA. Here is the timeline in condensed form of his development: - Late November, blood in sputum - Late December, admitted to ICU with kidney failure and lung filled with blood - 3 week ICU stay including ventilator support, continuous dialysis, and immunosuppresants - 2 cycles of cytoxan total during 4 week stay in hospital. once a week cycle of rituxan (4 total) - He came home with great lung function, creatinine at 2.7 (no dialysis) and down to 2.5 after a month. - Weekly physical therapy, on large doses of prednisone and tapering My father is in decent health, but I believe he is getting impatient. I've explained that people don't kick this disease after 3 months from diagnosis, I think he was optimistic because the improvement was so drastic in the first several weeks he was off the ventiator. Now that the progress is slowed, he feels like he's back tracking. I wanted to ask the group if they've experienced the following: - Small amounts of blood still in sputum (only in mornings) - NEW symptoms that he's never experienced before AFTER being sent home from the hospital after his first rounds of immunosuppresent infusions - this one mainly being joint pain in his knees (having trouble walking on it) Are these normal? He's scheduled for more rituxan 6 months after he's left the hospital (in July,) but i just wanted to make sure he's experiencing typical symptoms pre-remission. Any advice will help tremendously. 0 likes, 7 replies "

Gradually eliminated all things to which I was sensitive from my house/diet, had carpeting removed from house, replaced curtains w/blinds, waterproofed basement, avoided doctors, closed my business & rested as necessary, addressed past traumas in my life, replaced wardrobe w/100% cotton or linen or silk, changed the color of my walls & kitchen cabinets to brighten my environment - did whatever I felt might help me heal, crazy or not, expensive or not. March 2018: Eventually, after hounding my HVAC company about smelling mold & feeling sick when I turned on my A/C, I contacted a different HVAC company that directed me to a person who could test my house for mold.  Numerous people had searched for mold in my pristine house, that neither looks or smells like it could contain mold, but this guy found it right away - all through my duct work & HVAC system.  I replaced the HVAC system, to which I had an electronic air cleaner added, had the duct work vacuumed and cleaned w/an antimicrobial product, and had a dehumidifier installed in my basement. My symptoms disappeared immediately. I wish this result for all of you. 0 likes, 2 replies "

My out breaks mainly are on my palms and are very painful.  My c-reactive rate is high.  On prior tests my gfr has been low.  Dr has started me on steroids.  Any and all information would be helpful.  Thanks for reading. 0 likes, 5 replies "

It all started off I was experiencing the most intense deep burning pickles all over my body. They would come and go in different parts, I was at first describing it as an itch, but it was far more intense. I went to my doctor who sent me for a CBC and an allergy, diabetes blood tests, all came back fine. I proceeded to get on with life but 2 weeks on, I started to notice small pink circles appearing on my chest and inside my arms. They would come up and last around 24/48 hours. When they would disappear, new ones appeared.  I was then put on anti histamines, they never worked. The prickling was getting worse, and one evening coming home from work, I got undressed, and noticed a large bruise on my thigh that appeared with no known cause.  I had been suffering with a severe pressure headache and felt unwell, so took myself to be checked at the hospital. They ran bloods and again all come back normal, however the doctor did mention Vasculitis and I'm to see my doctor. So i went to my doctor who gave me a course of steroids, and referal to a dermatolist for further investigation on my skin flares. I got seen rather quickly as I got a cancellation, however the dermatologist I saw said he couldn't do any biopsy as my skin looked clear as since taking the steroids, my skin had calmed.  I explained all my symptoms and was quite distressed as the burning and prickling pricing is invisible and he just couldn't reassure or help me in any way. Anyway, another werk or 2 have gone by and I am now experiencing new severe symptoms of what seems nerve pain in my hands. It comes and goes but when the sharp sudden shooting pain in my fingers comes on it almost has me in tears. I have lowered my steroids as the doctor has told me to seen myself off, and now I'm noticing the pink raised spots on my chest are coming back. I also notice that when I get this sharp burning prickling sensation, I have tiny purple dots come up on the skin. I feel like the doctors are looking at me like it's all anxiety related, and I'm so fed up beyond words. I have a one year old daughter and 7 year-old son and before 3 months ago, I was a happy energetic mum who was in good health. I am only anxious because of what I am experiencing and not seeming to get any answers. I also the past week have been having the shakes, my arms are very weak and having severe pressure headaches. Could this be to do with the steroids? I am here because of the doctor in the hospital mentioning his concern of vasculitis. However my doctor is very dismissive of anything as all my blood tests have come back normal. This has made me anxious and I am so worried. I know something's not right and I don't know what to do next. I just want treatment and to get to the bottom of this.

It's refreshing to read others have similar symptoms.  However, it also seems none of us are getting real answers as to the core of this sometimes debilitating disorder. Mine starts with hives on my head that travel down and typically settle in my eyes.  Imagine the stares I get especially when out with my 6'4"" beau.   Yes, lots of facial swelling, and don't get me started on the bruising!  Then it moves into my shoulders, down the spine and across to the hips.  My back cannot be touched for about 36 hours.  Once that subsides, it shows up in my butt and down my legs.   I can't leave out the most interesting symptom yet...liver hematoma.  You want pain?  That was excruciating! Not that my back doesn't knock me over but that organ pain was awful. So, yes, I, too, have internal bleeding with no induced trauma. Really?  What the hell is going on here?  Why?  How can I relieve this pain when ibuprofen is off limits? I've done   for months at a time.  Drs don't want me on it for any length of time and I'm in agreement.   There's talk about starting a form of chemo but I know nothing about this and need to do some research. What I do know is there isn't enough info on UV.  I'm learning a lot by what I've experienced thus far.  It's painful & ugly.   I used to have beautiful skin.  Now, I have red butterfly rash, dry, flaking skin whenever in a flare (more often than not), and bruised swollen eyes upon waking.  That was some fight during the night.  I wonder what the other girl looks like. 😂  I can't do anything strenuous because they're afraid of more internal bleeding.  Wrap me in bubble wrap! The latest is pain behind and in my eyes which caused the blood vessels to break making me look like a zombie on Halloween.  The pressure was horrible and came forward yesterday making me look, once again, like I'd been in a bar room brawl.  I turn to Rocky and say, 'Cut me, Mick!' How many times before I have permanent damage to the optical or retinal nerve?  What about the pressure on the eye?  Hello ophthalmologist! It's like it affects every bit of my body one area at a time, from day to day. Trying to enlighten those around me is difficult because they don't always see the symptoms and I feel I come across as a drama queen when I can barely walk some days.   Ugh!  Ok...I'm going to get some good rest and fight the good battle again tomorrow.   0 likes, 8 replies "

Her main symptoms are swollen and painful limbs (not just in her joints but random places) and burst capillaries, but my main concern of late is her mental health. My mum is a tough cookie but this has really knocked her for six and I was after any advice as to what I can do to help her? She has had X2 courses of steroids, which help temporarily, and is currently taking   regularly which just about take the edge off. We are awaiting a kidney biopsy which will hopefully determine whether she is prescribed Methotrexate or Cyclophosphamide to help her condition. I have looked into dietary requirements and have adjusted accordingly but is there anything else I can buy/do to help? I am clutching at straws here but is there something to assist her getting by in everyday life? Oils/ointments? Something to help to tackle stairs when this flares up? Anything to lesson the tightening in her calf’s? Anything to help her reach cupboards when her arms ache or general advice to help when she is feeling low? Hopefully, when she is prescribed drugs this will ease the symptoms but I really am open to any suggestions meantime. It’s difficult seeing the strongest woman I know decline mentally as she is frustrated at not being able to live her normal life for fear of pain. She is also suffering fatigue and tires very quickly. I can’t seem to find anything on the internet other than drugs so any advice would be greatly appreciated! Cheryl 0 likes, 3 replies "

On the internet there are 2 kinds of weakness, true weakness and perceived weakness. You can have either one, but I believe that doesn't discount the fact that weakness itself is present. Here comes the confusion. True weakness is defined by the inability to perform basic functions such as lifting your hand etc. Perceived weakness is the feeling you get when you find yourself unable to lift your hand for a long period. Both are weaknesses. But the latter is due to fatigue (as so they say). It only gets more confusing. If you do have progressive muscle weakness, you'll find yourself slowly unable to work those muscles, setting fatigue in very easily.  Discussion point is: How would one know if their muscles are fatigued due to weakness or are weak due to fatigue ? Is there a subtle difference between those 2? This will definitely help people to tell the doctor more specific details so that correct tests can be performed.    1 like, 20 replies "

I seem to have gone downhill fast and as such I am not fit for work at the moment, and I am having an assessment on Friday as part of my Universal Credit to assess if I am fit to work at all. My feelings are definitely not as I feel terrible while working and I never get the time to recover. At the moment I am struggling just with day to day activities like housework and showering and this causes me to need to sleep in the day to give me the energy to get through the evening with my daughter. Has anyone on here had any luck with applying for and being successful with getting PIP and/or a Blue Badge? My GP is being really supportive and is going to write me supporting letters for both applications but I am bracing myself I guess to be turned down for both, and trying to ready myself for a fight with the council and DWP to prove that I can't do things for myself at home repeatedly and safely. I sent off my PIP form a couple of weeks ago but I worry I didn't put enough in it and wonder if there is any other evidence I should send in myself before they make a decision? 0 likes, 2 replies "

Mostly these symptoms get better in the late afternoon. During the evening I feel normal most of the time. The difference between morning/afternoon and evening can be very big. When I go to sleep I feel pretty normal. After a good night of sleep (no sleeping problems) I wake up and the same pattern repeats itself. The severity of the symptoms can vary greatly depending on the period. One week I feel like a zombie all the time and can hardly function, the other week I feel tired but a lot better. I have no idea why. (I have tried to link it with food or sleep or stress but there is no clear correlation). The symptoms have a serious negative impact on my life. In this 6 years I'v tried many things to figure out what is the problem: - Endless  . They where always fine. - Urine tests.  - Sleep study. No problems with sleep. - Cortisol saliva test -   of the blatter and the kindeys - eEg research - CAT scan of the sinuses - EMG research (not sure of the translation) - CEIA bilan (not sure of the translation) - Endless diets: Low-histamine diet, low-sugar diet, no-gluten diet, no-diary diet,... - I tried a lot of supplements (for more then 3 months) but there is nothing that gives me a better feeling. - Psychotherapy  - Allergy test: I am allergic to histamine and mercury - Food intolerance test: this is the only test where they found a potential cause of the symptoms. According to the test i'm intolerant to almond nuts, diary, gluten, yeast, eggs,  and bananas. I avoided these foods for 3 months without any results. Is there somebody out there with similar symptoms? Is there somebody that can give me advice in my search for a better health? How can I get rid of these headaches and the fatigue? Especially the difference between morning/daytime and eventing is very striking. It reminds me of adrenal insufficiency (the symptoms are very similar) but i have tested this and they seem to work normal (blood test and saliva test).  I have no idea why this happens to me. I eat healthy (vegetarian, lots of vegetables, no fast food, a lot of whole foods, not a lot of sugars, not a lot of processed foods,...) and I do sports at least twice a week (only during the evening because during daytime it is difficult).

Each day is a new challenge. What used to be simple, is now a seriously planned military operation. Shopping, bathing, household chores, etc. get broken down into small movements. Sound familiar? Even short 3 to 5 step activities have me leaning on a counter or wall as I catch my breath. My Dr. tells me that my O2 level is too high for him to recommend Oxygen therapy. My question is if my O2 level is in the 90s (with activity), then why am I still out of breath? I'm sure that it's not an airway restriction issue or a mucus issue, as I have a handle on those symptoms. I just can't grasp how O2 would not add to my quality of life. I know that exhaling CO2 is a priority and I do the in 2 and out 3 to 4 breathing method. It does help relieve the breathlessness quicker, but I can't help but feel that O2 would help me when I am active. I just can't resolve what I'm told, with how I feel. I've yet to hear/read an explanation for COPD's shortness of breath that satisfies me. Treatments do deal with airway restriction and mucus issues, but they do not treat shortness of breath. I understand that O2 therapy enters a patient into new medical issue areas, but used carefully would it not serve to do more good for more desperate people. I welcome a discussion on this issue and hopefully I'll finally get a better explanation that makes sense for me. All my best 3 likes, 48 replies "

One of the questions is ""date your medical condition started to affect your ability to work"".  Unlike some who started out with an infection, my fatigue came on gradually and has gotten progressively worse over years. I actually went back to school to find a desk job that would be more tolerable and then worked part-time and then couldn't work at all.

I had a severe bad mental reaction to the above medication after just 3 days which resulted in me becoming suicidal and felt disconnected etc etc, then being put straight onto mirtazapine 15mg, along with diazepam as a GP had diagnosed me with anxiety and completley dismissed the sertraline as the cause of the symptoms I was having after taking it, I was fine for 4 weeks then when came off the diazepam and just on the mirtazepine I became extremley anxious and started to become suicidal and having really dark thoughts and was not myself and just felt like a stranger in my own life, felt like my brain was shutting down mental health wise and everything else. I was then immediately put onto citalopram 10mg, on 18th december 2019, along with quetiapine 25mg for ""anxiety"" and depression, I was doing well for a couple of weeks then went downhill again and became extremley depressed again, resulting in me being signed off work again. my dosage was upped to 20mg, and quetiapine 50mg at night to slow my anxious and suicidal thoughts. I was then after about a week, fine for almost 4 weeks, which is when I went EXTREMLEY downhill again, became extremley suicidal, contemplated taking all my pills or moving out so my partner and 2 year old daughter dont have to deal with me anymore, as a constantly crying suicidal mess, not functioning, not sleeping,- not eating etc. it got so bad that we ended up getting our local mental health team intensive service involved becuase I so badly wanted help to not feel that way anymore, as I have everything in life and absolute no reason to have depression or anxiety, i was signed off from work for another month (2.5 months in total so far), and had mental health team visiting me daily. I saw a phsyciatrist and he upped my dosage of citalopram to 30mg, he said the reason I dipped straight back down was just down to my dosage not being high enough, I trusted this as seemed like a logical explanation and he has been a phsyciatrist for 37 years. I was then told to take diazepam to calm down my distress over the suicidal thoughts, and help me cope until the new dosage kicked in which the phsyciatrist said to expect small improvements after a week.

I again had 4 very good weeks where I finally thought I was better, I was mega excited to go back to work, I was happy again, I finally truly believed that it was all behind me, I expected to have a bad day here and there but I didnt care as I finally felt better. then last Sunday I started to get the burning sensation in my chest again, almost exactly 5 weeks after my dosage was upped and 3 - 4 weeks after I had started to feel better, I didnt panic too much, as I thought that it may just be abit of a blip and tried my hardest to convince myself that this didnt mean I was going to become really unwell again. so i went back to work tuesday as planned despite me feeling and noticing I was spiralling again, and tried my hardest to just get on with it, this didnt work and now I have came massively crashing down again, I have called MH team and GP who both said take 1 extra propranalol and diazepam twice a day for couple of days, which I've done this week and I'm no better and back to square one of being suicidal and basically non functioning again and scared, lost and alone, fearing I'm going to have to quit my job, feeling disconnected from the world around me, not myself again, trapped in my own head and frustrated, extremley upset, feeling like I've let down my employer and my partner and little girl as although I cant help it and am trying my hardest, they simply do not deserve to have to deal with my mental health declining like this every 4 weeks, it's like I get a glimpse of my life back then snatched back away and to say I'm heartbroken is an understatement, I'm not eating, not sleeping and barley functioning again, and unable to concentrate which means I'll have to be signed off again and I'm actually contemplating having to quit my job that I loved so so much.

He first noticed it a few weeks ago. He doesn't have any medical conditions or   other than hay fever. He isn't on any medication. He has gotten two spots. One is a singular red dot and the other is a smaller dot that comes with patches as well. The patchy spots only happened once. Both of the spots start bleeding randomly without any physcial contact. He says it's not causing him any pain, just some irritation now and then. They bleed for about a minute and then stop. The spots completely go away eventaully. He doesn't know how long. He says they usually happen in areas he sweats a lot. It has happened underneath the elbows, under his knees and his calf. He said he got spots recently on his genitals but the spots were a lot more sore and irritating and had lots of little spots of dry blood. He says he has thin skin and a possible reason for the spots is the heat. Not sure if this is important but sometimes he skips meals or doesn't eat enough. He doesn't drink a lot of water either. Sometimes he goes an entire day or two without drinking water. I've never heard of this before. Should he be concerned? He says he doesn't want to make an appointment.   0 likes, 1 reply "

I started taking Aidulan 20/75 for menstrual management of problematic periods(about to finish my last strip in my first box). I have in the past suffered with migraines of which are a risk factor with Aidulan but have been assessed and told that as my migraines aren't accompanied with aura that this isn't a problem and I hadn't had one for a very long time. I also have high blood pressure, but it seems it's only when I first see a dr/nurse as I suffer with anxiety and panic with strangers/medical environments. It is able to be bought under control to a safe level once I am relaxed. I've been advised to take it continuously in the effort to stop my periods and had a checkup on the 19th of this month to make sure my blood pressure hadn't raised and i hadn't had any migraines etc before I was given more. I had bled continuously for a week leading up to my appointment on the 19th whilst taking my pills so I was told to take a 5-7 day break to restart the process and then to continue as before, then if i bleed in the next 6 months(more than a bit of spotting or longer than 48 hours) to do the same thing. On the first day of my break i developed a headache, not what I considered a migraine but it continued constantly from the Tuesday to the Saturday of which I was taking paracetamol every 4 hours where possible. On the Saturday afternoon before re-taking my pill(in the evening) I developed a migraine without aura of which by the night time I took some Migraleve as I was due to attend a to a loud/busy event Sunday. This seemed to rid of the migraine within a few hours so I could sleep. During the Sunday I had a few little 'twinges' when turning my head so took some paracetamol once I got to the event just incase anything was to develop. On the way home from this event I developed another migraine and had to sleep on my partners shoulder on public transport to ease it. When I woke up it wasn't as bad but still had a headache and was very irritable. Monday morning I felt fine! Which is why i'm possibly linking these headaches to the 5 day pill break I took. As I had a headache every day I didn't take them which by the end of the week were migraine territory. I went through monday with a couple of twinges but didn't want to take any more painkillers as they was manageable and didn't want phantom pains from taking paracetamol for a long period of time! No headache/migraine on the Monday. The tuesday I had no headache, migraine or twinges but on the Tuesday evening i was sitting down with my back to my partner and he noticed I had a red/purple blotchy mark covering the left middle side of my back. It's almost similar to a hickey in the way it's blotchy and spread out. I've had no trauma to my back and nothing covering my back on this day/rubbing and its under the skin(not a graze). It doesn't feel bruised and I don't feel unwell - only usual fatigue that I feel on a daily basis. I wasn't in any crowds at the event the day before and the bruising wasn't there at 4pm on Tuesday. My partner noticed it at around 8pm. I was suffering with some neck pain which worried me a little last night(the Tuesday) so I decided to do the silly thing and google my symptoms of which told me it's a blood clot (risk associated with Aidulan which could lead to stroke) and possibly Leukemia/sepsis/meningitis!! I've logged into my GP's online portal of which there is no available appointments for the next week, and navigated the online 111 service which has told me to see a GP within 2 hours(2 hours has now passed) or visit an urgent care centre many miles away. So basically, to cut a long story short. I take Aidulan, i've had headaches/migraines for the last week which have now subsided, but I have suspect bruising on my back with no cause/trauma. Should I be worried? Should I make the journey to A&E or will I be laughed out for wasting time for a bruise? Does anyone have any similar pictures? I don't know what it is and can't find anything on google images that looks remotely similar. To add, I have done a glass test and the mark doesn't disappear under glass. Thanks in advance!

I started taking Aidulan 20/75 for menstrual management of problematic periods(about to finish my last strip in my first box). I have in the past suffered with migraines of which are a risk factor with Aidulan but have been assessed and told that as my migraines aren't accompanied with aura that this isn't a problem and I hadn't had one for a very long time. I also have high blood pressure, but it seems it's only when I first see a dr/nurse as I suffer with anxiety and panic with strangers/medical environments. It is able to be bought under control to a safe level once I am relaxed. I've been advised to take it continuously in the effort to stop my periods and had a checkup on the 19th of this month to make sure my blood pressure hadn't raised and i hadn't had any migraines etc before I was given more. I had bled continuously for a week leading up to my appointment on the 19th whilst taking my pills so I was told to take a 5-7 day break to restart the process and then to continue as before, then if i bleed in the next 6 months(more than a bit of spotting or longer than 48 hours) to do the same thing. On the first day of my break i developed a headache, not what I considered a migraine but it continued constantly from the Tuesday to the Saturday of which I was taking paracetamol every 4 hours where possible. On the Saturday afternoon before re-taking my pill(in the evening) I developed a migraine without aura of which by the night time I took some Migraleve as I was due to attend a to a loud/busy event Sunday. This seemed to rid of the migraine within a few hours so I could sleep. During the Sunday I had a few little 'twinges' when turning my head so took some paracetamol once I got to the event just incase anything was to develop. On the way home from this event I developed another migraine and had to sleep on my partners shoulder on public transport to ease it. When I woke up it wasn't as bad but still had a headache and was very irritable. Monday morning I felt fine! Which is why i'm possibly linking these headaches to the 5 day pill break I took. As I had a headache every day I didn't take them which by the end of the week were migraine territory. I went through monday with a couple of twinges but didn't want to take any more painkillers as they was manageable and didn't want phantom pains from taking paracetamol for a long period of time! No headache/migraine on the Monday. The tuesday I had no headache, migraine or twinges but on the Tuesday evening i was sitting down with my back to my partner and he noticed I had a red/purple blotchy mark covering the left middle side of my back. It's almost similar to a hickey in the way it's blotchy and spread out. I've had no trauma to my back and nothing covering my back on this day/rubbing and its under the skin(not a graze). It doesn't feel bruised and I don't feel unwell - only usual fatigue that I feel on a daily basis. I wasn't in any crowds at the event the day before and the bruising wasn't there at 4pm on Tuesday. My partner noticed it at around 8pm. I was suffering with some neck pain which worried me a little last night(the Tuesday) so I decided to do the silly thing and google my symptoms of which told me it's a blood clot (risk associated with Aidulan which could lead to stroke) and possibly Leukemia/sepsis/meningitis!! I've logged into my GP's online portal of which there is no available appointments for the next week, and navigated the online 111 service which has told me to see a GP within 2 hours(2 hours has now passed) or visit an urgent care centre many miles away. So basically, to cut a long story short. I take Aidulan, i've had headaches/migraines for the last week which have now subsided, but I have suspect bruising on my back with no cause/trauma. Should I be worried? Should I make the journey to A&E or will I be laughed out for wasting time for a bruise? Does anyone have any similar pictures? I don't know what it is and can't find anything on google images that looks remotely similar. To add, I have done a glass test and the mark doesn't disappear under glass. Thanks in advance!

I then made the fatal mistake of coming home and reading up all the information (and horror stories) on the internet.  So I thought I would like to give a first hand account of my own experience for anyone that is about to have this op.  My actual experience was a lot better than I was anticipating (and what I had read about!!!!!). The operation lasted between 3 -4 hours and I had an overnight stay in the hospital. During the operation my cholesteatoma was removed using miniature laser precision instruments, a titanium strip was used to repair the damaged hearing bone and my eardrum was repaired.  The operation was performed by Mr Hamilton who specialises in this technique. I feel as though he did a very good job. I had no pain, dizziness or balance problems immediately afterwards or in fact in the last 7 weeks. When I came round from the op I had packing in my ear and a turban type bandage holding the dressing in place. The turban was removed the following morning before I left the hospital but the next 3 weeks my hearing was very limited with the packing.    The internal packing was removed three weeks after the op and I had to have some small dressings inserted as there was still some seepage happening. Apparently in children the ear will repair itself much quicker....but I am on the wrong side of 60....so its taking longer!!  After a further 3 weeks wait I returned to have the dressings removed. In another 6 weeks time I will undertake a hearing test to see what sort of hearing I have recovered. I am feeling optimistic that I will have some decent hearing levels as I can already notice that my hearing is getting better in that ear. It has good days and bad days. At the moment I seem to have the pulsatile tinnitus returned again but I am happy to say that its not anywhere near as severe as it was prior to having the op. Some days my ear feels quite full and I don't hear so well from that side....then a few days later it makes a few strange noises and popping sounds and my hearing seems better. But its only week 7 and I understand that its a long process of getting the ear canal settled back down to a dry ear and normality. I am happy that I've had the op as its got rid of a pretty miserable time when I had 24 hour round the clock severe pulsatile tinnitus.   I am glad that I chose to have it done by laser surgery as the recovery time is better apparently (there is less bleeding with laser so less blood and debris for the ear to try and absorb and get rid of during the recovery period)   I just wish I hadn't read so many horror stories on the internet beforehand....as I had got myself worked up into quite a state before the op!!!!!   I hope this has been helpful to anyone about to have surgery. 0 likes, 3 replies "

In another 6 weeks time I will undertake a hearing test to see what sort of hearing I have recovered. I am feeling optimistic that I will have some decent hearing levels as I can already notice that my hearing is getting better in that ear. It has good days and bad days. At the moment I seem to have the pulsatile tinnitus returned again but I am happy to say that its not anywhere near as severe as it was prior to having the op. Some days my ear feels quite full and I don't hear so well from that side....then a few days later it makes a few strange noises and popping sounds and my hearing seems better. But its only week 7 and I understand that its a long process of getting the ear canal settled back down to a dry ear and normality. I am happy that I've had the op as its got rid of a pretty miserable time when I had 24 hour round the clock severe pulsatile tinnitus.   I am glad that I chose to have it done by laser surgery as the recovery time is better apparently (there is less bleeding with laser so less blood and debris for the ear to try and absorb and get rid of during the recovery period)   I just wish I hadn't read so many horror stories on the internet beforehand....as I had got myself worked up into quite a state before the op!!!!!   I hope this has been helpful to anyone about to have surgery. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I underwent 3 operations, the first was to look at the severity of it,  the second was to remove it and to reconstruct one of the bones that had been eaten away and the third was a double check to make sure it was gone.  But 6 years have passed now and I get quite a lot of pain inside my ear after sleeping on it or going underwater.  Everytime I go to the GP they take a look and tell me that it's a build up of wax that's causing the issue.. I have a very large collection of ear drops in the medicine cupboard 😂  Does anybody know if it's possible that the cholesteatoma has come back?  Or is the discomfort just a side effect of the surgery and is something that I'll just have to deal with forever?  Thanks. 1 like, 31 replies "

This Tuesday I go in for more tests, additional MRI and a CAT scan as well as follow up with my Otolaryngologist. I want to make sure I am asking all of the right questions. He thinks this is congenital and I have just now been diagnosed at age 50 so I am a little scared of what these additional tests will show. Here is what I know so far Profound hearing loss problem ear and some hearing loss in the other ear, Have also been suffering from long-term balance issues and fatigue. He is planning on a radical Mastiodectomy with facial nerve decompression as needed. Enclosure of the external auditory canal. He said I will take several months to recover and will need physical therapy for my balance as I will have no balance function on the right. He said I will need yearly MRIs as follow up ( chance of reoccurrence 30% ) and possibly a second look-see surgery in 6-12 months after surgery. Ok amazing people what questions do you think are most important to ask or that you wish you would have thought to ask before surgery. Thanks in advance. 0 likes, 6 replies "

Seeking Advice. (All info inside),"Hello everyone, Let me start with my info. 29 years old Male 140 LBS 5'9 Height No previous medical history ever. My dad has a weak heart. Cardiovascular disease. Mother is clean with no problem. I've been dealing with a chest discomfort/pain for almost 8 months now. I have done countless searches online trying to find out what may be wrong with me, or even find advice from others that have experienced the same thing but to no avail, was I able to find help. The Pain - How it occurs The pain is there every single day of my life for the past 8 months. EVERY single day. However, it's not the type of pain that happens when I'm standing still. I can mostly feel the pain when I stick my chest out. Whenever I expand my chest, I feel discomfort/pain inside of my chest. I can feel it under my sternum bone. This made me think that it's probably my lung lining that are inflamed and possibly swollen, so it's causing discomfort when I expand it. The pain is much harder when I sneeze. Sometimes, I would feel the pain when I cough but a lot of times I don't. Just like taking deep breath. Sometimes I would feel sharp pain, but sometimes I won't. But most importantly, the pain and discomfort is there 24/7 every time I stick my chest out or stick my chest in. The pain is mainly in the middle of my chest but sometimes it'll cause discomfort on my right side or left side chest. Other times, I have felt sharp hard pain in the left side of my chest where my heart is while laying down. I have also felt sharp pains around my shoulder bone and the back of my shoulder. I have felt pain on my back area also. Also, about 3 weeks ago, I've developed new symptoms such as a lump-like stuck in my throat sensation and my stomach stinging. My stomach also feels solid when I press it while laying down. These physical pain have been haunting me for months. The Tests For the past 7 months, I've visited countless doctors to try and figure this out fast and get it resolved. All the tests I've done, I will list it below. 2 visit to ER 3 Chest X-Ray 3 EKG 1 Chest CT Scan 1 Chest MRI Scan 3 Annual Blood Test (std included) Echocardiogram (heart check) Heart Stress Test (heart check) Endoscopy (check stomach and esophagus) Abdominal Ultrasound (checking kidney, liver, and stomach) Majority of these testing were done for elimination. Eliminating other risk such as heart attack, esophagus inflammation, and others. Everything came out normal except my Vitamin D which was fairly low. At this point, I don't know exactly what test I have to do now. One thing for sure is, I haven't exactly gotten my lungs checked except with radiology scans. I was told that for most lung problems, radiology is the only thing needed. However, if it's pleurisy, this can't really be found from radiology and how come non of my doctors suspected this? The Probable Cause So while being in pain and literally depressed for the past 7 months, I've sat and tried to wonder what exactly could have caused this problem to begin with. So I took my time to recollect my memory and try to remember when exactly the pain first started. I remember the first time I felt this pain was extremely mild. I was sitting on my computer chair and smoking Juul e-cig in my room. It was just a slight discomfort under the right side of my chest. It felt like a bone was cramped or something and needed to be popped/cracked. It was a very mild discomfort so I completely ignored it (thinking it'll get better with rest). However, ever since that day, the pain grew worse. I did some heavy lifting and other physical activity as time passed and believe that may have made my situation worse. Please note that this was all before the whole e-cig/vape epidemic. I quit Juul after I felt the discomfort but it didn't help. Some of the other list below may be the probable cause. I received a corticosteroid shot on my butt for an allergic reaction. I heard corticosteroids can cause a very bad side effect. I remember after receiving this shot, I started to develop huge stretch mark on my thighs that I have never had in my life before. Extremely heavy object lifting. I had to clean up this giant pot in my balcony that was filled with water + mold (from heavy rain). I covered it and lifted it to throw it away. This thing was about 400 LBS and I can't carry such weight. I'm 140lbs and thin. Could this have tear my muscle? Weakened chest bone from low vitamin D? Rib problem - when I was little, I had an accident that made one of my rib get pushed in. So one of my right side rib line is kind of ""pushed in"" compare to the other ones. It kind of feels like I'm missing a rib  line but it's in there. I never had any problem with my rib or my body while growing up. 20 years later, I'm starting to feel this chest pain. Could the rib be connected to my chest pain? So at this point, I don't know what to do, what test to do, and what steps to take. I tried taking vitamin D 2000mg per day but it's not helping me. I've tried taking medication such as NSAIDs but it's not relieving the pain. I even got a NSAID shot at the ER which didn't make the pain go away. The pain and discomfort feels like something is just... stuck there under my right side chest. It feels like it needs to be cracked or popped. It's extremely annoying. So overall, I would really appreciate it if anyone can share any good advice on what I should do next to try to get this resolved. 0 likes, 0 replies "

The Tests For the past 7 months, I've visited countless doctors to try and figure this out fast and get it resolved. All the tests I've done, I will list it below. 2 visit to ER 3 Chest X-Ray 3 EKG 1 Chest CT Scan 1 Chest MRI Scan 3 Annual Blood Test (std included) Echocardiogram (heart check) Heart Stress Test (heart check) Endoscopy (check stomach and esophagus) Abdominal Ultrasound (checking kidney, liver, and stomach) Majority of these testing were done for elimination. Eliminating other risk such as heart attack, esophagus inflammation, and others. Everything came out normal except my Vitamin D which was fairly low. At this point, I don't know exactly what test I have to do now. One thing for sure is, I haven't exactly gotten my lungs checked except with radiology scans. I was told that for most lung problems, radiology is the only thing needed. However, if it's pleurisy, this can't really be found from radiology and how come non of my doctors suspected this? The Probable Cause So while being in pain and literally depressed for the past 7 months, I've sat and tried to wonder what exactly could have caused this problem to begin with. So I took my time to recollect my memory and try to remember when exactly the pain first started. I remember the first time I felt this pain was extremely mild. I was sitting on my computer chair and smoking Juul e-cig in my room. It was just a slight discomfort under the right side of my chest. It felt like a bone was cramped or something and needed to be popped/cracked. It was a very mild discomfort so I completely ignored it (thinking it'll get better with rest). However, ever since that day, the pain grew worse. I did some heavy lifting and other physical activity as time passed and believe that may have made my situation worse. Please note that this was all before the whole e-cig/vape epidemic. I quit Juul after I felt the discomfort but it didn't help. Some of the other list below may be the probable cause. I received a corticosteroid shot on my butt for an allergic reaction. I heard corticosteroids can cause a very bad side effect. I remember after receiving this shot, I started to develop huge stretch mark on my thighs that I have never had in my life before. Extremely heavy object lifting. I had to clean up this giant pot in my balcony that was filled with water + mold (from heavy rain). I covered it and lifted it to throw it away. This thing was about 400 LBS and I can't carry such weight. I'm 140lbs and thin. Could this have tear my muscle? Weakened chest bone from low vitamin D? Rib problem - when I was little, I had an accident that made one of my rib get pushed in. So one of my right side rib line is kind of ""pushed in"" compare to the other ones. It kind of feels like I'm missing a rib  line but it's in there. I never had any problem with my rib or my body while growing up. 20 years later, I'm starting to feel this chest pain. Could the rib be connected to my chest pain? So at this point, I don't know what to do, what test to do, and what steps to take. I tried taking vitamin D 2000mg per day but it's not helping me. I've tried taking medication such as NSAIDs but it's not relieving the pain. I even got a NSAID shot at the ER which didn't make the pain go away. The pain and discomfort feels like something is just... stuck there under my right side chest. It feels like it needs to be cracked or popped. It's extremely annoying. So overall, I would really appreciate it if anyone can share any good advice on what I should do next to try to get this resolved. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Seeking Advice. (All info inside),"Hello everyone, Let me start with my info. 29 years old Male 140 LBS 5'9 Height No previous medical history ever. My dad has a weak heart. Cardiovascular disease. Mother is clean with no problem. I've been dealing with a chest discomfort/pain for almost 8 months now. I have done countless searches online trying to find out what may be wrong with me, or even find advice from others that have experienced the same thing but to no avail, was I able to find help. The Pain - How it occurs The pain is there every single day of my life for the past 8 months. EVERY single day. However, it's not the type of pain that happens when I'm standing still. I can mostly feel the pain when I stick my chest out. Whenever I expand my chest, I feel discomfort/pain inside of my chest. I can feel it under my sternum bone. This made me think that it's probably my lung lining that are inflamed and possibly swollen, so it's causing discomfort when I expand it. The pain is much harder when I sneeze. Sometimes, I would feel the pain when I cough but a lot of times I don't. Just like taking deep breath. Sometimes I would feel sharp pain, but sometimes I won't. But most importantly, the pain and discomfort is there 24/7 every time I stick my chest out or stick my chest in. The pain is mainly in the middle of my chest but sometimes it'll cause discomfort on my right side or left side chest. Other times, I have felt sharp hard pain in the left side of my chest where my heart is while laying down. I have also felt sharp pains around my shoulder bone and the back of my shoulder. I have felt pain on my back area also. Also, about 3 weeks ago, I've developed new symptoms such as a lump-like stuck in my throat sensation and my stomach stinging.

I have been having chest pain for last 18 months on and off. I also appear to have a high heart rate most of the time but then can be average when it feels like it!! For example twice at the doctors it has been 130 and then 150, and sat at home it can reach these readings. Then i can be walking and my pulse will reach 170 odd then sometimes i can walk the same distance and its 83. The chest pain is worse after exercise, but i do have random episodes, sat on sofa, just recently, once when lying down. The one lying down i got out of bed, had a vertigo episide, which i have never had before and a headache. and was sick and had chest comfort.This i reported to my doctor and since have bisophorul. Couple weeks later checkup with doctor my pulse was 118 at rest but a newer sympton my blood pressure was higher ( i usually have average readings everytime) . was 155/80 . 6 months ago i had a heart scan which was normal and ecg was normal so cardiology were fine to say dont need to see me again. positive its not related to stress as only have minor stresses in life which dont get me het up. i would point out my brother has heart disease but cardiology have said its not related. Sometimes my chest just feels like pressure on the left hand side but just lately it feels like that and almost like someone ripping it. this ripping lasts a few seconds then its the normal chest pain i get. most of the time it radiates to the left back/ shoulder  and my left arm feels weak.  The doc has kept me on a low dose of bisophurol but i havent really had an answer. could this be related to something else going on in the body, or i have i just got a naturally high pulse or is it to do with my heart? doctors dont know. has anyone else had similar symtons? 0 likes, 4 replies "

So I decided that I wanted to take it, because the media has made it seem like it's really important to take it, and most of my friends also took it.

My arm hurt and I got dizzy and stayed at the hospital for 30 minutes (the nurse who took the shot adviced me to stay afterwards, before even taking it just because I got a fever from the Swine Flu vaccine). When I then walked home, I was still dizzy and I felt weak. I think I felt dizzy the rest of the day. During the evening I decided to google about the vaccine (WHY DIDN'T I DO IT BEFOREHAND?!) and read about how bad and unneccessary it really is. And how many girls and women have gotten syndromes etc. that they now have to live with for the rest of their lives. It's been on the market for soo long, why is no one stopping it? Yesterday (the day after I took the vaccine) I felt a bit dizzy, but not really. My arm still hurt a little bit. But I also didn't sleep many hours that night. During the evening I got a really bad headache and went to bed early. I woke up in the middle of the night and I was sweating. I took my temperature in the morning and it was at 36.7 degrees Celsius, so no fever. But I still felt hot. Now my left arm and hand (where I took the shot) hurts a lot, more than yesterday. I did NOT sleep on my left arm, but on the right, and that arm feels fine. The pain doesn't entirely come from the spot where they injected the vaccine though (upper arm). It's more from the bend of my arm, down to my hand. I've read about girls getting the guillain-barré syndrome.

I feel safer that way. BUT, is the damage already done for me? I read that a 20 year old woman got POTS 2 months after her FIRST shot. Another one, also in her 20s got it 15 days after. Someone got something else around 6 months later. I'm literally going to have anxiety for a year now, worrying that I will get something that I have to live with. Could the vaccine affect me in a year or more? I mean, could I get guillain-barré syndrome, POTS, or whatever a year or more after because of it? I am SO SO SO scared that I might get something.

Could it be that cervical cancer is easy to catch and treat so this vaccine is not really even necessary? After all, you're required to have pap screenings for this anyway.  I'm very very conflicted on this vaccine.

Secondly - I know I should visit an orthopedic specialist - I already did. Hey guys. I need a little help with my scoliosos. When I was 20 I started to notice some rib hump on my left side and assymetrical chest. I knew it was a scoliosis so I went to visit an orthopaedist . He told me it is not serious at all and he did not even made X-ray because he said it is not necessary. He showed me some excersises and told me to move more. I was not quite sure, so I went to another doctor and he told me the same - my scoliosis is not serious any if I will work out and exercise it will get better. This is how my scoliosis looked then, when I visisted those both doctors. -  So I did my exercises and tried some yoga, but as I went to the college I stopped exercising and spent a lot of time only sitting behind books or computer. My only exercising was tennis, which I still play very often (I know it is not the best sport for scoliosis). Now 4 years later I visited the doctor again and he told me the same. It is not serious and I should doing exercises and so on. He has not told me much. What kind of scoliosis it is, what exercises are best. I try to gain some information about my scoliosis to find best exercises as I finally have time to work out and get it better. This is how my scoliosis looks today (not a much difference, but you can clearly see the scioliosis in the thoracic area?) -   Also my left nipple seems lower as my left side of chest is not so prominent.  What do you think? It is still not that serious? Doctors I visited did not even do Xray. I woud like to know, which side is my weak side. Left or Right? Is it thoracic scoliosis or lumbar? And which side should I work out more. Also if you can help with some good exercises, you can write them down. I know that not all of you are othopeadist here, but only if you could tell me some little things. Thank you very much. I really want to change it and know more about my scoliosis and exercise, but doctors in my town and country, they do not tell me much. Only that it is minor (but why my ribs and chest is assymetrical?). And I can afford seeing other specialist. Can you maybe recommend some good videos on youtube or your own experiences? Thank you. 0 likes, 4 replies "

I was diagnosed with scoliosis when I was 11 (now 38) and I was borderline at the age of 16 of getting a operation due to my curve (S shaped). I used to get awful back pain but due to that subsiding I decided against the operation and have had no issues as such.  I have always had one hip higher than the other and clothes can look funny on me and just don’t sit right which I’m sure a few of you can sympathise with. I’ve had a feeling that I’m beginning to shrink and a few of my friends have politely pointed out that I look lop sided and along with feeling short of breath I’m beginning to wonder if this is connected to my scoliosis. I had a lung x-Ray a few months back and they mentioned that they could see I had scoliosis. The last time I seen anyone was over 20 years ago so my question is, do you think I should ask for a review? I’m in no pain as such so don’t want to use up valuable resource time but just wondering if this is something I should get checked from time to time?  Many thanks in advance.  0 likes, 6 replies "

I try to wear flat shoes, use a back-pack style hand bag, and tight clothes feel uncomfortable.   Good luck and blessings to anyone with this extra thing to deal with... 0 likes, 1 reply "

The lower was done first, where rods were placed in my back with screws. Then a couple of months later, i had my upper back fused and rods and screws placed up there as well. I have never really had much back pain after the surgeries. I am a professional dancer, and broke one of the screws that was placed in my back. I went to see my doctor when that was bothering me, and he said it will not harm me, so there is no reason to take it out. The broken screw is on my right lower back. Now just within the past month i have been getting this awful pain in the middle of my back to the point where I cannot move. I went to see me doctor and they did an x-ray and said they did not find anything to be shifted or wrong. it has been happening more often in the last week now. The pain is on my right side in the middle of my back. It feels like my back is burning, when I get this pain. I have found that if I massage it, it will go away. But it hurts tremendously to massage my back, and when I do it feels like my rod the was placed in is sticking out(which I know it is not). I have not found a certain thing that I do to trigger this pain. Sometimes, it goes on fro 5 minutes and other times I have the pain for hours. Does anyone else have any type of pain like this or have experienced something like this? if you need more details, I can certainly try to give them to you. I just figured I would come to this site, since the doctor was unable to tell me anything. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I checked online and it's very rare for squirrels to carry the disease of rabies.. But.. what freaks me out so much is the way it was acting. Again, it didn't bite so...

It seems to mainly manifest when I engage in ""leg extension"" type moves. Not that I do leg extensions on the machine or anything... It's weird... I could do weighted squats just fine, but sometimes, I'll be sitting on an office chair, and propel myself back, and THEN I'll feel it in my left knee. It's like, a semi-sharp thing under the kneecap. Possibly related: My knees click a lot. If I'm standing around, and I lightly lock and unlock my knees, more often than not, it'll ""click"" audibly, kinda like the sound of cracking knuckles. Sometimes I'll feel the aforementioned knee pain more than other times, and usually, one ""click"" will relieve it somewhat. When I'm climbing stairs, there's no audible clicking, but I can ""feel"" it clicking a bit with every step up I take, and hear like a high-pitched version ripple through my body... if that makes sense... Is this something familiar to anyone? p.s. I've scheduled an appointment with a PT, but wanted to get the hive-mind's perspective too. In general, I have some amount of hypermobility (most noticeable in my shoulders, which dislocate super-easily, if in a precarious position like attempting an overhead squat), and the occasional lower back pain... I wonder if that's all linked, or if this is separate... It'd be good to know if there's an overall thing that's exacerbating this, or if the knee issue is isolated. 0 likes, 2 replies "

This forum has been very helpful to me as I struggle with so much pain, lack of sleep,  , shortness of breath and staying positive. I know I am not alone. How could I have predicted that I was amongst the last patients to have this surgery as we faced a global pandemic? Obviously, hospital visits stopped and the physio department closed. My 6 week post op check with the consultant will be by telephone. I've had to get on with physio on my own  in lockdown but of course haven't had any measurements taken. It's hard to maintain a  positive attitude and look forward to normal activities post op when  in isolation and lockdown. The TKR journey is not without periods of   about the future. The coronavirus pandemic ramps up these  anxiety levels. To anyone else out there experiencing TKR recovery in these extraordinary times we must try to be kind to ourselves. Its a long slog but one day we will be pain free and the pandemic will be over. Stay safe! 0 likes, 8 replies "

I told my family dr about it but she wasnt concerned. A couple months later in April i got really sick and went to the hospital. I had severe pain in the middle of my stomach directly across my belly button, and i couldnt stop vomitting. My wbc was at 15,300 and the er dr couldnt find anything wrong we thought it was an apendicits but my scan showed nothing wrong. he just kept asking me if ive noticed any swelling. thinking back and to this day my stomach randomly swells. i mean it gets huge and weird looking, but im not sure if thats cause for concern. Ever since i got sick ive been off and on sick, and i have scattered petechaie i have some on my face, arms, one spot on my chest, and a couple on my leg... i really have no idea what is going on.

Like I said, my previous PCP doesn't have the resources and I feel bad going to a clinic that treats lower-income clients when I can afford a regular doctor (it was just my first doctor in a new city at the time). SO I'm getting in with a new PCP at the big hospital chain I mentioned, but appointment is not for another month and a half! This has already given me so much anxiety on a daily basis. I try not to think about it and bother my mom and boyfriend about it, but I'm about to LOSE IT. Please (using your kindest words) offer me any advice you can. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I've had a chest x-ray, it was clear. And I've had an ecg, it was clear. The pain started out of nowhere, and it is mostly on the left side of my chest, but spreads to the right side, and sometimes the middle. It can range from just a tiny bit of pain to being horrible. It was only when I breathed at the start, but now it's constant. I've also been getting recurring chest infections, and pains in my back and arms. The pain is like a sharp stabbing pain, or can be a weird pressure on my chest. I've also been very out of breath lately, if I walk up and down the stairs I'm gasping for air, but I was fine a few weeks ago. I've taken anti-inflammatory meditation, but it hasn't worked at all. I have a blood test tomorrow, but I'm getting to the point where I'm worried. I've always been healthy, and have had no health problems prior to this. I'm only in my teens aswell. 0 likes, 6 replies "

My main concern is this chest pain i have the Last 3 days, without any break! Basically, the pain is located on the left side of my chest, sometimes it is quite strong, often making me feel dizzy. I must add that i also observe stomach problems during he chest pains (pain in the stomach, gassy sounds inside the stomach, a bit increased burping etc. Chest pain often makes me very upset, often ending up in the emergency in hospital, where after usual Heart checks (blood test, x-Ray of the thorax, ecg) i am always clean!  I literally suffer from this chest pain 3 days in a row now, it is a located (on the upper left side of the chest) sharp pain that comes and goes through the Day, lasting even 1hour or so! Also went to my cardiologist where after an echo, holter and running test were all clear again. Doc said problem is anxiety! Can really anxiety create such sufferring chest pain like heart attack? Maybe it is something related to stomach pain? But if that was the case, the pain should be located right at the center of my chest, not at the left, right?  I am SO confused, please help!! Thank you! Ps: forgot to add the constant ear ringing i am having as well! 0 likes, 5 replies "

I am sedentary unfortunately and work as a driver, so I sit a lot in a specific position with my arms also in the same spot all the time.  I have a history of anxiety, which tenses up the muscles(think like 20 000 panic attacks more or less).  The anxiety is mostly gone, but a few people in the health industry have commented at just how unbelievably tight and knotted my muscles are. I have a significant hiatal hernia.

I also sometimes get a light headed feeling and a feeling of impending doom or like I am about to die. Those 2 latter symptoms are mostly infrequent and the lightheadedness can come and go and doesn't seem to have any real relation to the pain. The pain is usually between a 1 and 3 most of the time but flares to a 6 to 8 sometimes for between a couple hours and a couple days at a time. Recently I have also had muscle aches on the left side of my neck and shoulder and sometimes my left arm feels different. These pains only started since I started propping up the head of my bed but that may be a coincidence.  I went to the ER twice the first month this started with xrays,   and ekgs all coming back negative. They discovered HB at 160/100 and I have been taking medication since that keeps it at around 130/80 or 125/75 when I'm relaxed. I also had an upper GI endoscopy the first month that found reflux esophagitis. About 9 months ago I had an   and a stress test that came back negative. I also had a barium swallow that showed mild reflux. The pain is constant 24/7, as is a feeling of something wrong in my chest. It seems to be the least first thing in the morning before I start moving around. It doesn't seem to have any relation to exertion really. I can run and get my HR up to 175+ and it doesn't seem to get too much worse, although I may get pains elsewhere that cause me concern so I very rarely exercise strenuously. When the sensations peak I feel like moving around and being active and sitting still seems to make it worse. Jogging for a short time seems to slightly relieve the episode. I had strep throat a couple weeks ago that caused a   outbreak, the first time I have had anything like this. I have been taking 40mg of nexium in the AM and PM and drink gaviscon throughout the day but cant tell if that has any real effect. The closest correlation I seem to be able to make is that the day after I drink excessive alcohol it seem like there is a greater chance for a more severe episode. It also seems to be worse on my days off from work sometimes but that's a flimsy correlation and I will have short term flare ups at work. Has anyone ever heard of anything like this? What other tests should I schedule? Thank you. 2 likes, 11 replies "

My doctor prescribed me something to stop my periods because the implant made me bleed for a month straight about six months ago, so I don't know the regular time for my period.

After a trip to the mountains for my anniversary I came back with a awful headache. By the next day it was a full blown migraine. So I went to my primary dr, Imitrex and Prednisone is what I'm given. After 48hrs I went to the ER, IV migraine cocktail and sent home with a few meds. Nothing helps. 48 hrs later I'm back in the ER, IV migraine cocktail again and sent home with Valium and Naproxen. No help. 48hrs later I went to Prompt Care, asked for a shot of Toradol and Benadryl, plus a RX for Toradol and Reglan. 24 hrs later most of the pain is gone. Another 24hrs and I'm finally better. Well now, about a week later, I'm dealing with extreme eye pain, no migraine, just eye pain. Finally after  a week I cant take it any more and I'm back in the ER. IV Toradol again and told I need to see an Opthalmologist and Neurologist ( I knew that much at that point). The Opthalmologist I would like to see is booked thru January and I have not yet called a Neurologist yet. Any one had these issues? Any suggestions?? 0 likes, 3 replies "

Had surgery. Can’t straighten arm. Stuck at 90 degrees. ,"Hi, i'm wondering if anyone can kindly help me please.. I broke my right arm in 2 places during an incident. 1 break was on my forearm which I was told this will heal on its own but I still get pain now and I can still feel some sort of ‘clicking’ movement. The 2nd break was on my humerus on my elbow of which I had surgery which entailed me having 1 plate and 2 screws. As soon as I broke my arm I’d attended A&E of which they admitted me straight to a ward after x-rays etc. Kept me in over night fasting me ready for my operation. Operation was cancelled 3 separate times over the course of 24 hours and then I was sent home with just a sling and was given a date for my operation 9 days later of which I woke up towards the end of my operation and I could hear them banging and my body was shunting but my arm had a ‘blocker’ to numb any feelings. I made everyone aware by shouting, “im awake, I’m awake!” Then I could feel a liquid running inside my left arm where they injected me and next thing I woke up on the ward. I was sent home 2 hours later with no feeling whatsoever in my arm. Then the fun part started. So I attended every physio session and doing my own excersises at home too. Was only in a sling and no other support. Long story short, now I’m 9 months on, my physio stopped 5 months ago because I was told there’s no progress and I can only straighten my arm to 90 degrees. This has a HUGE impact on my life as I am self employed. Every day I’m learning that there’s certain things I cannot do anymore. I still get pain. I cannot enjoy or even participate in certain hobbies. And being self employed it’s a struggle to take any time off work as I’ll have no income. Thank you, S 0 likes, 2 replies "

During this time, my symptoms were worsening with chest pain and a numb left arm being thrown into the mix. Another visit to my GP resulted in a referral for a 24 hour ECG.

January 2017 I first went to the doctors with sudden waking at night and dizziness (as well as many other unpleasant symptoms). I was quickly diagnosed with vertigo, prescribed Prochlorperazine and referred to ENT. My first appointment they concurred however my second with a different doctor didn’t agree with the vertigo diagnosis believing it was something else and referred me to a sleep clinic and for an MRI. After a few tests for sleep apnoea this was ruled out. My MRI, however, showed an arnold Chiari malformation. A further referral to a neurosurgeon was done with a second MRI to check my cerebral fluid flow. During this time, my symptoms were worsening with chest pain and a numb left arm being thrown into the mix. Another visit to my GP resulted in a referral for a 24 hour ECG. The results from that showed I had 4 episodes in one night of tachycardia whilst asleep so the doctor diagnosed arrhythmia. A cardiologist appointment had already been arranged but not until the beginning of October.

Now in January I have appointment with another Neurosurgeon but I am almost 100% sure that he will say the same and will not take me under treatment. I am so sad, because this illness affect my life and I will like to get rid of this problem that become worse since I had spinal surgery. I am asking you do you have some information of surgical treatment in Europe, or some groups for support in Europe, standing/sitting MRI in Europe, cost of decompresion surgery in Europe, Doctors in Europe  or maybe some other information.. thank you very much. 0 likes, 1 reply "

After surgery I have new neck pain and had CCI, which got mostly better after PT. That caused new problems with vision and a “bobble head” for a while. My surgeon initially said there was about a 20% possibility I would need a second surgery. I also have basilar invagination and a retroflexed ondontoid. So the next surgery would involve a spinal fusion where they put pins in the spine and fuse them into the skull. I’d lose 40% or so mobility in turning my head. Anyone go through this type of surgery? I actually thought my first decompression (C1 laminectomy, craniectomy, duraplasty) was incredibly smooth, not painful, and easy to recover from. ACL/meniscus surgery was more painful. I am far outside the norm there and the doctor said he had never seen a patient like me, so I’m lucky there. So anyone have experience with a second surgery like this? Also, anyone else have a yellow skull? Apparently I do, and the doc said he had never seen that. I’m a weirdo it seems haha. Would love to hear about experiences from anyone else, especially about the spinal fusion part. Thanks! 0 likes, 1 reply "

Toddler - Hypertension Undiagnosed,"Hi, I am really in need of your help.  If this isn't the right place for this post, or there is a better place for it, please let me know. Roughly 5 weeks ago, my 2 year 4 month old boy started acting very lethargic and just overall weird.  After four trips to the hospital / clinic, the doctors finally identified that his blood pressure was dangerously high, like 145/100.   They admitted us to the hospital and then ICU and slowly brought his blood pressure back under control with Labetelol and Norvasc. Since then, we have been searching for a cause (and solution) with no luck, and we're running out of things to look at.   We have, at times, suspected a pheochromocytoma, renal artery stenosis, seizures, heart problems, and more, and, essentially, the doctors are running out of things to look for.   I can provide more detail if desired, but here are some of the things we've done: I'm sure there's more that I'm missing, but the doctors have essentially exhausted their testing.  He's on 2.2 milligrams of amlodapine (Norvasc) twice daily and it more-or-less keeps his blood pressure below 110/xx, but we have been having to add in the Labetelol recently on an as-needed basis to keep it below 120/xx. My wife and I are really scared for him - this whole thing has been just killing us.  Is there anyone put there that has any ideas?? Thank you in advance 0 likes, 0 replies "

In my 30s I was diagnosed with ADD, I was given a titration of Vyvanse which as the dosage got larger I it put me to sleep harder. It was almost the same as taking a sleeping pill. I was then put on Ritalin. Same deal. Although quicker and didn’t last as long. Adderall again. Same deal. More I take the more I need to drop a sleep. Which also means I am absorbing the medication as it is having an effect. I have tried ldopa/ l-tyrosine no effect. When taking any stimulants I don’t get that rush, it’s like a damp cloth on my brain. My doctor is at a loss, he’s never seen someone take higher dosages of stimulants and it put them more and more a sleep, even with a high tolerance. Another attempt was Atomoxetine, plus Ritalin, plus ldopa. It just made me sleepy and gave me a sore head. When taking Ritalin/ Adderall the epinephrine/ norepinephrine rush isn’t there at all, it’s almost the opposite, it sedates me. I have thought over the years I could have trouble with my adrenals but I know know if this could have caused an issue here? I had not taken modafinil for a month or so before starting the ADD meds. Any ideas, solutions, things I could try? 1 like, 2 replies "

409,C0796085,Nance-Horan syndrome,C0542476,Forgetful,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/a-response-to-an-article-about-dyspraxia-in-adults-711134,A response to an article about Dyspraxia in Adults,"See here: -  I was born in nineteen-forty-eight. I first suspected I may have developmental (rather than acquired) dyspraxia, now usually academically termed developmental coordination disorder in nineteen-ninety-nine and had that confirmed to my satisfaction in two-thousand-and-two when I was fifty-three years old. My assessment was carried out at my expense by a chartered psychologist, and member of The British Psychological Society, who was an experienced clinician with a special interest in occupational and educational  psychology with adults. I hold a Diploma in Social Work awarded in nineteen-seventy-five by the University of Liverpool at the end of a two year full-time academic and practical professional training course which qualified me to work as either a local authority social worker or probation officer for a United Kingdom public authority. I retired as a probation officer in two-thousand-and-three after a full-time career. This is a helpful article because it is by a writer in stable and responsible employment who also discovered the condition once they became a mature adult. Yet in quoting from another person's experience of dyspraxia it is particularly disappointing as again the first symptoms regarding a diagnosis are characteristics observable to an onlooker. I do not minimise the importance of impaired motor skills or motor difficulties that affect a person's ability to carry out everyday activities. However, such “motor” difficulties are certainly not the most pertinent factors that I feel and experience, neither are they what have been reported to me by the many hundreds of adult dyspraxics that I have met and also engaged with via social media over twenty years. It is also very unlikely that a GP, will personally diagnose such a condition. In my case my GP refused to diagnose in two-thousand-and-two notwithstanding a clinical psychologist’s detailed report supported by extensive test results. After repeated requests, I was sent off to see a consultant neurologist who refused to diagnose, telling me I could not have dyspraxia because I found my way unaided to his office – (about twelve miles from home) despite me being fifty years of age and having navigated myself about the whole country for at least thirty years. I could give more details but it will not achieve anything here. The things that affect me most are the difficulties that come about consequent on a poor working memory – for example, constantly forgetting where I have put something down, or discovering where an item of mine is and accusing another person of moving it there without telling me. I do not do this now I understand more about my condition. I recall seeming to be understood by a former GP – when I said – it feels as if my head is full of spaghetti with all the ends swirling around, trying to match up with another spaghetti end but not quite making it. There is simply more going on in my brain at anytime than I can easily process and also I spill my dinner most days. When any practitioner first encounters a person who is having more difficulty managing tasks than seems logical, for a person with their level of intelligence and achievement, I suggest start by getting them to talk about how it feels – for example - to lock your keys in your car yet again and have to call a breakdown service out – something I have done several times, before I compensated by always carrying a spare car key. If practitioners start from how it feels to repeatedly do things that seem ridiculous, and accept what is said, rather than, as most do say something like – everyone does that – which will probably be true – but they will not go into a room a dozen times in a day and forget what they wanted – pick something else up return to whence they came & then try to work out what to do next. That is dyspraxia as far as I am concerned. Inch by inch others seem to be better at realising that, but it is very slow progress as indicated by the article by Ashwin Bhandari. He seems to have relied two heavily on the opinions of a trustee of the Dyspraxia Foundation, when we might have learned more if he had told us of his experiences. I continue to be a member of the Dyspraxia Foundation which I first joined in nineteen-ninety-nine. I was eventually diagnosed by an NHS Psychiatrist, who I obtained a referral to see in an effort to receive an onward referral to an NHS psychologist. I never was able to see an NHS psychologist and have those test scores reviewed  twelve years later, but at least my GP now accepts that I do actually have developmental dyspraxia. No services have ever been offered, and sixteen years on from early retirement, without a clear daily routine I continue to live a life of muddle and frustration, but at least with an occupational pension, I am far better off than many others as they struggle to get permanent work or welfare benefits to enable a minimal existence. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I didn't have any symptoms other than my ear infections. They told me it was benign but I would need surgery. I had surgery and they removed the chlosteatoma and I lost a great percentage of my hearing. The tumor had ate away at my hearing bones, my ear drum, and I believe they said I had one hearing bone left. I lost my hearing after the surgery because they called the Chlosteatoma a ""hearing tumor"".

Over the last 3 years, he's already had the surgery twice before. This will be our third attempt to get rid of this very annoying, very scary problem. Here's  the question...what type of surgery do we go with? Our doctor has proposed the modified radical as an option to consider. He told us its our decision to do the same surgery we've done 2 times before or try this. So, I've been doing research and the result of that is that I'm more scared and more confused than ever. I've read about smells, and never able to get wet, and granulation tissue, and constant drainage...none of which sound good at all. But, how many time can I continue to put my poor son through this surgery only to have it recur? I would love to hear your thoughts, personal experiences, and advice.

The infection was quite advanced at this point, and vital it was detected when it was. I had regular ear infections in my right ear growing up, which thankfully led to a doctor in Wolverhampton, whilst at university, spotting the infection (cholesteatoma) around the bone in the middle ear. The operation was successful, despite my hearing being at 85% in that ear aferwards (not so bad). I now go for regular check ups at the ENT at my local hospital in Bristol, with wax being suctioned out (gross, and SO uncomfortable!), and just general checks for any signs of the infection returning or inflammation. However, since the surgery, I have experienced uncomfortable symptoms. Every day at some point, (usually first thing in the morning), I have to pop my ear to improve my hearing, and then usually not long after, my ear pops back, and the hearing worsens, the sort of sensation of when water gets in your ear and it feels like your underwater.  Its really distracting when it happens, whether at work or watching a film etc, and I then seem to find it hard to get it back to its previous level of hearing, and it often keeps popping and feeling 'blocked' again. I would say this lowers my hearing to about 60% in the ear, maybe less. I have tried revision surgery in 2011, which didn't work. I have a hearing aid, which probably helps my hearing slightly but doesn't stop the popping or changing of pressure. My consultant at the ENT clinic doesn't seem to know what causes it. Has anyone experienced any similar symptoms after a cholesteatoma? My theory is there is some kind of blockage or continuous problem of wax behind the ear drum in the middle ear. But wouldn't this have come up in the revision surgery? Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated as, whilst I know things could be worse, this is causing me a lot of negative feelings and is affecting my quality of life as it happens so regularly.

Every day at some point, (usually first thing in the morning), I have to pop my ear to improve my hearing, and then usually not long after, my ear pops back, and the hearing worsens, the sort of sensation of when water gets in your ear and it feels like your underwater.  Its really distracting when it happens, whether at work or watching a film etc, and I then seem to find it hard to get it back to its previous level of hearing, and it often keeps popping and feeling 'blocked' again. I would say this lowers my hearing to about 60% in the ear, maybe less. I have tried revision surgery in 2011, which didn't work. I have a hearing aid, which probably helps my hearing slightly but doesn't stop the popping or changing of pressure. My consultant at the ENT clinic doesn't seem to know what causes it. Has anyone experienced any similar symptoms after a cholesteatoma? My theory is there is some kind of blockage or continuous problem of wax behind the ear drum in the middle ear. But wouldn't this have come up in the revision surgery? Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated as, whilst I know things could be worse, this is causing me a lot of negative feelings and is affecting my quality of life as it happens so regularly. Thanks, Ron 0 likes, 5 replies "

Unfortunately, I fell and hit my back right over the site of my battery.   I have complained about being able to feel my battery very easily from day one; it actually almost sticks out of my hip area.  Recently, I have started having very centralized pain and burning around the battery.  The rest of my back is fine, but I am having issues with mobility because of the level of pain around the battery. I have reached out to the Medtronics representative and am waiting to see what her response is.  My question is whether anyone else has ever experienced anything like this?  If so, where you able to find relief and how? Thanks for your time in reading this and any feedback you may be able to provide. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Bites from the widow spiders involve a neurotoxic venom which produces a condition known as latrodectism. Symptoms may include: pain which may be at the bite or involve the chest and abdomen, sweating, muscle cramps and vomiting among others. Bites from the recluse spiders cause the condition loxoscelism, in which local necrosis of the surrounding skin and widespread breakdown of red blood cells may occur. Headaches, vomiting and a mild fever may also occur.

I said wow that was a lot faster than I expected and she said yep you said the magic word . I replied what's that ? She said Shingles ! Here put this mask on and come with me . I asked why I needed a mask and she said because it's VERY CONTAGIOUS ! So they decided to admit me and started an IV drip of a wide spectrum of antibiotics and didn't stop for three days . Well in the meantime they were neglecting to give me my pain medication that I normally take , not to mention anything extra for what they diagnosed as Cellulitis the second day that I was there . After three days of asking everyone that came in my room about my pain medication , I finally got one Doctor to agree to give me something for my pain yesterday morning . Well the nurse brought me 15mg of Oxycodone and some tums for my heartburn and was supposed to bring me some oxycottin about an hour later . That would have been around 10:15 AM . At 6:00 PM I still haven't gotten my oxycottin . Now I'm getting mad . I called the nurse via the call button on the remote for everything in the room and asked why I still haven't gotten my medicine and she told me that I had . I replied , no maam I haven't . You brought me the Oxycodone and two Tums but never came back with the Oxycottin . She insisted that she had because she had scanned my armband to prove it so there was no way that she could fourge that ! I replied that the only thing that proves is that you scanned the bracelet , not that I ever received the pill . I said to her , look it's like this.

The next day I was worse, severe pain, temperature and delirious. My gp admitted me to hospital where it was difficult to obtain bloods or insert a cannula due to  veins not being accessible. I was finally treated with iv antibiotics for 4 days in hospital and 3 days outpatients. The pain and swelling in my leg had not improved so on return to gp restarted oral antibiotics.

I have a history. Anyways I'm pleased and relieved. However I have a new issue I feel a lump under skin in the anterior tibia area in right leg. Dr is now sending me for xray and ultrasound. I also had dipper done because lower leg is still very swilled and discoloured esp when down. Havent recd the results of the doppler yet. Anyways what could this lump under the skin be.

I just went for an MRI and was told that I have severe Arthritis in the L3, L4 joints and that it was that that is causing the pain but a few weeks before the MRI they took xrays and found the left lead had moved almost one vertebra  down and I truly believe that that is why I am no longer getting relief and my Doctor keeps saying that it didn't move enough for this to be happening and that the pain is being caused by the Arthritis. I am now going in for Facet injections this Tuesday this and the meds were the things I wanted to stop with the simulator but the doctor feels this will help and I'm sure it will.

Over the past 12 months the pain has been getting worse and managed through naproxen and physio. My physio suggested a fusion because it doesn't take much for me to.go out of alignment.

I work full time but have been struggling to do a full week since last injection in July and now use my leave to work 4 days a week. I spoke with the consultant who said he doesn't think surgery will help my situation at all and would like me to try some more medication. He said there is too much of a space so not impacting nerve too much. He thinks its shrunk back a bit. Last time 2 years ago he said if no improvement would consider shaving the disc. But why so much pain.  I recently came off amatrytline after 3 months of side effects, so was told my doc to come off them and they didn't really help. So next step is to try gabapentin or pregablin. He doesn't want to consider anymore injections either yet. After battling this for 3 years and trying to remain positive I am now really struggling. I have no life outside of work, lost friends, don't go away on holiday etc, plan my entire day from start to finish and usually put on a brave face until I go home. My marriage is suffering as a result, and I am now considering reducing my hours at work. I have adjusted my life and have tried and managed to take pleasure in the simple things, meals out and going for walks when I can. I think the consultant dismissing my pain has knocked me, not that I wanted surgery nobody does! But had come around to the idea. I can't sleep again tonite, got bad spasms and feel constantly worried about my future. At 46 feeling pretty low.

Over  the  last  year I  have  had xrays on my ankle, hip and lumbar  due  to  pain.  after many months it became clear that the pain was referred pain from the spine.  i was given meds that made be drool and I finally dropped them in favor of Marijuna.  PT only inflamed the nerve.  I have taken up pool therapy. I felt during the entire year I was dismissed as being old (65) and overweight (280).  With  reluctance my prime authorized an MRI.  I have 5 bulging discs and bone spurs on 4 levels, l5 formial narrowing with nerve impingement.  it has been a year of pain and even with this diagnosis, I still feel dismissed.  Kaiser has offered an epidural  on l5 if I  want it.  Does this sound like adequate care?   is this the best care I can hope for?  is the state of medicine not evolved enough where conditions such as mine have a treatment that has a long term success rate?  It seems like most treatments such as disc spacers are considered experimental. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I had. Programmer not really wanting to spend the time to get it right, few and far sessions that I finally complained to surgeon and the Company.  Got a new programmer.  He tried hard to find the right program and setting, but to no avail.  So for 8 mos. to the day, I made the decision to have it removed. It was not an easy decision.  It never worked from the getgo.  So on 11/2 of this year I had it totally remivedy.  My surgeon said I did everything asked if me by her and the tech but nothing worked,  As she was preparing to meet me in the OR, she was in total agreement with my decision.  She knew of my problems with the original tech, his lack of compassion, concern and a rush to program me and leave. It is out and now dealing with surgical pain again.  I have no regrets with my decision.  I will pursue, with a new PM doctor different injections that were not tried before.  So if anyone is thinking like me, I say go for it. For those whom it works, I say to you Thank God and I couldn’t be happier for you. My journey with the Stimulator is complete and a new journey to find pain management begins.  I am done with surgeries.  No more.  I think 5 is more than sufficient. Good luck to all who are still on their Stimulator journey. Dee 5 likes, 94 replies "

It only hurts when I arch my back inward, it doesn’t bother me any other time. I just don’t know if this is common or potentially something more serious? this whole time i thought it was lyme symptoms, now im thinking it can possibly be LP symptoms? the only reason i think it can be lyme is because the symptoms come and go, they dont happen all the time but i dont know much abt LP problems. i do have pressure in my ears, slight tinnitus, face tingling all over, tingling all over my body (started before LP) but the pain in my back only happens when i stretch inward, is this a sign of healing after the LP? i was in ROUGH shape for about 2-3 weeks after. i wasnt told how to take care of my back or anything, could these symptoms resolve on their own? obviously i have to rest, eat a healthy diet and keep my body extremely hydrated during lyme treatment so im hoping this will aid with the LP stuff. Alot of lyme symptoms overlap with possible LP ones. 😦 can anyone help? my doctors basically said keep an eye on it, they dont know. 0 likes, 0 replies "

There’s no fluid or anything in the area because I forced my doctor to do an X-ray and ultrasound. I just am not sure what to do? It only hurts when I arch my back inward, it doesn’t bother me any other time. I just don’t know if this is common or potentially something more serious? this whole time i thought it was lyme symptoms, now im thinking it can possibly be LP symptoms? the only reason i think it can be lyme is because the symptoms come and go, they dont happen all the time but i dont know much abt LP problems. i do have pressure in my ears, slight tinnitus, face tingling all over, tingling all over my body (started before LP) but the pain in my back only happens when i stretch inward, is this a sign of healing after the LP? i was in ROUGH shape for about 2-3 weeks after. i wasnt told how to take care of my back or anything, could these symptoms resolve on their own? obviously i have to rest, eat a healthy diet and keep my body extremely hydrated during lyme treatment so im hoping this will aid with the LP stuff. Alot of lyme symptoms overlap with possible LP ones. 😦 can anyone help? my doctors basically said keep an eye on it, they dont know. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I am amazed how little tech support is available on this product   LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS of sales data.... but no FAQS about how this or that works....or what to do if...   Found some unhappy people,  but no tips and tricks to using so thought i would start a topic and ask some questions from others.    I was not aware before surgery how much changing and programing there would be to find the right settings after surgery was over (I thought that was what the trial is for).    So I have a million newby questions that I cant seem to find online answers about.    I'll start with three, and maybe others will have things to share or add re: best practices.   1)  I didnt charge for last few days (bad boy).   I was hurting worse today than usual, and wondered if i had let my battery go dead.   My remote showed 1 blinking battery bar.  Does that mean it was dead?   Or just close to dead?   2)  is there any logic that if it was extra low (but not dead) that is was working not as well as it does when fully charged?  (or is it an all or nothing benefit)    3) before I charged when it was deadly low, it felt like the battery/transmitter box implanted was burning me.   Is it possible that when low and working extra hard to produce power that it can get hot (like maybe a cellphone would?  ) 2 likes, 32 replies "

My girlfriend is called Rosie and she has been dealing with pain in her back for 6 years ever since she lifted a box in college at the age of 18. Rosie visited many doctors early on who were equally as dismissive of her as the next. I believe an x-ray was done by one of these doctors who evaluated it as being nothing wrong, they believed growing pains were the issue.  She was prescribed tablets for pain relief which didnt help much. Other doctors did start to explore what could be causing the pain and looking at family history, they believed it could be AS, so they tested to find that the HLA-B27 genetic marker was present in her blood. This lead to doctors to make the assumption that this was the issue. It took a long time to get to this point already when she was referred to physiotherapy to learn exercises to make her pain more manageable, we tried yoga to help, a lot of heat patches, going on walks to keep the muscles active and prevent stiffness with Naproxen to manage the inflammation. As time goes by, rosie's pain only gets more severe and has some mornings that its so disabling that she cannot get out of bed without crying, cannot make it into University lectures or make it into work, needing assistance from me just to go to the toilet, help that no 20-24 year old should be needing. As the situation gets worse we think it could be more than AS, we visit many doctors in different hospitals hoping for someone to care, to no avail. Doctors dont want to give her x-rays or MRI's so just keep getting referred to pain management or physiotherapy. Eventually we find a doctor who does care, who takes the time to locate and examine the x-ray that rosie had taken 4 years prior, from the very beginning of this issue. This doctor determined that rosie had a slipped disc in her lower back... which couldve been identified 4 years before at the beginning! Instead we spent years doing exercises and activities that in fact were only exacerbating the pain and the damage. This good doctor obviously needed an update from a 4-year old x-ray and so put rosie in for some scans. This brought to light that she now had a slipped disc AND a torn disc. She was offered the Root Nerve block injection, which helped a lot for a few months as she was also now experiencing sciatica in her legs. After the injection wore off, the possibility of another was off the table through the NHS i believe, not considered a free treatment anymore. So Rosie occasionally uses pain medication to deal with her back at the moment but with a lot of the options being either insignificant in the relief they give or make her feel drowsy (which she cant have at work), she has resorted to a herbal method when she gets home. A lot of herbal alternatives for pain relief she cannot have because she is allergic to a lot of plant-based products, but we managed to find one that helps a bit. Rosie deals with her pain remarkably well but as we are in winter now, with temperatures a lot lower it is becoming more common for her to spend almost every morning crying in pain when she has to get up for work and drive into work. It is also now affecting her performance at work as her pain affects her breathing which affects being able to talk on the phone and meet stats requirements for the company she works for. Caught between a rock and hard place, needing money to live but needing time off (which will be unpaid) to look after her health, constantly getting pressure from bosses who are aware of the issue but have very little compassion or consideration for her. She has currently been trying to survive a year in the company to ensure she gets some sick pay when she has to be off work for 3 months for a lumbar discectomy in March 2020. I guess i am writing this on her behalf because just today she has been in tears all morning and is having a very difficult day and I feel helpless to do anything to ease her suffering. Is there any advice that anyone can give us on how to best deal with the pain especially in the colder months? And I really just want to know what options are out there to try and fix this problem completely as we've been told that the discectomy will most likely only help with the sciatica pain and that theres nothing that they can do for her back ( or are willing to do to). How true is what we're being told? Would a private practice specialist be able to repair the damaged vertebrates? Are the NHS not giving other options to fix her back because its too risky for them or cost too much? From countless bad experiences with doctors not believing that a young girl can be in so much back pain, the misdiagnosis which only led to further damage being done, these have led us to having a hard time trusting what we're told and really need to seek the help of multiple other opinions and expertise.

My girlfriend is called Rosie and she has been dealing with pain in her back for 6 years ever since she lifted a box in college at the age of 18. Rosie visited many doctors early on who were equally as dismissive of her as the next. I believe an x-ray was done by one of these doctors who evaluated it as being nothing wrong, they believed growing pains were the issue.  She was prescribed tablets for pain relief which didnt help much. Other doctors did start to explore what could be causing the pain and looking at family history, they believed it could be AS, so they tested to find that the HLA-B27 genetic marker was present in her blood. This lead to doctors to make the assumption that this was the issue. It took a long time to get to this point already when she was referred to physiotherapy to learn exercises to make her pain more manageable, we tried yoga to help, a lot of heat patches, going on walks to keep the muscles active and prevent stiffness with Naproxen to manage the inflammation. As time goes by, rosie's pain only gets more severe and has some mornings that its so disabling that she cannot get out of bed without crying, cannot make it into University lectures or make it into work, needing assistance from me just to go to the toilet, help that no 20-24 year old should be needing. As the situation gets worse we think it could be more than AS, we visit many doctors in different hospitals hoping for someone to care, to no avail. Doctors dont want to give her x-rays or MRI's so just keep getting referred to pain management or physiotherapy. Eventually we find a doctor who does care, who takes the time to locate and examine the x-ray that rosie had taken 4 years prior, from the very beginning of this issue. This doctor determined that rosie had a slipped disc in her lower back... which couldve been identified 4 years before at the beginning! Instead we spent years doing exercises and activities that in fact were only exacerbating the pain and the damage. This good doctor obviously needed an update from a 4-year old x-ray and so put rosie in for some scans. This brought to light that she now had a slipped disc AND a torn disc. She was offered the Root Nerve block injection, which helped a lot for a few months as she was also now experiencing sciatica in her legs. After the injection wore off, the possibility of another was off the table through the NHS i believe, not considered a free treatment anymore. So Rosie occasionally uses pain medication to deal with her back at the moment but with a lot of the options being either insignificant in the relief they give or make her feel drowsy (which she cant have at work), she has resorted to a herbal method when she gets home.

I had an   November 2015 which showed problems at L5/S1 which causes moderate stenosis compressing the L5 nerve root. Feb/2016 had a nerve block injection, this had no effect. Pain management tried Pregabalin and Gabapentin, both did not help. Pain was so bad now that I could only walk comfortably for 10mins, therefore walking group came to a stop. Had a private consultation with a spinal consultant who made his own diagnosis of the MRI scan, which was that degenerative scoliosis was producing narrowing @ L4/5 and L5/S1 plus grade 1 spondyolisthesis @ L4/5 level. He suggested a lateral recess decompression surgery which I had December 2017. Result being that the surgery  made no difference and the specialist said that I would have to learn to live with it! Have tried living with it but GP sent me for a further MRI scan June 2019, followed by another nerve block injection, which also has had no effect. GP now also says that I will have to live with it.

I'm 2 weeks post op. It took me 3 years to get the diagnosis from an amazing Plastic Surgeon in Salisbury Hospital. UK.  After 2 years of physio, scans, xrays and appointments with pretty much every specialist in Dorset I finally was told I could have the op. I was advised that recovery was hard and painful but I would feel immediate relieve from the original symptoms.   Well,  I certainly don't have the original symptoms anymore but they have been replaced with a whole new batch of issues and pain.  My op took 4.5hrs. They shaved my first rib, and said that it was alot worse than expected. The nerves were attached to my muscles and had to be physically torn from them! !  but I was then in the recovery room for over 8hrs due to having a very high heart rate 180 for 8hrs !!! After 50ml of morphine,  fluid and god knows what other drugs,  I was taken to the ward.  I spent 6 days in hospital.  The first day after the op I became short of breath with pain, after an xray it was discovered that the op had temporarly paralysed my diaphragm nerve which meant I couldn't take a deep breath in.  This is easing now (2 weeks after). I am home now but the pain in my shoulder and my back is so bad. I have one spot on my shoulder/back where it feels like someone is pushing a hot knife into me.  The muscles spasms all the time and I can't lift my arm at all, not even enough to shave my armpit! ! The worst thing is having a numb hand/finger tips.  I'm just starting to hold things, having learnt how to with a numb hand!   Can anyone tell me how long this pain and numbness will go on for? . This is bringing me down so bad.

If I sleep sitting up it's not as bad, I can't grab a hairbrush or a coffee cup without making it worse. This was supposed to improve my life not make it horrible.

Nueral Compression). My case was fairly urgent as the blood flow was limited to roughly 10% thru my subclavian vein. I was very lucky as I did not experience any typical symptoms such as a swollen arm due to clotting. I originally went to the doctors because I had a pain in my lower abdomin, which I thought was   coming on. I tested positive for D-Dimer (results around 2.0+), therefore my doctor immediately sent to get a CT Scan to rule out a blood clot. I did not have a blood clot, but this is when they did discover the unusually narrow vein. The doctor advised I see a Thoracic specialist.  The surgery went well. I was in the hospital for 2 nights. Recovery took about 4-6 weeks before I could go back to work full-time. I underwent PT for about 2 months, starting 1 month after surgery.  However, since October I have experienced a number of side effects including: 1. Horner's Syndrome. My right pupil (side of surgery) is still noticably constricted.  2. Numb arm due to damage of the long thoracic nerve, a constant roller coaster of sharp, acute pain and soreness near my right breast bone (I had my right first rib taken out). I want to understand if the pains I am feeling 6 months later are a normal part of nerve regeneration and if anyone has a similar experience, how long they last? The pain seems to come on and off all day. Some pains (acute/shooting) mainly in the mid-section of my right arm. The under side of my arm is still numb to touch. 3. Another pain I experience is near my second rib, where it attachs to the breastbone. A lower position then where my first rib was taken out, so I find this strange, the irriation would be lasting this long. 4. About 2 months ago, I started getting sharp pains in my upper lung (is the best way to describe it). When I drink cold water or other beverages it sends a sharp pain to the area. It is very strange. 5. Stuffy nose at night. Since surgery I can not breathe through my nose fully. It feels stuffy and not clear.  I have been to a few typical follow up appointments but my surgeon has not been able to identify a detailed reason for these pains besides a side effect of surgery. I understand my body underwent an intrusive surgery and needs time to heal, but I often get worried now something else is wrong, since the pains come on so suddenly and sharp, six months later.  We do not know the reason for the development of the VTOS. One of my surgeons suggested it happened when I was young, as the network of blood vessels around the vein were enlarged and carried much of the blood not flowing through my subclavian vein. The main surgeon thinks it may have happened within in the last 5 years. Typically trauma or excessive overhead movement causes VTOS, however neither of these applied to my case.  0 likes, 85 replies "

I had this with my last period - light bleeding a week before period but i just thought i got my dates wrong (i have a 4 week-5 week - 4 week cycle). i have cramps but this is so unusual for me as it has always been to the clock.

I have also had weird symptoms the last year that has been dismissed by drs, but totally out of norm for me . my periods stopped being like clockwork and would come every 3-4 months. one time was very painful, i started bleeding a lot of watery blood, almost passed out. in the ER, they did an ultrasound that showed a hemorrhaging cervical cyst . bleeding stopped later that day. i have had very high estrogen levels, extreme bloating (sometimes i look pregnant), constipation, abdominal pain and pressure. had a colonoscopy and it was fine. i have also been extremely tired, taking  a nap almost every day - I have never taken day time naps unless ill. so, my concern is that these abnormal results are related to my other issues but if it's not HPV, what could cause this? anyone have recurrent abnormal cervical results without HPV? thanks h 0 likes, 0 replies "

I have been on a rapid learning curve since and am still seeking answers from the medical profession and fellow sufferers. My story (should you have the patience) goes like this - One year ago I had micro surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome on my right hand under local anaesthetic. It was a miracle cure, with immediate pain relief after surgery pain receded. I still have carpal tunnel on the left hand, but nothing like the pain in my right arm and shoulder that brought me to tears and sleepless nights. So I chose to leave ithe left one be. In November I had a stomach upset, bad enough to go to my GP who adminstered a cocktail of injections to alleviate nausea, sickness, diahorrea and 4 days worth of dehydration. A few minutes afterwards, my mouth was tingling, I felt sick and faint and could not breath. My pulse went from normal 50bpm to 132, oxygen to 72 and bp to 50/30. My veins collapsed, but the GP managed to get me on oxygen, injected cortizone and adrenalin and the IV for fluids was finally insterted in the ambulance en route to the hospital.  I spent the next 4 days in ICU, where I stabilised in the first day. Allergic reaction to the drugs was considered but rejected, as the same drugs were given by IV in hospital. My collapse was diagnosed as hypovolemic shock. Alll organs were checked for damage arising from the oxygen deprivation. Everything was clear but I remained dizzy, unbalanced with moderate headache, so was examined by an orthapaedic specialist who arranged a CT scan of my neck and head. The CT scan revealed spondyloarthritis of the cervical region, discopathie of C5-C6 and C6-7. An MRI followed which revealed C4-C5 disc protrusion and degenrative lesions of joints of Luschka, C5-C6 loss of disc space, herniated disc, bone spurs, C6-C7 same as 5-6, spinal canal compressed to 7.6mm and a hemangioma in vertebral body of C6.  I was referred to a neurosurgeon who had a more detailed MRI done and did physical checks which demonstrated early myeolopathy. It seems this explained my balance and fine motor skill issues and even my carpal tunnel. The surgeon strongly recommended surgery as soon as possible as, whilst delicate and lengthy it was at this stage possible and safe. The alternative would be major adaptations to my very active lifestyle or risk major damage from a minor fall or sudden twist of the neck. Surgery would no longer be an option and I could be paralysed. I researched this and although surprised that other than the carpal tunnel I had no pain, I did indeed suffer from many of the signs of myeolopathy which I had been putting down to growing older (now 56) and general wear and tear of an active body. So surgery was scheduled for early December.  ​ Given the collapse, several checks were made beforehand to ensure I was fit for surgery; ecg, pulmonary function, ecg & ultrasound and discussion with anaesthesiologist. As I have a slight allergy to cats and sometimes use a ventolin inhaler, I was put on a cortisone inhaler and was to be given a nebuliser along with the pre med. The anesthetic team would monitor me after GA was adminstered to ensure I was stable before surgery commenced. I would be kept under GA for 24 hours to allow my windpipe to recover from swelling to ensure I resumed breathing easliy.  I was brought round c24 hours after entering theatre to find myself in the coma ward with all the consultants around me. It seems that depsite all the precautions and 30 mins monitoring after GA, the surgeon was about to make the incision when I went into bronchiospasm. I am told my blood pressure dropped to dangerously low but my heart kept trying. I suffered a minor cardio infraction, my lungs filled and oxygen fell to near zero. I am not yet sure how they saved me from this situation, but thankfully I am here to tell the tale. Needless to say, surgery was aborted and I spent the 24 hours on a ventilator until they brought me round. The next 4 days in ICU were a slow, hard and shocking recovery both physically and emotionally. Lungs and heart were constantly monitored. I had 2 quite different skin reactions that were attended to by pulmonarist checking for DVT and dermatologist treating and trying to ascertain cause. One reaction was tears on my inner forearm that had white crusty edges. The one on my inner calf started with bruising and developed into large blisters after 3 days. The consensus was massive allergic reaction, most likely linked to the first collapse. I was sent home to recover over the holiday season. By force majeur I am no longer leading an active life, but to minimise risk to my spinal cord I still have to wear a protective collar when out, am not to drive, nor exercise (I usually jog) and must take care while walking or on stairs. Despite the trauma and in the case of the heart some minor irreparable damage, my pulmonary function test and stress ecg showed a return to pre theatre levels - even better in the case of the lungs. Steroid meds stopped and allergy tests were run last week. It seems that two of the drugs given at the first collapse were not in fact given again in the first hospital. One of these drugs was also in the GA mix, so it was a primary suspect as an allergen trigger. Allergy testing was conducted last week. Such is the concern of the consulting team that even the subcutaneous skin tests were run in ICU, linked up to IV and all monitors. However, even an undiluted sample of the suspected trigger did not give a clear, positive result. A Rheumatologust was called in to discuss the possibility of an auto immune disease, butblood tests for these have returned negative. Biopsies were taken in each of the areas of skin damage. By now my arm had healed although scarred. The blisters on my calf burst after the three weeks and now, 6 weeks later are black, dented areas surrounded by red, taught skin. The dermatologist advises this is necrosis and it is to be removed this week to give the good underlying skin a chance to heal. Next steps are to review the biopsy results and then have a team meeting of all concerned to review findings and ongoing risk of any future medical intervention. Whatever the trigger or cause, it is certainly life threatening and at this time, the best I can hope for is that there is a way of managing the risk. So in the coming weeks I have to decide if the neck surgery is worth that risk. I find myself much less informed about what living with this neck condition is like. What degenration can I expect, over what timescale? I have relatively no pain, does that mean it is yet to come, the carpal tunnel was indeed related or a coincidence? I drop things, bump into things, feel disconnected a lot - are these related and will get worse? WIll they get better if I have the op? What other treatments are out there? Is my surgeon's advice to have this surgery now while it is simple and safe still valid, given my as yet undiagnosed allergic condition? I see many people here living with this neck condition in varying degrees. I would appreciate any personal views and links to information that are considered useful. This would help build my understanding and coming to a decision. I live out of the UK and cannot fault the medical care and repsonse I have had so far, but the team are researching further afield and the need for a second opinion may be the immediate conclusion. Any ideas on where to seek this and with whom would also be appreciated - either for the collapses or the neck problem. Many thanks and good health! 5 likes, 63 replies "

I have been on a rapid learning curve since and am still seeking answers from the medical profession and fellow sufferers. My story (should you have the patience) goes like this - One year ago I had micro surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome on my right hand under local anaesthetic. It was a miracle cure, with immediate pain relief after surgery pain receded. I still have carpal tunnel on the left hand, but nothing like the pain in my right arm and shoulder that brought me to tears and sleepless nights. So I chose to leave ithe left one be. In November I had a stomach upset, bad enough to go to my GP who adminstered a cocktail of injections to alleviate nausea, sickness, diahorrea and 4 days worth of dehydration. A few minutes afterwards, my mouth was tingling, I felt sick and faint and could not breath. My pulse went from normal 50bpm to 132, oxygen to 72 and bp to 50/30. My veins collapsed, but the GP managed to get me on oxygen, injected cortizone and adrenalin and the IV for fluids was finally insterted in the ambulance en route to the hospital.  I spent the next 4 days in ICU, where I stabilised in the first day. Allergic reaction to the drugs was considered but rejected, as the same drugs were given by IV in hospital. My collapse was diagnosed as hypovolemic shock. Alll organs were checked for damage arising from the oxygen deprivation. Everything was clear but I remained dizzy, unbalanced with moderate headache, so was examined by an orthapaedic specialist who arranged a CT scan of my neck and head. The CT scan revealed spondyloarthritis of the cervical region, discopathie of C5-C6 and C6-7. An MRI followed which revealed C4-C5 disc protrusion and degenrative lesions of joints of Luschka, C5-C6 loss of disc space, herniated disc, bone spurs, C6-C7 same as 5-6, spinal canal compressed to 7.6mm and a hemangioma in vertebral body of C6.  I was referred to a neurosurgeon who had a more detailed MRI done and did physical checks which demonstrated early myeolopathy. It seems this explained my balance and fine motor skill issues and even my carpal tunnel. The surgeon strongly recommended surgery as soon as possible as, whilst delicate and lengthy it was at this stage possible and safe. The alternative would be major adaptations to my very active lifestyle or risk major damage from a minor fall or sudden twist of the neck. Surgery would no longer be an option and I could be paralysed. I researched this and although surprised that other than the carpal tunnel I had no pain, I did indeed suffer from many of the signs of myeolopathy which I had been putting down to growing older (now 56) and general wear and tear of an active body. So surgery was scheduled for early December.  ​ Given the collapse, several checks were made beforehand to ensure I was fit for surgery; ecg, pulmonary function, ecg & ultrasound and discussion with anaesthesiologist. As I have a slight allergy to cats and sometimes use a ventolin inhaler, I was put on a cortisone inhaler and was to be given a nebuliser along with the pre med.

Steroid meds stopped and allergy tests were run last week. It seems that two of the drugs given at the first collapse were not in fact given again in the first hospital. One of these drugs was also in the GA mix, so it was a primary suspect as an allergen trigger. Allergy testing was conducted last week. Such is the concern of the consulting team that even the subcutaneous skin tests were run in ICU, linked up to IV and all monitors. However, even an undiluted sample of the suspected trigger did not give a clear, positive result. A Rheumatologust was called in to discuss the possibility of an auto immune disease, butblood tests for these have returned negative. Biopsies were taken in each of the areas of skin damage. By now my arm had healed although scarred. The blisters on my calf burst after the three weeks and now, 6 weeks later are black, dented areas surrounded by red, taught skin. The dermatologist advises this is necrosis and it is to be removed this week to give the good underlying skin a chance to heal. Next steps are to review the biopsy results and then have a team meeting of all concerned to review findings and ongoing risk of any future medical intervention. Whatever the trigger or cause, it is certainly life threatening and at this time, the best I can hope for is that there is a way of managing the risk. So in the coming weeks I have to decide if the neck surgery is worth that risk. I find myself much less informed about what living with this neck condition is like. What degenration can I expect, over what timescale? I have relatively no pain, does that mean it is yet to come, the carpal tunnel was indeed related or a coincidence? I drop things, bump into things, feel disconnected a lot - are these related and will get worse? WIll they get better if I have the op? What other treatments are out there? Is my surgeon's advice to have this surgery now while it is simple and safe still valid, given my as yet undiagnosed allergic condition? I see many people here living with this neck condition in varying degrees. I would appreciate any personal views and links to information that are considered useful. This would help build my understanding and coming to a decision. I live out of the UK and cannot fault the medical care and repsonse I have had so far, but the team are researching further afield and the need for a second opinion may be the immediate conclusion. Any ideas on where to seek this and with whom would also be appreciated - either for the collapses or the neck problem. Many thanks and good health! 5 likes, 63 replies "

I have been on a rapid learning curve since and am still seeking answers from the medical profession and fellow sufferers. My story (should you have the patience) goes like this - One year ago I had micro surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome on my right hand under local anaesthetic. It was a miracle cure, with immediate pain relief after surgery pain receded. I still have carpal tunnel on the left hand, but nothing like the pain in my right arm and shoulder that brought me to tears and sleepless nights. So I chose to leave ithe left one be. In November I had a stomach upset, bad enough to go to my GP who adminstered a cocktail of injections to alleviate nausea, sickness, diahorrea and 4 days worth of dehydration. A few minutes afterwards, my mouth was tingling, I felt sick and faint and could not breath. My pulse went from normal 50bpm to 132, oxygen to 72 and bp to 50/30. My veins collapsed, but the GP managed to get me on oxygen, injected cortizone and adrenalin and the IV for fluids was finally insterted in the ambulance en route to the hospital.  I spent the next 4 days in ICU, where I stabilised in the first day. Allergic reaction to the drugs was considered but rejected, as the same drugs were given by IV in hospital. My collapse was diagnosed as hypovolemic shock. Alll organs were checked for damage arising from the oxygen deprivation. Everything was clear but I remained dizzy, unbalanced with moderate headache, so was examined by an orthapaedic specialist who arranged a CT scan of my neck and head. The CT scan revealed spondyloarthritis of the cervical region, discopathie of C5-C6 and C6-7. An MRI followed which revealed C4-C5 disc protrusion and degenrative lesions of joints of Luschka, C5-C6 loss of disc space, herniated disc, bone spurs, C6-C7 same as 5-6, spinal canal compressed to 7.6mm and a hemangioma in vertebral body of C6.  I was referred to a neurosurgeon who had a more detailed MRI done and did physical checks which demonstrated early myeolopathy. It seems this explained my balance and fine motor skill issues and even my carpal tunnel. The surgeon strongly recommended surgery as soon as possible as, whilst delicate and lengthy it was at this stage possible and safe. The alternative would be major adaptations to my very active lifestyle or risk major damage from a minor fall or sudden twist of the neck. Surgery would no longer be an option and I could be paralysed. I researched this and although surprised that other than the carpal tunnel I had no pain, I did indeed suffer from many of the signs of myeolopathy which I had been putting down to growing older (now 56) and general wear and tear of an active body. So surgery was scheduled for early December.  ​ Given the collapse, several checks were made beforehand to ensure I was fit for surgery; ecg, pulmonary function, ecg & ultrasound and discussion with anaesthesiologist. As I have a slight allergy to cats and sometimes use a ventolin inhaler, I was put on a cortisone inhaler and was to be given a nebuliser along with the pre med. The anesthetic team would monitor me after GA was adminstered to ensure I was stable before surgery commenced. I would be kept under GA for 24 hours to allow my windpipe to recover from swelling to ensure I resumed breathing easliy.  I was brought round c24 hours after entering theatre to find myself in the coma ward with all the consultants around me. It seems that depsite all the precautions and 30 mins monitoring after GA, the surgeon was about to make the incision when I went into bronchiospasm. I am told my blood pressure dropped to dangerously low but my heart kept trying. I suffered a minor cardio infraction, my lungs filled and oxygen fell to near zero. I am not yet sure how they saved me from this situation, but thankfully I am here to tell the tale. Needless to say, surgery was aborted and I spent the 24 hours on a ventilator until they brought me round. The next 4 days in ICU were a slow, hard and shocking recovery both physically and emotionally. Lungs and heart were constantly monitored. I had 2 quite different skin reactions that were attended to by pulmonarist checking for DVT and dermatologist treating and trying to ascertain cause. One reaction was tears on my inner forearm that had white crusty edges. The one on my inner calf started with bruising and developed into large blisters after 3 days. The consensus was massive allergic reaction, most likely linked to the first collapse. I was sent home to recover over the holiday season.

I find myself much less informed about what living with this neck condition is like. What degenration can I expect, over what timescale? I have relatively no pain, does that mean it is yet to come, the carpal tunnel was indeed related or a coincidence? I drop things, bump into things, feel disconnected a lot - are these related and will get worse? WIll they get better if I have the op? What other treatments are out there? Is my surgeon's advice to have this surgery now while it is simple and safe still valid, given my as yet undiagnosed allergic condition? I see many people here living with this neck condition in varying degrees. I would appreciate any personal views and links to information that are considered useful. This would help build my understanding and coming to a decision. I live out of the UK and cannot fault the medical care and repsonse I have had so far, but the team are researching further afield and the need for a second opinion may be the immediate conclusion.

I have been on a rapid learning curve since and am still seeking answers from the medical profession and fellow sufferers. My story (should you have the patience) goes like this - One year ago I had micro surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome on my right hand under local anaesthetic. It was a miracle cure, with immediate pain relief after surgery pain receded. I still have carpal tunnel on the left hand, but nothing like the pain in my right arm and shoulder that brought me to tears and sleepless nights. So I chose to leave ithe left one be. In November I had a stomach upset, bad enough to go to my GP who adminstered a cocktail of injections to alleviate nausea, sickness, diahorrea and 4 days worth of dehydration. A few minutes afterwards, my mouth was tingling, I felt sick and faint and could not breath. My pulse went from normal 50bpm to 132, oxygen to 72 and bp to 50/30. My veins collapsed, but the GP managed to get me on oxygen, injected cortizone and adrenalin and the IV for fluids was finally insterted in the ambulance en route to the hospital.  I spent the next 4 days in ICU, where I stabilised in the first day. Allergic reaction to the drugs was considered but rejected, as the same drugs were given by IV in hospital. My collapse was diagnosed as hypovolemic shock. Alll organs were checked for damage arising from the oxygen deprivation. Everything was clear but I remained dizzy, unbalanced with moderate headache, so was examined by an orthapaedic specialist who arranged a CT scan of my neck and head. The CT scan revealed spondyloarthritis of the cervical region, discopathie of C5-C6 and C6-7. An MRI followed which revealed C4-C5 disc protrusion and degenrative lesions of joints of Luschka, C5-C6 loss of disc space, herniated disc, bone spurs, C6-C7 same as 5-6, spinal canal compressed to 7.6mm and a hemangioma in vertebral body of C6.  I was referred to a neurosurgeon who had a more detailed MRI done and did physical checks which demonstrated early myeolopathy. It seems this explained my balance and fine motor skill issues and even my carpal tunnel. The surgeon strongly recommended surgery as soon as possible as, whilst delicate and lengthy it was at this stage possible and safe. The alternative would be major adaptations to my very active lifestyle or risk major damage from a minor fall or sudden twist of the neck. Surgery would no longer be an option and I could be paralysed. I researched this and although surprised that other than the carpal tunnel I had no pain, I did indeed suffer from many of the signs of myeolopathy which I had been putting down to growing older (now 56) and general wear and tear of an active body. So surgery was scheduled for early December.  ​ Given the collapse, several checks were made beforehand to ensure I was fit for surgery; ecg, pulmonary function, ecg & ultrasound and discussion with anaesthesiologist. As I have a slight allergy to cats and sometimes use a ventolin inhaler, I was put on a cortisone inhaler and was to be given a nebuliser along with the pre med. The anesthetic team would monitor me after GA was adminstered to ensure I was stable before surgery commenced. I would be kept under GA for 24 hours to allow my windpipe to recover from swelling to ensure I resumed breathing easliy.  I was brought round c24 hours after entering theatre to find myself in the coma ward with all the consultants around me. It seems that depsite all the precautions and 30 mins monitoring after GA, the surgeon was about to make the incision when I went into bronchiospasm. I am told my blood pressure dropped to dangerously low but my heart kept trying. I suffered a minor cardio infraction, my lungs filled and oxygen fell to near zero. I am not yet sure how they saved me from this situation, but thankfully I am here to tell the tale. Needless to say, surgery was aborted and I spent the 24 hours on a ventilator until they brought me round. The next 4 days in ICU were a slow, hard and shocking recovery both physically and emotionally. Lungs and heart were constantly monitored. I had 2 quite different skin reactions that were attended to by pulmonarist checking for DVT and dermatologist treating and trying to ascertain cause. One reaction was tears on my inner forearm that had white crusty edges. The one on my inner calf started with bruising and developed into large blisters after 3 days. The consensus was massive allergic reaction, most likely linked to the first collapse. I was sent home to recover over the holiday season. By force majeur I am no longer leading an active life, but to minimise risk to my spinal cord I still have to wear a protective collar when out, am not to drive, nor exercise (I usually jog) and must take care while walking or on stairs. Despite the trauma and in the case of the heart some minor irreparable damage, my pulmonary function test and stress ecg showed a return to pre theatre levels - even better in the case of the lungs. Steroid meds stopped and allergy tests were run last week. It seems that two of the drugs given at the first collapse were not in fact given again in the first hospital. One of these drugs was also in the GA mix, so it was a primary suspect as an allergen trigger. Allergy testing was conducted last week. Such is the concern of the consulting team that even the subcutaneous skin tests were run in ICU, linked up to IV and all monitors. However, even an undiluted sample of the suspected trigger did not give a clear, positive result. A Rheumatologust was called in to discuss the possibility of an auto immune disease, butblood tests for these have returned negative. Biopsies were taken in each of the areas of skin damage. By now my arm had healed although scarred. The blisters on my calf burst after the three weeks and now, 6 weeks later are black, dented areas surrounded by red, taught skin. The dermatologist advises this is necrosis and it is to be removed this week to give the good underlying skin a chance to heal. Next steps are to review the biopsy results and then have a team meeting of all concerned to review findings and ongoing risk of any future medical intervention.

I decided  to pay to see a consultant who looked at the results of my M R I scan and he diagnosed arthritis and pinched nerves. He then arranged for me to have facet injections. When I arrived at the hospital  I was asked if I wanted to pay before or after the treatment I hadn't been given any information about how much it would cost and was shocked when I was told that it was fifteen hundred pounds. I was taken through into the treatment room where the radiologist ignored me he then came in to see me and told me that he was going  to do six injections and it would be painful . I was told to lie on my back and put into a CT scanner. I was concerned that he did the injections from the front of my neck it was very painful  After the treatment I saw a lot of blood on paper towels. He was very dismissive of me before and after treatment. I had to wait three months to receive a report   The treatment had no effects whatsoever on my neck pain in fact I am also now suffering with throat pain  Sorry to ramble on but I am so upset and feel let down. 0 likes, 12 replies "

I did have the option of having the 2 discs removed and replaced with artificial ones but i declined when he described the operation for example going in through the front of the neck having to move your voice box slightly which could cause a slight change in voice I thought I might come out sounding like Joe pasqualy lol. anyway joking apart just wondered if anyone has had this operation and how successful was it. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I've been to several different specialists, and all have refused for different reasons. ""You're too young"", "" you haven't tried literally everything yet"" ""your nerves aren't messed up enough"", etc. In summary, I've basically been told my doctors, ""you're screwed, sorry, but here are some referrals for possible temporary fixes that'll cost you even more money"".

I can't work to the best of my ability anymore, and am having to cut down a lot of my physical responsibilities at work.

On and off I notice severe   after dialysis and sometimes during my rest days. They go on for ranging from 1 minute to the last one was 30 minutes. No other symptoms except general distress fast pulse of almost 130 and sometimes high BP of 150/90. No sweating, breathlessness or pain. Some episodes are small like a second and stop on their own. Somtimes as soon as I start walking after dialysis ends, heart rate starts rising to 100-110. Some times after completion of diaysis, I have to almost sit for an hour before I can walk at a normal pace without a rapidly rising hear rate. My sodium, potassium and phosphorus are all in the range of 4.0 and HB is 11.5. CKD stage 5 with Diabetes and Hypertension. Hypertension is well controlled with calcium channel blockers and beta blockers and statins for cholesterol. No history of heart disease but only uncontrolled Diabetes and Hypertension lead to CKD over time. Weight was 250 lbs last year now I am 155 lbs lost it all due to dieting and conscious eating.

I'm a 52yr old female & i'm terrified i may have something wrong with my kidneys. Only this morning i went to the toilet as usual & noticed that there was no colour in my urine. It was literally the color of water. Through the course of the day i observed the colour everytime i urinated & only twice did it have abit of normal yellow to it. I live in australia & i rang a nurse & she did an assessment & said that it didn't sound like kidney disease although admitting that she couldn't give me a definitive answer (obviously). I don't have any other symptoms such as swelling in ankles or under the eyes, itchy skin & so on but i'm concerned about the lack of colour as iv'e never had this before. I am making an appointment with my local doctor if things don't improve. Any advice of anyone having anything similar & what was the outcome. 0 likes, 9 replies "

He is fit and well with no visible symptoms and this has come completely out of the blue from a medical he had to join the Police. They found microscopic traces of blood in his urine and quite high levels of protein. His BP is slightly raised so he’s been put on  . He feels his life is over and we are all so scared. The insensitive specialist even asked him if he realised how serious this is.  He had secured his dream job with the Police and now he’s been told he will never be allowed to join the Force and is facing certain dialysis and transplant. We just don’t know where to turn for advice and support.  0 likes, 16 replies "

I have also had an ultrasound and a CT scan, both of which found nothing.

I have a constant pain which is usually a dull ache that I have gotten used to but from time to time I have very bad episodes of pain during which  I can do nothing except lie down and cry. When I was 9 I was found to have a slightly smaller right kidney with some scarring near the top half and ever since I've had yearly check ups which include urinalysis and blood pressure monitoring, which have always been fine and normal. Since this pain began in April I have had 5 urine tests and 3 blood tests, all of which have come back fine bar a small amount of blood in one urine test and some protein in another. I have also had an ultrasound and a CT scan, both of which found nothing. I've had theory diagnoses, at first it was kidney infection, then stones, then a burst kidney, and most recently vesico-ureteral reflux. My blood pressure monitoring over a week came back with an average of 128/85 which I have been told is all fine. Creatinine levels were 69 and again I was told this is okay. My doctors cannot find any cause of the pain and I have now been told that urology will not want to see me as the CT scan came back with nothing. I'm at a loss, I've sat all my final exams with this excruciating pain and now that exams are over this nightmare has not ended. All I have now is a follow up appointment with a nephrology specialist in September, which is over 2 months away, and from what I have been told is that I will be signed off then because all tests are normal. If anyone has any idea, please help me because this pain is reducing my quality of life. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I'm new here. I am a 21 year old girl needing some help. So ever since last spring ive been having this mysterious pain in my upper left flank area. Its kind of below my armpit towards my back. The pain comes and goes in short stabby bursts. Sometimes it hurts really bad but never goes on for more than half an hour at a time. I'm starting to get really worried because it's been so long and I am still getting this pain in the exact same spot. When I tried to look online everyone who also has left flank pain says its in their lower region while mine is towards the top. I just dont have any idea what it could be. Im scared it might be some kind of aneurysm. Does anyone have any clue what this pain could be and what I should do? Thank you very much!! 0 likes, 0 replies "

The pain is most strong on the back of my left side but i can also feel it from the front. I went to the doctors with this pain where i done blood and urine tests and got put on antibiotics for a suspected kidney infection, as well as codeine to ease the pain.

I am still in a lot of pain, both when moving and sitting (it never eases), and it is effecting my every day life.

I am constantly feeling down and tired, and often get spells of dizziness and my eyes blacking out when i stand up (i am unsure if the tiredness and dizziness is related or not).

I wondered if i was about to go down with an attack of cystitis . (I am retired female). I thought  I would go to GP after holiday. On 1st day of holiday I was shopping with husband, it was very hot and i was struggling to keep up with him. Suddenly i had a sharp pain in my left side just below my waist at the front, like a bad stitch. it lasted 3-4 minutes.  A few minutes later i felt a trickling sensation between my legs. when we got home i saw i was sort  of seeping  cola coloured fluid. ( I am not incontinent.)  I am long past child bearing age and was alarmed thinking it was coming from my vagina,  but then realised it was more like  coloured water and not a discharge. it was from my bladder. It went on till later that evening then stopped. If started again the next morning and got more blood stained during the day. I called 111 who sent an ambulance and they checked me out and said I seemed fine. They did observe tenderness over left kidney.  They did not take me into hospital. I did get checked out at hospital when I got home. Blood tests all clear, urine test showed signs of mild UTI, CT scan all clear.  They thought i might have passed   a kidney stone. From the point i had stitch, my backache, fatigue all went away. But am worried about the fluid released - could it have been backed up behind a stone? i was not having any trouble urinating. I am told i have  no stones now, no infections now but i still get a small amount of pinkish fluid released each day although i am not incontinent. Could I have been left with a bruised kidney ? Has anyone here had anything similar? 0 likes, 2 replies "

I have been diagnosed a year ago with a 5mm stone in the bottom part of my kidney. It's not causing any pain. I have had a ESWL treatment and it brought the stone down to 3mm. My health anxiety has sky rocketed so I do not know what to do anymore and really need this stone out of my system. I have now the choice between a ureteroscopy or another shock wave treatment. I am sure that the stone is that small that ureteroscopy should just require a basket maybe and then itll be out ... Although ... they are talking about putting a stent in and I am absolutely terrified by all the horror stories and side effects from what I have heard regarding the ureter stent ... The urologist wasn't gonna do anything regardless but I have asked him nicely to get rid of it for peace of mind and he accepted. Can someone please tell me what to do !

I was told they partially shattered it but would need to go back again. i went back three weeks ago for second session but they said they couldn't do procedure as i was symptomatic of passing some of the broken part of stone which may be lodged. Same day CT Scan didnt show any particles and i still feel awful. mostly nausea and anxiety feeling, urgency to wee, pressure at end of weeing and flank pain. Doc saying nausea not connected as stone not that big or in ureter.  Wants me to go for scope into stomach even though i have no bloating or weight loss or any other symptoms. He's really worried me more now which really doesnt help the nausea! Sometimes the nausea subsides and i feel perfect except for the level 3 flank pain which is not the worst. Anyone else have the nausea so bad while no evidence of passing stone? 0 likes, 6 replies "

A couple of my co workers thought it was more likely kidney stones. Within the hour I was doubled over in pain and could barely walk. I had my son give me a ride home and run over to where my husband was working and get him for me. By the time he got to me 5 minutes later i would have had him call an ambulance if i could have formed words but all i could do was scream. I was in the bathtub -half dressed because I  thought heat would help, and  I didnt  want to waste more time with taking off  the rest of my clothes.  My husband is also thinking kidney stones at this point because he'd had them before. He managed to get me out of the tub and in a towel ,and then almost like magic, the pain subsided. At that point I also started thinking it had to be a kidney stone since ive heard how painful they are and that the pain comes in waves. Mine hadnt completely subsided but it went away enough that i knew i should be getting my butt to the hospital before it came back. But i laid down and slept HARD from exhaustion. When i woke up it had started to come back so my husband took me to the ER. Pain meds, labs, and a cat scan later I learned that it wasnt kidney stones- but something obstruction and i needed to see a urologist straight away after the holiday weekend. They said theyd give me some antibiotics and enough pain meds to make it til then -or they could admit me and i could have my pain managed there.  Regardless, what i had would not resolve on its own. i still didnt think it could be anything serious- i had heard obstruction and still pictures kidney stones, so we just went home to wait. It was a horrible wait. Skip to Tuesday - urologist says I have a upj obstruction and its so severe that its probably been at least partially obstructed my whole life. He couldnt believe i hadnt noticed any symptoms prior to this, but i hadnt.  Anyway, he puts me on more antibiotics because by this point id had hydronephrosis and a hella kidney infection  but he wants another ct scan with contrast before he can figure out a plan. im sent home to wait for my insurance to approve it. 2 days later  we were still waiting, and i ran out pain meds and started to feel way sicker so back to the ER we went and THEY ordered the ct scan eith contrast so i didnt have to wait for insurance. They suggested I be admitted so they could start iv antibiotics, and wait to hear back from my dr, but i had to get home to get my daughter to school. I stayed long enough for them to give me 1 round of meds and made sure they sent results to urology. By the next morning I was way more sick and vomiting and i hadnt heard from dr so we went back to ER and they admitted me. i had ivs in both arms pumping me full of round after round of antibiotics and my white count kept doubling. Another urologist from the same office stopped to update me that night and told me theyd wait 1 more night to see if my count started dropping, but they were gonna need to put in a neph tube to drain my kidney and then have surgery after the infection cleared up to fix the obstructed ureter. By this time I didnt care what they did as long as i got some relief. So i had them put the drain in and i was sent home from the hospital to heal and rest. I  spent the next month in bed, mostly sleeping.  If i got up for any length of time I would get a crushing migraine that lasted 2+days due to my kidney not filtering toxins out fast enough. No work. I felt like I had the flu for a solid month.  Then on the 10th of October I finally had surgery. It was a robotic assisted laparoscopic right side complete dismemberment pyeloplasty. (also removed the neph tube and placed a ureter stent) The surgery was supposed to take 2.5 hours. Mine took 5. I was on a pca pump afterwards and stayed in the hospital for 6 days. Immediately following surgery i had severe co2 shoulder pain that subsided after a couple days. I started getting symptoms  of a uti aftee my catheter came out, but dr and nurses didnt seem concerned. They just kept saying it was from the stent. I have a patient portal id and once i was home i started looking into my lab results and was blown away that nothing had been mentioned. The day after surgery when they did my last blood draw, my complete cbc diff  came back abnormal. Anyway, uti symptoms keep increasing and then I woke up 2 days ago with the worst shoulder and neck pain imaginable.  My hubby took me back to the er, and they did more labs and ordered a cat scan. All of the tests say i have a horrible kidney infection/uti. He also said neck and shoulder pain can be referred from the phrenic nerve that is in the kidney area-especially if the kidney is inflamed. He said my neck will stop hurting as the infection clears up. He gave me a script for antibiotics and then scheduled me with my urologist. i went there today and told them all the same symptoms id told the ER and what they said it was. I was then informed by my urologist that its not an infection, its just the stent, and the neck pain is not related to any nerve by my kidney. So who do i believe and should i be concerned? I scream when I pee it hurts so bad and usually nothing really comes out. Less than a test tube full. I can feel the stent but it doesnt seem to be at the center of the pain.  I realize having a foreign object in place is going to result in wbcs and rbcs in my urine. i just want to know if anyone can tell me if the amounts in my urine and blood are normal for having a stent in place. And there was a couple other results I'll include that were off as well. i just need someone to help me interpret these results since my dr doesnt even look at them. Do i even need to worry about an infection at this point? Im just so tired of being sick. Another symptom of infection is fever. My body temp averages at 97.3-97.5. So when i hit the 98.6 mark i am feeling low grade fever ill - the same way a person normally at 98.6 feels at 100. My chart has my normal temp listed. yet when i go in and my temp reads 98.8, I am told I am right where im supoosed to be- even when im starting to shiver and show signs of a fever. its very frustrating and makes you feel unheard.

A couple of my co workers thought it was more likely kidney stones. Within the hour I was doubled over in pain and could barely walk. I had my son give me a ride home and run over to where my husband was working and get him for me. By the time he got to me 5 minutes later i would have had him call an ambulance if i could have formed words but all i could do was scream. I was in the bathtub -half dressed because I  thought heat would help, and  I didnt  want to waste more time with taking off  the rest of my clothes.  My husband is also thinking kidney stones at this point because he'd had them before. He managed to get me out of the tub and in a towel ,and then almost like magic, the pain subsided. At that point I also started thinking it had to be a kidney stone since ive heard how painful they are and that the pain comes in waves. Mine hadnt completely subsided but it went away enough that i knew i should be getting my butt to the hospital before it came back. But i laid down and slept HARD from exhaustion. When i woke up it had started to come back so my husband took me to the ER. Pain meds, labs, and a cat scan later I learned that it wasnt kidney stones- but something obstruction and i needed to see a urologist straight away after the holiday weekend. They said theyd give me some antibiotics and enough pain meds to make it til then -or they could admit me and i could have my pain managed there.  Regardless, what i had would not resolve on its own. i still didnt think it could be anything serious- i had heard obstruction and still pictures kidney stones, so we just went home to wait. It was a horrible wait. Skip to Tuesday - urologist says I have a upj obstruction and its so severe that its probably been at least partially obstructed my whole life. He couldnt believe i hadnt noticed any symptoms prior to this, but i hadnt.  Anyway, he puts me on more antibiotics because by this point id had hydronephrosis and a hella kidney infection  but he wants another ct scan with contrast before he can figure out a plan. im sent home to wait for my insurance to approve it. 2 days later  we were still waiting, and i ran out pain meds and started to feel way sicker so back to the ER we went and THEY ordered the ct scan eith contrast so i didnt have to wait for insurance. They suggested I be admitted so they could start iv antibiotics, and wait to hear back from my dr, but i had to get home to get my daughter to school. I stayed long enough for them to give me 1 round of meds and made sure they sent results to urology. By the next morning I was way more sick and vomiting and i hadnt heard from dr so we went back to ER and they admitted me. i had ivs in both arms pumping me full of round after round of antibiotics and my white count kept doubling. Another urologist from the same office stopped to update me that night and told me theyd wait 1 more night to see if my count started dropping, but they were gonna need to put in a neph tube to drain my kidney and then have surgery after the infection cleared up to fix the obstructed ureter. By this time I didnt care what they did as long as i got some relief. So i had them put the drain in and i was sent home from the hospital to heal and rest. I  spent the next month in bed, mostly sleeping.  If i got up for any length of time I would get a crushing migraine that lasted 2+days due to my kidney not filtering toxins out fast enough. No work. I felt like I had the flu for a solid month.  Then on the 10th of October I finally had surgery. It was a robotic assisted laparoscopic right side complete dismemberment pyeloplasty. (also removed the neph tube and placed a ureter stent) The surgery was supposed to take 2.5 hours. Mine took 5. I was on a pca pump afterwards and stayed in the hospital for 6 days. Immediately following surgery i had severe co2 shoulder pain that subsided after a couple days. I started getting symptoms  of a uti aftee my catheter came out, but dr and nurses didnt seem concerned. They just kept saying it was from the stent. I have a patient portal id and once i was home i started looking into my lab results and was blown away that nothing had been mentioned. The day after surgery when they did my last blood draw, my complete cbc diff  came back abnormal. Anyway, uti symptoms keep increasing and then I woke up 2 days ago with the worst shoulder and neck pain imaginable.  My hubby took me back to the er, and they did more labs and ordered a cat scan. All of the tests say i have a horrible kidney infection/uti. He also said neck and shoulder pain can be referred from the phrenic nerve that is in the kidney area-especially if the kidney is inflamed. He said my neck will stop hurting as the infection clears up. He gave me a script for antibiotics and then scheduled me with my urologist. i went there today and told them all the same symptoms id told the ER and what they said it was. I was then informed by my urologist that its not an infection, its just the stent, and the neck pain is not related to any nerve by my kidney. So who do i believe and should i be concerned? I scream when I pee it hurts so bad and usually nothing really comes out. Less than a test tube full. I can feel the stent but it doesnt seem to be at the center of the pain.  I realize having a foreign object in place is going to result in wbcs and rbcs in my urine. i just want to know if anyone can tell me if the amounts in my urine and blood are normal for having a stent in place. And there was a couple other results I'll include that were off as well. i just need someone to help me interpret these results since my dr doesnt even look at them. Do i even need to worry about an infection at this point? Im just so tired of being sick. Another symptom of infection is fever. My body temp averages at 97.3-97.5. So when i hit the 98.6 mark i am feeling low grade fever ill - the same way a person normally at 98.6 feels at 100. My chart has my normal temp listed. yet when i go in and my temp reads 98.8, I am told I am right where im supoosed to be- even when im starting to shiver and show signs of a fever. its very frustrating and makes you feel unheard.

By this time I didnt care what they did as long as i got some relief. So i had them put the drain in and i was sent home from the hospital to heal and rest. I  spent the next month in bed, mostly sleeping.  If i got up for any length of time I would get a crushing migraine that lasted 2+days due to my kidney not filtering toxins out fast enough. No work. I felt like I had the flu for a solid month.  Then on the 10th of October I finally had surgery. It was a robotic assisted laparoscopic right side complete dismemberment pyeloplasty. (also removed the neph tube and placed a ureter stent) The surgery was supposed to take 2.5 hours. Mine took 5. I was on a pca pump afterwards and stayed in the hospital for 6 days. Immediately following surgery i had severe co2 shoulder pain that subsided after a couple days. I started getting symptoms  of a uti aftee my catheter came out, but dr and nurses didnt seem concerned. They just kept saying it was from the stent. I have a patient portal id and once i was home i started looking into my lab results and was blown away that nothing had been mentioned. The day after surgery when they did my last blood draw, my complete cbc diff  came back abnormal. Anyway, uti symptoms keep increasing and then I woke up 2 days ago with the worst shoulder and neck pain imaginable.  My hubby took me back to the er, and they did more labs and ordered a cat scan. All of the tests say i have a horrible kidney infection/uti. He also said neck and shoulder pain can be referred from the phrenic nerve that is in the kidney area-especially if the kidney is inflamed. He said my neck will stop hurting as the infection clears up. He gave me a script for antibiotics and then scheduled me with my urologist. i went there today and told them all the same symptoms id told the ER and what they said it was. I was then informed by my urologist that its not an infection, its just the stent, and the neck pain is not related to any nerve by my kidney. So who do i believe and should i be concerned? I scream when I pee it hurts so bad and usually nothing really comes out. Less than a test tube full. I can feel the stent but it doesnt seem to be at the center of the pain.  I realize having a foreign object in place is going to result in wbcs and rbcs in my urine. i just want to know if anyone can tell me if the amounts in my urine and blood are normal for having a stent in place. And there was a couple other results I'll include that were off as well. i just need someone to help me interpret these results since my dr doesnt even look at them. Do i even need to worry about an infection at this point? Im just so tired of being sick. Another symptom of infection is fever. My body temp averages at 97.3-97.5. So when i hit the 98.6 mark i am feeling low grade fever ill - the same way a person normally at 98.6 feels at 100. My chart has my normal temp listed. yet when i go in and my temp reads 98.8, I am told I am right where im supoosed to be- even when im starting to shiver and show signs of a fever. its very frustrating and makes you feel unheard.

A couple of my co workers thought it was more likely kidney stones. Within the hour I was doubled over in pain and could barely walk. I had my son give me a ride home and run over to where my husband was working and get him for me. By the time he got to me 5 minutes later i would have had him call an ambulance if i could have formed words but all i could do was scream. I was in the bathtub -half dressed because I  thought heat would help, and  I didnt  want to waste more time with taking off  the rest of my clothes.  My husband is also thinking kidney stones at this point because he'd had them before. He managed to get me out of the tub and in a towel ,and then almost like magic, the pain subsided. At that point I also started thinking it had to be a kidney stone since ive heard how painful they are and that the pain comes in waves. Mine hadnt completely subsided but it went away enough that i knew i should be getting my butt to the hospital before it came back. But i laid down and slept HARD from exhaustion. When i woke up it had started to come back so my husband took me to the ER. Pain meds, labs, and a cat scan later I learned that it wasnt kidney stones- but something obstruction and i needed to see a urologist straight away after the holiday weekend. They said theyd give me some antibiotics and enough pain meds to make it til then -or they could admit me and i could have my pain managed there.  Regardless, what i had would not resolve on its own. i still didnt think it could be anything serious- i had heard obstruction and still pictures kidney stones, so we just went home to wait. It was a horrible wait. Skip to Tuesday - urologist says I have a upj obstruction and its so severe that its probably been at least partially obstructed my whole life. He couldnt believe i hadnt noticed any symptoms prior to this, but i hadnt.  Anyway, he puts me on more antibiotics because by this point id had hydronephrosis and a hella kidney infection  but he wants another ct scan with contrast before he can figure out a plan. im sent home to wait for my insurance to approve it. 2 days later  we were still waiting, and i ran out pain meds and started to feel way sicker so back to the ER we went and THEY ordered the ct scan eith contrast so i didnt have to wait for insurance.

A couple of my co workers thought it was more likely kidney stones. Within the hour I was doubled over in pain and could barely walk. I had my son give me a ride home and run over to where my husband was working and get him for me. By the time he got to me 5 minutes later i would have had him call an ambulance if i could have formed words but all i could do was scream. I was in the bathtub -half dressed because I  thought heat would help, and  I didnt  want to waste more time with taking off  the rest of my clothes.  My husband is also thinking kidney stones at this point because he'd had them before. He managed to get me out of the tub and in a towel ,and then almost like magic, the pain subsided. At that point I also started thinking it had to be a kidney stone since ive heard how painful they are and that the pain comes in waves. Mine hadnt completely subsided but it went away enough that i knew i should be getting my butt to the hospital before it came back. But i laid down and slept HARD from exhaustion. When i woke up it had started to come back so my husband took me to the ER. Pain meds, labs, and a cat scan later I learned that it wasnt kidney stones- but something obstruction and i needed to see a urologist straight away after the holiday weekend. They said theyd give me some antibiotics and enough pain meds to make it til then -or they could admit me and i could have my pain managed there.  Regardless, what i had would not resolve on its own. i still didnt think it could be anything serious- i had heard obstruction and still pictures kidney stones, so we just went home to wait. It was a horrible wait. Skip to Tuesday - urologist says I have a upj obstruction and its so severe that its probably been at least partially obstructed my whole life. He couldnt believe i hadnt noticed any symptoms prior to this, but i hadnt.  Anyway, he puts me on more antibiotics because by this point id had hydronephrosis and a hella kidney infection  but he wants another ct scan with contrast before he can figure out a plan. im sent home to wait for my insurance to approve it. 2 days later  we were still waiting, and i ran out pain meds and started to feel way sicker so back to the ER we went and THEY ordered the ct scan eith contrast so i didnt have to wait for insurance. They suggested I be admitted so they could start iv antibiotics, and wait to hear back from my dr, but i had to get home to get my daughter to school. I stayed long enough for them to give me 1 round of meds and made sure they sent results to urology. By the next morning I was way more sick and vomiting and i hadnt heard from dr so we went back to ER and they admitted me. i had ivs in both arms pumping me full of round after round of antibiotics and my white count kept doubling. Another urologist from the same office stopped to update me that night and told me theyd wait 1 more night to see if my count started dropping, but they were gonna need to put in a neph tube to drain my kidney and then have surgery after the infection cleared up to fix the obstructed ureter. By this time I didnt care what they did as long as i got some relief. So i had them put the drain in and i was sent home from the hospital to heal and rest. I  spent the next month in bed, mostly sleeping.  If i got up for any length of time I would get a crushing migraine that lasted 2+days due to my kidney not filtering toxins out fast enough. No work. I felt like I had the flu for a solid month.  Then on the 10th of October I finally had surgery. It was a robotic assisted laparoscopic right side complete dismemberment pyeloplasty. (also removed the neph tube and placed a ureter stent) The surgery was supposed to take 2.5 hours. Mine took 5. I was on a pca pump afterwards and stayed in the hospital for 6 days. Immediately following surgery i had severe co2 shoulder pain that subsided after a couple days. I started getting symptoms  of a uti aftee my catheter came out, but dr and nurses didnt seem concerned. They just kept saying it was from the stent. I have a patient portal id and once i was home i started looking into my lab results and was blown away that nothing had been mentioned. The day after surgery when they did my last blood draw, my complete cbc diff  came back abnormal. Anyway, uti symptoms keep increasing and then I woke up 2 days ago with the worst shoulder and neck pain imaginable.  My hubby took me back to the er, and they did more labs and ordered a cat scan. All of the tests say i have a horrible kidney infection/uti. He also said neck and shoulder pain can be referred from the phrenic nerve that is in the kidney area-especially if the kidney is inflamed. He said my neck will stop hurting as the infection clears up. He gave me a script for antibiotics and then scheduled me with my urologist. i went there today and told them all the same symptoms id told the ER and what they said it was. I was then informed by my urologist that its not an infection, its just the stent, and the neck pain is not related to any nerve by my kidney. So who do i believe and should i be concerned? I scream when I pee it hurts so bad and usually nothing really comes out. Less than a test tube full. I can feel the stent but it doesnt seem to be at the center of the pain.  I realize having a foreign object in place is going to result in wbcs and rbcs in my urine. i just want to know if anyone can tell me if the amounts in my urine and blood are normal for having a stent in place. And there was a couple other results I'll include that were off as well. i just need someone to help me interpret these results since my dr doesnt even look at them. Do i even need to worry about an infection at this point? Im just so tired of being sick. Another symptom of infection is fever. My body temp averages at 97.3-97.5. So when i hit the 98.6 mark i am feeling low grade fever ill - the same way a person normally at 98.6 feels at 100. My chart has my normal temp listed. yet when i go in and my temp reads 98.8, I am told I am right where im supoosed to be- even when im starting to shiver and show signs of a fever. its very frustrating and makes you feel unheard.

The doctor explained that PCNL was the only option to remove the stone before it damaged the rest of my left kidney.  I scheduled the surgery for Nov 11th and everything went well the day of surgery.  The tube was inserted 2 hours prior to my surgery by Intervening Radiology and I only felt mild discomfort.  Surgery went well and all but sand size granules of the stone were removed.  The pain meds worked fine until the middle of the night.  The pain became excruciating and the nightime nurse was  ot very responsive.  I had to wait anywhere from 2 hours to 5 hours for the nurse to give me the pain pills.  I opted to be discharged the day after to surgery due to such poor care at the hospital.  My first few nights home were extremely uncomfortable and the pain was horrible when I would lay down or recline.  I requested additional pain meds and to take them every 6 hours versus 8 hours and this seemed to get the pain under control.  I was starting to feel better when the day came to get the nephrostomy tube removed.  One week after surgery, I went back to the hospital and within 15 minutes the nephrostogram and tube removal was complete.  It was a little uncomfortable, but not painful.  They bandaged me up and gave me a care package with a handful of gauze pads and tegaderm film.  I'm not sure what they thought this would accomplish.  I used up the whole care package within a few hours and ended up with what felt like diaper rash on my back.  The urine leakage was uncontrollable from my back.  I  soaked at least three loads of laundry before my husband was able to get home with bladder control pads and ACE bandages to improvise a urine control bandage for my back.  Here I am 39 hours post tube removal and still changing pads on my back every 2-3 hours.  Doc says this is normal, but it doesn't feel normal to function with a pad on your back!  I'm thankful my job gave me advanced sick leave and I can stay home until this dries up.  I'm also still feeling the same amount of pain I have been for the past week.  I'm glad many others haven't had as rough a time with PCNL, but I wish I had been more prepared for the difficulties I've endured with the post surgery recovery. 0 likes, 5 replies "

Due to the surgey they put a stent in while it all heals up to take the pressure off the area and in general it's been ok with just the usual extra urgency and discomfort to pee sometimes but one of the other discomforts is I feel full on the side of the kidney surgery. It's not painful but I feel bloated and super uncomfortable and on that side and sometimes it feels like when I break wind it relieves some of that pressure.

My career is going great and I've been married to the most amazing women for over 4 years who gave birth to our first child, a beautiful baby boy on 18th November. For the past 8 months or so I've had sciatica, which I assumed was from running or the seating position of a new car. Stretching always relived the pain and I thought nothing more of it as it was easily bearable and only impacted me when sitting for long periods. Due to the constant bending to pic up my baby boy, I developed a pain in same area of my sciatica, nothing extreme, just a typical back strain and was struggling to get a full gait with my left leg. As I was on paternity, on November 28th I decided to see an osteopath to finally sort the issue out, as having a new born was certainly not going to help. The treatment seemed ok and I walked out slightly less stiff.  The next day I was ok, similar pain when walking but a bit tender around the massaged area. That evening I had a bit of a spasm in my back where the pain was when bending over using the toilet, but once I was up I was fine and thought nothing more.  The following morning I was struggling to get out of bed, I got 3 steps down the stairs and the spasm hit again, but 10 times worse. No way was I making it down stairs then. I made it back to bed to releave the pain. This went on at intervals throughout the day, trying to go the bathroom etc, and at one point I made it down the stairs (no spasm) and back up. I could only stand for short period (30 secs), but as soon as I was back lying down I was fine. Since it was a bad back I was trying move every hour to not seize. 5pm, I couldn't even try to get out of bed without feeling the spasm and pain.  6pm came and I could get out of bed no problem, pain but no spasm.  I went to the toilet at 7pm and started to go. Standing still was extremely painful and then the spasm came, worse than ever. I stopped and headed straight for the bed to get flat. I managed to get on the bed and get flat and then everything started to go numb from my waist down. My feet were locked, my legs had little movement and my groin and butting area went all numb. As like most, I've never heard of CES, and hadn't got a clue what was happening. I instantly knew something was wrong and dailed for an ambulance.  2 hours later I was in A&E, where a doctor had recognised my symptoms after waiting 2 hours in the queue. By 3am I had been ambulanced to a specialist spinal unit, still unable to move my feet/ankles and still the numbness in my groin and buttock area. An MRI detected a L4-L5 disc hernation. I had surgery at 1pm that day, 18 hours after the initial onset. Having read more about CES and the crucial window to avoid lasting damage, I feel very lucky to have had surgery so quick, and even more so to get moved to a rehab centre within a few days.  I'm now recovering in a Spinal Rehabilitation unit, 8 days after surgery. My legs are moving, bending at the knee (but not in a scissor motion), and both feet have drop foot.  The numbness to my groin and buttock area remains. Since the surgery the movement in my feet has increased, I can wiggle them maybe 5mm, and the numbness may have decreased slightly on the outside of my buttock region and a bit in my groin, but a great deal remains. I can't voluntarily urinate, but can tell I need to go. I have some feeling in my bowel function but no proper control.  I can stand and walk awkwardly taking small steps with a frame which is extremely tiring. I'm working on building the strength back in to my legs, but toilet troubles have halted that progress. I'm trying to stay positive and have my family and friends to support me, but as I'm sure you can imagine, missing out on those precious moments of a new born is hurting, but at the same time motivating me to become stronger without overdoing it. Over the last week or so I have researched everything I can on CES and read countless stories, and realise I am lucky to have some movement and to have received surgery in a timely manner.  I am still in the early days and see months of hard work ahead to try and function more independently. I just wanted to put my story out there and would appreciate any advice.

My career is going great and I've been married to the most amazing women for over 4 years who gave birth to our first child, a beautiful baby boy on 18th November. For the past 8 months or so I've had sciatica, which I assumed was from running or the seating position of a new car. Stretching always relived the pain and I thought nothing more of it as it was easily bearable and only impacted me when sitting for long periods. Due to the constant bending to pic up my baby boy, I developed a pain in same area of my sciatica, nothing extreme, just a typical back strain and was struggling to get a full gait with my left leg. As I was on paternity, on November 28th I decided to see an osteopath to finally sort the issue out, as having a new born was certainly not going to help. The treatment seemed ok and I walked out slightly less stiff.  The next day I was ok, similar pain when walking but a bit tender around the massaged area. That evening I had a bit of a spasm in my back where the pain was when bending over using the toilet, but once I was up I was fine and thought nothing more.  The following morning I was struggling to get out of bed, I got 3 steps down the stairs and the spasm hit again, but 10 times worse. No way was I making it down stairs then. I made it back to bed to releave the pain. This went on at intervals throughout the day, trying to go the bathroom etc, and at one point I made it down the stairs (no spasm) and back up. I could only stand for short period (30 secs), but as soon as I was back lying down I was fine. Since it was a bad back I was trying move every hour to not seize. 5pm, I couldn't even try to get out of bed without feeling the spasm and pain.  6pm came and I could get out of bed no problem, pain but no spasm.

All in all I'm pretty happy happy with it although I had some concerns that I wrote about in another post.  I still have the edge glare but even that doesn't seem as bad as it was.  However one thing I have noticed is that if I look at a bright light and blink, I see a symmetrical snowflake like geometry in my central vision.  I do not see any lights when my eyes are closed so I do not think this is retina related.  I've had enough retinal issues in my life to know what that looks like.  Also the snowflake doesn't stay there but only appears for like a millisecond after a blink but it's harder to discern when not looking at a bright light or white background.  Has anybody every seen this kind of thing after cataract surgery?   Or have an idea of what it is? 0 likes, 4 replies "

Trying to work out if I’m suffering from Afib, ectopic beats or something else. I have been struggling with what I thinks is chest flutters/palpitations for the past few months (no sweating, chest pain etc), and have become super anxious about it, worrying I have a defective heart. My resting heartbeat when relaxed is around 55-60 bpm, but can notice an increase and strong heartbeat when I wake most morning or sometimes if I go to the loo in middle of night. This can some feel a little erratic but does feel somewhat regular but never really rises above 110bpm. On a few occasions over the past few months I have been lying in bed and feel myself get super anxious so automatically go to to test my pulse, also instantaneously my heart rate goes up and starts beating sporadically. But once I deep breath and count in my head this can then go to normal rhythm/beats in about 20sec to a minute.  This was something I never really noticed when I wasn’t so anxious about things. Also when at work (office job which is not at all stressful) sometimes (not every day) around 11.00-12.00 I usually feel a little flutter in my chest followed by some strong heartbeats but pulse again doesn’t go over 90bpm. Always around the same time which seems odd (possible sugar level dropping) I went A&E just prior to Xmas when feeling super anxious and had a poor night’s sleep and had an ECG which showed an ectopic beat (PVC). This kind of made me feel a little less anxious for a while and not worrying about a heart defect. However, I couldn’t shake the worry, so I went to Dr. I had another ECG and blood test and ECG showed a normal heart beat and blood tests was all well in range and cholesterol ratio at 2.4. I mentioned to Dr I cycle 7 miles to work daily and am in the gym 5 days a week (cardio/light weight) raising heart rate to approx. 150 bpm and can recover extremely quickly. And feel my fitness has improved over past few months. I’m a on plant-based diet and a recent over 40 MOT put my heart attack/stroke risk at 2.2%. Dr obviously sent me away reassuring me that I have nothing to worry about. For just over 1 week now I have been taking a large tablespoon of NowFoods Potassium Citrate powder in the morning with water and last week didn’t have any noticeable flutters during the days or during weekends. Did wake up though in the night with what felt like raised heartbeat and a little erratic, but this was the night prior to seeing Dr and also going for tests. Over past 2 mornings I have reduced the Potassium to 2 teaspoons and around the same time 11am-12 had a few noticeable flutters, so took a spoonful at work and these stopped for the rest of day. Also been taking a spoonful before bed and haven’t noticed any heart palpitations during the night. Apologies for the super long post, in a bit of limbo in terms of what to do, have I got anything to worry about from a heart perspective as I seem to be doing everything right from a lifestyle perspective (apart from anxiety) .

I am having a nightmare with my specialist and GP's. no one seems to know what on earth is going on and now all have gone radio silent on me! I was told at an appointment 8 weeks ago completely out of the blue that it would be best for me to have my thyroid removed?! Seems drastic when I've only been on carbimazole since last September! Since being on it I have suffered the most insane anxiety attacks. Now I cannot for sure say they are the cause as since a child I have been an anxiety sufferer on and off. But these attacks are debilitating!  I am also miserable! I'm usually one of those very annoying peppy people who's always bouncing off the walls (possibly because I had an overactive thyroid! Ha!) now I'm miserable, health obsessed, moody, shattered, and boring!!!  I've noticed over time a lack of interest in anything I used to love! For example working out! I used to work out before work and after! Now I want to cry at the thought! It's just too much effort! As is washing my hair some weeks (I do of course!) I have a foggy head which I see is quite common and constipation which again is something I've had on/off through life but I'm sure has increased.  After the removal discussion I had to go for a scan. 6 weeks ago!!!! Along with bloods. Does anyone want to give me the results of these?? Absolutely not it seems!! I'm still in the dark! I went I my GP at breaking point literally! Feeling like my life has gone from amazing to unbearable (I am dramatic apologies!) and she said if anything my thyroid now appeared to be under active but as she's not a specialist would not like to formally comment or advise! I've called my specialist 3 times in 6 weeks, was told by his secretary my scan was on his desk 2 weeks ago and I'd hear soon. Still nothing! So (sorry I am getting to the point!) I decided to try for myself reducing my carbimazole from 20mg to 10mg. Which is possibly too big a jump? Well anyway since starting the meds I have at times forgotten to take a dose here and there (rarely) but every time I have I have started spotting?? Does this happen to anyone else? So when this happens I panic that I'm doing damage and go back to 20mg, feel like crap, feel determined to reduce whilst waiting for advice, get spotting, panic and take 20mg again!  I have googled this side effect to death and can find no one else mentioning this??  I am having separate tests for this btw in case it isn't related but I know from missed doses it definitely seems to tie in! Each time I have forgotten a dose do you know how I realise?? I suddenly feel great!! And can think clearly!  I have had a lot happen in the last year,y home was broken into while I was here! (Day time!) threat of redundancy at work, marital issues etc so I am aware my increased anxiety could be this.  But I'm sure it's these pills also! I'm now considering reducing to 15mg instead of straight down to 10mg to see? As the Gp was convinced I'm at the underactive end of the scale now! But I'm scared to come off it! Which is why I never wanted to start it in the first place    When I reduce any palpitation or dizzy spell or spotting I convince myself is the reduction in meds so I panic and take my 2nd pill and never try to ride it out. Any advice greatly appreciated! Sympathy also    I'm so unhappy   and just want answers or opinions from anyone who has had a similar experience.  I have a GP appointment with one that does understand thyroids next Friday and will chase for scan results again in the week but really feel upset I have to!  0 likes, 2 replies "

I had recently been told I have thy2 nodules which was a huge relief and have a Thyroid uptake scan next week. This scan has required me to be off my Carbimizole for the scan and since coming off I haven't been feeling very well. I am unsure if this is related or whether I am just paranoid but I've been really dizzy at work, had vision changes and have been extremely tired and run down where I feel like I'm just sleeping all the time. I then woke up on Monday with an extremely sore throat that was extremely swollen, it has since come down but is still sore and have a really dry cough that is causing a painful burning sensation across my chest. I am just concerned because I haven't had a cough like this before and along with the other symptoms and me only being 20 years old I'm just getting myself more anxious.

I was sick from the Flu that week and on the Friday instead of resting my body/mind, I decided to be a tough guy and go train at my brazilian Jiu Jitsu academy, while battling the flu and being exhausted from my sales job. The next day, I got up early, so sleep deprived, worked out, cleaned my place, paid my rent, got a drink of red wine and then went downtown to a social event. As I was climbing up these stairs from the subway to the streets, my heart palpitations occurred. It was an irregular, fast heart beat and lasted for 1 to 2 minutes. I breathed myself out of it. Later in that day, I had a few more episodes but much shorter in time. I didn't experience chest pain, or shortness of breath or anything but started to panic and felt a bit light headed. Once again, I breathed and was no longer light headed. Was this a panic attack or an arrhythmia caused by me pushing the boundaries of my mind/body when exhausted and injesting a trigger/stimulant like alcohol on top of that? It was all gone by end of day. I also tend to keep myself always on the Go Growing my business, I go out to social events to meet women, pick up women each day at this one area that they tend to walk around on during lunch and after work"" Also have had some stress added due to some personal, family related things so really got in my head the last 2 months. I'm slowly getting out of it with better sleep, meditation, relaxation and now if I feel I'm exhausted I just rest and call it a day instead of pushing my mind and body. Now a month later like 2 days ago. Same thing I'm out with my friends, it's super cold, I'm exhausted, mentally drained and we are out for 7 hours. We then end up having a hearty wood oven pizza, a glass of whisky and then we go out again and walk around. I started to feel some PVCs or ectopic beats after my drink. Then when I left my friends and went home on the subway, when I exited the station onto the streets. It was bone chilling cold. I had heart palpitations again. Lasting for about 50 seconds. I breathed myself out of it. The common thing between these two things I noticed was alcohol and exhaustion and mental stress. It's like when I think about my heart, I get palpitations, when I just get out of my head and into my body, they are gone or much less. So trying to figure out what these could be If they are Arrhythmia then they must be Premature Ventricular Contractions or A Fibs. I know it is not a V fib as that is deadly.

The next day, I got up early, so sleep deprived, worked out, cleaned my place, paid my rent, got a drink of red wine and then went downtown to a social event. As I was climbing up these stairs from the subway to the streets, my heart palpitations occurred. It was an irregular, fast heart beat and lasted for 1 to 2 minutes. I breathed myself out of it. Later in that day, I had a few more episodes but much shorter in time. I didn't experience chest pain, or shortness of breath or anything but started to panic and felt a bit light headed. Once again, I breathed and was no longer light headed. Was this a panic attack or an arrhythmia caused by me pushing the boundaries of my mind/body when exhausted and injesting a trigger/stimulant like alcohol on top of that? It was all gone by end of day. I also tend to keep myself always on the Go Growing my business, I go out to social events to meet women, pick up women each day at this one area that they tend to walk around on during lunch and after work"" Also have had some stress added due to some personal, family related things so really got in my head the last 2 months. I'm slowly getting out of it with better sleep, meditation, relaxation and now if I feel I'm exhausted I just rest and call it a day instead of pushing my mind and body. Now a month later like 2 days ago. Same thing I'm out with my friends, it's super cold, I'm exhausted, mentally drained and we are out for 7 hours. We then end up having a hearty wood oven pizza, a glass of whisky and then we go out again and walk around. I started to feel some PVCs or ectopic beats after my drink. Then when I left my friends and went home on the subway, when I exited the station onto the streets. It was bone chilling cold. I had heart palpitations again. Lasting for about 50 seconds. I breathed myself out of it. The common thing between these two things I noticed was alcohol and exhaustion and mental stress. It's like when I think about my heart, I get palpitations, when I just get out of my head and into my body, they are gone or much less. So trying to figure out what these could be If they are Arrhythmia then they must be Premature Ventricular Contractions or A Fibs. I know it is not a V fib as that is deadly. Curious if anyone has experienced this type of thing or can lend any insight as to what these two isolated episodes might have been. Thanks 0 likes, 1 reply "

Then on that day had another drink(red wine..a huge trigger for me), before going up a long flight of stairs to go to a social event while drained, sick and it hit me.

Just diabetes and strokes as complications but later in their golden years. My parents are in great health I think it could just be nerves and stimulants and over working myself. I'm type A and very driven. I've since taken a break from Jiu Jitsu for 1 month. resting more, sleeping earlier, drinking more water, reduced to completely eliminated alcohol to just beer nothing strong and that too once in a while, eating whole foods, meditation and etc and I do feel better.

Would like to hear about your experiences ,"hello everyone i have been suffering with ectopic beats for almost 6months now, they  are honestly the worst thing i could imagine due to their unpredict ability. My experience is as follows - i get them around 30 times a day mainly when i am moving outside or laughing hard or when i get anxious as if it occurs when there is a spike inadrenaline or excitement of any form. they give me a sinking feeling in my stomach like when a rollercoaster drops, my heart skips a beat and it feels lik e my heart is about to stop or go erratic and thats when i feel  like i am about to die. - the ectopics can be followed by lightheadedness or my stomach feeling unease as if its moving around in my abdomen - they tend to  not happen  when i am staying still or resting such as resting on a sofa - i also noticed that i get these ectopic beats when i am changing position in bed sometimes - tachycardia can happen from time to time where my heart rate hovers around 100-120 for a little bit, often i feel breathless or light headed when this happen. - i sometimes wake up feeling with strong palpitation and elevated resting heart rate around 88-110 for no  reason straight up from sleeping. although this doesnt happen often as my ectopic beats - heavy meals can sometimes trigger them i have seen a cardiologist and did a ecg monitoring and waiting for those results now. I wanted to hear from your guys, if you suffered something similar or know how to deal with it. i am only 21 and really dont know how i am supposed to cope withthis feeling as i truly feel scared all the time. it has stopped me from taking up an active lifestyle as i am scared it can trigger an erratic heart rate. i have stopped any caffiene or fizzy drinks and reduced my sugar intakes. people dont believe how much it has impacted my life when i tell them about and was hopingi could find some people who understand thank you for reading 0 likes, 25 replies "

There was nothing to be concerned as per the doctors. I was prescribed a propranolol beta blocker which did somewhat suppressed my ectopics..However a month back I started having very hard and forceful heartbeat which was most noticeable at night while I was trying to go to sleep. This thing did not bother me that much during daytime but is troubling me to go to sleep during night which makes me very weary the next day. I again went to the doctor and had one more ECG which was again normal. So doctor basically attributed it to anxiety and slightly low level of iron and he changed my beta blocker to metroprolol and gave me supplements plus some anti-stress herbal medicine. It has been two weeks since and while I have seen some improvement but still it is troublesome.Anybody else suffering from the same who can help me? Just to add i suffer from severe chronic constipation but ever since i started having these heart issues i have also developed indigestion issues for which i take one pill daily at night.. I am 31 male btw. 0 likes, 8 replies "

I did an EKG and the doctor decided that i should have a holter on for a day. I kept it for a day, the doctor read the results and said that she could not see any anomaly and everything is fine. When i came home and looked at the holter results, i saw that my QT interval read Average:357ms Min:309ms and Max:520ms and the QTc reads: Average:401ms Min:356ms and Max: 563ms. I got really scared when i read this and did some research and did not find anything conclusive so i decided to write here. I should mention that i had a holter 2 years ago too and it was pretty much the same. I am a hypochondric so i get scared about everything health related so i had a lot of heart tests done over the 3-4 years including 3 heart echos, 2 holters as mentioned above and a lot of EKG's. Everything came back as normal, only the holter that i had 2 years ago read some extra systoles but the doctor attributed them to me growing up and having hormonal changes and i don't have them anymore. Should i worry? 0 likes, 3 replies "

Im on 25mg of metoprolol time release tablets ( a beta blocker) the palps are basically gone, maybe a few a day. (use to be very bad for a while) but im wondering if anyone is on beta blockers and what they think? the idea is to stay on them for a few months the  weane off slowly. the goal is not to be on them forever, but get my anxiety under control. My other question is, has anyone had any negative side effects? ive been on them for about a month and a few days ago ive been having some chest, and neck pain. a dull and tight uncomfortable feeling. i feel if its not one thing its anotner. i dont want to go to the doc for every time i think something is wrong. ive had multiple echos and holter monitors (all came back fine) could the beta blocker be making my chest hurt? is it anxiety? i feel like my heart wants to beat faster but cant because its slowed down with the beta blocker. if anyone has any tips, please share. i feel like im going crazy and the doctors keep missing something. 1 like, 8 replies "

Anyone experience this? HI so the last week I've been sleeping so so and getting up in the night. I've since then lowered my stress and get to bed earlier and found a way to sleep more soundly to completely decompress my body. However I noticed that on those days where I slept like crap thenight before, a few things happen and as a note have been not as hydrated by drinking water as I should be. I'm now drinking more water also. So anyways some of the things I experienced I think all of this has to do with the vagus nerve being irritated, stimulated due to stress, lack of sleep, bathroom straining and this nerve regulated heart rate. I also read that all of this is common and I have no other symptoms that could suggest   or anything. I train, workout with intensity and never get faint, dizzy or even lose my breath. I have sick, conditioning like a fighter. I also don't smoke, don't drink but am stressed as I'm a type A personality so always on the go, do not really decompress consistently and also don't get enough sleep lately nor water. I will try to now. Anyone else experience this? Related Tags 0 likes, 3 replies "

A couple of times in my life, I have nearly fainted, because of what I believe to be heart problems, I feel dizy before hand, within 45 minutes I feel my heart really slow, head spinning, vision loss.

Last October the following started and continues to this day: when I lay down to read (head propped up on pillows) or sleep on my back, my heart rate changes immediately. It goes from normal rhythm to an noticeable irregular beat to a constant 4 beats then skip, 2 beats then skip...can go on for an hour or more back and forth. Most alarming is when it it beats once then skips and measures 32 BPM. I have a cardio app the shows the heart beat and graphic. Once I get up, all is AOK, except some days I have an occasional heart beat skip throughout the day. Does anyone have any experience with this sort of irregular heart beat when laying down?  It can happen when I sleep on my left side and until last week never happened on my stomach or right side. Its now happening on occasion  in the night no matter how I'm situated in bed. Its causing me awful concern now. I do not have a doctor.    Please advise. Thank you. Z 0 likes, 2 replies "

I also started having heart   around the same time, which will either happen as one 'skip' so to speak, or more commonly, I'll feel a fluttering in my chest that lasts about 6 seconds. Again, off and on throughout the day, but it hasn't gone away. What's weird is that's where the symptoms stop. I've checked symptoms online that lead to disease with other symptoms I dont have. I've been to the emergency room twice, and both times they say my blood pressure and bpm are pretty normal. They ask if I have any  , fatigue, pain or anything, and i really feel pretty normal aside from those two things. But they aren't helping me and I want to get an idea what this is, because unfortunately where I'm from, without a primary doctor, ED trips are all I have. 0 likes, 4 replies "

I can feel each thump, each bump, each bigemic run. I have worn more Holter monitors than most, been to the ER over 50 times, had over 100 EKGs (ECG’s), 3 MRIs, the whole works. Over 6% of my heartbeats were ectopic. So I decided to finally have a cardiac ablation, and I wanted to write to everyone considering an ablation, those who live with this hellish problem doctors rarely take seriously and few ways to treat, much less cure, in order to give back to the community that helped me in the hardest times when I was in bigeminy and couplets and SVT, laying on my couch waiting to die. First: PVCs and PACs in a otherwise healthy heart won’t kill you they just will not. I’ve spoken to 30 docs at some of the best hospitals in the country. They won’t. Sometimes very rarely they spin out into other issues that feel worse and if left untreated can be harmful. If your heart rate spins over 170 for more than a couple hours, go to an ER. If over 200 for more than a couple minutes, go to an ER. The other super scary VFIb sudden death stuff if it’s not in your family history, or you haven’t just had a massive heart attack with electrical complications, it’s not going to happen to you. It just isn’t. You’re fine. It just sucks. Calm down. Now is the time to be decisive. You can drive, eat, exercise (it sucks but I did it all the time), go for walks with your family, go on vacation. Everything. Staying inside won’t help the PACs or PVCs. Staying inside just lets you listen for them and curl up. Staying inside is actually worse for your health, in the long term. But you get to decide how you live your life. Me? Some days I stayed in, when I was in constant bigeminy. Other days I went out until I couldn’t take it anymore. But when I was out, I often forgot about them. I saw people and lived a life. Second: No amount of drugs helped my skipped beats. Not fish oil, not four different types of magnesium, not beta blockers, not calcium blockers, not potassium, not COQ-10, not anything. What helped? Good sleep, hydration, exercise, walking. But mostly, a deep desire to stop letting them run my life. They’re terrible. I hate them. I pushed through them. You can too. There are hundreds of millions of people with skipped beats almost all of us, according to reports and some people don’t go outside because of them and some people run in the Olympics. You get to choose. I would go for weeks without skipped beats sometime. Months even. They always returned. I got what I call storms for weeks, endless skipped beats. Dark days. But I pushed through. THE ABLATION: This is a no BS zone. I put off the ablation twice before I finally got it because I was nervous about someone burning my heart. I’d spent hours online reading the pros and cons. I read the possibilities of stroke and zapping through my heart. I scanned through all the success stories to read about people on their 3rd ablation. I talked to two friends who had ablations for A-fib. I worried about having a stroke, reacting to drugs, etc. Then came a particularly bad storm, and I told my wife, “Remind me of how I felt during this moment if I say I’m going to put off the surgery again.” She did. I prepared for the appointment. Preparation: I didn’t eat after midnight. I took a shower. I drank coffee, because I wanted those little b******s to start popping first thing, so they could detect them. Went to bed late, 2 am, because that always brings them on. I was calling down the storm. The hospital: Got there at 5 AM. Yes, that early. They took 8 of us in at once. I got into a gown. They shaved my pubes and nipple hair and around my kidneys. But guess what? I wasn’t having A SINGLE SKIPPED BEAT. I got nervous, did pushups, ran down the hall, went to the bathroom to hop up and down. Nothing. If they couldn’t detect a skipped beat, they couldn’t burn. I would have to go through the whole recovery with nothing changed. I was wheeled into the frigidly cold room 5 hours later. Three attendant nurses were there with the anesthesiologist. My electrophysiologist, who would be preforming the surgery, hadn’t arrived yet. He’d promised me they’d shoot me up with drugs that would make my arrhythmia start up before they went in, but that didn’t happen. I asked them not to put me completely out, because I had a cousin die at the dentist under anesthesia. They said they wouldn’t. I was out like a light within 2 minutes of being in the room. Fentanyl. Before falling asleep the ceiling was crawling in waves. I woke up just as they were applying pressure to the insertion site. I felt them suturing the wound with a single stitch. They told me not to move. They said they were able to get some bad beats and made the burn. I was elated. Then they shot me up with fentanyl, a massive 100 mcg dose that shocked the docs I spoke to in the room they kept me for 4 hours, to make sure there weren’t any complications. In the waiting area I experienced skipped beats, which were normal. My heart felt like it was being squeezed, but the docs were right there & I was hooked up to monitors. Chest pain, wonked out on drugs, desperate. 5 hours later I was released. I got a car with my wife and headed home. FIRST WEEK: You are now 90 years old. For 3 days, you will not be able to walk across the room without getting winded. You will have a giant knot in an uncomfortable place, several knots even, that you will monitor to make sure it doesn’t get bigger than a walnut. One doc told me a “fist.” The bruising will be nasty and run a bit down your leg, all over the place. You will believe you’re hemorrhaging but probably aren’t. You will be dizzy, anxious, nauseous maybe, and sore at the spot. This is normal. But I called the hospital at least 8 times making sure I wasn’t dying. Your heart rate will go 10 points above normal for the next 3 weeks, by the way (nobody told me this it’s known). You need somebody to take care of you the first week. Docs might say you can go back to work after a week. NO YOU CANNOT! You need to take 3 weeks off work, minimum. Sorry, minimum. My mother came up to be with us. I could barely walk to the bathroom to pee, and I only showered once during the first week. Lay down, cue up Netflix, have someone make you food. SECOND WEEK: I’m in bigeminy. I’ll be in bigeminy a lot for the next 4 weeks. I’ve read that it takes 3 months for the heart to heal, but I pulled by EP aside and told him to level with me. He said if nothing changes within the first 6 weeks, the procedure was most likely a failure. I have an Alivcor single-lead strip (INVEST IN THIS) that shows I’m not only throwing PACs and PVCs, and in bigeminy A LOT, but that I’ve DEVELOPED A NEW PVC SPOT! I go to my appointment at the Heart Rhythm Center. I show a PDF of the strip to my EP, who confirmed the new spot. “This wasn’t there before, I was unifocal,” I said. He shrugged. “That’s definitely a different spot. This will make another surgery a bit more difficult.” “Did the new scarring cause this?” I asked. “No, it’s in a different part of the heart.” They put me on a 24-hr Holter. I’m now playing Wii Golf for exercise. I cannot lift anything heavy, and shouldn’t try. I’m writing horror stories on my laptop and watching all the old Ingmar Bergman films I missed. There are 60 but I have time now. I cancel all plans for the month. This is my life now. I have to heal. I have to make my life about me for now. THIRD WEEK: Bigeminy, skipped beats, and while I’m sitting on the couch, my heart rate flies to 170 beats per minute. Is it SVT, which is harmless but terrifying, or VT (V-tach), which is deadly? I call the hospital hotline but the on-call doc says they can’t tell unless they catch it on the strip. “Try to catch the next one.” So I do. It happens again 3 days later. Sinus tachycardia, they say. 120 bpm lying down. “It went to 170 last time,” I say. They shrug. “Is this related to the burn?” “No,” they say, it’s the PVCs and PACs throwing it into an abnormal rhythm. I’m exercising more, Wii Golf. I’m afraid now I will simply drop dead. I have made a huge mistake doing this to my heart. I have hurt my wife by becoming a burden to her. I am terrified. I schedule another appointment with my EP, and wait a terribly long weekend in bed with my heart going crazy. FOURTH WEEK: I meet with my EP first thing on Monday. He assures me I’m not going to go into VT, that it’s incredibly rare in someone my age (42), much less in someone without other preexisting conditions. I cannot believe him. “How rare?” “You’re not showing any of the common morphology for any of these diseases. I’ve seen them before.” The Holter shows only 2% of all any beats are ectopics, with a few runs of tachycardia and only a single couplet. “Bigeminy often, but that’s a normal heartbeat for some people. YOU JUST FEEL EVERYTHING.” I ask him if I can go off the daily 325 aspirin, he says yes. I ask him if the surgery was a failure. He nods, “It appears so. But we’re going to start you on a new beta blocker, works for 25% of people. Later we’ll add flecanide, which will bring it up in the range of 65%.” I’m willing to do anything at this point. “And if that doesn’t work, we’ll return to ablation.” I have a plan. After a month of this mess, I’m more content that my new life is living with my arrhythmia this is the new normal, and it won’t kill me. THE NEXT DAY: I went off aspirin that day, which was 5 days ago, and something strange happened. I woke up the next morning, and I wasn’t in bigeminy. In fact, I wasn’t throwing any beats at all. I was cautious. I told no one. I worried that my blood was thickening, that het real healing had begun, the burn was clotting, and now I would have a stroke. I called the center. They assured me I was fine. Nothing in my history put me in the usual cautious category for a stroke. I went and did my own research, as many of you will running through the “Conclusions” section of NIH studies to see just how many people die of stroke after ablations. The truth? A very low number, much less than 1%, have strokes following ablations. They tend to be much much older than I. How many of those who have strokes die? Less than 5% of 1%. So I could have a stroke and still live? Didn’t even occur to me. FIVE DAYS LATER I’ve had 12 skipped beats in 5 days. One of them threw my heart rate slightly higher. I haven’t been in bigeminy once. I’ve been walking miles in 90 degree New York City heat every day of the week to test my luck and push myself. I’m pushing all my buttons. I want to make sure my heart knows what I’m planning to do with it. The PVCs and PACs aren’t gone, there’s just a lot fewer of them. Did the procedure work, or did I just past through another storm? I have no idea, but this shows me that I’ll have good days. It’s important to LIVE INSIDE your good days, and PUSH THROUGH the bad. I’m a scaredy cat, a worry wart, a very anxious person. I’m surviving. You will too. 7 likes, 18 replies "

I go to my appointment at the Heart Rhythm Center. I show a PDF of the strip to my EP, who confirmed the new spot. “This wasn’t there before, I was unifocal,” I said. He shrugged. “That’s definitely a different spot. This will make another surgery a bit more difficult.” “Did the new scarring cause this?” I asked. “No, it’s in a different part of the heart.” They put me on a 24-hr Holter. I’m now playing Wii Golf for exercise. I cannot lift anything heavy, and shouldn’t try. I’m writing horror stories on my laptop and watching all the old Ingmar Bergman films I missed. There are 60 but I have time now. I cancel all plans for the month. This is my life now. I have to heal. I have to make my life about me for now. THIRD WEEK: Bigeminy, skipped beats, and while I’m sitting on the couch, my heart rate flies to 170 beats per minute. Is it SVT, which is harmless but terrifying, or VT (V-tach), which is deadly? I call the hospital hotline but the on-call doc says they can’t tell unless they catch it on the strip. “Try to catch the next one.” So I do. It happens again 3 days later. Sinus tachycardia, they say. 120 bpm lying down. “It went to 170 last time,” I say. They shrug. “Is this related to the burn?” “No,” they say, it’s the PVCs and PACs throwing it into an abnormal rhythm. I’m exercising more, Wii Golf. I’m afraid now I will simply drop dead. I have made a huge mistake doing this to my heart. I have hurt my wife by becoming a burden to her. I am terrified. I schedule another appointment with my EP, and wait a terribly long weekend in bed with my heart going crazy. FOURTH WEEK: I meet with my EP first thing on Monday. He assures me I’m not going to go into VT, that it’s incredibly rare in someone my age (42), much less in someone without other preexisting conditions. I cannot believe him. “How rare?” “You’re not showing any of the common morphology for any of these diseases. I’ve seen them before.” The Holter shows only 2% of all any beats are ectopics, with a few runs of tachycardia and only a single couplet. “Bigeminy often, but that’s a normal heartbeat for some people. YOU JUST FEEL EVERYTHING.” I ask him if I can go off the daily 325 aspirin, he says yes. I ask him if the surgery was a failure. He nods, “It appears so. But we’re going to start you on a new beta blocker, works for 25% of people. Later we’ll add flecanide, which will bring it up in the range of 65%.” I’m willing to do anything at this point. “And if that doesn’t work, we’ll return to ablation.” I have a plan. After a month of this mess, I’m more content that my new life is living with my arrhythmia this is the new normal, and it won’t kill me. THE NEXT DAY: I went off aspirin that day, which was 5 days ago, and something strange happened. I woke up the next morning, and I wasn’t in bigeminy. In fact, I wasn’t throwing any beats at all. I was cautious. I told no one. I worried that my blood was thickening, that het real healing had begun, the burn was clotting, and now I would have a stroke. I called the center. They assured me I was fine. Nothing in my history put me in the usual cautious category for a stroke. I went and did my own research, as many of you will running through the “Conclusions” section of NIH studies to see just how many people die of stroke after ablations. The truth? A very low number, much less than 1%, have strokes following ablations. They tend to be much much older than I. How many of those who have strokes die? Less than 5% of 1%. So I could have a stroke and still live? Didn’t even occur to me. FIVE DAYS LATER I’ve had 12 skipped beats in 5 days. One of them threw my heart rate slightly higher. I haven’t been in bigeminy once. I’ve been walking miles in 90 degree New York City heat every day of the week to test my luck and push myself. I’m pushing all my buttons. I want to make sure my heart knows what I’m planning to do with it. The PVCs and PACs aren’t gone, there’s just a lot fewer of them. Did the procedure work, or did I just past through another storm? I have no idea, but this shows me that I’ll have good days. It’s important to LIVE INSIDE your good days, and PUSH THROUGH the bad. I’m a scaredy cat, a worry wart, a very anxious person. I’m surviving. You will too. 7 likes, 18 replies "

New poster, long time lurker. Thanks to all of you for sharing your stories over the years! I spent years Googling PVCs, PACs, and arrhythmia after I began experiencing them 8 years ago. I can feel each thump, each bump, each bigemic run. I have worn more Holter monitors than most, been to the ER over 50 times, had over 100 EKGs (ECG’s), 3 MRIs, the whole works. Over 6% of my heartbeats were ectopic. So I decided to finally have a cardiac ablation, and I wanted to write to everyone considering an ablation, those who live with this hellish problem doctors rarely take seriously and few ways to treat, much less cure, in order to give back to the community that helped me in the hardest times when I was in bigeminy and couplets and SVT, laying on my couch waiting to die. First: PVCs and PACs in a otherwise healthy heart won’t kill you they just will not. I’ve spoken to 30 docs at some of the best hospitals in the country. They won’t. Sometimes very rarely they spin out into other issues that feel worse and if left untreated can be harmful. If your heart rate spins over 170 for more than a couple hours, go to an ER. If over 200 for more than a couple minutes, go to an ER. The other super scary VFIb sudden death stuff if it’s not in your family history, or you haven’t just had a massive heart attack with electrical complications, it’s not going to happen to you. It just isn’t. You’re fine. It just sucks. Calm down. Now is the time to be decisive. You can drive, eat, exercise (it sucks but I did it all the time), go for walks with your family, go on vacation. Everything. Staying inside won’t help the PACs or PVCs. Staying inside just lets you listen for them and curl up. Staying inside is actually worse for your health, in the long term. But you get to decide how you live your life. Me? Some days I stayed in, when I was in constant bigeminy. Other days I went out until I couldn’t take it anymore. But when I was out, I often forgot about them. I saw people and lived a life. Second: No amount of drugs helped my skipped beats. Not fish oil, not four different types of magnesium, not beta blockers, not calcium blockers, not potassium, not COQ-10, not anything. What helped? Good sleep, hydration, exercise, walking. But mostly, a deep desire to stop letting them run my life. They’re terrible. I hate them. I pushed through them. You can too. There are hundreds of millions of people with skipped beats almost all of us, according to reports and some people don’t go outside because of them and some people run in the Olympics. You get to choose. I would go for weeks without skipped beats sometime. Months even. They always returned. I got what I call storms for weeks, endless skipped beats. Dark days. But I pushed through. THE ABLATION: This is a no BS zone. I put off the ablation twice before I finally got it because I was nervous about someone burning my heart. I’d spent hours online reading the pros and cons. I read the possibilities of stroke and zapping through my heart. I scanned through all the success stories to read about people on their 3rd ablation. I talked to two friends who had ablations for A-fib. I worried about having a stroke, reacting to drugs, etc. Then came a particularly bad storm, and I told my wife, “Remind me of how I felt during this moment if I say I’m going to put off the surgery again.” She did. I prepared for the appointment. Preparation: I didn’t eat after midnight. I took a shower. I drank coffee, because I wanted those little b******s to start popping first thing, so they could detect them. Went to bed late, 2 am, because that always brings them on. I was calling down the storm. The hospital: Got there at 5 AM. Yes, that early. They took 8 of us in at once. I got into a gown. They shaved my pubes and nipple hair and around my kidneys. But guess what? I wasn’t having A SINGLE SKIPPED BEAT. I got nervous, did pushups, ran down the hall, went to the bathroom to hop up and down. Nothing. If they couldn’t detect a skipped beat, they couldn’t burn. I would have to go through the whole recovery with nothing changed. I was wheeled into the frigidly cold room 5 hours later. Three attendant nurses were there with the anesthesiologist. My electrophysiologist, who would be preforming the surgery, hadn’t arrived yet. He’d promised me they’d shoot me up with drugs that would make my arrhythmia start up before they went in, but that didn’t happen. I asked them not to put me completely out, because I had a cousin die at the dentist under anesthesia. They said they wouldn’t. I was out like a light within 2 minutes of being in the room. Fentanyl. Before falling asleep the ceiling was crawling in waves. I woke up just as they were applying pressure to the insertion site. I felt them suturing the wound with a single stitch. They told me not to move. They said they were able to get some bad beats and made the burn. I was elated. Then they shot me up with fentanyl, a massive 100 mcg dose that shocked the docs I spoke to in the room they kept me for 4 hours, to make sure there weren’t any complications. In the waiting area I experienced skipped beats, which were normal. My heart felt like it was being squeezed, but the docs were right there & I was hooked up to monitors. Chest pain, wonked out on drugs, desperate. 5 hours later I was released. I got a car with my wife and headed home. FIRST WEEK: You are now 90 years old. For 3 days, you will not be able to walk across the room without getting winded. You will have a giant knot in an uncomfortable place, several knots even, that you will monitor to make sure it doesn’t get bigger than a walnut. One doc told me a “fist.” The bruising will be nasty and run a bit down your leg, all over the place. You will believe you’re hemorrhaging but probably aren’t. You will be dizzy, anxious, nauseous maybe, and sore at the spot. This is normal. But I called the hospital at least 8 times making sure I wasn’t dying. Your heart rate will go 10 points above normal for the next 3 weeks, by the way (nobody told me this it’s known). You need somebody to take care of you the first week. Docs might say you can go back to work after a week. NO YOU CANNOT! You need to take 3 weeks off work, minimum. Sorry, minimum. My mother came up to be with us. I could barely walk to the bathroom to pee, and I only showered once during the first week. Lay down, cue up Netflix, have someone make you food. SECOND WEEK: I’m in bigeminy. I’ll be in bigeminy a lot for the next 4 weeks. I’ve read that it takes 3 months for the heart to heal, but I pulled by EP aside and told him to level with me. He said if nothing changes within the first 6 weeks, the procedure was most likely a failure. I have an Alivcor single-lead strip (INVEST IN THIS) that shows I’m not only throwing PACs and PVCs, and in bigeminy A LOT, but that I’ve DEVELOPED A NEW PVC SPOT!

But when I was out, I often forgot about them. I saw people and lived a life. Second: No amount of drugs helped my skipped beats. Not fish oil, not four different types of magnesium, not beta blockers, not calcium blockers, not potassium, not COQ-10, not anything. What helped? Good sleep, hydration, exercise, walking. But mostly, a deep desire to stop letting them run my life. They’re terrible. I hate them. I pushed through them. You can too. There are hundreds of millions of people with skipped beats almost all of us, according to reports and some people don’t go outside because of them and some people run in the Olympics. You get to choose. I would go for weeks without skipped beats sometime. Months even. They always returned. I got what I call storms for weeks, endless skipped beats. Dark days. But I pushed through. THE ABLATION: This is a no BS zone. I put off the ablation twice before I finally got it because I was nervous about someone burning my heart. I’d spent hours online reading the pros and cons. I read the possibilities of stroke and zapping through my heart. I scanned through all the success stories to read about people on their 3rd ablation. I talked to two friends who had ablations for A-fib. I worried about having a stroke, reacting to drugs, etc. Then came a particularly bad storm, and I told my wife, “Remind me of how I felt during this moment if I say I’m going to put off the surgery again.” She did. I prepared for the appointment. Preparation: I didn’t eat after midnight. I took a shower. I drank coffee, because I wanted those little b******s to start popping first thing, so they could detect them. Went to bed late, 2 am, because that always brings them on. I was calling down the storm. The hospital: Got there at 5 AM. Yes, that early. They took 8 of us in at once. I got into a gown. They shaved my pubes and nipple hair and around my kidneys. But guess what? I wasn’t having A SINGLE SKIPPED BEAT. I got nervous, did pushups, ran down the hall, went to the bathroom to hop up and down. Nothing. If they couldn’t detect a skipped beat, they couldn’t burn. I would have to go through the whole recovery with nothing changed. I was wheeled into the frigidly cold room 5 hours later. Three attendant nurses were there with the anesthesiologist. My electrophysiologist, who would be preforming the surgery, hadn’t arrived yet. He’d promised me they’d shoot me up with drugs that would make my arrhythmia start up before they went in, but that didn’t happen. I asked them not to put me completely out, because I had a cousin die at the dentist under anesthesia. They said they wouldn’t. I was out like a light within 2 minutes of being in the room. Fentanyl. Before falling asleep the ceiling was crawling in waves. I woke up just as they were applying pressure to the insertion site. I felt them suturing the wound with a single stitch. They told me not to move. They said they were able to get some bad beats and made the burn. I was elated. Then they shot me up with fentanyl, a massive 100 mcg dose that shocked the docs I spoke to in the room they kept me for 4 hours, to make sure there weren’t any complications. In the waiting area I experienced skipped beats, which were normal. My heart felt like it was being squeezed, but the docs were right there & I was hooked up to monitors. Chest pain, wonked out on drugs, desperate. 5 hours later I was released. I got a car with my wife and headed home. FIRST WEEK: You are now 90 years old. For 3 days, you will not be able to walk across the room without getting winded. You will have a giant knot in an uncomfortable place, several knots even, that you will monitor to make sure it doesn’t get bigger than a walnut. One doc told me a “fist.” The bruising will be nasty and run a bit down your leg, all over the place. You will believe you’re hemorrhaging but probably aren’t. You will be dizzy, anxious, nauseous maybe, and sore at the spot. This is normal. But I called the hospital at least 8 times making sure I wasn’t dying. Your heart rate will go 10 points above normal for the next 3 weeks, by the way (nobody told me this it’s known). You need somebody to take care of you the first week. Docs might say you can go back to work after a week. NO YOU CANNOT! You need to take 3 weeks off work, minimum. Sorry, minimum. My mother came up to be with us. I could barely walk to the bathroom to pee, and I only showered once during the first week. Lay down, cue up Netflix, have someone make you food. SECOND WEEK: I’m in bigeminy. I’ll be in bigeminy a lot for the next 4 weeks. I’ve read that it takes 3 months for the heart to heal, but I pulled by EP aside and told him to level with me. He said if nothing changes within the first 6 weeks, the procedure was most likely a failure. I have an Alivcor single-lead strip (INVEST IN THIS) that shows I’m not only throwing PACs and PVCs, and in bigeminy A LOT, but that I’ve DEVELOPED A NEW PVC SPOT! I go to my appointment at the Heart Rhythm Center. I show a PDF of the strip to my EP, who confirmed the new spot. “This wasn’t there before, I was unifocal,” I said. He shrugged. “That’s definitely a different spot. This will make another surgery a bit more difficult.” “Did the new scarring cause this?” I asked. “No, it’s in a different part of the heart.” They put me on a 24-hr Holter. I’m now playing Wii Golf for exercise. I cannot lift anything heavy, and shouldn’t try. I’m writing horror stories on my laptop and watching all the old Ingmar Bergman films I missed. There are 60 but I have time now. I cancel all plans for the month. This is my life now. I have to heal. I have to make my life about me for now. THIRD WEEK: Bigeminy, skipped beats, and while I’m sitting on the couch, my heart rate flies to 170 beats per minute. Is it SVT, which is harmless but terrifying, or VT (V-tach), which is deadly? I call the hospital hotline but the on-call doc says they can’t tell unless they catch it on the strip. “Try to catch the next one.” So I do. It happens again 3 days later. Sinus tachycardia, they say. 120 bpm lying down. “It went to 170 last time,” I say. They shrug. “Is this related to the burn?” “No,” they say, it’s the PVCs and PACs throwing it into an abnormal rhythm. I’m exercising more, Wii Golf. I’m afraid now I will simply drop dead. I have made a huge mistake doing this to my heart. I have hurt my wife by becoming a burden to her. I am terrified. I schedule another appointment with my EP, and wait a terribly long weekend in bed with my heart going crazy. FOURTH WEEK: I meet with my EP first thing on Monday. He assures me I’m not going to go into VT, that it’s incredibly rare in someone my age (42), much less in someone without other preexisting conditions. I cannot believe him. “How rare?” “You’re not showing any of the common morphology for any of these diseases. I’ve seen them before.” The Holter shows only 2% of all any beats are ectopics, with a few runs of tachycardia and only a single couplet. “Bigeminy often, but that’s a normal heartbeat for some people. YOU JUST FEEL EVERYTHING.” I ask him if I can go off the daily 325 aspirin, he says yes. I ask him if the surgery was a failure. He nods, “It appears so. But we’re going to start you on a new beta blocker, works for 25% of people. Later we’ll add flecanide, which will bring it up in the range of 65%.” I’m willing to do anything at this point. “And if that doesn’t work, we’ll return to ablation.” I have a plan. After a month of this mess, I’m more content that my new life is living with my arrhythmia this is the new normal, and it won’t kill me. THE NEXT DAY: I went off aspirin that day, which was 5 days ago, and something strange happened. I woke up the next morning, and I wasn’t in bigeminy. In fact, I wasn’t throwing any beats at all. I was cautious. I told no one. I worried that my blood was thickening, that het real healing had begun, the burn was clotting, and now I would have a stroke. I called the center. They assured me I was fine. Nothing in my history put me in the usual cautious category for a stroke. I went and did my own research, as many of you will running through the “Conclusions” section of NIH studies to see just how many people die of stroke after ablations. The truth? A very low number, much less than 1%, have strokes following ablations. They tend to be much much older than I. How many of those who have strokes die? Less than 5% of 1%. So I could have a stroke and still live? Didn’t even occur to me. FIVE DAYS LATER I’ve had 12 skipped beats in 5 days. One of them threw my heart rate slightly higher. I haven’t been in bigeminy once. I’ve been walking miles in 90 degree New York City heat every day of the week to test my luck and push myself. I’m pushing all my buttons. I want to make sure my heart knows what I’m planning to do with it. The PVCs and PACs aren’t gone, there’s just a lot fewer of them. Did the procedure work, or did I just past through another storm? I have no idea, but this shows me that I’ll have good days. It’s important to LIVE INSIDE your good days, and PUSH THROUGH the bad. I’m a scaredy cat, a worry wart, a very anxious person. I’m surviving. You will too. 7 likes, 18 replies "

New poster, long time lurker. Thanks to all of you for sharing your stories over the years! I spent years Googling PVCs, PACs, and arrhythmia after I began experiencing them 8 years ago. I can feel each thump, each bump, each bigemic run. I have worn more Holter monitors than most, been to the ER over 50 times, had over 100 EKGs (ECG’s), 3 MRIs, the whole works. Over 6% of my heartbeats were ectopic. So I decided to finally have a cardiac ablation, and I wanted to write to everyone considering an ablation, those who live with this hellish problem doctors rarely take seriously and few ways to treat, much less cure, in order to give back to the community that helped me in the hardest times when I was in bigeminy and couplets and SVT, laying on my couch waiting to die. First: PVCs and PACs in a otherwise healthy heart won’t kill you they just will not. I’ve spoken to 30 docs at some of the best hospitals in the country. They won’t. Sometimes very rarely they spin out into other issues that feel worse and if left untreated can be harmful. If your heart rate spins over 170 for more than a couple hours, go to an ER. If over 200 for more than a couple minutes, go to an ER. The other super scary VFIb sudden death stuff if it’s not in your family history, or you haven’t just had a massive heart attack with electrical complications, it’s not going to happen to you. It just isn’t. You’re fine. It just sucks. Calm down. Now is the time to be decisive. You can drive, eat, exercise (it sucks but I did it all the time), go for walks with your family, go on vacation. Everything. Staying inside won’t help the PACs or PVCs. Staying inside just lets you listen for them and curl up. Staying inside is actually worse for your health, in the long term. But you get to decide how you live your life. Me? Some days I stayed in, when I was in constant bigeminy. Other days I went out until I couldn’t take it anymore.

YOU JUST FEEL EVERYTHING.” I ask him if I can go off the daily 325 aspirin, he says yes. I ask him if the surgery was a failure. He nods, “It appears so. But we’re going to start you on a new beta blocker, works for 25% of people. Later we’ll add flecanide, which will bring it up in the range of 65%.” I’m willing to do anything at this point. “And if that doesn’t work, we’ll return to ablation.” I have a plan. After a month of this mess, I’m more content that my new life is living with my arrhythmia this is the new normal, and it won’t kill me. THE NEXT DAY: I went off aspirin that day, which was 5 days ago, and something strange happened. I woke up the next morning, and I wasn’t in bigeminy. In fact, I wasn’t throwing any beats at all. I was cautious. I told no one. I worried that my blood was thickening, that het real healing had begun, the burn was clotting, and now I would have a stroke. I called the center. They assured me I was fine. Nothing in my history put me in the usual cautious category for a stroke. I went and did my own research, as many of you will running through the “Conclusions” section of NIH studies to see just how many people die of stroke after ablations. The truth? A very low number, much less than 1%, have strokes following ablations. They tend to be much much older than I. How many of those who have strokes die? Less than 5% of 1%. So I could have a stroke and still live? Didn’t even occur to me. FIVE DAYS LATER I’ve had 12 skipped beats in 5 days. One of them threw my heart rate slightly higher. I haven’t been in bigeminy once. I’ve been walking miles in 90 degree New York City heat every day of the week to test my luck and push myself. I’m pushing all my buttons. I want to make sure my heart knows what I’m planning to do with it. The PVCs and PACs aren’t gone, there’s just a lot fewer of them. Did the procedure work, or did I just past through another storm? I have no idea, but this shows me that I’ll have good days. It’s important to LIVE INSIDE your good days, and PUSH THROUGH the bad. I’m a scaredy cat, a worry wart, a very anxious person. I’m surviving. You will too. 7 likes, 18 replies "

New poster, long time lurker. Thanks to all of you for sharing your stories over the years! I spent years Googling PVCs, PACs, and arrhythmia after I began experiencing them 8 years ago. I can feel each thump, each bump, each bigemic run. I have worn more Holter monitors than most, been to the ER over 50 times, had over 100 EKGs (ECG’s), 3 MRIs, the whole works. Over 6% of my heartbeats were ectopic. So I decided to finally have a cardiac ablation, and I wanted to write to everyone considering an ablation, those who live with this hellish problem doctors rarely take seriously and few ways to treat, much less cure, in order to give back to the community that helped me in the hardest times when I was in bigeminy and couplets and SVT, laying on my couch waiting to die. First: PVCs and PACs in a otherwise healthy heart won’t kill you they just will not. I’ve spoken to 30 docs at some of the best hospitals in the country. They won’t. Sometimes very rarely they spin out into other issues that feel worse and if left untreated can be harmful. If your heart rate spins over 170 for more than a couple hours, go to an ER. If over 200 for more than a couple minutes, go to an ER. The other super scary VFIb sudden death stuff if it’s not in your family history, or you haven’t just had a massive heart attack with electrical complications, it’s not going to happen to you. It just isn’t. You’re fine. It just sucks. Calm down. Now is the time to be decisive. You can drive, eat, exercise (it sucks but I did it all the time), go for walks with your family, go on vacation. Everything. Staying inside won’t help the PACs or PVCs. Staying inside just lets you listen for them and curl up. Staying inside is actually worse for your health, in the long term. But you get to decide how you live your life. Me? Some days I stayed in, when I was in constant bigeminy. Other days I went out until I couldn’t take it anymore. But when I was out, I often forgot about them. I saw people and lived a life. Second: No amount of drugs helped my skipped beats. Not fish oil, not four different types of magnesium, not beta blockers, not calcium blockers, not potassium, not COQ-10, not anything. What helped? Good sleep, hydration, exercise, walking. But mostly, a deep desire to stop letting them run my life. They’re terrible. I hate them. I pushed through them. You can too. There are hundreds of millions of people with skipped beats almost all of us, according to reports and some people don’t go outside because of them and some people run in the Olympics. You get to choose. I would go for weeks without skipped beats sometime. Months even. They always returned. I got what I call storms for weeks, endless skipped beats. Dark days. But I pushed through. THE ABLATION: This is a no BS zone. I put off the ablation twice before I finally got it because I was nervous about someone burning my heart. I’d spent hours online reading the pros and cons. I read the possibilities of stroke and zapping through my heart. I scanned through all the success stories to read about people on their 3rd ablation. I talked to two friends who had ablations for A-fib. I worried about having a stroke, reacting to drugs, etc. Then came a particularly bad storm, and I told my wife, “Remind me of how I felt during this moment if I say I’m going to put off the surgery again.” She did. I prepared for the appointment. Preparation: I didn’t eat after midnight. I took a shower. I drank coffee, because I wanted those little b******s to start popping first thing, so they could detect them. Went to bed late, 2 am, because that always brings them on. I was calling down the storm. The hospital: Got there at 5 AM. Yes, that early. They took 8 of us in at once. I got into a gown. They shaved my pubes and nipple hair and around my kidneys. But guess what? I wasn’t having A SINGLE SKIPPED BEAT. I got nervous, did pushups, ran down the hall, went to the bathroom to hop up and down. Nothing. If they couldn’t detect a skipped beat, they couldn’t burn. I would have to go through the whole recovery with nothing changed. I was wheeled into the frigidly cold room 5 hours later. Three attendant nurses were there with the anesthesiologist. My electrophysiologist, who would be preforming the surgery, hadn’t arrived yet. He’d promised me they’d shoot me up with drugs that would make my arrhythmia start up before they went in, but that didn’t happen. I asked them not to put me completely out, because I had a cousin die at the dentist under anesthesia. They said they wouldn’t. I was out like a light within 2 minutes of being in the room. Fentanyl. Before falling asleep the ceiling was crawling in waves. I woke up just as they were applying pressure to the insertion site. I felt them suturing the wound with a single stitch. They told me not to move. They said they were able to get some bad beats and made the burn. I was elated. Then they shot me up with fentanyl, a massive 100 mcg dose that shocked the docs I spoke to in the room they kept me for 4 hours, to make sure there weren’t any complications. In the waiting area I experienced skipped beats, which were normal. My heart felt like it was being squeezed, but the docs were right there & I was hooked up to monitors. Chest pain, wonked out on drugs, desperate. 5 hours later I was released. I got a car with my wife and headed home. FIRST WEEK: You are now 90 years old. For 3 days, you will not be able to walk across the room without getting winded. You will have a giant knot in an uncomfortable place, several knots even, that you will monitor to make sure it doesn’t get bigger than a walnut. One doc told me a “fist.” The bruising will be nasty and run a bit down your leg, all over the place. You will believe you’re hemorrhaging but probably aren’t. You will be dizzy, anxious, nauseous maybe, and sore at the spot. This is normal. But I called the hospital at least 8 times making sure I wasn’t dying. Your heart rate will go 10 points above normal for the next 3 weeks, by the way (nobody told me this it’s known). You need somebody to take care of you the first week. Docs might say you can go back to work after a week. NO YOU CANNOT! You need to take 3 weeks off work, minimum. Sorry, minimum. My mother came up to be with us. I could barely walk to the bathroom to pee, and I only showered once during the first week. Lay down, cue up Netflix, have someone make you food. SECOND WEEK: I’m in bigeminy. I’ll be in bigeminy a lot for the next 4 weeks. I’ve read that it takes 3 months for the heart to heal, but I pulled by EP aside and told him to level with me. He said if nothing changes within the first 6 weeks, the procedure was most likely a failure. I have an Alivcor single-lead strip (INVEST IN THIS) that shows I’m not only throwing PACs and PVCs, and in bigeminy A LOT, but that I’ve DEVELOPED A NEW PVC SPOT! I go to my appointment at the Heart Rhythm Center. I show a PDF of the strip to my EP, who confirmed the new spot. “This wasn’t there before, I was unifocal,” I said. He shrugged. “That’s definitely a different spot. This will make another surgery a bit more difficult.” “Did the new scarring cause this?” I asked. “No, it’s in a different part of the heart.” They put me on a 24-hr Holter. I’m now playing Wii Golf for exercise. I cannot lift anything heavy, and shouldn’t try. I’m writing horror stories on my laptop and watching all the old Ingmar Bergman films I missed. There are 60 but I have time now. I cancel all plans for the month. This is my life now. I have to heal. I have to make my life about me for now. THIRD WEEK: Bigeminy, skipped beats, and while I’m sitting on the couch, my heart rate flies to 170 beats per minute. Is it SVT, which is harmless but terrifying, or VT (V-tach), which is deadly? I call the hospital hotline but the on-call doc says they can’t tell unless they catch it on the strip. “Try to catch the next one.” So I do. It happens again 3 days later. Sinus tachycardia, they say. 120 bpm lying down. “It went to 170 last time,” I say. They shrug. “Is this related to the burn?” “No,” they say, it’s the PVCs and PACs throwing it into an abnormal rhythm. I’m exercising more, Wii Golf. I’m afraid now I will simply drop dead. I have made a huge mistake doing this to my heart. I have hurt my wife by becoming a burden to her. I am terrified. I schedule another appointment with my EP, and wait a terribly long weekend in bed with my heart going crazy. FOURTH WEEK: I meet with my EP first thing on Monday. He assures me I’m not going to go into VT, that it’s incredibly rare in someone my age (42), much less in someone without other preexisting conditions. I cannot believe him. “How rare?” “You’re not showing any of the common morphology for any of these diseases. I’ve seen them before.” The Holter shows only 2% of all any beats are ectopics, with a few runs of tachycardia and only a single couplet. “Bigeminy often, but that’s a normal heartbeat for some people. YOU JUST FEEL EVERYTHING.” I ask him if I can go off the daily 325 aspirin, he says yes. I ask him if the surgery was a failure. He nods, “It appears so.

Three attendant nurses were there with the anesthesiologist. My electrophysiologist, who would be preforming the surgery, hadn’t arrived yet. He’d promised me they’d shoot me up with drugs that would make my arrhythmia start up before they went in, but that didn’t happen. I asked them not to put me completely out, because I had a cousin die at the dentist under anesthesia. They said they wouldn’t. I was out like a light within 2 minutes of being in the room. Fentanyl. Before falling asleep the ceiling was crawling in waves. I woke up just as they were applying pressure to the insertion site. I felt them suturing the wound with a single stitch. They told me not to move. They said they were able to get some bad beats and made the burn. I was elated. Then they shot me up with fentanyl, a massive 100 mcg dose that shocked the docs I spoke to in the room they kept me for 4 hours, to make sure there weren’t any complications. In the waiting area I experienced skipped beats, which were normal. My heart felt like it was being squeezed, but the docs were right there & I was hooked up to monitors. Chest pain, wonked out on drugs, desperate. 5 hours later I was released. I got a car with my wife and headed home. FIRST WEEK: You are now 90 years old. For 3 days, you will not be able to walk across the room without getting winded. You will have a giant knot in an uncomfortable place, several knots even, that you will monitor to make sure it doesn’t get bigger than a walnut. One doc told me a “fist.” The bruising will be nasty and run a bit down your leg, all over the place. You will believe you’re hemorrhaging but probably aren’t. You will be dizzy, anxious, nauseous maybe, and sore at the spot. This is normal. But I called the hospital at least 8 times making sure I wasn’t dying. Your heart rate will go 10 points above normal for the next 3 weeks, by the way (nobody told me this it’s known). You need somebody to take care of you the first week. Docs might say you can go back to work after a week. NO YOU CANNOT! You need to take 3 weeks off work, minimum. Sorry, minimum. My mother came up to be with us. I could barely walk to the bathroom to pee, and I only showered once during the first week. Lay down, cue up Netflix, have someone make you food. SECOND WEEK: I’m in bigeminy. I’ll be in bigeminy a lot for the next 4 weeks. I’ve read that it takes 3 months for the heart to heal, but I pulled by EP aside and told him to level with me. He said if nothing changes within the first 6 weeks, the procedure was most likely a failure. I have an Alivcor single-lead strip (INVEST IN THIS) that shows I’m not only throwing PACs and PVCs, and in bigeminy A LOT, but that I’ve DEVELOPED A NEW PVC SPOT! I go to my appointment at the Heart Rhythm Center. I show a PDF of the strip to my EP, who confirmed the new spot. “This wasn’t there before, I was unifocal,” I said. He shrugged. “That’s definitely a different spot. This will make another surgery a bit more difficult.” “Did the new scarring cause this?” I asked. “No, it’s in a different part of the heart.” They put me on a 24-hr Holter. I’m now playing Wii Golf for exercise. I cannot lift anything heavy, and shouldn’t try. I’m writing horror stories on my laptop and watching all the old Ingmar Bergman films I missed. There are 60 but I have time now. I cancel all plans for the month. This is my life now. I have to heal. I have to make my life about me for now. THIRD WEEK: Bigeminy, skipped beats, and while I’m sitting on the couch, my heart rate flies to 170 beats per minute. Is it SVT, which is harmless but terrifying, or VT (V-tach), which is deadly? I call the hospital hotline but the on-call doc says they can’t tell unless they catch it on the strip. “Try to catch the next one.” So I do. It happens again 3 days later. Sinus tachycardia, they say. 120 bpm lying down. “It went to 170 last time,” I say. They shrug. “Is this related to the burn?” “No,” they say, it’s the PVCs and PACs throwing it into an abnormal rhythm. I’m exercising more, Wii Golf. I’m afraid now I will simply drop dead. I have made a huge mistake doing this to my heart. I have hurt my wife by becoming a burden to her. I am terrified. I schedule another appointment with my EP, and wait a terribly long weekend in bed with my heart going crazy. FOURTH WEEK: I meet with my EP first thing on Monday. He assures me I’m not going to go into VT, that it’s incredibly rare in someone my age (42), much less in someone without other preexisting conditions. I cannot believe him. “How rare?” “You’re not showing any of the common morphology for any of these diseases. I’ve seen them before.” The Holter shows only 2% of all any beats are ectopics, with a few runs of tachycardia and only a single couplet. “Bigeminy often, but that’s a normal heartbeat for some people. YOU JUST FEEL EVERYTHING.” I ask him if I can go off the daily 325 aspirin, he says yes. I ask him if the surgery was a failure. He nods, “It appears so. But we’re going to start you on a new beta blocker, works for 25% of people. Later we’ll add flecanide, which will bring it up in the range of 65%.” I’m willing to do anything at this point. “And if that doesn’t work, we’ll return to ablation.” I have a plan. After a month of this mess, I’m more content that my new life is living with my arrhythmia this is the new normal, and it won’t kill me. THE NEXT DAY: I went off aspirin that day, which was 5 days ago, and something strange happened. I woke up the next morning, and I wasn’t in bigeminy. In fact, I wasn’t throwing any beats at all. I was cautious. I told no one. I worried that my blood was thickening, that het real healing had begun, the burn was clotting, and now I would have a stroke. I called the center. They assured me I was fine. Nothing in my history put me in the usual cautious category for a stroke. I went and did my own research, as many of you will running through the “Conclusions” section of NIH studies to see just how many people die of stroke after ablations. The truth? A very low number, much less than 1%, have strokes following ablations. They tend to be much much older than I. How many of those who have strokes die? Less than 5% of 1%. So I could have a stroke and still live? Didn’t even occur to me. FIVE DAYS LATER I’ve had 12 skipped beats in 5 days. One of them threw my heart rate slightly higher. I haven’t been in bigeminy once. I’ve been walking miles in 90 degree New York City heat every day of the week to test my luck and push myself. I’m pushing all my buttons. I want to make sure my heart knows what I’m planning to do with it. The PVCs and PACs aren’t gone, there’s just a lot fewer of them. Did the procedure work, or did I just past through another storm? I have no idea, but this shows me that I’ll have good days. It’s important to LIVE INSIDE your good days, and PUSH THROUGH the bad. I’m a scaredy cat, a worry wart, a very anxious person. I’m surviving. You will too. 7 likes, 18 replies "

New poster, long time lurker. Thanks to all of you for sharing your stories over the years! I spent years Googling PVCs, PACs, and arrhythmia after I began experiencing them 8 years ago. I can feel each thump, each bump, each bigemic run. I have worn more Holter monitors than most, been to the ER over 50 times, had over 100 EKGs (ECG’s), 3 MRIs, the whole works. Over 6% of my heartbeats were ectopic. So I decided to finally have a cardiac ablation, and I wanted to write to everyone considering an ablation, those who live with this hellish problem doctors rarely take seriously and few ways to treat, much less cure, in order to give back to the community that helped me in the hardest times when I was in bigeminy and couplets and SVT, laying on my couch waiting to die. First: PVCs and PACs in a otherwise healthy heart won’t kill you they just will not. I’ve spoken to 30 docs at some of the best hospitals in the country. They won’t. Sometimes very rarely they spin out into other issues that feel worse and if left untreated can be harmful. If your heart rate spins over 170 for more than a couple hours, go to an ER. If over 200 for more than a couple minutes, go to an ER. The other super scary VFIb sudden death stuff if it’s not in your family history, or you haven’t just had a massive heart attack with electrical complications, it’s not going to happen to you. It just isn’t. You’re fine. It just sucks. Calm down. Now is the time to be decisive. You can drive, eat, exercise (it sucks but I did it all the time), go for walks with your family, go on vacation. Everything. Staying inside won’t help the PACs or PVCs. Staying inside just lets you listen for them and curl up. Staying inside is actually worse for your health, in the long term. But you get to decide how you live your life. Me? Some days I stayed in, when I was in constant bigeminy. Other days I went out until I couldn’t take it anymore. But when I was out, I often forgot about them. I saw people and lived a life. Second: No amount of drugs helped my skipped beats. Not fish oil, not four different types of magnesium, not beta blockers, not calcium blockers, not potassium, not COQ-10, not anything. What helped? Good sleep, hydration, exercise, walking. But mostly, a deep desire to stop letting them run my life. They’re terrible. I hate them. I pushed through them. You can too. There are hundreds of millions of people with skipped beats almost all of us, according to reports and some people don’t go outside because of them and some people run in the Olympics. You get to choose. I would go for weeks without skipped beats sometime. Months even. They always returned. I got what I call storms for weeks, endless skipped beats. Dark days. But I pushed through. THE ABLATION: This is a no BS zone. I put off the ablation twice before I finally got it because I was nervous about someone burning my heart. I’d spent hours online reading the pros and cons. I read the possibilities of stroke and zapping through my heart. I scanned through all the success stories to read about people on their 3rd ablation. I talked to two friends who had ablations for A-fib. I worried about having a stroke, reacting to drugs, etc. Then came a particularly bad storm, and I told my wife, “Remind me of how I felt during this moment if I say I’m going to put off the surgery again.” She did. I prepared for the appointment. Preparation: I didn’t eat after midnight. I took a shower. I drank coffee, because I wanted those little b******s to start popping first thing, so they could detect them. Went to bed late, 2 am, because that always brings them on. I was calling down the storm. The hospital: Got there at 5 AM. Yes, that early. They took 8 of us in at once. I got into a gown. They shaved my pubes and nipple hair and around my kidneys. But guess what? I wasn’t having A SINGLE SKIPPED BEAT. I got nervous, did pushups, ran down the hall, went to the bathroom to hop up and down. Nothing. If they couldn’t detect a skipped beat, they couldn’t burn. I would have to go through the whole recovery with nothing changed. I was wheeled into the frigidly cold room 5 hours later.

New poster, long time lurker. Thanks to all of you for sharing your stories over the years! I spent years Googling PVCs, PACs, and arrhythmia after I began experiencing them 8 years ago. I can feel each thump, each bump, each bigemic run. I have worn more Holter monitors than most, been to the ER over 50 times, had over 100 EKGs (ECG’s), 3 MRIs, the whole works. Over 6% of my heartbeats were ectopic. So I decided to finally have a cardiac ablation, and I wanted to write to everyone considering an ablation, those who live with this hellish problem doctors rarely take seriously and few ways to treat, much less cure, in order to give back to the community that helped me in the hardest times when I was in bigeminy and couplets and SVT, laying on my couch waiting to die. First: PVCs and PACs in a otherwise healthy heart won’t kill you they just will not. I’ve spoken to 30 docs at some of the best hospitals in the country. They won’t. Sometimes very rarely they spin out into other issues that feel worse and if left untreated can be harmful. If your heart rate spins over 170 for more than a couple hours, go to an ER. If over 200 for more than a couple minutes, go to an ER. The other super scary VFIb sudden death stuff if it’s not in your family history, or you haven’t just had a massive heart attack with electrical complications, it’s not going to happen to you. It just isn’t. You’re fine. It just sucks. Calm down. Now is the time to be decisive. You can drive, eat, exercise (it sucks but I did it all the time), go for walks with your family, go on vacation. Everything. Staying inside won’t help the PACs or PVCs. Staying inside just lets you listen for them and curl up. Staying inside is actually worse for your health, in the long term. But you get to decide how you live your life. Me? Some days I stayed in, when I was in constant bigeminy. Other days I went out until I couldn’t take it anymore. But when I was out, I often forgot about them. I saw people and lived a life. Second: No amount of drugs helped my skipped beats. Not fish oil, not four different types of magnesium, not beta blockers, not calcium blockers, not potassium, not COQ-10, not anything. What helped? Good sleep, hydration, exercise, walking. But mostly, a deep desire to stop letting them run my life. They’re terrible. I hate them. I pushed through them. You can too. There are hundreds of millions of people with skipped beats almost all of us, according to reports and some people don’t go outside because of them and some people run in the Olympics. You get to choose. I would go for weeks without skipped beats sometime. Months even. They always returned. I got what I call storms for weeks, endless skipped beats. Dark days. But I pushed through. THE ABLATION: This is a no BS zone. I put off the ablation twice before I finally got it because I was nervous about someone burning my heart. I’d spent hours online reading the pros and cons. I read the possibilities of stroke and zapping through my heart. I scanned through all the success stories to read about people on their 3rd ablation. I talked to two friends who had ablations for A-fib. I worried about having a stroke, reacting to drugs, etc. Then came a particularly bad storm, and I told my wife, “Remind me of how I felt during this moment if I say I’m going to put off the surgery again.” She did. I prepared for the appointment. Preparation: I didn’t eat after midnight. I took a shower. I drank coffee, because I wanted those little b******s to start popping first thing, so they could detect them. Went to bed late, 2 am, because that always brings them on. I was calling down the storm. The hospital: Got there at 5 AM. Yes, that early. They took 8 of us in at once. I got into a gown. They shaved my pubes and nipple hair and around my kidneys. But guess what? I wasn’t having A SINGLE SKIPPED BEAT. I got nervous, did pushups, ran down the hall, went to the bathroom to hop up and down. Nothing. If they couldn’t detect a skipped beat, they couldn’t burn. I would have to go through the whole recovery with nothing changed. I was wheeled into the frigidly cold room 5 hours later. Three attendant nurses were there with the anesthesiologist. My electrophysiologist, who would be preforming the surgery, hadn’t arrived yet. He’d promised me they’d shoot me up with drugs that would make my arrhythmia start up before they went in, but that didn’t happen. I asked them not to put me completely out, because I had a cousin die at the dentist under anesthesia. They said they wouldn’t. I was out like a light within 2 minutes of being in the room. Fentanyl. Before falling asleep the ceiling was crawling in waves. I woke up just as they were applying pressure to the insertion site. I felt them suturing the wound with a single stitch. They told me not to move. They said they were able to get some bad beats and made the burn. I was elated. Then they shot me up with fentanyl, a massive 100 mcg dose that shocked the docs I spoke to in the room they kept me for 4 hours, to make sure there weren’t any complications. In the waiting area I experienced skipped beats, which were normal. My heart felt like it was being squeezed, but the docs were right there & I was hooked up to monitors. Chest pain, wonked out on drugs, desperate. 5 hours later I was released. I got a car with my wife and headed home. FIRST WEEK: You are now 90 years old. For 3 days, you will not be able to walk across the room without getting winded. You will have a giant knot in an uncomfortable place, several knots even, that you will monitor to make sure it doesn’t get bigger than a walnut. One doc told me a “fist.” The bruising will be nasty and run a bit down your leg, all over the place. You will believe you’re hemorrhaging but probably aren’t. You will be dizzy, anxious, nauseous maybe, and sore at the spot. This is normal. But I called the hospital at least 8 times making sure I wasn’t dying. Your heart rate will go 10 points above normal for the next 3 weeks, by the way (nobody told me this it’s known). You need somebody to take care of you the first week. Docs might say you can go back to work after a week. NO YOU CANNOT! You need to take 3 weeks off work, minimum. Sorry, minimum. My mother came up to be with us. I could barely walk to the bathroom to pee, and I only showered once during the first week. Lay down, cue up Netflix, have someone make you food. SECOND WEEK: I’m in bigeminy. I’ll be in bigeminy a lot for the next 4 weeks. I’ve read that it takes 3 months for the heart to heal, but I pulled by EP aside and told him to level with me. He said if nothing changes within the first 6 weeks, the procedure was most likely a failure. I have an Alivcor single-lead strip (INVEST IN THIS) that shows I’m not only throwing PACs and PVCs, and in bigeminy A LOT, but that I’ve DEVELOPED A NEW PVC SPOT! I go to my appointment at the Heart Rhythm Center. I show a PDF of the strip to my EP, who confirmed the new spot. “This wasn’t there before, I was unifocal,” I said. He shrugged. “That’s definitely a different spot. This will make another surgery a bit more difficult.” “Did the new scarring cause this?” I asked. “No, it’s in a different part of the heart.” They put me on a 24-hr Holter. I’m now playing Wii Golf for exercise. I cannot lift anything heavy, and shouldn’t try. I’m writing horror stories on my laptop and watching all the old Ingmar Bergman films I missed. There are 60 but I have time now. I cancel all plans for the month. This is my life now. I have to heal. I have to make my life about me for now. THIRD WEEK: Bigeminy, skipped beats, and while I’m sitting on the couch, my heart rate flies to 170 beats per minute. Is it SVT, which is harmless but terrifying, or VT (V-tach), which is deadly? I call the hospital hotline but the on-call doc says they can’t tell unless they catch it on the strip. “Try to catch the next one.” So I do. It happens again 3 days later. Sinus tachycardia, they say. 120 bpm lying down. “It went to 170 last time,” I say. They shrug. “Is this related to the burn?” “No,” they say, it’s the PVCs and PACs throwing it into an abnormal rhythm. I’m exercising more, Wii Golf. I’m afraid now I will simply drop dead. I have made a huge mistake doing this to my heart. I have hurt my wife by becoming a burden to her. I am terrified. I schedule another appointment with my EP, and wait a terribly long weekend in bed with my heart going crazy. FOURTH WEEK: I meet with my EP first thing on Monday. He assures me I’m not going to go into VT, that it’s incredibly rare in someone my age (42), much less in someone without other preexisting conditions. I cannot believe him. “How rare?” “You’re not showing any of the common morphology for any of these diseases. I’ve seen them before.” The Holter shows only 2% of all any beats are ectopics, with a few runs of tachycardia and only a single couplet. “Bigeminy often, but that’s a normal heartbeat for some people. YOU JUST FEEL EVERYTHING.” I ask him if I can go off the daily 325 aspirin, he says yes. I ask him if the surgery was a failure. He nods, “It appears so. But we’re going to start you on a new beta blocker, works for 25% of people. Later we’ll add flecanide, which will bring it up in the range of 65%.” I’m willing to do anything at this point. “And if that doesn’t work, we’ll return to ablation.” I have a plan. After a month of this mess, I’m more content that my new life is living with my arrhythmia this is the new normal, and it won’t kill me. THE NEXT DAY: I went off aspirin that day, which was 5 days ago, and something strange happened. I woke up the next morning, and I wasn’t in bigeminy. In fact, I wasn’t throwing any beats at all. I was cautious. I told no one. I worried that my blood was thickening, that het real healing had begun, the burn was clotting, and now I would have a stroke. I called the center. They assured me I was fine. Nothing in my history put me in the usual cautious category for a stroke. I went and did my own research, as many of you will running through the “Conclusions” section of NIH studies to see just how many people die of stroke after ablations. The truth? A very low number, much less than 1%, have strokes following ablations. They tend to be much much older than I. How many of those who have strokes die? Less than 5% of 1%. So I could have a stroke and still live? Didn’t even occur to me. FIVE DAYS LATER I’ve had 12 skipped beats in 5 days. One of them threw my heart rate slightly higher. I haven’t been in bigeminy once. I’ve been walking miles in 90 degree New York City heat every day of the week to test my luck and push myself. I’m pushing all my buttons. I want to make sure my heart knows what I’m planning to do with it. The PVCs and PACs aren’t gone, there’s just a lot fewer of them. Did the procedure work, or did I just past through another storm? I have no idea, but this shows me that I’ll have good days. It’s important to LIVE INSIDE your good days, and PUSH THROUGH the bad. I’m a scaredy cat, a worry wart, a very anxious person. I’m surviving. You will too. 7 likes, 18 replies "

Docs might say you can go back to work after a week. NO YOU CANNOT! You need to take 3 weeks off work, minimum. Sorry, minimum. My mother came up to be with us. I could barely walk to the bathroom to pee, and I only showered once during the first week. Lay down, cue up Netflix, have someone make you food. SECOND WEEK: I’m in bigeminy. I’ll be in bigeminy a lot for the next 4 weeks. I’ve read that it takes 3 months for the heart to heal, but I pulled by EP aside and told him to level with me. He said if nothing changes within the first 6 weeks, the procedure was most likely a failure. I have an Alivcor single-lead strip (INVEST IN THIS) that shows I’m not only throwing PACs and PVCs, and in bigeminy A LOT, but that I’ve DEVELOPED A NEW PVC SPOT! I go to my appointment at the Heart Rhythm Center. I show a PDF of the strip to my EP, who confirmed the new spot. “This wasn’t there before, I was unifocal,” I said. He shrugged. “That’s definitely a different spot. This will make another surgery a bit more difficult.” “Did the new scarring cause this?” I asked. “No, it’s in a different part of the heart.” They put me on a 24-hr Holter. I’m now playing Wii Golf for exercise. I cannot lift anything heavy, and shouldn’t try. I’m writing horror stories on my laptop and watching all the old Ingmar Bergman films I missed. There are 60 but I have time now. I cancel all plans for the month. This is my life now. I have to heal. I have to make my life about me for now. THIRD WEEK: Bigeminy, skipped beats, and while I’m sitting on the couch, my heart rate flies to 170 beats per minute. Is it SVT, which is harmless but terrifying, or VT (V-tach), which is deadly? I call the hospital hotline but the on-call doc says they can’t tell unless they catch it on the strip. “Try to catch the next one.” So I do. It happens again 3 days later. Sinus tachycardia, they say. 120 bpm lying down. “It went to 170 last time,” I say. They shrug. “Is this related to the burn?” “No,” they say, it’s the PVCs and PACs throwing it into an abnormal rhythm. I’m exercising more, Wii Golf. I’m afraid now I will simply drop dead. I have made a huge mistake doing this to my heart. I have hurt my wife by becoming a burden to her. I am terrified. I schedule another appointment with my EP, and wait a terribly long weekend in bed with my heart going crazy. FOURTH WEEK: I meet with my EP first thing on Monday. He assures me I’m not going to go into VT, that it’s incredibly rare in someone my age (42), much less in someone without other preexisting conditions. I cannot believe him. “How rare?” “You’re not showing any of the common morphology for any of these diseases. I’ve seen them before.” The Holter shows only 2% of all any beats are ectopics, with a few runs of tachycardia and only a single couplet. “Bigeminy often, but that’s a normal heartbeat for some people. YOU JUST FEEL EVERYTHING.” I ask him if I can go off the daily 325 aspirin, he says yes. I ask him if the surgery was a failure. He nods, “It appears so. But we’re going to start you on a new beta blocker, works for 25% of people. Later we’ll add flecanide, which will bring it up in the range of 65%.” I’m willing to do anything at this point. “And if that doesn’t work, we’ll return to ablation.” I have a plan. After a month of this mess, I’m more content that my new life is living with my arrhythmia this is the new normal, and it won’t kill me. THE NEXT DAY: I went off aspirin that day, which was 5 days ago, and something strange happened. I woke up the next morning, and I wasn’t in bigeminy. In fact, I wasn’t throwing any beats at all. I was cautious. I told no one. I worried that my blood was thickening, that het real healing had begun, the burn was clotting, and now I would have a stroke. I called the center. They assured me I was fine. Nothing in my history put me in the usual cautious category for a stroke. I went and did my own research, as many of you will running through the “Conclusions” section of NIH studies to see just how many people die of stroke after ablations. The truth? A very low number, much less than 1%, have strokes following ablations. They tend to be much much older than I. How many of those who have strokes die? Less than 5% of 1%. So I could have a stroke and still live? Didn’t even occur to me. FIVE DAYS LATER I’ve had 12 skipped beats in 5 days. One of them threw my heart rate slightly higher. I haven’t been in bigeminy once. I’ve been walking miles in 90 degree New York City heat every day of the week to test my luck and push myself. I’m pushing all my buttons. I want to make sure my heart knows what I’m planning to do with it. The PVCs and PACs aren’t gone, there’s just a lot fewer of them. Did the procedure work, or did I just past through another storm? I have no idea, but this shows me that I’ll have good days. It’s important to LIVE INSIDE your good days, and PUSH THROUGH the bad. I’m a scaredy cat, a worry wart, a very anxious person. I’m surviving. You will too. 7 likes, 18 replies "

New poster, long time lurker. Thanks to all of you for sharing your stories over the years! I spent years Googling PVCs, PACs, and arrhythmia after I began experiencing them 8 years ago. I can feel each thump, each bump, each bigemic run. I have worn more Holter monitors than most, been to the ER over 50 times, had over 100 EKGs (ECG’s), 3 MRIs, the whole works. Over 6% of my heartbeats were ectopic. So I decided to finally have a cardiac ablation, and I wanted to write to everyone considering an ablation, those who live with this hellish problem doctors rarely take seriously and few ways to treat, much less cure, in order to give back to the community that helped me in the hardest times when I was in bigeminy and couplets and SVT, laying on my couch waiting to die. First: PVCs and PACs in a otherwise healthy heart won’t kill you they just will not. I’ve spoken to 30 docs at some of the best hospitals in the country. They won’t. Sometimes very rarely they spin out into other issues that feel worse and if left untreated can be harmful. If your heart rate spins over 170 for more than a couple hours, go to an ER. If over 200 for more than a couple minutes, go to an ER. The other super scary VFIb sudden death stuff if it’s not in your family history, or you haven’t just had a massive heart attack with electrical complications, it’s not going to happen to you. It just isn’t. You’re fine. It just sucks. Calm down. Now is the time to be decisive. You can drive, eat, exercise (it sucks but I did it all the time), go for walks with your family, go on vacation. Everything. Staying inside won’t help the PACs or PVCs. Staying inside just lets you listen for them and curl up. Staying inside is actually worse for your health, in the long term. But you get to decide how you live your life. Me? Some days I stayed in, when I was in constant bigeminy. Other days I went out until I couldn’t take it anymore. But when I was out, I often forgot about them. I saw people and lived a life. Second: No amount of drugs helped my skipped beats. Not fish oil, not four different types of magnesium, not beta blockers, not calcium blockers, not potassium, not COQ-10, not anything. What helped? Good sleep, hydration, exercise, walking. But mostly, a deep desire to stop letting them run my life. They’re terrible. I hate them. I pushed through them. You can too. There are hundreds of millions of people with skipped beats almost all of us, according to reports and some people don’t go outside because of them and some people run in the Olympics. You get to choose. I would go for weeks without skipped beats sometime. Months even. They always returned. I got what I call storms for weeks, endless skipped beats. Dark days. But I pushed through. THE ABLATION: This is a no BS zone. I put off the ablation twice before I finally got it because I was nervous about someone burning my heart. I’d spent hours online reading the pros and cons. I read the possibilities of stroke and zapping through my heart. I scanned through all the success stories to read about people on their 3rd ablation. I talked to two friends who had ablations for A-fib. I worried about having a stroke, reacting to drugs, etc. Then came a particularly bad storm, and I told my wife, “Remind me of how I felt during this moment if I say I’m going to put off the surgery again.” She did. I prepared for the appointment. Preparation: I didn’t eat after midnight. I took a shower. I drank coffee, because I wanted those little b******s to start popping first thing, so they could detect them. Went to bed late, 2 am, because that always brings them on. I was calling down the storm. The hospital: Got there at 5 AM. Yes, that early. They took 8 of us in at once. I got into a gown. They shaved my pubes and nipple hair and around my kidneys. But guess what? I wasn’t having A SINGLE SKIPPED BEAT. I got nervous, did pushups, ran down the hall, went to the bathroom to hop up and down. Nothing. If they couldn’t detect a skipped beat, they couldn’t burn. I would have to go through the whole recovery with nothing changed. I was wheeled into the frigidly cold room 5 hours later. Three attendant nurses were there with the anesthesiologist. My electrophysiologist, who would be preforming the surgery, hadn’t arrived yet. He’d promised me they’d shoot me up with drugs that would make my arrhythmia start up before they went in, but that didn’t happen. I asked them not to put me completely out, because I had a cousin die at the dentist under anesthesia. They said they wouldn’t. I was out like a light within 2 minutes of being in the room. Fentanyl. Before falling asleep the ceiling was crawling in waves. I woke up just as they were applying pressure to the insertion site. I felt them suturing the wound with a single stitch. They told me not to move. They said they were able to get some bad beats and made the burn. I was elated. Then they shot me up with fentanyl, a massive 100 mcg dose that shocked the docs I spoke to in the room they kept me for 4 hours, to make sure there weren’t any complications. In the waiting area I experienced skipped beats, which were normal. My heart felt like it was being squeezed, but the docs were right there & I was hooked up to monitors. Chest pain, wonked out on drugs, desperate. 5 hours later I was released. I got a car with my wife and headed home. FIRST WEEK: You are now 90 years old. For 3 days, you will not be able to walk across the room without getting winded. You will have a giant knot in an uncomfortable place, several knots even, that you will monitor to make sure it doesn’t get bigger than a walnut. One doc told me a “fist.” The bruising will be nasty and run a bit down your leg, all over the place. You will believe you’re hemorrhaging but probably aren’t. You will be dizzy, anxious, nauseous maybe, and sore at the spot. This is normal. But I called the hospital at least 8 times making sure I wasn’t dying. Your heart rate will go 10 points above normal for the next 3 weeks, by the way (nobody told me this it’s known). You need somebody to take care of you the first week.

I feel like it's more than likely just bad readings, and my anxiety getting to me, but I thought I would get some second opinions. 0 likes, 3 replies "

It felt similar to my usual breathlessness and through-a-straw type breathing that I usually get from my Asthma, except this time, my inhalers didn't do a thing to help me. I visited my usual Nurse at the Asthma Clinic and she noted that the cause couldn't be the Asthma as my sats were normal (sp02 98-100). I then went to my GP the next day only to be given the task of making a 2-week Peak Flow diary to fully rule out Asthma as the cause. Shortly after finishing the diary, I had to go to A&E as my Heart Rate has shot up to 130bpm and I found it difficult to breath. (No pain anywhere). They did the ECG. Everything was fine as far as they could see (by this point, all of my symptoms had started to calm down, typical!) They took a blood test and for the most part it was normal except for a High D-Dimer reading. They sent me home for the weekend as they felt it was safe for me to do so as there was no pain. I came back the following Monday for an X-Ray and a VQ Scan and I was told that there was nothing there to worry about. I was then discharged. I am now left with more questions than answers and not sure what to do. I still have the symptoms but now the Heart problem seems to have evolved into a consistent bounding in my chest which is unsettling to say the least! What should I do?

As I said before, I had this idea during a bad episode, having no other remedies that worked, I dove into the Ph world. Long story short, that morning I stopped ALL foods that were acidic and ONLY ate foods that were Alkaline. Within 6 hours my PVC's were down to 30 or so, AN HOUR, not minute.

I'm an 18 year old female, relatively healthy now but a bit unfit. I go out drinking maybe a couple/few times a month at best, last autumn/winter i had one cigarette a week and smoked socially but i stopped after a couple of months, because smoking is awful for health and i didnt want to become addicted. I also smoked marijuana a couple of times just to experiment, but stopped because my body reacted badly to it. so my issue is a bit complicated- for the past few months, ive been having two types of heart palpitations the first type im used to, as i get when im anxious about something. this type i can easily rationalise because i know its just stress causing it. the second type is what im concerned about. for some reason i'll randomly get a fast heartbeat, usually occuring when im resting, it'll start beating super fast and last for about 10 mins before it goes back to normal. Other symptoms that sometimes accompany this is slightly pulsating vision, but i dont tend to feel lightheaded or anything. The one measurement ive done during these palpitation was around 120-130bpms, BUT as i dont want to make myself anxious and in turn make them worse, I tend not to record them. i get this second type extremley intensley the day after drinking a alcohol. i get this as well after walking up stairs and doing physical activity but im pretty sure thats just me being unfit! due to other concerns with my health (i was having digestive issues as well as chest pain which i now put down to precordial catch syndrome as that pretty much makes sense), I've had two ECGs over the past few months, and both have been fine! i know this pretty much reassures it, but my concern is that these ECGs havent been done when im actually getting the palpitations, therefore I cant fully know what's going on when I get them. my main problem with going to the doctors is that i dont want to waste their time. due to my other previous issues, I don't want to look like im wasting the service, especially as i've already had two ECGs! also, im a uni student and my local GP service is awful. Appointments are usually two weeks at best and so i dont want to book one if its not worth it but at the same time dont want to ignore it if it is a problem! has anyone had a similar experience/ got some advice? thanks 0 likes, 3 replies "

But if I drink some extra water at night before sleeping (or eat some watery fruit), I absolutely DO wake up  after sleeping for 2-3 hours. Again, that's normal, I know. BUT... when i get up, pee and come back, my HEART starts PALPING, pulse is a bit high (90-100), and heart feels funny, uneasy. This goes for about 15-30 minutes so I can't fall asleep immediately. But after that, I can clearly sense that the heart feel comfortable again, no palps, it's calm, I can fall asleep. OTHER INFO:  No pain, no angina, no irregular pulse. I lift weights (intensely) 3-4 days/week so my BP/blood sugar is very normal at 115 over 65-70. My pulse is usually around in the high 70s to mid 80s during working hours, and low 70s when waking up. What could this be? Is it just the sudden getting up in the middle of sleeping that's making the heart race? Whom (IF) do I see since most Docs take BP and on seeing 110-115 and 60-70 and seeing that I am very fit otherwise, don't look that much in detail. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I thought it had to do with  , but it happens even when I'm perfectly calm, relaxed, or happy. Background: I'm a 21 year old female. I drink extremely rarely and exercise fairly rarely as well but walk every day and do work a sedentary job. Here is what I feel: -(happened once) I was getting up from sitting down alone, and I felt the craziest pressure in my entire chest. It was like the wind got knocked out of me and I couldn't breathe for about three seconds. Then my vision started to go back. Not spotty like when you get up too fast. It was slow and just darkness. -(happened once) not sure if it's related because I was very sick at the time. But I was in a room of people and started seeing black again. Then I couldn't hear, it felt like someone had their hands over my ears. I got really dizzy and then nauseous and then got actually sick to my stomach. -(happens often) I find myself often with an accelerated heart beat. Typically I when I measure it, it's between 100-140. During these times I might just be sitting, at work, walking the dog, etc. Nothig highly active that should cause this. -(happens often) I almost feel like my heart flip flops. The closest thing I can compare it to visually is a fish out of water. It literally feels like my heart is almost twitching. -(happens every so often) it almost feels like my heart skips a beat. So instead of being consistent there is just an awkward pause for a second and then the first beat back is hard. -(happens often) I am extremely aware of my heart beat. Again, without exercise but I feel it in my chest, other times I feel it in my arms and legs, or feel it in my face and ears. -(happens every so often) I sometimes feel pain that is in my ribs or breast on the left side. I think. I don't think it's my heart feeling pin but I don't know. The only instance that was ever even remotely painful in my heart was the first one. But there is definitely discomfort and I'm extremely aware. I don't have health insurance right now (just switched jobs and it's a complicated situation) and I don't want to seem like a hypochondriac.

The first time, I woke up feeling faint, notice my heart rate was very slow, I had jelly legs, I went to the toilet and the poop was like dihorreah. The night before I was fine. This lasted for around 10 minutes, I didn't faint, and afterwards I was fine. Forward several years, and I wake up one morning fine. I then (I think) go to the toilet. It was the day I was coming back from holiday, so sat down, then starting to feel what I can describe as fuzzy headed/unwell. Color had apparently drained from my face etc. Noticed sensations in my stomach. Felt ill. Then over a period of 30 to 40 minutes it got worse and I began to spin. By this time we were in the car on the way home. We stopped, and by the time the door was open, I felt okay again and I  was normal after this. As I started to spin, I did notice a thud in my chest, like my heart had missed a beat. Ten months later, I wake up, go to the toilet, poop was like diarrhoea again. During the bowel movement I feel this strange indescribable sensation in my stomach. Over then next 40 minutes, my legs turn to jelly, I become quite agitated, legs turn to jelly, colour drains from my face, and I feel quite sick/ill. I again begin to spin. On this occasion, I had started to walk to the bus stop to walk, I had to stop walking because my legs went to jelly. Then I begin to spin very fast. I notice the thudding in my chest, and my heart beat is very slow and i think irregular. I lose partially my sight. This went on for 5 or so minutes, then it stopped and I was fine afterwards, if a little shaken. I am scared to visit a doctor. Yes, I know I should. I am certain it is a problem with my heart. So what could it be? I do sometimes feel extra/skipped beats when at rest which cause me to take notice of them. They last for a split second. They don't happen every day. They are not becoming more frequent or worse. Thanks for any help! 0 likes, 6 replies "

I'm not talking about my heart randomly racing. I mean there is a noticeable flutter, skipped beat feeling. It feels like something is kicking my heart from inside it. It feels like my heart ""pops"". It's torture. Sometimes its worse than others: sometimes I can't sleep, or even sit down. I want to stress the fact that my heart rate is not high. It's usually around 60. Yet the palpitaitons still happen. So it's not like I'm having panic attacks or being nervous or anything. I've tried everything to try to get them to go away, including beta blockers, flecainide,  magnesium, and other home remedies. Nothing works. I had an ablation a long time ago, which didn't really do much, and cardiologists recommend I don't try it again. Most of these medicines, like beta blockers, slow down the heart. Again, I don't need my heart rate lowered, it's at about 60. I'm suffering every day. I'm out of options. I'm not considering suicide, but eventually that might be my only viable option. I cannot live like this forever. I just can't, and I'm out of options and out of hope. So I don't know how much longer I have before I go over the edge. I can;t sleep anymore without taking a xanax. I'm probably addicted to it now, that's just great. I can't sleep, sit down and watch a movie, or have any sense of comfort. No one knows what to do. Get a heart transplant? I probably wouldn't even qualify as this isn't ""life threatening.""

I had both hands done privately about 7 years ago at the age of 37. It's apparently unusual for both hands to be done together but, it minimised my downtime, and got me back to work much quicker. The initial recovery was relatively quick and the 6-8 weeks time guide is about right. You have to realise that just because the hand appears healed it doesn't mean you can carry on as normal though. 3-4 months later I still struggled to hold a garden spade and drive it into the ground or to lift something heavy as it would send an excruciating pain through my hand, it took about 12 months for this pain to have completely passed. Living with the after effects though, I sometimes wonder whether it was the right thing to do. My hands disturbed my sleep and the systems would have eventually withered away my thumb muscle but, at the time I had strong hands. Now I can easily open a narrow bottle like lemonade but, a wide rimmed jam jar is a lot harder to get a good grip of, and occasionally this is beyond me. It doesn't continue to affect me lifting anything but my hands do tire quickly. I get muscle fatigue very quickly in hands and wrists now even if I'm doing a simple activity like rubbing butter and flour together for a cake, I couldn't do an 8oz mix without a lot of pain in my thumb pad for instance. My hands now ache in places they never did before, the thumb pad is a given this muscle is worked really hard but, I also have ache's in the tendons across the back of my hands between my fingers, and the bones between the joints in my fingers often ache. It isn't constant and I have to be conscious of my objectives and my time limits when carrying out tasks. If they are too grip heavy I will really pay for it later in the day. Carpal tunnel surgery releases a very specific pressure but, the hand is a very complex machine and with each action, there is a counteraction, when you cut the tendon strength that joins the two muscle pads of the hand you remove the shared load, each has to now work in a different way to achieve the same result and it creates other issues and pressures. I would love to see the muscles of my hands now compared with someone that has not had surgery as I'm sure they would differ in their make up. My advice would be to do some additional research prior to having surgery and only use surgery as a last resort. It's a simple surgeons procedure done under local anaesthetic with minimal surgery complications but, for you, it's a different story. You have to live with the ongoing niggles created by the release, and accept that it's a trade off between the loss of sensation, numbness and muscle wastage against the aches and pains of the lack of hand strength created by the loss of the ligament support. There are days when I think I made the wrong decision and others when I'm not even conscious of hand problems. You'll often find me massaging my thumb pads in turn with the other thumb to relieve the ache and tightness of everyday simple activities. I hope this helps others.   2 likes, 1 reply "

Some years ago I found out that I am a carrier of a rare genetic mutation which can lead to cardiomyopathy. We were surprised since no one has ever had heart issues or dies suddenly in our family. So far I am disease free. I have noticed that the smallest thing I do my heart rate goes crazy high immediately. For example if I go our running my heart rate can climb to over 190 bpm. I get tired and out of breath very fast, but no chest pain. If I stop it does come down within seconds max 1 min. Do you find such high rate as normal? I have a fitbit which shows that throughout 24 hr my resting heart rate is around 67. I am afraid to do the smallest activity because as I said the heart rate goes immediately high. Any recommendations? Thank you 0 likes, 1 reply "

Has anyone had acupuncture for their carpal tunnel problems? What were you experiences? Did it help? My mum has carpal tunnel in both hands. She has done surgery on one hand, which has slightly improved it but only slightly. The operation was several months ago and she’s still not able to do much with both hands. Recently she put more pressure than normal on her operated hand and it resulted in a night of much pain all along her arm.  I’m sure there must be something out there that can help with this ? I’m reluctant to have her get the other hand done now if there isn’t much improvement to be made. I’d rather her try all alternative options.  She’s been having physio (being given excersises to do) they may be working, we’re not sure.  0 likes, 5 replies "

For around four months I dealt with the annoying numbness and extreme pain - especially during the night. It went away after my child was born. It came back a few years ago, but they were mostly annoying symptoms: numb hands waking me up as I tried to sleep - thankfully no pain - and I noticed I was constantly dropping things. Something else is happening and I'm not sure its from the carpal tunnel. Every couple months pain in my wrist - the joint, around the carpals would slowly get worse and more painful until it peaked for a few days, then slowly go away. All together this would take a month or so. Sometimes  it happened in my shoulder. Recently i'd gone almost a year without it happening. About 2 weeks ago it started again in my wrist. But this time its much, much worse. The pain is not only in my wrist, but travels up into my fingers. There is a kind of achy pain similar to carpal tunnel pain. Its started to go away, but its a very slow process. Is it time for me to see a doctor? Should i wait for the pain to be at its worst before i see a doctor? 0 likes, 3 replies "

The day after surgery and since then I have been able to move my fingers, open a doorknob,shop, cook, dry my hair with a hairdryer, etc.  It really is remarkable.  With such a successful surgery, I plan on getting my right hand done in a month or two.  I put this surgery off for too many years(because I was unsure of recovery time) and feel bad for anyone whose recovery is taking a long time.  I only posted this to help people know that some surgeries come off without any issues. I live in CT and if anyone wants to know who did my surgery, I will be happy to tell you.  Good Luck to everyone who is dealing with CT.    2 likes, 8 replies "

However, the nerve pain for CTS never went away. I had an MRI last Friday to conduct whether the nerve pain is connected to my neck, which aren't. That was the most horrible thing I've ever had to do. That aside, I now have to have a Nerve Conduction Study & EMG done, which I am waiting for my appointment letter from Charing Cross Hospital. My question is, has anyone had it done? What did it feel like and what were your results? Though I am skeptical about having the surgery I have been told that, that will more than likely be the next course of treatment. Thanks in advance. 0 likes, 3 replies "

Immediately after post-op, I could see faces further away than 2 feet. I hadn't been able to do that for months. It only got better from there. In that eye, I have perfect vision at all distances except for the tiniest print up close. Early in the morning, it was a little blurry and I used reading glasses +1.25 to read my phone just to make it clearer. Once I wake up more, I don't use any glasses. I do see the halos driving at night but it's a small price to pay compared to the cataracts. This morning, I got the second eye done. Removed my eye shield to put in the second drop and just started looking around. Noticed it's blurry and there is a bit of a ring around lights but it's an uneven ring not like the halos I see in the other eye. I know from reading these forums that some people have some blurriness post-op and it clears up over time. I have the 1 day follow-up with my surgeon tomorrow and I'll see what he says. I am disappointed because the first eye was so perfect so early. Keeping hopes up that this is normal. FYI the only pain I've had with both surgeries was the IV insertion and immediately post-op. I took 2 Tylenol and never felt pain since. It's really amazing how little pain there is associated with this procedure. 0 likes, 4 replies "

I loved the result on my first eye!  Had the second eye done targeting a -1.5D which I had tried outcwith contacts beforehand. After the surgery I could not get my far vision to blend. It has been 3 weeks after the last eye and I am so dizzy and nauseated I can't leave the couch. Vision still won't blend. Doctor says my distance eye declined to -.5d and my reading eye went to -1.75. I believe it is now too much monovision. I can put in a contact in my left eye and it relieves the nausea somewhat but still unable to function well. Can't seem to wear glasses unless both lenses have the same power.  Monovision just doesn't seem to work well with glasses.  Nausea and imbalance are worse if I try to bring my eyes up to full power with either contacts or glasses. Am seriously considering lens exchange or lasik to bring the reading eye up to full strength. At times I think no lens would be better than this lens. Any experience, advice??? 0 likes, 40 replies "

I was first diagnosed with congenital cataracts at age 5, and have had them ever since. They've always been fairly mild - for a long time my vision was 20/30-20/35, about the same acuity for near, intermediate and distance. I also have a slight astigmatism and a slight lazy eye (acuity based, not misalignment based). I’ve been prescribed glasses for the astigmatism in the past, but the correction was so mild I never used them because they didn’t really “fix anything” (the astigmatism sure, but not the cataracts). I moved to Boston when I was 29 and found a new ophthalmologist. She recognized my cataracts right away (she is a cataract specialist), and said I’d likely need surgery someday but better to hold off until it was needed. Starting this summer (I’m now 35), I started to notice lots of glare and halos from light - I was commuting to work on the subway one day and realized the lights in the subway station seemed awfully hazy, but it wasn’t a very humid day. After a few days of anxious waiting, I scheduled a check-in with my ophthalmologist and she confirmed my cataracts were getting worse and based on how my vision was deteriorating, I’d likely need surgery within a year. She gave me the option of scheduling the surgery now, or scheduling a check in in six months time to see where I was at. Went home and talked it over with my wife, and then called my father, who had cataract surgery in his late 50s, and my dad put it to me this way - He said “it’s the best thing I ever did for my vision. I saw better the day after my surgery then I had seen in years before that. If I was you, I wouldn’t put off something you’re going to have to do eventually anyways. Why keep putting up with bad vision when you could get it over with? “ So after a few days of consideration, I emailed my ophthalmologist and said let’s get this train started. I started doing research on lens choices and what went into the surgery. I went in last week for my A scan and a consult with the doc on lens choices. Since I’ve never really worn glasses, and I’m not particularly far or nearsighted, it’s definitely a bit of tossup in terms of which direction to go. My ophthalmologist definitely seems conservative about the side effects of some of the premium lenses, and has talked up monofocal’s, but she also hasn’t talked me out of any of the premium lenses either. In fact after talking about my lifestyle, the fact that my wife and I are very active (run 2-3 days a week, lift weights 3-4 days a week, hike in the summer on weekends, snowboard in the winter, etc.) she suggested considering the new PanOptix trifocals, or the older ReSTOR multifocals. She had just met the Alcan rep that week about the PanOptix and said given their popularity in Europe and Canada, they may be a good fit. So at this stage, I need to go back for more eye measurements in three weeks (immersion, and a few others) as I apparently have a “short eye” and she wants to nail the refraction calculations. I’m leaning heavily towards the PanOptix as my first choice, then the Symfony as my second, before considering a few others if there’s some reason those are not a good fit. We may or may not go Toric on he lenses depending on the measurements on my astigmatism. My hope is, given that I’m on the younger side of the average cataract patient, that I’ll take pretty well to any choice that I make in terms of new lenses. I’ve never thought of my vision is being that bad until just recently, now that I’m getting lots of glare at night and in dark situations and from bright lights even during the daytime. I am trying to be pragmatic, especially given the slight astigmatism and lazy eye, that I might need glasses or contacts for some distances after I’m done. But my surgery will be at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear hospital, which is very good, and my ophthalmologist does a few hundred cataract surgeries a year, so I’m feeling hopeful about my odds. Currently my first surgery is scheduled for Nov 18 (a few days before my 36th birthday), so I’m hoping my doc can deliver me a good birthday present. We’ll need to finalize my lens choice and which eye goes first, but we’ll get that started in the weeks ahead. I’ll provide updates as I go along as I haven’t found too many stories like mine about quite young patients with congenital cataracts, and I’d like to document my experience a bit for anyone who might come looking for a similar story. 0 likes, 50 replies "

I was first diagnosed with congenital cataracts at age 5, and have had them ever since. They've always been fairly mild - for a long time my vision was 20/30-20/35, about the same acuity for near, intermediate and distance. I also have a slight astigmatism and a slight lazy eye (acuity based, not misalignment based). I’ve been prescribed glasses for the astigmatism in the past, but the correction was so mild I never used them because they didn’t really “fix anything” (the astigmatism sure, but not the cataracts). I moved to Boston when I was 29 and found a new ophthalmologist. She recognized my cataracts right away (she is a cataract specialist), and said I’d likely need surgery someday but better to hold off until it was needed. Starting this summer (I’m now 35), I started to notice lots of glare and halos from light - I was commuting to work on the subway one day and realized the lights in the subway station seemed awfully hazy, but it wasn’t a very humid day. After a few days of anxious waiting, I scheduled a check-in with my ophthalmologist and she confirmed my cataracts were getting worse and based on how my vision was deteriorating, I’d likely need surgery within a year. She gave me the option of scheduling the surgery now, or scheduling a check in in six months time to see where I was at. Went home and talked it over with my wife, and then called my father, who had cataract surgery in his late 50s, and my dad put it to me this way - He said “it’s the best thing I ever did for my vision. I saw better the day after my surgery then I had seen in years before that. If I was you, I wouldn’t put off something you’re going to have to do eventually anyways. Why keep putting up with bad vision when you could get it over with? “ So after a few days of consideration, I emailed my ophthalmologist and said let’s get this train started. I started doing research on lens choices and what went into the surgery. I went in last week for my A scan and a consult with the doc on lens choices. Since I’ve never really worn glasses, and I’m not particularly far or nearsighted, it’s definitely a bit of tossup in terms of which direction to go. My ophthalmologist definitely seems conservative about the side effects of some of the premium lenses, and has talked up monofocal’s, but she also hasn’t talked me out of any of the premium lenses either. In fact after talking about my lifestyle, the fact that my wife and I are very active (run 2-3 days a week, lift weights 3-4 days a week, hike in the summer on weekends, snowboard in the winter, etc.) she suggested considering the new PanOptix trifocals, or the older ReSTOR multifocals. She had just met the Alcan rep that week about the PanOptix and said given their popularity in Europe and Canada, they may be a good fit. So at this stage, I need to go back for more eye measurements in three weeks (immersion, and a few others) as I apparently have a “short eye” and she wants to nail the refraction calculations. I’m leaning heavily towards the PanOptix as my first choice, then the Symfony as my second, before considering a few others if there’s some reason those are not a good fit. We may or may not go Toric on he lenses depending on the measurements on my astigmatism.

I had the cataracts removed when I was eight and ten weeks old, and I started wearing thick lensed glasses when I was three months old. My parents opted for glasses as they did not want me going through lens procedures every few months and did not want to struggle with   (after they saw another child screaming with the pain of them). I went though patching to balance my eyes up until I was six. I've never received support from the blind council here as I was on the list for corrective surgery and I attended mainstream school (despite the protests of the principal). I received support in primary school with PE to improve my coordination and resource teaching to improve my social and visual skills. When I was sixteen, I opted for IOL surgery which corrected my vision significantly. I now only use reading glasses day to day. Sometimes I feel my condition is isolating. Everyone assumes that it only occurs in elderly people and people look in amazement when I say that I had it, or they need it explained to them. I've never met anybody around my own age who has been through the same experience. I attended the children's eye clinic but a lot of patients attending that were either born with   or another disability or were up for a procedural check up as they were born premature. I don't consider myself to be disabled, I prefer the term impaired. It's hard to explain to people the way that I need to have things bigger for myself, then explaining that no, I'm not blind, no, I'm not low vision as I've had corrective surgery but yes, I am dealing with the side effects of cataracts. It was particularly bad before I had the corrective surgery, as not many teachers and no students at the mainstream schools I attended understood what was different about me besides me wearing glasses. One time I literally had to beg a teacher to change the seating plan so I could sit at the front to see the board properly and stop me getting headaches. It was a battle to get exam supports in secondary school. Thank God my university is a lot more accomodating. I've really struggled socially, not helped by my Asperger's (which I only found out about when I was nineteen) or years of   because of my eyesight. Yes, I know cataracts is a common condition among elderly people. It's surreal at the moment as my aunt is waiting for her cataracts to 'bloom' so she can have surgery (Been there, done that!). I'm also the youngest patient attending the adult eye clinic so anyone who talks to me and my mam think that she has it! If anyone else out there is around my age, I'd love to hear your stories.

At the begging of April I was helping do some yard work and a rather large tree limb knocked me to the ground.  Everyone there said they thought it had killed me because I hit the ground so hard.  Really not thinking I got up brushed myself off and went about the rest of the day.  Granted no one would let me do anything but I kinda just put it out of my mind.   Three days later I woke up quite sore.  On my way to the bathroom that morning that all too fimliar ""boiling water on the back of my leg"" sensision brought tears to my eyes. I laid around for the next couple days taking it easy hoping it would just go away.  When I started feeling a weird numbness in new places I contacted my GP who told me in no uncertain terms to go back to my spinal  nero surgan.  who promply sent me for the soonest MRI I could get.  (After insurance approval that is)   The reason I'm here is because he told me he was about 90% sure I had blown another disc from the amount of weakness in my leg, And the numbness and tingling in my ummmm my ummmm well between my legs and on my butt.  I have also been having a couple other symptoms which he couldn't rule out being ces with out a MRI.   I'm wondering if anyone could help me some because I can't find any info on this thing.  it's like all the sites say the exact same thing and are no help.  My MD told me if I used the bathroom on myself or when 24 hours without using the bathrrom or lost all feeling in my leg to go straight to my local hospital (very small town ER) and tell them my surgan was out of the next town and have them take me by ems there.   Here are my questions for those of you who may have had it. Has anyone ever not had the earge to pee until it was almost too late?  ( I won't have to pee and then instead of that little twinge that says you gotta go I feel like I'm on one of those old inccontance commericals ""gotta go gotta go gotta go right now""  and I feel like I""m not gonna make it to the bathroom in time) What do they mean by it can cause constipation?  (I have been pretty regular for the last year.  even thought I""m on an array of meds I take a stool softner ever day to keep me regular but the last month it's like I'm only going like once a week if I""m lucky but it feels like I have to poop 85% of the time.  but I cant push anything out.) What about nthe need to pee in the middle of the night?

FINDINGS: Assuming 5 lumbar type vertebral bodies, the conus terminates at the L1 level. Lumbar vertebral body heights are preserved. Degenerative disc disease with disc desiccation at the L3-4, L4-5 and L5-S1 levels. Mild loss of disc space height at the L4-5 level and more moderate loss of disc space height at L5-S1. Slight retrolisthesis of L5 on S1. Facet arthropathy. The osseous marrow signal is mildly heterogenous. Degenerative changes involving the sacroiliac joints. T11-12: Disc bulge with osteophytosis with slight indentation of the anterior aspect of the thecal sac. T12-L1: No significant narrowing. L1-2: No significant narrowing. L2-3: No significant narrowing. L3-4: Disc bulge with small area of annular fissure possibly with associated disc protrusion at the 6:00 position. Facet arthropathy and thickening ligamentum flavum. Mild central canal narrowing. L4-5: Disc bulge with osteophytosis, facet arthropathy and thickening ligamentum flavum. Focal left paracentral disc herniation measuring 1 cm in transverse dimension and 0.8 cm in AP thickness. There is focal narrowing at the left portion of the central canal and thecal sac related to disc herniation. It compresses the left L5 nerve as it is exiting the thecal sac. It also displaces the left S1 nerves in the thecal sac. Otherwise mild narrowing of the thecal sac towards the right side. Mild neural foraminal narrowing bilaterally. L5-S1: Disc bulge with osteophytosis, facet arthropathy and thickening ligamentum flavum. There is a broad-based left paracentral disc herniation measuring 1.5 cm in transverse dimension at its base by 0.6 cm in AP thickness. There is narrowing of the anterior portion of the central canal and lateral recess regions, left greater than right. There is compression of the left S1 nerve. Moderate to severe right and mild to moderate left neural foraminal narrowing. IMPRESSION: 1. Degenerative disc disease and facet arthropathy. 2.

On the whole I have made pretty good progress I think. I have always had some saddle numbness on the right side and some down the right calf area and the right foot. This improved for a few weeks or so after the operation but would say it has settled down now and been the same for about 1 year.  My question is surrounding this particular area. Does anyone else that suffers with the same numbness and loss of feeling have periods of a few days where it feels a bit worse than what is normal for you? Over the past 3,4 days, and this has happened once or twice before I think over the past 12 months, my saddle area just feels a bit 'heavier' - like a bit extra numbness has spread a bit more. Does anyone else have these same changes? Is it normal? I am not unduly concerned currently and would add I am in no pain or showing any kind of symptons of any back pain etc and do expect the feeling to go down again. The difference is so minimal but just wondered if anyone else has any similar changes? Any advice or input appreciated. Regards David 1 like, 3 replies "

And is there anything that can be done without surgery ?  ... I'm 37 have herniated discs l5-s1 and cauda equina .. I am pregnant and due in a month in a half .. it's actually so painful .. I've had other children before the cauda equina (just milder disc issues) and was fairly normal and both vaginal deliveries.  Recently A neurologist said they were surprised I was still holding up w/o surgery yet . I do pt.and chiropractic which only temperarly help then I'm in pain all over again including the shooting nerve pain . No one could ever tell me with both cauda equina and the disc issues if I'd improve or be worse with my pregnancy , from the begining  i had asked alot of questions but all that was said is it could go either way there was no definite answer.  I fortunalty havent lost any bladder / bowel function but In  these last 2 - 2 1/2months of my pregnancy have been the worse with the discs and cauda equina issues especially in bad weather.  And last of all  Does anyone know  how each case is handled, what if any meds are given especially if you haven't had surgery yet and want to do another vaginal birth if its even possible ????  0 likes, 9 replies "

I'm a 30-year-old woman.  In spring 2010 my lower back suddenly became painful. It didn't get better. Over the summer I tried various things - painkillers, the chiropractor, the gym, swimming, pilates - but found nothing gave lasting relief. Towards the year end my back became increasingly stiff and sore and one evening before Christmas I fell on the snow and felt a disc slip in my back.  Instantly I was in agony. The doctor seemed to think my level of pain was pretty standard and put me on Voltarol. I carried on with work with out pain but feeling electric shock sensations down my legs every so often. When I came off the Voltarol a week later, I had the most excruciating sciatica and was almost crawling up the walls with pain. I was put back on painkillers and told repeatedly by several very kind, but essentially uninterested doctors that the sciatica would likely wear off. After about 3 weeks I had upped my dosage of painkillers (dangerously, I later found out) to cope with the pain. My GP told me that no investigation of sciatica was warranted until I had had it for at least 6 weeks. After 4 weeks I started to have difficulty walking. After about 50 yards I would need to crouch down to get the feeling back in my legs so I could continue moving. My feet would point in odd directions sometimes, as if I had a disability. When I lay down, a feeling of coldness would fill my bottom area. I experienced some difficulty in peeing though I was still able to go to the toilet and had no incontinence until the day of the operation.  I called the doctor after a week of this and he said if I wasn't incontinent, there was no need to worry about CES. I later learnt that once you are incontinent with CES, your prognosis for recovering nerve function is significantly worse. I was in the pre-stages of urinary retention, which he didn't seem to think was at all related. He said the leg weakness was most likely muscle wasting from the sciatica (which I thought odd - my muscles looked and were behaving perfectly normally) and that if I felt coldness, not pins and needles in my saddle area, it did not sound like CES (which I'd heard about after typing my symptoms into Google and finding that unanimously, they came up).  A week later I got another doctor's appointment as my leg weakness and inability to pee were getting worse. This time I saw a different doctor who instantly realised what the problem was, tested the sensation in my saddle area which was worryingly absent (it's horribly easy not to notice that bits of you are going numb) and sent me straight to A&E. After various tests and an MRI I was diagnosed with CES with a very large disc herniation at L4-L5 and was operated on that night.  After the surgery the leg pain and weakness resolved instantly. When the nurses removed my catheter though I couldn't pee and couldn't feel anything much in my genital area. I was utterly terrified that I might have ruined my sex life and lost the ability to pee normally. They sent me home with a tap catheter to try and remind my body of what it should be doing.  A couple of weeks later I was lying in bed and suddenly felt a wave of feeling in my saddle area, as if all my nerve endings were suddenly alert. It was the most wonderful feeling as I knew it meant that my nerves were repairing and that I hadn't lost sensation here. I could feel that I needed to pee, which was also wonderful. The catheter came out soon after and I could pee normally most of the time, with a slight delay at other times.  It's now a year later. I'm often in pain with my back still. I've had several episodes where CES symptoms have come back and I've been MRIed again, showing that whenever any disc of mine in that area slightly bulges out, the nerves damaged by the first herniation go on the blink again, but with time the numbness goes away again, though it's always nerve-wracking. I pee normally most of the time but am still seeing a neuro-urologist at times to assist with this. I've currently got sciatica for the first time since prior my operation which is worrying, but I'm keeping an eye on it and will contact my brilliant consultant if it doesn't go away after a month or so, or obviously if I develop any more worrying symptoms.   The point of this essay is really to explain what happened to me, as when I got the syndrome I couldn't find details of another case quite like mine online. I hope this might be helpful to someone who is worried their nerves won't repair, because there is often hope that they will - when I was in hospital, the doctors kept telling me my nerves wouldn't get better as I had had pressure on them for longer than 48 hours - in fact 3 weeks! But they still did, so there is hope.  The other point of this story is that I needn't have ever developed this distressing syndrome had my back problems been taken seriously by my GPs. The other day I went back to the GP to get their advice about this new episode of sciatica and they said ""Let's wait and see how it turns out."" I think in this instance they're probably right - it probably will wear off with painkillers and physiotherapy. But this is exactly the same advice they gave me a year ago prior to my operation. If my GP had ordered a scan after my disc first slipped, or after my sciatica first started, my consultant says they would have straight away seen that I would need surgery as the herniation was too big to ever repair by itself. But they didn't think it was a big deal, and I don't like to be pushy.  And as a result of their inattention and delay I developed CES and now have permanent nerve damage.  I understand that back pain is a fact of life for many, and it looks like I'm going to be one of them. I also understand that in the vast majority of cases, slipped discs and sciatica go away by themselves. But it seems to me that whenever there is the chance of some underlying pathology that will lead to outcomes like (or worse than) mine, GPs should err vastly on the side of caution. 27 likes, 319 replies "

For people who might be newly learning of this condition let me share a beacon of hope when you are likely feeling quite terrified! My boyfriend had back problems for many years, I think prolapsed discs that eventually healed themselves.  Last year he had this condition for much longer than normal, a number of months and the pain got worse and worse.  He was getting shooting pains down the backs of his legs.  One weekend he said his legs were starting to feel numb and then in the space of 2 days he lost feeling in his feet and calves.  He could not feel any sensation as to whether his bladder or bowels were full and he couldn't feel his buttocks at all.  His penis also completely lost all feeling. At this point he went to hospital and fortunately was in a hospital with an excellent neurosurgery unit so they recognised the symptoms immediately.  The surgeon operated within hours removing the disc.  He was in hospital a couple of days for recovery from surgery but almost immediately the feeling in his bladder and bowels returned. Once back home he was very, very weak for several weeks, really struggling to walk.  He had numb legs for a long time and even now, 8 months later, he still cannot feel the base of one foot.  For many weeks after surgery the feeling in his buttocks and penis did not return.  As you can imagine we were both very worried this could be a permanent situation.  After a few weeks he managed to get an erection and ejaculate even though he couldn't actually feel it.  Finally after many weeks the feeling in the saddle area fully returned and all was functioning as normal. He had a very severe limp even until now and sadly that has resulted in a second prolapsed disc which he will also need surgery for but thankfully the disc is not compressing the nerves that would cause CES and the surgeon is confident he will heal nicely.   So he isn't yet recovered from all the issues related to his back but I think he has almost fully recovered from the specific issues associated with CES and the compression of that specific nerve system.   I hope this gives people some hope that it is possible to recover in some situations. 9 likes, 75 replies "

For people who might be newly learning of this condition let me share a beacon of hope when you are likely feeling quite terrified! My boyfriend had back problems for many years, I think prolapsed discs that eventually healed themselves.  Last year he had this condition for much longer than normal, a number of months and the pain got worse and worse.  He was getting shooting pains down the backs of his legs.  One weekend he said his legs were starting to feel numb and then in the space of 2 days he lost feeling in his feet and calves.  He could not feel any sensation as to whether his bladder or bowels were full and he couldn't feel his buttocks at all.  His penis also completely lost all feeling. At this point he went to hospital and fortunately was in a hospital with an excellent neurosurgery unit so they recognised the symptoms immediately.  The surgeon operated within hours removing the disc.  He was in hospital a couple of days for recovery from surgery but almost immediately the feeling in his bladder and bowels returned.
