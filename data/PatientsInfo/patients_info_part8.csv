My urologists told me it has absolutely nothing to do with the operation which I absolutely refuse to believe. So I have hit a dead end in terms of getting professional help now. I would like to ask you all, has anyone experienced this and gotten a different response from their urologist? i.e it is possible that the operation can cause this. I myself can feel a thick, swollen tube like structure inside my scrotum that runs from the root of my penis to my balls and I'm sure I could never feel it before the operation. My urologists gave me an examination and told me it's all good and the tubes were not even touched during the operation. Am I wrong for thinking that is utter BS because y'know, balls are attached to a few tubes, move the balls and remove it's surrounding membrane, there is a chance it could affect connecting features, no? Urologist says zero chance. A couple more questions. Where exactly was your incision made? Mine was directly down the center line of the scrotum about halfway down. Has anyone else here got cysts on their operated testicle? I have 3 or 4 including one on my epidymis.

I noticed a few days ago that i could only get about 70% erect. I am no longer reaching my full capacity.. but not just this, I feel as though my penis is smaller. The inner muscles feel tighter and my shaft skin appears to fit my shaft differently. I can't quite remember how I used to look but something very odd is going on with my penis now. 2.

I also notice when i try to get erect that my balls feel super tingly (not in a good way) and then the cords linking my penis and balls feel very tight and straight like i have these long thin rods attempting to fit inside a basically flaccid penis.. oh but it's not just flaccid.

I wanted to share my story as I was terrified before having the surgery from all the posts I read.  Mine was on my left side and was about the size of a small grapefruit. I was living with this hydrocele for about a year, but going to the gym started to get quite uncomfortable. I started to show a bulge even in my dress cloths for work. It was quite embarrassing and all I could think about was people staring at me and mumbling ""whats wrong with this guy."" I am married with my first child on the way so I wasn't to worried about what some single guys worry about.  The day of the surgery I was pretty terrified, I work in Healthcare so being on the other side of the privacy curtain was pretty dramatic for me. I wasn't as much scared about the surgery as I was being put to sleep. I am 27 years old, live in Texas with my pregnant wife. My entire family all reside in Indiana, as we moved down to Houston 3 years ago. I kept thinking ""What if I don't wake up?"", ""Ill never meet my kid"", ""I wont get a chance to say goodbye to my family."".... I questioned the anesthesiologist for about 5 straight minutes on what I could expect. They put in an IV and started pumping me full of water to hydrate me. This did calm me down a bit, then they gave me some valium. I highly recommend this before getting put out for anyone, this really calms you down. They rolled me into the surgery part, put a gas mask on me and I was out.  The surgery took about 30 minutes and I woke up about 30 minutes after that. Obviously when you come out of being put to sleep you are very groggy and confused. I couldn't feel any pain. I got dressed and the nurse rolled me to my wifes car and we went home.  I had about 10 stitches (dissolving ones) and a drain tube inserted to help reduce swelling. The first day wasn't bad as everything was numb. When I woke up the second day I had a migraine from hell. Probably from all the drugs the day before. It was hard to walk, but I didn't have any problems peeing.  The third day the pain started to come, honestly the stitches never hurt from beginning to where I am now. The pain I had was from the drain tube. Do not be alarmed when you have a lot of blood from the drain tube for the first 3-4 days, its normal. My surgery was on Friday and the drain tube was removed on Monday.  Swelling. Lots of swelling, expect this. Swelling will most likely be bigger than what the hydrocele was before it was removed. Looked like I was carrying around a softball in my pants. It has been three weeks and the stitches are gone and the drain tube hole is closing. I still have some pain from where the drain tube was, but not to bad. I am walking fine and going back to the gym tomorrow. Swelling has gone down, but still noticable. Feels like a hard rock sitting on top of my testicle. You have to remember, the testicles and sac are very vascular. Lots of tissue and what not so you will have swelling and bruising.  The swelling is smaller now than the original hydrocele and it can take a few months to fully go away. They say people can live with a hydrocele with no long term effects other than it getting bigger, but honestly, why would you want to do this? It's not normal, so why risk anything by just accepting that it is there. Get the surgery done and move on. You will be laid out for about 4 days. I was back to work on Tuesday (Surgery on Friday). Let me know if you have any other questions, don't read into all the horror stories. Everybody's body is different and if you have a solid doctor, they will take care of you.  I was asked about costs. I am on a high deductible plan with my wife to keep our monthly premium low as we are pretty healthy people. The doctor fee was $350. The surgery center is where it gets you. For everything it was $4,900. So in total for me out of pocket was $5,200. Fortuantely I have a HSA account and had the finances in that which are all tax deductible. Just depends on the type of insurance you have. My deductible is now met, so with the little one being born all doctors visits will be paid 100% in full for the rest of the year.

However, I am thinking it may happen more when I am eating something with higher sodium (since I cut out most of the salt in my diet). Its getting really annoying that after almost anything I eat (snack or meal) I almost immediately get headachend dizzy.  Its manageable but annoying and will last all day. I do not have diabetes or any other conditions.  Does this have to do with blood pressure?  the meds?  the salt?  Trying to do everything right...and end up with different crappy symptoms 😦 0 likes, 2 replies "

I've been told by my doctor that my blood pressure was relatively high about 2-3 years ago which affected my heart muscle quite a bit. I told the doctor I had high intake of sodium and oily food due to stress and my weight was an estimate of 92kg, at 1.79m tall. And we have been monitoring my condition since then, I did some couple urine and blood test as well as a sleep study. It all turned out to be fine, no particular problem found. Currently, I am not on any medication. Ever since then, I've been trying regular efforts to cut down on my daily intake of deep-fried food and salt. I have also lost some weight since then (approx 10kg since 1 year ago?). There was significant change in my blood pressure since then whenever I measured at home (130/90mmHg). However, whenever I measured it at the hospital before my appointment, it seems to hit 140/90 mmHg. I think it could also be the fear that I would find out that my health have deteriorated for the worst during my appointment which led to a spike. I've told my doctor about my concern and was scheduled a 24-ABP monitoring sometime next month. Now, I am worried that I will get overly nervous during my monitoring and somehow affect my results.

The pharmacist thinks it might of been stress and that the 165/132 may of been a glitch. But this is still very concerning. I confess that I did have a heavy weekend for 2 nights in a row and was tired today (could this be behind it).

This is a very brief summary of a long story so If it's a bit confusing that's why. Currently I'm 16, but about 3-4 years ago they noticed my BP was slightly elevated during a check up. Nothing extreme so they didn't do anything about it. However about 2 years ago I started experiencing quite a lot of shortness of breath, especially during rest, so I went to my GP and at that time my BP measured around 130/90. Still nothing extreme but quite high for a 14 year old. I did some lung tests but everything looked good so she sent me to a cardiologist just in case. During a physical exam he noticed that I had a very weak pulse in one side of my groin, I have no idea what that means but it's worth mentioning. I did an ambulatory BP monitoring which also measured around 130/90 as a daily average (If I remember correctly, I'm not sure) and later I also did an   that looked normal. Since they couldn't find anything they assumed there wasn't a particular cause and no more tests were done. That was a while ago but the last few months my shortness of breath has gotten significantly worse and I've started experiencing other symptoms such as: -fatigue -dizzy spells where I have to sit down or I will faint -Increasing headaches -  (although my heart rate is generally very fast, around 90-100 bpm sitting down) -ringing in ears, especially the right one -blurry vision, especially the right eye as well So i decided to see my doctor last week. These were my BP readings: 146/110 136/105 130/103 She did some   as well but I haven't gotten the results yet. But as you can tell, it's my diastolic pressure I'm worried about. What could be the cause of this and could it be related to my symptoms? I'm not overweight and don't have any family history of hypertension or   that I know of. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I recently had a blood test measure my TSH, T4, T3 Uptake, and Free Thyroxine Index, coming out to: 2.130 7.8 29 2.3 Respectively. All these levels were considered normal. Right in the middle of their respective ranges in fact and stunned me since I had thought I was sure the symptoms all seemed to match. Everything people said about having Hyperthyroidism or nodules or goiters, sound like a mirror of everything i've gone through for years. I've though about going to an Endocrinologist and having them  conduct further tests on my Thyroid to uncover the issue, but feel that they may see no point if I already have the results of the blood test.

I have recently been diagnosed and it seems a very lonely illness. Although I have a great family network all I feel like I do is moan or groan.  My vision is blurry my head always fuzZy constant confusion etc etc And don't get me started on tiredness. I'm trying to keep in work but being a primary teacher this is proving quite difficult.   I have just had more opthamology tests done and now await more results but in the mean time just have to get on with it.  I am suffering terribly with water retention in my feet and hands. Does anyone else have problems with their pituitary gland as apparently mine is empty so therefore trying to lose weight is pretty much a no go at the min as if controls your thyroid.  Thank you for reading this and thanks for your support.

I am lucky enough to have been symptom free of IIH for the past 5 years. I really suffered with symptoms for many years before that. My GP has just fitted me with a Mirena coil (Im aware i cannot use the combined Pill) and the Doctor assured me this was safe with my past medical history. However ive looked online and seen that Mirena can be a risk factor in triggering IIH symptoms again and its really worried me. Ive been so careful always since i was so ill to avoid anything hormonal but i was assured it was safe by three different GPs. I really want it removed now but once again my GP says this is not a necessary concern as Progestogen is safe for me anyway & the hormone only is localised.  I wondered if anyone here might be able to give me any advice as to whether Mirena could be a contributary factor in IIH? My gut instinct is telling me to have it taken out asap.

I am tired. Emotionally and physically. For the last four months, I have been in bed and had to leave work on STD to have treatment due to worsening symptoms. I have had a lumbar puncture, taken  Diamox, Topamax, and Lasix, as well as lost weight since being diagnosed in 7/2017. I haven't been able to tolerate  Topomax or Lasix. I went off of all of the medication due to not being able to deal with the side effects. All of the weight that I lost, I gained back since being home on bed rest.  The Diamox is the lesser of the three evils but causes my heat intolerance to be worse (even though its already bad on its on without meds)  and causes incontinence at times due to having to drink water because of excessive thirst. I am being put back on Diamox because my vision isn't improving and my optic nerves are still swollen.  My visual field is decreasing. The other symptoms are horribly impairing my ability to function.

My papilledema  and  IHH is considered chronic now. The neurologist has stated that there's nothing more that can be done and surgical intervention is the only option but I do not want to have a shunt inserted because it is a beast of its own to deal with. Most people who have had shunts placed, haven't had a lot of relief from the procedure or needed a revision. I don't want to deal with that as I have had other surgeries in the past and do not feel that I can deal with the shunt and aftercare it requires. I have been referred for bariatric surgery to loose weight to help with the symptoms and hopefully stave off further vision deterioration.  I will only do a shunt if absolutely necessary. The pain, fatigue, memory loss, confusion, anxiety, ringing in the ears, heat intolerance, light sensitivity, nausea, and other symptoms are so hard to deal with.  What hurts the most is doing all of this alone. I have no support and have recently ended all communication with my toxic familial and personal relationships because it has never been healthy, has exacerbated my stress levels, and I finally realized that I need all of my energy to be positive to assist me with dealing with this. I have come to realize that my well being is more important than anything in my world. Anyone that doesn't understand will be okay. I know that I am not crazy even though a lot of people think that I am because this condition has turned my life upside down.  My constant pain, anxiety, insomnia, and other symptoms have made me extremely unpredictably emotional. So many days I am irritable because of the pain.

However, I was wondering what everyone uses in the form of contraception? When I was diagnosed I was taken off my pill and ‘unofficially’ told that it was likely this that had caused it, but there isn’t enough evidence and they couldn’t confidently say. They did make very clear that IIH is most commonly diagnosed recently with women on various birth control aids with that being the only link between us. They also told me that I was no longer allowed any contraceptive pill and that this is the same for other women with the condition that come through the hospital. I wasn’t given any guidance as to what I can use instead and I am not comfortable with only using condoms. I wondered if anyone has any advice at all or can tell me what they use? I’m assuming others have also been told of the link between the pill and IIH, if not I would please do some research as it is incredibly risky, a lot of women aren’t as lucky as to be diagnosed before it has reached very harmful consequences. I have seen that some websites suggest progesterone only pills are okay and that there is a link between the estrogen in the pill with the IIH. However, my doctor is very thorough and I’m sure he would’ve mentioned this if it was possible as I was quite concerned to be without it. I am 21 with my partner and children are not what we want yet, the risk is still there. Some suggest the mirena coil as it has little hormone but again, I have seen plenty of women also getting IIH with that. I’m a bit stuck with what to do, could some women please let me know what they use?  Thank you  0 likes, 1 reply "

It used to drip very fast when bending over, exercising or straining. Now it is more conservative and runs slowly to the edge of my nose when I go from laying to standing. Although it seems very inaccurate, it says that it used to be tested by using a glucometer to test it and if it was csf it would show a reading. I have one of these in the house and each testing shows a reading ranging from 1.4 to 4 usually.  I am however, very unlikely to tell a dr this as even the research suggests it can be inaccurate. Has anyone else had a leak that dripped like this rather than a leak from a lumbar puncture? I don't feel I'll ever find a dr who truly would want to investigate this anyway. It was hard enough trying to get one to take me seriously about my   leading to iih  diagnosis in the first place and I have just lost the dr that was helping me with it for the foreseeable future as he can't go any further. So now I just have nothing.  Perhaps I should've taken so many   to try and prove my pain rather than just trying to muddle through with non prescription meds. Maybe then they might have thought, ' wow she must be in pain, look at all the pills she's on'. Excuse my bluntness, I am very upset right now and I've gone into self destruct mode. 0 likes, 2 replies "

Is this hemifacial spasm?,"Hi everyone, I've been suffering miserably with what I think is HFS for almost 3 years. I've been under the 'care' of a maxcillofacial specialist for 18 months with no diagnosis and not much help. I've tried self diagnosing as it feels like I'm banging my head against a brick wall with the lack of understanding from medical professionals so far. So my symptoms started with the lower half of my face which I understand is a-typical, and has progressed up my face and involves the masseter and tempoalis muscles mainly. I get pretty much constant twitching combined with hard cramping and my jaw is forced shut causing me to bite my tongue numerous times a day. I have trouble eating and speaking. Nobody seems to understand how severely debilitating this is and I can't seem to get a diagnosis. I avoid going out where I may have to speak to people as I look so stupid and it's embarrassing. I'm taking baclofen which is possibly calming it slightly but certainly not enough. I've also had Botox into the masseter which obviously calmed that muscle but with the temporalis spasming constantly it didn't really relieve my issue. The Botox has now worn off and I'm back to square one. Any advice would be great. I'd love to hear how other suffers got their diagnosis and treatments you have had. I've heard about Nik Patel in Bristol and am wondering if this is where I should be heading and if anyone else has experience of seeing him. Thank you for reading my waffle! Amy 0 likes, 2 replies "

It worked out well but recovery took 6-8 weeks and the post-op period was painful. I was in bed for a couple of days with an ice pack on my groin. Now I have to have the other side done with a new surgeon, who is promoting the laparoscopic repair. It's attractive from the standpoint of quick recovery but requires general anesthesia and the instrumentation actually goes inside the abdominal cavity, which I find a bit scary.

So for the last month or so I've been dealing with some crazy symptoms. It all started in late December, early January.  I, along with my roommates came down with flu-like symptoms.   Cough, fever, diarrhea, sore throat.  Eventually we got over it.  Or so I thought. A couple weeks later however, in the last week of January I started developing slight vertigo.  The feeling would come and go but I would notice it mostly in closed corridors or whenever I was in the  bathroom/taking a shower.  Scary but I thought it would run its course. Well, fast forward a week later after that (early February), I started developing ear fullness, crackling and facial tension to join my vertigo.   Every morning I could feel the blood from the back of my head rush to the front of my face.  My eyes couldnt stay focused and I felt like I was on a boat.  My head felt heavy, like someone tied a belt around it. Mother-in-law is a nurse and she checked my ear drums and noticed they were swollen.  She suggested I take Sudafed and Motrin.  It didnt help. I thought this was bizzare.  Eventually it got so bad over that week that it made me feel lightheaded, almost like I was going to pass out. Thats when I went to urgent care thinking i was going to die.  They ran some basic tests on me.  Blood sugar was fine.  Hemoglobin fine.   Blood Pressure, tad bit high but probably due to panic attack.   The doctor ran a  basic neuro test on me where she made me follow her finger to finger, hands to feet, eye to finger etc.    She also checked my eyes and ears and concluded that I must have had a migraine. A migraine...Ive had migraines before.  This did not feel like any migraine. Well she sent me home with Zofrane, and Sumatriptan.  It didnt feel like it was working.   So a couple days later I saw a physician. At this point we are two weeks into the odd symptoms (starting with the vertigo).  I explained the situation to him and he ran the same tests as the urgent care doctor (although I felt more comfortable around him cause he took his time to explain the situation). He concluded ear infection.  Even though he saw no outer fluid, based on my symptoms ans story he thought middle/inner ear infection from a head cold that stuck around after the flu in December/January. He prescribed me ear drops with sulfate, Meclizine for nausea and Ibropufen for headpain. Well, its been two more weeks and I feel like my situation isnt necessarily improving but altering at times.  My ear crackling comes and goes.  Facial tension not as much. But I developed cold sensations in my hands and feet.  Also, in certain positions my hands start to throb.  Maybe its anxiety? Maybe a nerve issue? Finally my head now feels like a balloon! and when i stand up it feels like a cinderblock right in the front of my face.   So much tension yet almost like a vacuum is sucking my head from up above me.   Its causing me stomach pains and my bowels to be watery (maybe due to anxiety, nerves?)  I can still hear my ears crackling at times.  But its freaking me out. It feels best when Im laying down, but as soon as I stand up, I get that heavy, heavy feeling in my head and front of face.  My stomach tenses up and its like I'm going to vomit if I move too fast.    And my neck tenses up. I have a follow up appointment in April with my physician.  Its hard to see him because I have Medi-Cal and my clinic has so many patients.  And referrals are just as tough. Anyways, anyone have any idea what this could be? Labyrintitis? Infection after Flu? Cancer?  Anxiety? My physician assured it wasnt serious but the symptoms feel serious.. I was a fairly healthy boy up to this point.  I went to the gym 4 out of 7 days a week. 5'7 175 pounds Male Filipino/Mexican On a side note, I took a blood test a week ago but still waiting for a letter back. These symptoms came on somewhat slow but progressed into something crazy. Any help would be greatly appreciated! 0 likes, 9 replies "

My stomach tenses up and its like I'm going to vomit if I move too fast.    And my neck tenses up. I have a follow up appointment in April with my physician.  Its hard to see him because I have Medi-Cal and my clinic has so many patients.  And referrals are just as tough. Anyways, anyone have any idea what this could be? Labyrintitis? Infection after Flu? Cancer?  Anxiety? My physician assured it wasnt serious but the symptoms feel serious.. I was a fairly healthy boy up to this point.  I went to the gym 4 out of 7 days a week. 5'7 175 pounds Male Filipino/Mexican On a side note, I took a blood test a week ago but still waiting for a letter back. These symptoms came on somewhat slow but progressed into something crazy. Any help would be greatly appreciated! 0 likes, 9 replies "

So for the last month or so I've been dealing with some crazy symptoms. It all started in late December, early January.  I, along with my roommates came down with flu-like symptoms.   Cough, fever, diarrhea, sore throat.  Eventually we got over it.  Or so I thought. A couple weeks later however, in the last week of January I started developing slight vertigo.  The feeling would come and go but I would notice it mostly in closed corridors or whenever I was in the  bathroom/taking a shower.  Scary but I thought it would run its course. Well, fast forward a week later after that (early February), I started developing ear fullness, crackling and facial tension to join my vertigo.   Every morning I could feel the blood from the back of my head rush to the front of my face.  My eyes couldnt stay focused and I felt like I was on a boat.  My head felt heavy, like someone tied a belt around it. Mother-in-law is a nurse and she checked my ear drums and noticed they were swollen.  She suggested I take Sudafed and Motrin.  It didnt help. I thought this was bizzare.  Eventually it got so bad over that week that it made me feel lightheaded, almost like I was going to pass out. Thats when I went to urgent care thinking i was going to die.  They ran some basic tests on me.  Blood sugar was fine.  Hemoglobin fine.   Blood Pressure, tad bit high but probably due to panic attack.   The doctor ran a  basic neuro test on me where she made me follow her finger to finger, hands to feet, eye to finger etc.    She also checked my eyes and ears and concluded that I must have had a migraine. A migraine...Ive had migraines before.  This did not feel like any migraine. Well she sent me home with Zofrane, and Sumatriptan.  It didnt feel like it was working.   So a couple days later I saw a physician. At this point we are two weeks into the odd symptoms (starting with the vertigo).  I explained the situation to him and he ran the same tests as the urgent care doctor (although I felt more comfortable around him cause he took his time to explain the situation). He concluded ear infection.  Even though he saw no outer fluid, based on my symptoms ans story he thought middle/inner ear infection from a head cold that stuck around after the flu in December/January. He prescribed me ear drops with sulfate, Meclizine for nausea and Ibropufen for headpain. Well, its been two more weeks and I feel like my situation isnt necessarily improving but altering at times.  My ear crackling comes and goes.  Facial tension not as much. But I developed cold sensations in my hands and feet.  Also, in certain positions my hands start to throb.  Maybe its anxiety? Maybe a nerve issue? Finally my head now feels like a balloon! and when i stand up it feels like a cinderblock right in the front of my face.

The doctor ran a  basic neuro test on me where she made me follow her finger to finger, hands to feet, eye to finger etc.    She also checked my eyes and ears and concluded that I must have had a migraine. A migraine...Ive had migraines before.  This did not feel like any migraine. Well she sent me home with Zofrane, and Sumatriptan.  It didnt feel like it was working.   So a couple days later I saw a physician. At this point we are two weeks into the odd symptoms (starting with the vertigo).  I explained the situation to him and he ran the same tests as the urgent care doctor (although I felt more comfortable around him cause he took his time to explain the situation). He concluded ear infection.  Even though he saw no outer fluid, based on my symptoms ans story he thought middle/inner ear infection from a head cold that stuck around after the flu in December/January. He prescribed me ear drops with sulfate, Meclizine for nausea and Ibropufen for headpain. Well, its been two more weeks and I feel like my situation isnt necessarily improving but altering at times.  My ear crackling comes and goes.  Facial tension not as much. But I developed cold sensations in my hands and feet.  Also, in certain positions my hands start to throb.  Maybe its anxiety? Maybe a nerve issue? Finally my head now feels like a balloon! and when i stand up it feels like a cinderblock right in the front of my face.   So much tension yet almost like a vacuum is sucking my head from up above me.   Its causing me stomach pains and my bowels to be watery (maybe due to anxiety, nerves?)  I can still hear my ears crackling at times.  But its freaking me out. It feels best when Im laying down, but as soon as I stand up, I get that heavy, heavy feeling in my head and front of face.  My stomach tenses up and its like I'm going to vomit if I move too fast.    And my neck tenses up. I have a follow up appointment in April with my physician.  Its hard to see him because I have Medi-Cal and my clinic has so many patients.  And referrals are just as tough. Anyways, anyone have any idea what this could be? Labyrintitis? Infection after Flu? Cancer?  Anxiety? My physician assured it wasnt serious but the symptoms feel serious.. I was a fairly healthy boy up to this point.  I went to the gym 4 out of 7 days a week. 5'7 175 pounds Male Filipino/Mexican On a side note, I took a blood test a week ago but still waiting for a letter back. These symptoms came on somewhat slow but progressed into something crazy. Any help would be greatly appreciated! 0 likes, 9 replies "

A little about me.  I'm in my 30's, tall and 184lbs.  I am sedentary unfortunately and work as a driver, so I sit a lot in a specific position with my arms also in the same spot all the time.  I have a history of anxiety, which tenses up the muscles(think like 20 000 panic attacks more or less).  The anxiety is mostly gone, but a few people in the health industry have commented at just how unbelievably tight and knotted my muscles are. I have a significant hiatal hernia.

I have had amitriptyline, propananol and topamax none of which eased the headaches but just gave me awful side effects. I was prescribed sumitriptan for pain relief and it's the only thing that relieves the headaches but I am becoming more and more reliant on them.  I tried to help myself and after attending chiropractors and an osteopath who confirmed my neck muscles are really tight and I realised I always have a tender/sore neck I then connected this to my office job where I have spent years slumped over a desk. I then to my joy discovered a headache clinic here in Belfast where I live who specialise in headaches. I seen a therapist here who confirmed I suffer cervicogenic headaches which are coming from my neck she described the muscles in my neck as being like a rope they are so tight. The therapist performs manoeuvres on the neck vertebrae to loosen up and help. Unfortunately this treatment takes months to help and isn't cheap. I started off having 1/2 sessions a week but still don't have a big amount of relief. I am now in a situation where I can only afford one session once a month and this isn't enough to help. I am suffering badly at the minute I have had headaches every day for past week I feel my neck so stiff and tight. I have had to take sumitriptan every day which isn't good at all. I am so worried what to do now, who to turn to what next. I seem to have exhausted most things and feel I no longer have any quality of life as I am in constant pain and always exhausted.

I lost my job because I could no longer concentrate because the headaches were so bad. Shortly after the headaches I started to get a weird sensation in my ears like they were ALWAYS full. I got a CT scan, saw an ENT specialist and both told me that I was fine and that it was my anxiety. ... ever since then my ears have NEVER stopped being clogged. I pop them every day.

And then it's about finding the right ones for me, but I can't lose my job again. I finally have a great career. And now these headaches pop up again. All I can think is that I'm dying. That I have something like a tumor. It's all I think about (along with constantly popping my ears). I went back to the doctors a couple days ago and was prescribed a steroid nasal spray. And also told to use a nedi pot (the sinus flush) before the nasal spray each time to clear anything out and then spray. I know anxiety and depression can create physical sensations that are REAL. But what if I really have ETD? (Eustachian tube dysfunction) which is something to do with the middle ear and the pressure in your head because it is not right.

It was a feeling of undescribable head pressure(I describe it as fluid surrounding my head). Pressure/headache in the eyes was really terrible. When I thought I was feeling a bit better and got up to move around, the head pressure would return and I had to lay back down. This lasted 2-3 days. I thought I would recover, but I've never felt the same since... And I'm only 28. No prior health issues to this. I have a 5 year old daughter and to be honest, this is completely ruining my life. The head pressure has never gone away. The head pressure was so bad on and off for the first 4 months I literally thought I had brain swelling(that's how it made me feel).

Please help!,"Hello everyone. I came across this website while searching for the name of the condition I have been dealing with for close to one year now. I hope I can find someone that is dealing or has dealt with a similar condition as I am going through right now. I know that this post is very long so I thank you for your time in advance. I am a 22 year old male and I started to develop my initial symptoms from November 2018. My vision started to feel zoned out when I wasn't zoning out. I don't exactly know how to describe it but it kind of feels like when you are tipsy without dizziness. At times things around me looked slightly blurry. I know that it wasn't to do with my eye sight because a month before I had already got it checked and my eye sight was pretty good actually. So I thought that it was to do with my neurological stuff. I ignored my symptoms for a couple of months and finally in Jan 2019 I decided to visit a local neuropsychiatrist. The doctor prescribed me some pills which I assumed that it was for my neurological stuff but later found out that they were for depression and anxiety. By this point, I developed tingly, pulsating tension between my eyebrows and in the bones behind my ears. I was quite sure that my condition wasn't due to psychological causes so later in Jan I decided to visit a different neurologist in a bigger hospital. I got an MRI of my brain done which came out clean. The doctor told me that she sees nothing wrong with the MRI and that my symptoms are probably linked to my mental health. I took that advice and went to see a psychiatrist who prescribed me antidepressants. I was on the pills for eight months until this August. During the period of these eight months, my condition did not improve at all but in fact became gradually worse until present. My visual perception became worse. Although I can see everything fine it just feels widened out (if that makes sense). In other words, my eyes find it difficult to focus to the point that talking to a person face to face is difficult because the face of the person I am talking appears slightly blurry. I just feel like as if I am drunk or high (that is the closest to how I can put it into words). The tingly, pulsating tension between my eyebrows is still present and when it moves to the bones behind my ears, it feels like my bones are going to break. In addition to these symptoms, recently I started to feel pins and needles on my back. Sometimes it just tingles but sometimes I get this spot on my upper back, right below my neck, where I feel concentrated feeling of pins and needles. In fact, I didn't develop this symptom recently but had it March 2019 as well on my right side right above my lower back but eventually disappeared. The feeling has returned about a week ago. Another symptom that I have been dealing with is that when I turn my head or move my eyeballs, I sometimes get this jerk feeling which runs from my left chest to my left arm. Apart from my physical symptoms my cognitive ability has decreased significantly. I am not able to think clearly anymore. The condition I have been dealing with started to take a toll on me psychologically as well. I am not exactly sure who I am anymore and get this constant detachment between my physical self and mental self. I want to make it clear that the psychological aspect is a consequence of my physical condition. Until date, I have seen multiple neurologists but they haven't been able to figure out the cause behind my symptom since my brain MRI looks clean and the pills I took from my psychiatrists did not help me at all. This condition has really taken its toll on me to the point that I have even lost my zeal to live anymore. I don't like to get out to public places and meeting people has become really hard. If any one of you has experienced similar conditions or has any advice for how I should proceed with it such as medical tests and etc., please let me know. Your smallest help can really make a positive change in my life. Thank you for your help and time. 0 likes, 10 replies "

I have been suffering with the symptoms in the title pretty consistently for about 2 and a half years now. I used to have some relief from the symptoms for a day or 2 here and there or maybe a bit of relief for a few hours in the day but recently the symptoms are pretty much constant and I cannot shake them.  I have an overall mild pressure feeling in the head, its not painful but is just very aggravating and feels really strange. I also have extreme brain fog with this and like a fuzzy head, there is a constant cloud over my brain and I never have any mental clarity or a clear head. My cognitive function is extremely poor now, my short term memory is non existent, its scarily bad. I often feel, detached from reality when the symptoms are bad and suffer from de-realisation, although I think this may be down to some anxiety and depression I experience when the symptoms run me down. I also get random sharp cramping pains in the head, they are quite painful but do not bother me so much as they only usually last a second or 2, it varies on how many I get of these each day but its usually less than 5. It often feels as though my brain is malfunctioning somehow and my cognitive function and senses are all out of whack, its hard to explain. There can sometimes be a build up of these symptoms throughout the day and by the night I can feel like I somehow how the flu without a fever? Like I have the head pressure, completely foggy headed, I feel super unwell, weak, sometimes even start feeling cold. Also have night sweats usually for about 4 or 5 days each month, there doesnt seem to be any sort of pattern to them that I can notice, so not sure if they are relevant. Another thing I have is ringing in ears which is mild but seems to have gotten worse recently if that sounds relevant at all. The main thing that gets me is the odd head pressure/sensation and the utterly life hindering brain fog, my brain feels like it is coated in a dark blanket constantly. I do suffer from anxiety, I know many of these symptoms can be caused or made worse by these symptoms. I dont doubt that anxiety is a contributing factor and the way I think about they symptoms probably makes them worse but I have come a long long way with my anxiety, I have good control over it, I haven't had a panic attack in a couple of years, I manage to control most of my concious anxiety and stay in a positive mindset. No doubt I still have some subconscious anxiety underlying and I am working on that but I am not convinced this is the route cause of my symptoms. I am in therapy for my anxiety. I do not feel I will ever fully recover while I have these symptoms hanging over me though.  I have been to the doctor about these symptoms, although I do think I struggle to explain them or put them across very well in the doctors office. I have have blood tests which are all normal. I saw a neurologist couple of years back when this started, had a CT scan which was normal, they put the stabbing pains down to icepick headaches and thought the other symptoms were probably made worse by my anx/depression. Since then I went away and have been on anti depressants etc with no improvement of symptoms. I have also had a few ECGs and a 24hr ECG as I have slow heart rate and low bp so thought maybe the symptoms could be down to low bp and lack of blood to the brain, doctors do not think think this is the case and all my results came back normal. I have recently been back to the neurologist who is referring me for an MRI although he said he is sure there is nothing sinister and thinks the symptoms are probably tension type headaches and made worse by and previous drug use, he only put it down to the drug use when i told him about it though so it seemed like a convenient diagnosis. I forgot to mention I used to take drugs on the weekends socially, cocaine, ketamine and ecstasy on different occasions for a couple of years, I have had periods where I have felt ok since taking these drugs and do not really think they are the cause, I was not an addict this was just one or 2 nights a month at the weekends. So I have an MRI coming up but the neuro thinks it will be clear and obviously I hope it is and I am looking for other answers.  What could be causing these symptoms? Other than anxiety which i no can be a factor, but I have periods where my anxiety is pretty much non existent but these symptoms still build up out of nowhere and persist. I was thinking maybe some sort of allergy could be a possibility, I have tried cutting out gluten and lactose, this didn't seem to make much difference although I didn't stick to this for very long. I actually did a juice fast for 2 weeks with eating nothing other than fruit and veg juice put through a juicer to see if that would help but it didn't really give me any relief. Are there any other stomach issues that could cause this? I never have diarrhoea or constipation, my stools always float recently though, to the point of not being able to flush them, also whenever I have seen chance medicine doctors they check me out and say they think i have issues with digestion, i don't feel i have these issues but do wonder if there might be something in it.  Could there be something going on with the blood vessels in my head? Could it be a spine/posture issue? Some sort of epilepsy or electrical activity in my brain? I just have no idea now and am desperate for some relief. If anyone has any ideas or advice I would really appreciate it.  Oh just to add I am reasonably fit, I try go to the gym a few times a week and I do some weight lifting. I am a normal weight. I have been losing some weight recently which is a concern but I am still in a normal weight range for height and age.  Thanks for reading 46 likes, 1293 replies "

I have been suffering with the symptoms in the title pretty consistently for about 2 and a half years now. I used to have some relief from the symptoms for a day or 2 here and there or maybe a bit of relief for a few hours in the day but recently the symptoms are pretty much constant and I cannot shake them.  I have an overall mild pressure feeling in the head, its not painful but is just very aggravating and feels really strange. I also have extreme brain fog with this and like a fuzzy head, there is a constant cloud over my brain and I never have any mental clarity or a clear head. My cognitive function is extremely poor now, my short term memory is non existent, its scarily bad. I often feel, detached from reality when the symptoms are bad and suffer from de-realisation, although I think this may be down to some anxiety and depression I experience when the symptoms run me down. I also get random sharp cramping pains in the head, they are quite painful but do not bother me so much as they only usually last a second or 2, it varies on how many I get of these each day but its usually less than 5. It often feels as though my brain is malfunctioning somehow and my cognitive function and senses are all out of whack, its hard to explain. There can sometimes be a build up of these symptoms throughout the day and by the night I can feel like I somehow how the flu without a fever? Like I have the head pressure, completely foggy headed, I feel super unwell, weak, sometimes even start feeling cold. Also have night sweats usually for about 4 or 5 days each month, there doesnt seem to be any sort of pattern to them that I can notice, so not sure if they are relevant. Another thing I have is ringing in ears which is mild but seems to have gotten worse recently if that sounds relevant at all. The main thing that gets me is the odd head pressure/sensation and the utterly life hindering brain fog, my brain feels like it is coated in a dark blanket constantly. I do suffer from anxiety, I know many of these symptoms can be caused or made worse by these symptoms. I dont doubt that anxiety is a contributing factor and the way I think about they symptoms probably makes them worse but I have come a long long way with my anxiety, I have good control over it, I haven't had a panic attack in a couple of years, I manage to control most of my concious anxiety and stay in a positive mindset. No doubt I still have some subconscious anxiety underlying and I am working on that but I am not convinced this is the route cause of my symptoms. I am in therapy for my anxiety. I do not feel I will ever fully recover while I have these symptoms hanging over me though.  I have been to the doctor about these symptoms, although I do think I struggle to explain them or put them across very well in the doctors office. I have have blood tests which are all normal. I saw a neurologist couple of years back when this started, had a CT scan which was normal, they put the stabbing pains down to icepick headaches and thought the other symptoms were probably made worse by my anx/depression. Since then I went away and have been on anti depressants etc with no improvement of symptoms. I have also had a few ECGs and a 24hr ECG as I have slow heart rate and low bp so thought maybe the symptoms could be down to low bp and lack of blood to the brain, doctors do not think think this is the case and all my results came back normal. I have recently been back to the neurologist who is referring me for an MRI although he said he is sure there is nothing sinister and thinks the symptoms are probably tension type headaches and made worse by and previous drug use, he only put it down to the drug use when i told him about it though so it seemed like a convenient diagnosis. I forgot to mention I used to take drugs on the weekends socially, cocaine, ketamine and ecstasy on different occasions for a couple of years, I have had periods where I have felt ok since taking these drugs and do not really think they are the cause, I was not an addict this was just one or 2 nights a month at the weekends. So I have an MRI coming up but the neuro thinks it will be clear and obviously I hope it is and I am looking for other answers.  What could be causing these symptoms? Other than anxiety which i no can be a factor, but I have periods where my anxiety is pretty much non existent but these symptoms still build up out of nowhere and persist.

I actually did a juice fast for 2 weeks with eating nothing other than fruit and veg juice put through a juicer to see if that would help but it didn't really give me any relief. Are there any other stomach issues that could cause this? I never have diarrhoea or constipation, my stools always float recently though, to the point of not being able to flush them, also whenever I have seen chance medicine doctors they check me out and say they think i have issues with digestion, i don't feel i have these issues but do wonder if there might be something in it.  Could there be something going on with the blood vessels in my head? Could it be a spine/posture issue? Some sort of epilepsy or electrical activity in my brain? I just have no idea now and am desperate for some relief. If anyone has any ideas or advice I would really appreciate it.  Oh just to add I am reasonably fit, I try go to the gym a few times a week and I do some weight lifting. I am a normal weight. I have been losing some weight recently which is a concern but I am still in a normal weight range for height and age.  Thanks for reading 46 likes, 1293 replies "

Please help me. (5 MONTHS)  ","Hi everyone. My name is Erik. I am a 20 year old male, thin build. 6' 2'' at 170 lbs. I have had really debilitating issues for the last 5 months. The issue is that I feel drunk, spacey, loopy, high and dizzy all the time. It basically feels the same as if you were tipsy or the high feeling you can get. I also have visual disturbances. My vision has become blurry and I have somewhat tunnel vision. I just feel all around out of it. I find myself daydream, when I say this I mean my eyes don't focus on anything (go blurry) and just look at nothing. I think it might be slight double vision. Sounds are also very werid and it takes alot of energy to focus on visual and audio stimulants. Additionally, I am tired all the time. Extremely tired. Some days I will sleep very well for 10-11 hours and still be tired when I wake up and exercise will not wake me up. It is like the type of good solid sleep you have when your body is sick.. My memory has gotten really bad as well as my ability to process thoughts and engage in conversation. Imagine being drunk all the time...first I have been reading on boards like this for a long time now and have seen some people with these symptoms but no answers!! People seem to disappear. I hope hey have solved this problem but please let me know how! Let me start by giving some background information. In August 2015 I was in an indoor rock climbing gym and fell from 15 feet straight onto my back. I could not move for a good 15 minutes because it hurt so bad. I wasn't able to do anything athletic after that day for at least a month. However, I did not have my current symptoms after this fall.  Fast forward to December 15th 2015. I got really sick, was in bed for 4 days. Sore throat, eyes hurt like crazy, and super tired. It was during and after these 4 days that I developed a headache. This headache causes a pressure/dull/sharp pain behind my eyes, the upper bridge of my nose and right in between my eyes on my forehead. This headache lasted for about 4 months.  At about 3 weeks into the headache I went and saw an ENT as I thought it was a sinus infection. i took multiple sets of antibiotics over the course of the next month to no avail. I got blood tests and liver test at around 2 months into the headache and nothing showed abnormal. I then was able to get into a nuerologist. They were unable to find anything after taking an MRI of my head with a barium contrast.  Since the beginning of my headache I have been seeing a (PT) physical therapist mostly for my neck and back since after the fall my back is sore constantly. I had a neck injury about 5 years ago on a trampoline so I have a sore neck, tight muscles alot from that.  At about 3 months into the headache (3/15/2015) I developed a new symptom, the drunk/high, dizziness, loopiness. I had the headache at the same time at this point. My PT suggested that I may have a blood vessel being pinched in my neck or a nerve being pinched in my mid back area where my rock climbing fall pain is mostly at. I have been to 3 different chiropractors since this has occured about 5 times to each one. It has not helped so far. My PT gave me massages in my affected back and neck areas.  Also a new thing I've noticed recently is that when I look up (bend my neck to look at the sky) I seem to get some sort of relief? Also ever since the loopy part started (this did not happen when I just had the headache) any amount of alcohol at all will make me SUPER DRUNK, literally like 2 sips. I used to be able to drink 3 full beers before getting buzzed. I am thinking I want my doctor to give me a full head (brain/upper atlas) to lower back (tailbone) MRI so that my nerves and blood vessels going to my brain can be evaluated. Do you think this is a good idea? Has anyone had these symptoms before? I am now 5 months into this and it is debilitating.  No doctor is taking me seriously because I am so young and the chances of having a serious problem are supposedly slim because of my age. PLEASE HELP!!! I feel like I'm caught in a dream and losing my awareness and my IQ. I am afraid something is damaging my brain and this is going to be permanent. 2 likes, 150 replies "

After researching the internet for causes and treatment, I stumbling upon this forum and was reading multiple posts about 4 years ago in which a person named ""windhur"" posted his discoveries which helped him.   He concluded that his neck was causing the problem.  I was thrilled to hear this as I was telling my doctors that I am 95%  sure  my neck is contributing to this facial spasm.  I had three whiplash injuries to my neck, a right shoulder that dislocates anteriorly for the last twenty years and extreme neck tightness especially the right side.  I have started doing stretches with heat and massage to the neck area  concentrating on the right side with postural excercises to correct bad posture. (text neck ).  I have had no botox treatments.   I have also  starting wearing special glasses that filter outs the harmful rays of light because of sensitivity to lights and noise (I also suffer from migraine with dizziness)  and have had a 80% improvement in my hemispasm. I am concluding for myself that my neck is playing a huge part in this disorder.

I've had hemi facial spasms since age 40. At first it was a slight twitch on my eye.  Then, the whole eye was closing with my left side of my mouth and cheek muscles moving. (If you are here on these forums... you know the deal...) Since I was 40, I've been getting botox shots to control the spasms. The twitching was almost non-existant.  I could tell it was still happening because I could hear in my left ear a sort of sheesh, sheesh, sheesh noise.  (sounded like a quick static-like ocean sound) Then... maybe November or so I noticed the noise wasn't happening. I'd learned to block it out, so I had to pay attention. It's now February and my last botox was in October I think.  I was supposed to get another shot in January but I told the doc to postpone it. My smile is back.  My eyebrow doesn't twitch.  My eye , face and mouth arent twitching.   What gives?  I thought only surgury could cure this. So you are probably wondering... what did I do recently that may have helped it?  Now, I'm not saying this did it, but in the last two years I've done some things differently. For the past year and a half Ive' been: 1) I started excercising.  My cholesterol was going up, so I started the treadmill every other day for 1/2 hour. 2) I hear Krill oil lowers cholesterol so I've been taking 1000mg every morning.  Never miss a dose.  It thins blood. 3) My blood pressure was going up a little so I started taking L-Citrulline which open blood vessels.  (about 2.4grams in the morning and again at night)  L-Citrulline gets converted into nitrous oxide in the body. Body builders use it to expand blood vessels before working out or running a marathon.  So maybe that was the thing.... not sure..... I read nitrous oxide levels decease as we get older.  Maybe that's why hemi-facial spams affects more people over 40?  When women enter  , the nitrous oxide level drop. So, again, I'm not a doctor.... I can only tell you what I've done differently.  Maybe there's no correlation? Dunno. I'm soooooo glad to see me in the mirror again. If posting this actually helps someone, that would be great. IMPORTANT!  I did research those suppliments before I took them and they will interact with some heart medications or erectile drugs... MAKE SURE YOU LOOK INTO ANY DRUG INTERACTIONS BEFORE TRYING ANYTHING PLEASE. Good luck! Dan. 4 likes, 62 replies "

Especially geno type 1. I had lived with being hep c positive for approximately twenty years. I begun a twelve week course of new medication eight weeks ago. The virus load was  (1,200,000) at the beginning of the course. On the fourth week the virus load had been reduced to an amazing  (28). On the sixth week blood test the virus is now not detected. My liver function test is normal though my liver has a slightly above average fat content, this too can be reduced through diet and exercise. I still have four weeks of treatment left as I have completed eight weeks now.  This is reassuring news and much welcomed  for those awaiting or just to begin treatment. The medication I have been prescribed is Exviera dasabuvir / Viekirax ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir / Ribavirin . For all those who may be hepatitis positive, pursue the treatment as it is becoming more available, as the cost although still considerable has lowered and more health authorities are able to offer the treatment than in previous times. For any one that may be in a state of panic as to whether they may have the virus, the worst case scenario is that even detected positive, the rate of success of cure with the new treatment I have been informed by the hep c team who kindly manage my treatment is a staggering 98% which is brilliant news the hep c community has been needing for a long time.( On hope, foundations are built ) This news is a message of hope, keep focused and whatever your circumstances I hope this news brings comfort and a renewed sense of direction. If any one has any questions to the treatment and it's side effects, you are welcome to reply. Regards Robert 1 like, 10 replies "

Any advise please.,"My teenage age son was diagnosed with HSP in November 2017. The trigger was a cold with an ear infection. The rash spread around his legs and hands. The diagnosis was immediate and the hospital kept him in for three days. Thankfully the rash disappered within 5 weeks and he has not had another flair since then. We followed up with urine analysis on a weekly basis for 3 months and then monthly thereafter. Only on two occasions he showed traces of protein and that was within the first two months.He continous to show micro hematuria in his urine. He drinks plenty of water 3-4 liters a day since he plays basketball. He has cut down on the sugar and milk and eat mainly organic.

First it started as a rash on her ankles that progressed up to her bottom, then to her arms. Pain and swelling began in her knees to her ankles, elbows, wrists, and eventually hands before we finally got the diagnosis. Because she is so young, her doctor didn't want to give her steroids, leaving only the use of ibuprofen to deal with her pain. We were told to let the disease run its course, it'll go away in a month or two. These past few weeks have been hard for us. Some days she is full of energy and will run around like any other child, but the next day she'll be in so much pain that she doesn't want to move. Now, about a month with this disease, the upper left quarter of her head is swollen. It was frightening because just an hour earlier, she was completely fine. We rushed to the hospital, had all the urine and blood tests done (everything was fine, just slight anemia), and were told that the swelling was just another symptom of HSP. I'm really confused because this whole time I thought it only affected joints with swelling.  I'm just wondering if anyone else has had swelling in part of their body aside from limbs? 0 likes, 3 replies "

I am actually worse, now I am showing protein in my urine. I created this discussion for treatment options that work. Prednisone has helped me with abdominal symptoms but not for the rash. I don’t think azathioprine did much but my rheumatologist insisted increasing dosage. My GP has found a new drug called Rituximab, which has been approved in Australia for rheumatoid arthritis and non-Hodgkins lymphoma. It works by depleting B cells in the body. A study was recently released with 22 HSP patients treated with Rituximab with good results, I will try and find it to link it here.  Has anyone tried Rituximab? It isn’t approved here so will be very expensive to try.  I have heard dapsone has been effective for some people but my doctors don’t think it will help- is this something I should try? The other thing I have read about is a tonsillectomy- again my doctors aren’t convinced it will help unless I had strep. For those that it has helped, did you have a strep infection? I have also looked into a plasma dialysis but my doctors think it would be too risky.  Now that I have kidney involvement I think they are more likely to try riskier treatments. I would love to hear from anyone who has actually cured their HSP because it doesn’t seem likely from what I’ve read but none of the doctors seem to know this!! 0 likes, 9 replies "

On the 28TH of February this year I woke up with abdominal pain i thought nothing of it at first but as the day progressed it got worse and worse so bad it was unbearable and I couldnt even walk straight it wasnt the type of pain either that gave you a break it was everlasting and very weakening.2 days later when I couldnt bear it any longer I attended the A AND E Dept in waterford Regional Hospital where Im from in Ireland.They Told me that it was infact a ''knotting of my stomach'' and the prescribed me with medication.I had infact at the time of my examination already developed signs of a rash on my legs and feet.   2 days later from that and no better I got very sick during the night,at this stage I was vomiting and the rash had got much more agressive covering my legs and also the end of my back which was the worse of all.My family became very concerned so during the night I travelled to a care doc. The care doc was puzzled as to what was wrong and could not find anything wrong with my stomach on examination so gave me different medication and told me to go home and have a hot choclate!   Days dragged on and I was feeling worse and worse I was sweating one minute and cold the next I got so weak I could not move from my bed.The third time a doctor was called. The doctor took my blood pressure and was astonished as to how high it was for my age,she examined me and on examination she called for my parents to call an ambulance straight away..she diagnosed me with mengicocal menengitis and gave me 3 injections of anti biotics..the ambulance rushed me to hospital where I spent a week and where they confirmed it was not menengitis but a viral infection.They killed the pain with painkillers and told me there was nothing else for what I had only that it had to go by itself.I was left out the following week as the rash had faded and I was in no more pain but felt very weak.   It wasnt long I was home and the rash started up again folowed by the abdominal pain,as the days went on I deteriated once again and another doctor came as I could not move from the house as this time my joints had become inflamed and my knee was twice its size. It was only this time that the doctor that visitied diagnosed my disease for what it really is.HSP.He recognised it by the rash and asked me if it has started at the end of my back,which it did. He said that I needed to be hospitalised in order for the pain to be controlled and I needed Steroids as a last resort.However he said that I did not need to go there till the next morning as the only worry was my kidneys with this disease and that in itself would take years if they were to be affected. The next mornin I returned to hospital again along with the doctors letter and its only then they confirmed that I had this disease. They sent me home with a small dose of steroids but the following week the dermatologist took me off them as symptoms were dying down.   The following week to no surprise I woke up during the night with rash on my legs and stomach pains I tried my best to leave it go by itself with painkillers but it just got worse and worse and ANOTHER doctor was called.The doctor took my blood pressure and said that it was dangerously high and called another ambulance.   all that night in the hospital i was vomiting I hadnt slept in days and i thought id never sleep again the pain in my stomach was so bad and nothing would take it away.I could not go to the loo without the aid of someone with me as i was so weak shakey and dizzy.However I was greatful the swelling had not come back. After 3 days of no sleep and constant nausea a doctor was called to my bedside suring the night I was sweating so bad and blood pressure had risen again I could not eat or drink without aid of a drip,the doctor decided to try the steroids again through an injection.No sooner had he done so when the abdominal pain left.I was never so relieved in all my life,it felt like he was god!!!!! i could sleep first time in i couldnt even remember!! The morphine had been very good for killing pain all along but knwoing it was gone without a painkiller was something else!   The next day I was left home and symptoms had all gone.....for a week.. I woke up not being able to lift my head with the pain in my head and my neck,It was such a fright I began to panic so bad and it was clear i needed another doctor. The doctor arrived and on seeing how much distress i was in called the hospital who informed her to call another ambulance and have me straight out.

On the 28TH of February this year I woke up with abdominal pain i thought nothing of it at first but as the day progressed it got worse and worse so bad it was unbearable and I couldnt even walk straight it wasnt the type of pain either that gave you a break it was everlasting and very weakening.2 days later when I couldnt bear it any longer I attended the A AND E Dept in waterford Regional Hospital where Im from in Ireland.They Told me that it was infact a ''knotting of my stomach'' and the prescribed me with medication.I had infact at the time of my examination already developed signs of a rash on my legs and feet.   2 days later from that and no better I got very sick during the night,at this stage I was vomiting and the rash had got much more agressive covering my legs and also the end of my back which was the worse of all.My family became very concerned so during the night I travelled to a care doc. The care doc was puzzled as to what was wrong and could not find anything wrong with my stomach on examination so gave me different medication and told me to go home and have a hot choclate!   Days dragged on and I was feeling worse and worse I was sweating one minute and cold the next I got so weak I could not move from my bed.The third time a doctor was called. The doctor took my blood pressure and was astonished as to how high it was for my age,she examined me and on examination she called for my parents to call an ambulance straight away..she diagnosed me with mengicocal menengitis and gave me 3 injections of anti biotics..the ambulance rushed me to hospital where I spent a week and where they confirmed it was not menengitis but a viral infection.They killed the pain with painkillers and told me there was nothing else for what I had only that it had to go by itself.I was left out the following week as the rash had faded and I was in no more pain but felt very weak.   It wasnt long I was home and the rash started up again folowed by the abdominal pain,as the days went on I deteriated once again and another doctor came as I could not move from the house as this time my joints had become inflamed and my knee was twice its size. It was only this time that the doctor that visitied diagnosed my disease for what it really is.HSP.He recognised it by the rash and asked me if it has started at the end of my back,which it did. He said that I needed to be hospitalised in order for the pain to be controlled and I needed Steroids as a last resort.However he said that I did not need to go there till the next morning as the only worry was my kidneys with this disease and that in itself would take years if they were to be affected. The next mornin I returned to hospital again along with the doctors letter and its only then they confirmed that I had this disease. They sent me home with a small dose of steroids but the following week the dermatologist took me off them as symptoms were dying down.   The following week to no surprise I woke up during the night with rash on my legs and stomach pains I tried my best to leave it go by itself with painkillers but it just got worse and worse and ANOTHER doctor was called.The doctor took my blood pressure and said that it was dangerously high and called another ambulance.   all that night in the hospital i was vomiting I hadnt slept in days and i thought id never sleep again the pain in my stomach was so bad and nothing would take it away.I could not go to the loo without the aid of someone with me as i was so weak shakey and dizzy.However I was greatful the swelling had not come back. After 3 days of no sleep and constant nausea a doctor was called to my bedside suring the night I was sweating so bad and blood pressure had risen again I could not eat or drink without aid of a drip,the doctor decided to try the steroids again through an injection.No sooner had he done so when the abdominal pain left.I was never so relieved in all my life,it felt like he was god!!!!! i could sleep first time in i couldnt even remember!! The morphine had been very good for killing pain all along but knwoing it was gone without a painkiller was something else!   The next day I was left home and symptoms had all gone.....for a week.. I woke up not being able to lift my head with the pain in my head and my neck,It was such a fright I began to panic so bad and it was clear i needed another doctor. The doctor arrived and on seeing how much distress i was in called the hospital who informed her to call another ambulance and have me straight out. My consultant was waiting for me as I arrived at the hospital as the symptoms pointed towards menengitis they were worried and I was brought down for a CT scan and also a lumber puncture(one id like to forget) and i was giving a room in isolation.It took several hours for the results to be confirmed that I did not have menengitis.However I was kept in isolation for the next few days and treated with painkillers and anti biotics..before being told I could go home. That has been 3 weeks ago, I still have scars from the rash of my HSP..i still get the regular headache..the odd pain..but do feel weak all the time..I havent been the same since i got this disease. The hospital have been bringing me out for check ups and there is still signs of protein and blood pressure is still very high.. is there an end to this disease??it has left me traumatised.

She has experienced tummy aches, head aches, the rash and swollen and stiff joints (this has been the worst symptom by far). As yet, no kidney involvement thank God but she will be tested regularly for 12 months so I know we have a long road ahead of us. My question is, should she have the nasal spray/ flu jab? She is due to have it at school a week from now. Is she at risk because her immune system is compromised? I will ask the same question of my GP. Also, any view on when we can reintroduce sport? The GP advised that rest is beneficial. Any advice gratefully received. Thank you in advance. 0 likes, 3 replies "

Im a 23 year old student at Universtiy in the UK.  I got HSP while i was on holiday in the states.  It started off with the red spots on my ankle and then spread untill i had a really bad rash all over my legs and on my waist aswell as around my elbows.  My fingers, ankles, toes, elbows and knees would all swell up and i had to take IBUPROFEN every 6 hours just to keep the pain at bay. I wont bore you all with the details of what the docs said and how i came to know i had HSP but basically after trial and error i was able to pin point some triggers that would set me off: Chocolate, Smoking, Drinking, Food with additives and preservatives in, Tight clothing and getting hot from walking to Uni or playing sport. After even more trial and error and a few months i was able to drink Vodka and cranberry as theres no additives or preservatives in either and i can now smoke 'American Spirit' Tobbaco (which you can only buy from tobacconists)  As a 23 year old student who enjoys partying and socialising it was a pretty big shock to the system as i could no longer go out and do what students do.   Just wanted to post this to let anyone who is in the same position as i was ( a student at uni who drank and smoke and then all of sudden could not go out had to eat a strict diet couldnt get worked up or hot) just rememeber that i had the same thing happen to me and now 5 months down the line im back to normal and everything is OK!  Yeah it is very annoying and painful and can really get you down but just remember it does not last forever and will get better! Thanks 2 likes, 36 replies "

I was given Prednisolone and until now I am still on Prednisolone because every time dermatologists will taper my Prednisolone , new rashes will erupt. I had diarrhea and even passed out bloody stool.  All laboratories were normal and occult blood in my stool was negative. I have still the rashes (old and new) and I am on Prednisolone 5mg now and steroid cream. Now my problem is I cannot eat anything except fish and vegetables.

Are there certain foods that will help reduce the inflammation or foods that cause flare ups? Will exercise help in any way? Anyone advise would be greatly appreciated!! 0 likes, 11 replies "

I never passed out, it never happened without a precursor of panic(so if the tachycardia comes up SUDDENLY, like 90 to 160 in a couple beats, it's likely a cardiac issue). I starved myself in fear of having even more issues, but it turned out that it made it far worse. After year of being sick like this, the symptoms seemed to subside and disappear. I was fine for a while. I could run, do whatever with no issues. Then one day, it showed up again. Mysterious. I'd have runs of the same panic, the same chest pain, the same acid reflux... I took all the damn tests, but it was a hernia. The doctors demanded I take a CT to make sure, but I prefer not to have a huge dose of radiation at only twenty. I went to a chiropractor and had my stomach pulled and it got rid of all my symptoms immediately.

I notice things wrong with my body much more clearly and feel much worse. No one understood what was wrong with me(I had telltale signs of a hernia even then, back pain, chest pain, belching, acid reflux). A hernia that was missed by endo-scopy obviously isn't that big of a deal, right? Wrong. My hernia isn't permanent. It straightens itself out and cramps up repeatedly. It can come and go, but it comes with a vengeance when I have long term stress or if I stress my GI. The point of this isn't to say that doctors are wrong, or that you shouldn't trust them. It's just that if you want to be healthy, you have to do your own research and find your problem if the fixes aren't working(this sadly happens more often than not). PPIs made me feel worse. My stomach spasms cause hernia and this hernia makes me feel god awful like I'm going to die(panic attacks randomly).  I'm having bouts of my hernia again, but when I use my chiropractor's method of pulling my stomach back down, VIOLA! No panic, tachy's gone, feelings of dying are gone.  Stress is a killer for any disease for the stomach. A lot of people say that ""stress doesn't cause problems with health"", but stress affects the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system.

Some people experience heart attacks like they're chest discomfort and some people experience them like it's the end of the world. Some people don't even noticed GERD and some people have straight up freak-outs that are chalked up to anxiety.  That aside, how is everyone doing with their hernias? Hernias generally are considered ""untreatable"" aside from surgery, but even to that, I find that a good lifestyle with activity can hold back even diabetes.

I developed 2 incisional hernias several months later. The hernias were very painful and I know my weight at the time made matters worse.  My wonderful surgeon told me I needed to lose 80 pounds before he would do the hernia surgery, because if I didn't lose the weight then the chance for more hernias after surgery was very good.  So, I had weight loss surgery (laproscopic) in Nov 2016.  I have lost 100 pounds. I have been feeling a lot better and getting exercise, etc, until Monday this week when I started having severe pain in the large hernia again. Now it even sticks out when I am in the laying down posistion.  Because of the sudden pain, I saw my surgeon yesterday.  He said I am ready for surgery.  I am no longer considered high risk because of the weight loss. However, as he finished explaining what the surgery would entail, I was not prepared for his news.  I am going to need open surgery (not lapro) and it will involve cutting me just below the breastbone all the way to the lower abdomen.  He will remove scar tissue and adhesions from my prior abdominal surgeries, he will repair the hernias, muscular work will be done... basically a reconstruction of the abdominal wall.  I didn't realize it was such a major surgery.  Also, because of my prior abdominal surgeries, I will be in the hospital at least 3 days. He said I need to get this done soon because if I am up and active, the pain will just contine (I am taking Tramadol for pain).  Currently I just lay in bed with the heating pad on. Severe pain.  So I need to suck it up and just make that call and get the ball rolling on surgery. Sorry this is so long, but I need to talk to people who have been there. I am really scared of going through pain.  For those of you that have had previous open abdominal surgeries, how bad is the pain after another open surgery?  How long were you in the hospital and when you got back home, how did you do things on your own such as getting out of bed, walking around, etc.?   Please share with me and thank you in advance.  0 likes, 10 replies "

Then one night my right eye swelled and closed up. I went to A&E. I had an MRI brain scan of the brain and eye sockets, the bloods had markers for a clot on the brain. No clot was found. The docs said they could see a pattern of pustules forming over the right side of my head and around the eye brow. The scalp was very itchy and I had sensitivity to bright light. I was admitted and given IV anti virus and IV steroids for 5 days with medication for the nausea and pain. Nursing care consisted of having my bad eye washed out with sterile water using syringes 4 times a day, a combination of an antibiotic and steroid drops being inserted, then 5 minutes later, Acyclovir eye ointment inserted, also 4 times a day. After a week, I was sent home on Oral Acyclovir 800 mg x 2 for 3 more days plus to continue with the eye care/eye drop/eye ointment regime. 6 weeks on, I have seen the specialist twice as an outpatient. He looked inside the eyes.  I used E45 anti itch cream and it helped to relieve the itching and I self medicated with Piriton tablets for the itching. The itching has mostly stopped, I still get bad headaches, but they are lessening  intensity.  For the pain I was prescribed opiates and only take them at night. 3 days ago, I developed red eye and soreness. I rang up the eye specialist and he said I am to increase the Acyclovir eye ointment to every waking 4 hours and the combination eye drops, one drop every 6 waking hours. I will see him tomorrow for a review as I have started to get blue streaks/spots  in the  colors of  the vision in the bad eye.  I think I am making progress.

I waited a full year before posting this. I had my husband randomly switch my zinc for something else twice in a mock “blind” trial because I was so so worried it was probably just placebo effect. I slipped out of remission when the zinc was removed so I’m convinced. I first stumbled across it in an NIH study and I’ve posted the link.  I’ve done multiple topical and oral biotics. I’ve had drained abscesses, surgery, biopsies and  . Turns out I’m alleric to nightshade (found out through a blog post) and could be cured by high doses of zinc (through an Internet article). I feel so let down after 7 years of medical treatment and I was still in severe pain with constant flairs that cost me so much, I hope someone else can be helped from this. I’m completely symptom free unless I accidentally have nightshade (paprika is in virtually all packaged food) but even then I might have a small painless lump not a full blown boil or open sore that debilitates me    / 0 likes, 15 replies "

One week later it had alot of numbness and pins and needles. 4 weeks later its numb, hurts to touch. Just the blanket touching it hurts bad. The foot feels like its BURNING UP combined with shocks!

Is it the foot waking up and feels pain or is it the nerve dying? The fact that I could move the foot right after surgery(first hours) makes me wonder what happened. The nerve wasnt damaged by the surgery it self. Just right after the surgery something happened. Im so scared this is permanent. I cant live with this. Its so terrible. Anyone had similar problems?

I think its too early to say if anythings really happening. I'm supposed to have them for another week & see how things go.  If by next week I'm no better I'm gonna have to have another go of oral prednisolone. Except this time I'm going to be taken off my Mezavant XL & go onto Azathioprine. I'm a little worried because last time I talked about it with my doctor he said it is a 50/50 wether I respond well to it. The list of possible side effects is quite something as well, weakening of the immune system, a possibility of a couple types of cancer, nausea & vomiting etc and on top of that it apparently takes about 10-12 weeks to do anything ...if it does anything at all I'd like some advice please off anyone who has been/is on on Azathioprine, what its like, how bad is it, is it worth the risks basically  Thanks in advance Andy 0 likes, 3 replies "

Episodes are usually infrequent- around 1 every 4-6 weeks. Onset is invariably at night and when lying down to sleep or actually asleep. The time spent out of rhythm varies from 30 minutes to as much as 8 hours, usually going back into normal sinus rhythm when the bloating has abated. ECG and Echo tests normal. But have been prescribed a blood-thinner of course (not warfarin), which I have to start soon it seems. Two things concern me: ONE that neither the specialist or my GP seemed to accept that there was any connection between A/F and bloating/IBS yet the internet is crowded with people with the same symptoms as me. Only two (eminent) USA sites mention this as a reality. TWO I do wish my GP would take seriously a need to review and change my medication routine (I have been on 25mg Atenolol for ectopic beats for 9 years now), especially since I have read in several notable cardiological sites that atenolol can not only contribute to A/F but also that in any event, 25mg is too low a dose. Would others with A/F AND these IBS-type symptoms please share their experiences/outcomes/view please? Many thanks!! 1 like, 79 replies "

However, this has never caused any physical problems until three months ago, when I had sudden chest pains so bad that I went to the urgent care facility at 8am in the morning because they woke me up and I was convinced I was dying. They did some blood tests, did an EKG and xrays and told me it's probably anxiety, that everything looked normal and not to worry because the odds of someone my age and weight (I'm only 108lbs at 5'2) having a legit heart problem is basically like winning the lottery.

I feel like it can't be normal to be sitting on my sofa watching tv and feel my heart thump and pulse out of the blue, or be laying in bed trying to fall asleep and feel the same. I  have to be doing anything stressing, emotionally or physically, to bring it on. It just seems random. Last time I was watching tv and perfectly calm. Only lasts a second or two each time. It's not prolonged and doesn't hurt, it's just a rapid, heavy flutter and then it's gone and my heart rate is normal again. Does this sound like afib?

I thought it would be useful to tell my story.  Maybe it could help somebody or at least offer hope. I started experiencing frequent urination at night, and sometimes during the day, near 2000.  Typically, at first, I would wake up after midnight and visit the bathroom 6-8 times, every 20-30 minutes.  This started at about once a month or so.  I had what would later be diagnosed as a-fib, but I didn't connect the two at first.  After much complaining to my primary doctor, he sent me to Urology, where it was assumed I was just another aging male with an enlarged prostate.  When I assured him that, while that was true, it wasn't the real problem, he gave me a plastic urinal and told me to record overnight volume for a week.  I gave him daily numbers like:  2,700, 350, 1,900,  2,300,  500, 300, 3,000 ml.  He considered the results and told me that he had heard about a-fib releasing a factor that caused the kidneys to dump liquid.  He didn't know what to do about it and Endocrinology refused a referral. About that time, my a-fib was documented.  As my a-fib got worse, so did the urination.  At the peak, I was going to the bathroom 15-18 times a night, every other night, and once  measured 4.5 liters over night (I usually didn't measure, however).  This, of course, led to severe  .  Over six months I had emergency room visits for bleeding kidneys (2), strokes (2), and an injury from fainting.   My cardiologist agreed that something had to be done about the a-fib.  RF ablation was the only outright cure, but in 2007, it was risky and the success rate was low.  We agreed to try chemical control, hoping to buy time until the technology progressed.   I was put on propafenone (Rhythmol), which worked phenomenally well for ten years: almost no arrhythmias or hyper-urination.  Then, as expected, I started experiencing wildly fluctuating heart rhythm and I was taken off of it and put on amiodarone. I was sent for an ablation consult and learned that it had, in fact, improved, and two ablation procedures were now routine at Kaiser Permanente, where I get medical care.  They first performed a cryoablation, which is relatively quick and 80% effective.  It didn't work for me, though.  Six months later, they tried RF ablation, much more tedious (for them) and with about the same success rate.  This one stuck.  It  took almost 6 months for things to settle down, but now I pee about as much as a 67 year old man does.  Strangely, I still have arrhythmias, primarily ventricular, which must have snook up while the a-fib was firing, but my cardiologist doesn't seem worried about them.  I've been told that the success rate of the procedure after 10 years is only about 20%, but drugs become effective again.  Who knows.  Maybe there will be a whole new treatment by then.

Thanks in advance for any advice  . . . and I have to say this condition just stinks.  It makes a sex life all but impossible. 0 likes, 10 replies "

And what were your results? Did you notice an increase in symptoms after switching? Did you have any problems with the applicators? Several months ago I switched fro Estrace cream to yuvafem. I was doing oknay on the cream but it was messy and you had to wash and reuse the applicator. But I have had some problem with the yuvafem applicator. To begin with it does not have rounded corners on the end like the vagifem , it has sharp rectangular edges, Everytime I use it I am sore the next day and I am thinking those sharp edges are causing some damage,  I have gotten very small since using this yuvafem and it can be quite difficult to insert. Also I have had an increase in yeast infections( which goes great with the burning I already have) And I read the ingredients and the first one is corn starch, which is why we shouldn't use powder because yeast feeds on corn starch. I'm starting to think I should switch to vagifem even if the co pay is more anyway let me know if you have had any problems if you have switched to yuvafem   1 like, 82 replies "

Doctors kept telling me that there was something wrong with my  immune system and that a normal healthy person should not have gotten this .they ran many blood tests one of which was T lymphocyte  and everything came back (good)I was told I must have a natural weak immune system .   I was supposed to be off work for a year but I only took 2 months off ,  I had a nurse coming to my house and packing and bandaging where I had surgery , i cancelled the health care and went back to work packing and bandaging myself during the day as I worked , at this point I had no more nodes in my neck . I have a business and a family to provide for , I did what I had to do .   I’m now 30 years old and about 3 months ago the nodes came back in my neck , I’m very worried, went to see my doctor and all blood work came back normal , they gave me an ultrasound of my neck and found a cyst. I did research regarding my nodes and did some research regarding the tests they have done on me and put in consideration my medical history ( the abscess) and the results I get off google scare me , I see HIV as the response to most my searches .  I’m assuming the doctors suspected  hiv when I was hospitalized due my abscess which is why they did so many tests on my immune system ,  I remember the doctor telling me my t4 count was good and that they checked my blood for protein and that was good too and  that I must have a natural weak immune system or an underlying problem that they can’t see .  I don’t do drugs nor have I  had sex with anyone other then my partner in 10 years ,  However I did beat up a guy at a bar when I was 25 who claimed he had aids  but I didn’t believe him because he had sexually assaulted a girl at the bar and when I confronted him he said he was gay and when I started beating him he said he had aids , that’s the only way I might have came in contact with the virus . The doctors tell me that it’s stress and lack of sleep that’s most likely the cause of my weakened immune system . My questions are :  1) is it possible for stress and lack of sleep to be causing my problems ? 2 ) the doctor told me they did a t lymphocyte test and checked my blood for presence of protein and antibodies ( were these tests done to check me for hiv?  ) could you tell from these tests ( I’m embarrassed to ask the doctor ) I should have never googled , now I’m stressed out and I have been experiencing anxiety regarding my health , I feel like I’m going to die and my mind is never at rest, it’s affecting how I love my children and my wife , I’m scared to transmit something to them .  I wish they would find cancer because that would mean my  family would be healthy  . I know asking for an hiv test would solve the problem but I’m to embarrassed and scared to talk to anyone regarding how I’m feeling . That’s why I’m here , to get advice and information regarding the tests I’ve had done to hopefully put my mind at rest . Thank you for taking the time to read my post  . 0 likes, 4 replies "

When I was 27 I noticed I had a swollen Lymp node below my chin (fixed) at the front of my neck about the size of a pea  and a couple others on the left side of my neck( move able) When I was 28  one day I woke up with a pimple on my butt and a high fever , I kept working and through out the week my pimple got bigger and my fever got worse , I went to take a p**s and found my balls swollen; I then went to the hospital where I under went  2 major surgery’s ,  I had an absess which tunneled from the pimple to my balls . Doctors kept telling me that there was something wrong with my  immune system and that a normal healthy person should not have gotten this .they ran many blood tests one of which was T lymphocyte  and everything came back (good)I was told I must have a natural weak immune system .   I was supposed to be off work for a year but I only took 2 months off ,  I had a nurse coming to my house and packing and bandaging where I had surgery , i cancelled the health care and went back to work packing and bandaging myself during the day as I worked , at this point I had no more nodes in my neck . I have a business and a family to provide for , I did what I had to do .   I’m now 30 years old and about 3 months ago the nodes came back in my neck , I’m very worried, went to see my doctor and all blood work came back normal , they gave me an ultrasound of my neck and found a cyst. I did research regarding my nodes and did some research regarding the tests they have done on me and put in consideration my medical history ( the abscess) and the results I get off google scare me , I see HIV as the response to most my searches .  I’m assuming the doctors suspected  hiv when I was hospitalized due my abscess which is why they did so many tests on my immune system ,  I remember the doctor telling me my t4 count was good and that they checked my blood for protein and that was good too and  that I must have a natural weak immune system or an underlying problem that they can’t see .  I don’t do drugs nor have I  had sex with anyone other then my partner in 10 years ,  However I did beat up a guy at a bar when I was 25 who claimed he had aids  but I didn’t believe him because he had sexually assaulted a girl at the bar and when I confronted him he said he was gay and when I started beating him he said he had aids , that’s the only way I might have came in contact with the virus .

I didn't notice in the beginning as I didn't feel or see anything unusual but now I'm in a alot of pain. On the top of clit hood I have a swollen, reddish lump that's gotten bigger during the day yesterday and has been swelling probably everyday. I don't know what it is as I've never had it before, I'm 19 and a virgin so I know it's not an STD/STI. Also, along the left labia I noticed it's really swollen also but it doesn't hurt until it reaches the clit hood. The hood is swollen so badly that I can't see my clit without really stretching, which hurts. My left is primarily the issue side and as of this moment it burns. I can't walk, sit , sleep or move at all without going through a moment of pain first and I can only sleep on my back. PLEASE HELP!!!! 2 likes, 44 replies "

I am looking for some possible information (confirmation) as to what may be going on. I have been to a few doctors having different, but all negative experiences. The symptoms seem to flare up every 6 months or year. In between flare ups sometimes I feel more energetic with less intense symptoms that come and go. I am able to mostly ignore them, but I still do not feel, what I believe should be, normal. This started when I was 16 years old. The first symptom I recall is my hands peeling raw. It started as it always does with small red spots popping up on my palms and fingers. They are not raised but seem to be beneath the skin. They burn and sting with pins and needles when this happens. A few days later my hands start to peel and flake. The rash continues for another week or 2 before subsiding. By this point my hands are so raw and sensitive that anything with a slightly sharp edge can cut me. At the time I was on Accutane to clear up my acne. After a week of my hands splitting I seen the dermatologist and was told to stop taking the medicine. He gave me anti-fungal cream and I went on my way. This is always one of the first symptoms I notice At the time of the first incident I was working at a grocery store that was under construction. I remember feeling weak and feeling as if my head were in the clouds nearly constantly for a few weeks. I wondered if it was something to do with the construction and something in the air. I now understand that it was just part of all of this. During these flareups I spend most of my free time in bed. I am drained of energy after making it through a day of work. Pulling myself out of bed in the morning is a hassle as I feel like I have cold oil in my joints, especially my hands, fingers, knees and feet. I also sometimes experience nights sweats during these periods to the point where a towel is necessary. Sleep can very difficult to come by. If I cut myself it takes twice as long to heal as it otherwise seems to. I get ulcers in my mouth (and even nose recently) nearly every time and they can sometimes take a a couple weeks to heal. There have been several instances where I would wake up every morning and throw up whatever I had eaten last the previous day. My whole digestive system seems to get our of whack. My stool is never solid or constant.  I wear contact lenses and also tend to end up with, at least, irritated eyes, and sometimes ulcers and infection in my eyes. As I said I have been to doctors several times and it has never gotten me very far. When I was 19 I had blood work and scans done only to be told the only thing found was a minor bladder infection. (This has since happened again with a different doctor). I once had a doctor tell me the only possible explanation for the palm rash was syphilis. He lectured me, gave me antibiotics and sent me on my way. A couple weeks later the test came back negative and we were able to find no other explanation. I suspect, for the reasons I am about to explain, is that I have some kind of autoimmune disorder. The first clue is that my grandmother passed away from scleroderma before I was born. We have since found out 2 of her children (my mothers siblings) both have autoimmune problems. Rheumatoid arthritis for both of them as well as other problems. And as it turns out one of them was diagnosed with Lupus a couple months back, which is what I suspect I may have. Another thing that points towards autoimmune problems is this all starting while I was taking Accutane, which I found out a few years ago is known to bring about these problems. My initial suspicions began after making a post on Facebook about some of these symptoms. One of my mothers friends messaged me after seeing it asking if I was cold all of the time. This instantly perked my ears as I am CONSTANTLY cold. I am given a hard time regularly because I will wear a sweater during summer. When I explained this to her she told me she thought I had lupus as these were many of the same symptoms she experiences. This sparked me to look into it and that is when all of the puzzle pieces came together. I am just looking for some confirmation or maybe to be pointed in the correct direction, should I possibly be wrong.  Thank you in advance. 0 likes, 0 replies "

And as it turns out one of them was diagnosed with Lupus a couple months back, which is what I suspect I may have. Another thing that points towards autoimmune problems is this all starting while I was taking Accutane, which I found out a few years ago is known to bring about these problems. My initial suspicions began after making a post on Facebook about some of these symptoms. One of my mothers friends messaged me after seeing it asking if I was cold all of the time. This instantly perked my ears as I am CONSTANTLY cold. I am given a hard time regularly because I will wear a sweater during summer. When I explained this to her she told me she thought I had lupus as these were many of the same symptoms she experiences. This sparked me to look into it and that is when all of the puzzle pieces came together. I am just looking for some confirmation or maybe to be pointed in the correct direction, should I possibly be wrong.  Thank you in advance. 0 likes, 0 replies "

A few days later my hands start to peel and flake. The rash continues for another week or 2 before subsiding. By this point my hands are so raw and sensitive that anything with a slightly sharp edge can cut me. At the time I was on Accutane to clear up my acne.

He said, once i'm medicated it will get better, I have been on medication now for about 5 months, they have increased my levothyroine, now on 75mcg, about to go up to 100mcg. Also my B12 and Vit D low, so taking supplements for that,  but my voice and the strangling feeling is still there. So about 4 weeks ago, i decided to go gluten free, within 2 days my voice returned to normal 😃 last week i went out for lunch, chose what i thought was gluten free and within 5 mins my throat felt funny and my voice completely went!

So a couple years go by (late 2016) and at this time i am working a part-time job and going to college, i start throwing up in the mornings. it was always stomach acid and i always felt better as soon as i'm done. So i brushed it off because i didn't really have time to go to the doctor. About 4 months after that, i wake up one morning in the worst stomach pain of my life and projectile vomiting ever 3-4 minutes. i went to the ER, had elevated blood pressure and was giving tramodol. it had no affect on the pain so they have me morphine, which also didn't help. i ended up getting Diladud and it barely helped. Was sent home and told to call my PCP. This problem starts happening every few days and it's getting worse. went to 3 gastrointestinal doctors and 3 different PCP with no results. i did mulitiple HIDA scans, C-T scans, upper endoscopes and biopsies. All came back 100% healthy. I eventually lost 75+ pounds and was told ""your body is in starvation mode"" but i was healthy. After almost a year of that, it randomly stops. i start gaining weight again and i get back healthy. I have a good few months and feel great. By early 2019 i'm sick again. but it's not just my stomach this time, it's my head and my whole body. i get tender spots all over my legs for no reason, my neck stays stiff 24/7 and if i try to actually get up and be productive, my neck has tremors that night and i can't control it.  i don't sleep anymore at all because of how uncomfortable i am at night. i always have a headaches, no appetite, severe fatigue, i have a heat and light sensitivity and i have the worst brain fog. i can't think straight and i almost feel like i'm in a dream. The mornings are the worst for me. i cry the first 2-3 hours i'm up because i can't handle it. i know this is a lot and it's all random, but if you have any suggestions please send them my way.

Pregnant mothers were spoken to about it and as far as I know, that was about it. In this country  it is never out of the newspapers or off the internet now. My Musculo  Skeletal Consultant is  now  issuing Vitamin D as a basic necessity to all newly diagnosed patients at her hospital department, based on my findings and usage. I take 1000 iu daily, after the initial 6 week very high dosage, at the outset of my trial. I do not take Calcium supplements as together, they can have heart and kidney side effects.

My Musculo  Skeletal Consultant is  now  issuing Vitamin D as a basic necessity to all newly diagnosed patients at her hospital department, based on my findings and usage.

I must stress that, this is my own personal journey, and it may not be the one you should take.

","I`m  male, 68 and live in England, UK, and have just found this site after reading an article in one of our national newspapers. I`ve had the above autoimmune conditions for 10 years now. It all started off with a very sudden onset of Reynauds in my hands, then I had trouble putting my painful feet on the ground as I got out of bed. Then I got general fatigue and muscle and joint pain. I went to the doctors who made me an appointment with a Rheumatologist. He instantly said Scleroderma and Inflammatory Arthritis and issued Prednisolone steroids, the steroids had an instant effect. Took bloods and gave me a UK web address to look at everything to do with the condition. On our next meeting he confirmed his diagnosis and made appointments for x-rays , and heart and lung function tests. he also made me an appointment to a Musculo Skeletal Consultant. After that appointment  I was the diagnosed with Systemic Sclerosis with overlapping Sjogrens Syndrome. I had severe side effects to all the drugs I was given for the conditions so, I began an internet journey to find an alternative natural anti-inflammatory. After 6 months of trawling the internet I found a scientific paper by a Japanese medic. The gist of it was that he tested his theory (on himself) that large doses of Vitamin D ( which has anti-inflammatory properties ) would help his condition. I followed his routine and it helped massively. I told my Consultant what I was going to do and he backed me doing this. 10 years ago Vitamin D was very little known vitamin. Pregnant mothers were spoken to about it and as far as I know, that was about it. In this country  it is never out of the newspapers or off the internet now.

I've been healthy my whole life except for seasonal allergies, dry eyes and dry mouth. No high blood pressure, no high cholesterol, no diabetes, non-smoker, no family history of autoimmune disorders. However, back in April 2013 I went to my primary doctor because I was having some these painful electric-like shocks in my feet. Eventually I was referred to a Rheumatologist who diagnosed me with Sjogren's and placed me on Hydroxychlorquine 200 mg twice per day. In late 2015 I started having bad gastro symptoms--vomitting and severe indigestion. A upper GI and biopsy revealed chronic gastritis—please note I was also under a lot of stress at this time with full-time college and full-time job. In October 2016 I started having severe joint pain in my hands, it was difficult to hold so much as a glass or plate. My primary doctor prescribed me medicine she thought would help with the pain/inflammation. Several days after taking the medication the left side of my face went numb. It feels almost like it fell asleep or when you get Novocain from the dentist, along with a ""crawling"" feeling. No pain at all. My primary doctor ordered a MRI to check for MS. The MRI was perfectly normal minus ""chronic sinusitis"". I also started experiencing Raynaud’s around this time. My primary doctor referred me to a neurologist who diagnosed me with Trigeminal Neuralgia. The sensation in my face never returned. In December 2016 I started seeing a new Rheumatologist who diagnosed me with Lupus, not Sjogren's like my other doctor. She started me on Hydroxychlorquine 200 mg 3x/day and Imuran 2x/day. By the end of 2017 she started weaning me off of Imuran. By the beginning of 2018 I was only taking Hydroxychloroquine 200mg 3x/day and she began weaning me off that as well. By the beginning of 2019 I was only taking Hydroxychloroquine 200mg 1x/day. Today I only take 1 tablet per day of the Hydroxychloroquine. I've been seeing my Rheumatologist ever since 2016 but have some discrepancies as to whether or not I actually have Lupus and maybe I have Sjogren’s instead.

I can't remember a time when I wasn't absolutely obsessed with something (I've read the first 3 Harry Potter books over 100 times for example), and although I value the few close friends I have I don't feel the need to meet more than every few months. I've never been in a romantic relationship. I struggle to understand when people are flirting, and have felt extremely stressed and guilty when it's become obvious. I am an extreme perfectionist to the extent that I often struggle to finish projects, and throw away anything I've done because it doesn't meet my standards. As I've grown older (I'm now 24) I've gained more control over my temper and emotions, but still had a lot of trouble finding work that didn't give me a breakdown/panic attacks. Luckily I'm now in a job I enjoy, and get on with most people that I meet. I've learnt a lot about people's emotions from various courses I've taken, and no longer pretend to be someone I'm not. I do like people - I just need a lot of time alone! I also have IBS - my current obsession is controlling it, and I continuously research potential sensitivities (e.g. amines, lectins) and any symptoms I have had/foods I've eaten. Does this sound like autism? I know it doesn't change anything, but I'm just curious! 0 likes, 1 reply "

I know all children aren't the same, but I feel if I don't act now this could have a big impact on her life. Not sure where to go for help.

So much so certain situations can reduce her to tears. Shes very emotional and even opening a Xmas present she gets very overwhelmed and cries. Socially she wants to get along with everyone and struggles at school when children are horrible, she'll get emotional and can't understand Why? Nor can she walk away, she will keep going back until she is accepted. In terms of work I've noticed how messy her work is in books etc, she's easily distracted and doesn't have the patience to complete work. Homework is a nightmare usually spend a whole day trying to get her to do her work, even then we have to sit and go through everything for her to understand. Maths is a massive struggle she can't understand maths questions in written form and every question has to be broken down.

Getting changed is a nightmare she doesn't like labels, tags on clothes and anything tight she hates and won't wear.  This will then cause another melt down.  She likes routine and seems to do the same thing over and over again. For example: watch the same film/programme, look over family videos and pictures over and over again!!!

He says 4 words 2 of which are strong and clear (mama, dada) and two which he doesn't use often and only seems to whisper (up, all done).  Honestly always thought the whispering thing was a bit quirky but as he got older I noticed he isn't really picking up new words and I haven't heard him say up or all done for about a month. Normally I'd just think he is marching to the beat of his own drum but then he started doing other things I have not seen before such as walking around our table repeatedly.  If I get in his way he hugs me but a realize he is not so much hugging me as he is over excited and squeezing me.  he has always done this thing with his hands where he opens and shuts them when he gets really excited and his body tenses belittle and his mouth will open wide and again we were told it's a quirk.  but I noticed he sort of does that (sortbof a milder version) when walking around the table and now he walks around other objects. Since he could control his hands he would fold his ears over not exactly at noise just in general.  It was enough I thought something was wrong with his ears when he was younger but there wasn't.  Now he is doing it at sounds.  Not just loud sounds, but sometimes it's just a normal sound that's not soft or loud.  He does not cry at these sounds.  He does really cry or throw tantrums at all ever.  The only place I noticed he will freak out is in the doctors office and only in the exam rooms. When I walk with him he is s big boy so I can't carry him (30 lbs in size 5 diapers) I noticed if I hold his hand he doesn't  really fuss or try to run and get away.  If I let his hand go though he will be all over the place and he does not come to me if I call for him. I recently realized he doesn't really respond to his name.  I didn't notice this before because he does respond to me if I'm doing other things such as have something he is intrested in or if I sing his name which I noticed I did a lot.  But if I say I'm gonna get you he giggles and runs.  he will even watch to see if I'm chasing and if I'm not he will wait for me to. He does not point or reach for things.  I was told because he is very smart and tall that a lot of that may be because he will think and figure out what he wants (and he is very clever which I will get into in s moment).   But he also doesn't wave buh bye and when we do play peekaboo or patty cake which he does know he will use my hands but not his own. A more recent addition to all this is he will either blow on his arm which wasn't weird until he started occasionally biting it.  Not hard enough to make teeth marks.  The blowing I just figured he liked and I can get him to copy me if I do it but the biting was hhard enough to make red marks  and seemed to be another thing he does when he is excited. He doesn't have any toys he is obsessed with.  Does prefer toys or things he can shut such as drawers or doors but you can remove him he doesn't really care if you do.  He does have his hands down his pants which I admit isn't odd for a boy but he does it almost 24/7.  Far more then my other two sons.  He does love music but doesn't try to dance but he smiles.  If you put on an actual music video not a kids music video but a real one he will be glued in front of the TV. So here's the thing my son is super smart and brave.  He pretty much learned to walk the second he could stand which was about 8 months.  Heck he practically just ran.  He learned to climb over every obstacle.  He even climbs over our couch and just jumps off the back onto his feet or butt (no I didn't let him he was just fast).  We have had to get creative with almost all babyproofing because he has figured it out.  we have one of those plastic covers on his door knob because he like to open his door from his crib.  He can open the door with it on.  How we have no freaking idea because he won't do it if we are watching.  He smiles and giggles almost all the time, rarely cries, will absolutely look you in the eyes, and will hug and cuddle.  Not a big kisser but does know how.  He seems to be always calm in the car (I do mean always) and in the grocery store besides getting excited and doing that thing with his hands where he tenses up when he gets excited nothing.  At the park he will run run run until he is bright red sweating and we normally have to pick him up to stop him but he doesn't  ever cry when we do.

He says 4 words 2 of which are strong and clear (mama, dada) and two which he doesn't use often and only seems to whisper (up, all done).  Honestly always thought the whispering thing was a bit quirky but as he got older I noticed he isn't really picking up new words and I haven't heard him say up or all done for about a month. Normally I'd just think he is marching to the beat of his own drum but then he started doing other things I have not seen before such as walking around our table repeatedly.  If I get in his way he hugs me but a realize he is not so much hugging me as he is over excited and squeezing me.  he has always done this thing with his hands where he opens and shuts them when he gets really excited and his body tenses belittle and his mouth will open wide and again we were told it's a quirk.  but I noticed he sort of does that (sortbof a milder version) when walking around the table and now he walks around other objects. Since he could control his hands he would fold his ears over not exactly at noise just in general.  It was enough I thought something was wrong with his ears when he was younger but there wasn't.  Now he is doing it at sounds.  Not just loud sounds, but sometimes it's just a normal sound that's not soft or loud.  He does not cry at these sounds.  He does really cry or throw tantrums at all ever.  The only place I noticed he will freak out is in the doctors office and only in the exam rooms. When I walk with him he is s big boy so I can't carry him (30 lbs in size 5 diapers) I noticed if I hold his hand he doesn't  really fuss or try to run and get away.  If I let his hand go though he will be all over the place and he does not come to me if I call for him. I recently realized he doesn't really respond to his name.  I didn't notice this before because he does respond to me if I'm doing other things such as have something he is intrested in or if I sing his name which I noticed I did a lot.  But if I say I'm gonna get you he giggles and runs.  he will even watch to see if I'm chasing and if I'm not he will wait for me to. He does not point or reach for things.  I was told because he is very smart and tall that a lot of that may be because he will think and figure out what he wants (and he is very clever which I will get into in s moment).   But he also doesn't wave buh bye and when we do play peekaboo or patty cake which he does know he will use my hands but not his own. A more recent addition to all this is he will either blow on his arm which wasn't weird until he started occasionally biting it.  Not hard enough to make teeth marks.  The blowing I just figured he liked and I can get him to copy me if I do it but the biting was hhard enough to make red marks  and seemed to be another thing he does when he is excited. He doesn't have any toys he is obsessed with.  Does prefer toys or things he can shut such as drawers or doors but you can remove him he doesn't really care if you do.  He does have his hands down his pants which I admit isn't odd for a boy but he does it almost 24/7.  Far more then my other two sons.  He does love music but doesn't try to dance but he smiles.  If you put on an actual music video not a kids music video but a real one he will be glued in front of the TV. So here's the thing my son is super smart and brave.  He pretty much learned to walk the second he could stand which was about 8 months.  Heck he practically just ran.  He learned to climb over every obstacle.  He even climbs over our couch and just jumps off the back onto his feet or butt (no I didn't let him he was just fast).  We have had to get creative with almost all babyproofing because he has figured it out.  we have one of those plastic covers on his door knob because he like to open his door from his crib.  He can open the door with it on.  How we have no freaking idea because he won't do it if we are watching.  He smiles and giggles almost all the time, rarely cries, will absolutely look you in the eyes, and will hug and cuddle.  Not a big kisser but does know how.  He seems to be always calm in the car (I do mean always) and in the grocery store besides getting excited and doing that thing with his hands where he tenses up when he gets excited nothing.  At the park he will run run run until he is bright red sweating and we normally have to pick him up to stop him but he doesn't  ever cry when we do.

He stopped saying some words he knew, started doing a lot of sensory behavior such as walking around objects and people, he also had stopped responding to his name, he doesn't point to things or have any hand gestures such as buh bye, and does this thing with his hands where he opens and closes them and his body tenses up and his mouth gaps open, or he will do hand thing and bite his arm. We are waiting for an appointment for him to be tested, but it is very far out.  He has an Ot currently coming to the house to work with him and with the work we have gotten him to respond to his name a bit more (40 % of the time) and he did start to say words although I've only ever heard him use the words once then never again.  We suspect that he is autistic or has very bad sensory processing disorder. The odd thing is everyone talks about the meltdowns their kids have with both, but our son doesn't really have meltdowns.  He has never been afraid of anything, he barely shows signs that things hurt, and its even hard to tell if something is annoying him.  He of course cries occasionally, but honestly his lack of crying and tantrums is abnormal.  Is this something that can occur in autism? 0 likes, 2 replies "

Even though i had a baby out of wed lock. Anyways fast forward three years my daughter has been diagnosed with autism. Its been a big blow but i knew she had something wrong with her due to her meltdowns she can have one that last 3 hours, she avoided eye contact and was non verbal. Altough she is talking a bit now shes not there yet. i love her but my problem is i get so frustrated with her. i thought getting her pets would help with her being so needy but nope i got to watch her even more i saw her choking the cat and trying to suffocate our dog with a pillow and body slamming him. my pets run away when they see her.  even taking her to the store is a task i dread. some days are better than others but most i just end up so frustrated i cry. she doesnt understand how to calm down, car rides are hell with her, this morning i served us both cereal and shw grabbed my plate instead of hers and i told her about it and  she gave me a big fit i let her keep my plate. she ended up flipping the plate upside down just to make me mad. i hate when she stims i find it embarassing.  i cant leave the room for five seconds otherwise shes right behind me crying.  she also self harms and hits me i heard it gets better for some people and some people it doesnt i just hope it does.  idc if she never talks but i just hope she calms down thats all i wish for just her not yelling not giving me a hard time. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I'm 24 years old, and I was diagnosed with   at 18 months old. I was the youngest person diagnosed in my state until I was 12 or so. Growing up my parents always did everything they could to keep my bloodsugars in check, and when I was more independent as a teen, I hit a little bit of a rough patch with A1C's in the 8's. Since the age of 18, I can't recall having an A1C above 7. In fact, my last few have been in the low 6's and even high 5's. A1C is an average of your blood glucose, and high 5's is someone who's considered pre Diabetic. So if you looked at my A1C reading, you wouldn't even know I had diabetes. With that being said, I like to think I take pretty good care of my diabetes. But I have one constant fear that I cannot shake: the fear of dying. More specifically, that diabetes is going to kill me at a young age. I've dealt with anxiety disorder since age 13, and about a year ago I started medication to help. It has certainly helped, but I still worry constantly- I'm talking probably once or twice every hour I'm awake every day- that diabetes is going to kill me young. This has lead to poor health choices. I drink anywhere from 2 to 4 beers nightly just to try to take my mind off it. I used to be a pretty casual drinker, and since I upped my drinking I've gained about 15 lbs. At age 19 I started smoking, which I found sadly helped calm me down and take me out of a panic attack. I smoked cigarettes for about a year, and I've been using an ecigarrette since age 21. I constantly worry about my kidneys failing, going blind, losing limbs, heart attacks, you name it, I worry about it. All my life I've heard the horror stories- ""My grandpa lost his legs from diabetes and he died shortly after"", ""My uncle's kidneys failed and he died from diabetes"", all of that really takes a toll. I think I worry about it more also now because I have a beautiful wife and an amazing 17 month old son who is my entire world- I'm always worrying I won't be around to see him grow up. In fact, I'm often grateful we had our son in our early 20s because I often think I won't make it to 40 and he will be an adult by then. Has anyone else had this constant fear of death? What did you do to help your fears? Constantly thinking about death and complications is getting old and it's pretty depressing. Looking for any advice or support I can get.

All my life I've heard the horror stories- ""My grandpa lost his legs from diabetes and he died shortly after"", ""My uncle's kidneys failed and he died from diabetes"", all of that really takes a toll. I think I worry about it more also now because I have a beautiful wife and an amazing 17 month old son who is my entire world- I'm always worrying I won't be around to see him grow up. In fact, I'm often grateful we had our son in our early 20s because I often think I won't make it to 40 and he will be an adult by then. Has anyone else had this constant fear of death? What did you do to help your fears? Constantly thinking about death and complications is getting old and it's pretty depressing. Looking for any advice or support I can get.

I'm 24 years old, and I was diagnosed with   at 18 months old. I was the youngest person diagnosed in my state until I was 12 or so. Growing up my parents always did everything they could to keep my bloodsugars in check, and when I was more independent as a teen, I hit a little bit of a rough patch with A1C's in the 8's. Since the age of 18, I can't recall having an A1C above 7. In fact, my last few have been in the low 6's and even high 5's. A1C is an average of your blood glucose, and high 5's is someone who's considered pre Diabetic. So if you looked at my A1C reading, you wouldn't even know I had diabetes. With that being said, I like to think I take pretty good care of my diabetes. But I have one constant fear that I cannot shake: the fear of dying. More specifically, that diabetes is going to kill me at a young age. I've dealt with anxiety disorder since age 13, and about a year ago I started medication to help. It has certainly helped, but I still worry constantly- I'm talking probably once or twice every hour I'm awake every day- that diabetes is going to kill me young. This has lead to poor health choices. I drink anywhere from 2 to 4 beers nightly just to try to take my mind off it. I used to be a pretty casual drinker, and since I upped my drinking I've gained about 15 lbs. At age 19 I started smoking, which I found sadly helped calm me down and take me out of a panic attack.

This started 2 weeks ago on a Saturday when I was hungover I was out for dinner and as I was walking out of the restaurant I had this feeling in my head and felt a faint spell come on and was convinced I was going to the ground (felt like I was being pulled to the floor, lightheaded yet heavy squeezing feeling) but I didn’t faint, I just went home and slept it off .. felt fine the next day until I dinner time again when I was walking around making dinner and the exact same faint attack came on so I went and laid down for the rest of the night.  Went to the doctors on Monday she said she believed it could be related to my GERD and also did bloodwork and some other basic tests. For the rest of the week I was fine until Friday noon time, I was sitting on the computer at work and it suddenly came on again and caused a panic attack as well. I had to get picked up from work and was super dizzy, short of breath, nauseas and sweaty. Laying down seems to make it better, so I was doing that till I got up and grabbed a shower was getting dressed then had another faint feeling in the same day (same Friday I left work) so I went to the Emergency Room. Doctor said my bloodwork, vitals and ECG was fine so I just got sent to a general internal medicine clinic for the next week.  But things have only got worse from here    The next morning I woke up with skull crushing head pressure (all over head, base of skull, top of head, temples etc.) that makes my brain feel like it’s floating around in my head and pushing into my skull.. may I add my appetite has been completely off since Friday (31st of August) so I feel weak too. The head pressure was so bad that I felt like my head was being lifted up off of my neck then being pushed from the top/back (really such an uncomfortable feeling). When I stand or sit up right/eat for too long my head starts to have the faint feelings again and I got warm flushes, my hands and feet go cold and I’m legit wet with sweat.. it feels like I’m about to drop to the floor and die (BUT I never actually end up fainting). I started noticing other symptoms come on that are just disabling.. the pressure started going into my forehead, nose, face and really hard on my jaw and teeth (truly feels like they’re being pushed and squeezed) I just felt so disoriented like my head was going to pop and wasn’t a part of the rest of my body, the dizziness was bad, I truly have been laying down for over a week now. The worst I noticed was sometimes when I’m eating I notice my whole head face and mouth and like down to my neck would go numb and feel like I was floating and then the panick and faint would come back followed by the hot flush and sweating (so so scary). I don’t have confusion or loss of vision or double/blurry vision.. the dizziness doesn’t necessarily feel like vertigo it feels more internal as opposed to things around me spinning. Not extremely sensitive to light.. only a little bit to noise. I went back to the ER again and got more done (CT scan, more bloodwork and vitals) all came back perfect.  I also saw the specialist at the GIM clinic and again didn’t know what was wrong with me but reckoned it was migraine related vertigo. So I tried Advil and the vertigo medication (neither worked) and I actually ended up really sick (dry heaving, closed my eyes and felt like I had the spins from booze) wasn’t sure if this was the medication or added symptoms to what was already going on but either way I went to see my family doctor the next day who said it could be an inner ear infection so she prescribed me a nose spray and amoxicillin (antibiotics) but it’s been like 4 days and nothing has improved which worries me!!! I have no idea what’s going on I am crying and having anxiety everyday Does anyone have any idea what this could be I am losing hope and worrying this won’t go away PLEASE help    (Some additional symptoms- tingling in lips and face and ears.

Doctor said my bloodwork, vitals and ECG was fine so I just got sent to a general internal medicine clinic for the next week.  But things have only got worse from here    The next morning I woke up with skull crushing head pressure (all over head, base of skull, top of head, temples etc.) that makes my brain feel like it’s floating around in my head and pushing into my skull.. may I add my appetite has been completely off since Friday (31st of August) so I feel weak too. The head pressure was so bad that I felt like my head was being lifted up off of my neck then being pushed from the top/back (really such an uncomfortable feeling). When I stand or sit up right/eat for too long my head starts to have the faint feelings again and I got warm flushes, my hands and feet go cold and I’m legit wet with sweat.. it feels like I’m about to drop to the floor and die (BUT I never actually end up fainting). I started noticing other symptoms come on that are just disabling.. the pressure started going into my forehead, nose, face and really hard on my jaw and teeth (truly feels like they’re being pushed and squeezed) I just felt so disoriented like my head was going to pop and wasn’t a part of the rest of my body, the dizziness was bad, I truly have been laying down for over a week now. The worst I noticed was sometimes when I’m eating I notice my whole head face and mouth and like down to my neck would go numb and feel like I was floating and then the panick and faint would come back followed by the hot flush and sweating (so so scary). I don’t have confusion or loss of vision or double/blurry vision.. the dizziness doesn’t necessarily feel like vertigo it feels more internal as opposed to things around me spinning. Not extremely sensitive to light.. only a little bit to noise. I went back to the ER again and got more done (CT scan, more bloodwork and vitals) all came back perfect.  I also saw the specialist at the GIM clinic and again didn’t know what was wrong with me but reckoned it was migraine related vertigo. So I tried Advil and the vertigo medication (neither worked) and I actually ended up really sick (dry heaving, closed my eyes and felt like I had the spins from booze) wasn’t sure if this was the medication or added symptoms to what was already going on but either way I went to see my family doctor the next day who said it could be an inner ear infection so she prescribed me a nose spray and amoxicillin (antibiotics) but it’s been like 4 days and nothing has improved which worries me!!! I have no idea what’s going on I am crying and having anxiety everyday Does anyone have any idea what this could be I am losing hope and worrying this won’t go away PLEASE help    (Some additional symptoms- tingling in lips and face and ears.

Now the dizziness and sweating is slowly creeping back with any physical activity. I’ve only been taking the Metoprolol for 4 days, and it has helped a ton. I wonder if I will still continue to see improvements? Or maybe my body has adjusted to this dosage and I need to go higher? Along with the symptoms disappearing in the first few days, I noticed my resting heart rate was actually in the low to mid 70’s! Now it’s back up in the 90’s. I go back to my doctor tomorrow so I was just wondering if there were suggestions, advice, etc. Along with the medicine, he recommended compression socks, gluten free diet (I have frequent GI upset), and increased sodium intake.

I know i have been dealing with anxiety after I lost my ex to cancer. I became so stressed and anxious about my health which eventually lead to my first panic attack. Fast forward to may of this year the panic attacks became more frequent, I was dealing with tension in my chest and convinced myself I had angina and would have a heart attack if I worked out. One day I worked out and had the most intense panic attack ever, I was certain I was going to die. Since then I've been obsessed with checking my pulse and blood pressure having panic attacks regularly. I had my heart checked by a cardiologist had test ran and all was ok minus bp spikes from anxiety.  Here is where things start to not look like anxiety. Off and on after I'd had a panic attack or a full day of anxiety, my resting heart rate sometimes remain high for days or return to normal, however, when I stand, my hear jumps to 140 - 160 and slows to 120. I start getting really bad tension headache and blurred vision. I am not anxious when it happens or am not thinking about anything upsetting. This reaction last for weeks after I'd a panic attack. As if my sympathetic nervous system is stuck on.  This only started recently after I was diagnosed with panic disorder. I know they aren't panic attacks because my attacks are brought on by an obsession like thinking my bp us high and I check it and its high then I panic. Or feel a twitch in my stomach then I panic.  I checked my bp when standing and my bp doesn't really change much. It might go up if I panic but otherwise it remains pretty steady. But my hear increases way beyond what is normal.  Is this some form of pots? Can panic and anxiety cause dysautonomia? Or is it that due to overstimulation from all the stress, panic and anxiety, my sympathetic nervous system is responding innapropriately? I can't do anything without my heart racing and its really uncomfortable and hard to live like this.  0 likes, 2 replies "

I know i have been dealing with anxiety after I lost my ex to cancer. I became so stressed and anxious about my health which eventually lead to my first panic attack. Fast forward to may of this year the panic attacks became more frequent, I was dealing with tension in my chest and convinced myself I had angina and would have a heart attack if I worked out. One day I worked out and had the most intense panic attack ever, I was certain I was going to die. Since then I've been obsessed with checking my pulse and blood pressure having panic attacks regularly. I had my heart checked by a cardiologist had test ran and all was ok minus bp spikes from anxiety.  Here is where things start to not look like anxiety. Off and on after I'd had a panic attack or a full day of anxiety, my resting heart rate sometimes remain high for days or return to normal, however, when I stand, my hear jumps to 140 - 160 and slows to 120. I start getting really bad tension headache and blurred vision. I am not anxious when it happens or am not thinking about anything upsetting. This reaction last for weeks after I'd a panic attack. As if my sympathetic nervous system is stuck on.  This only started recently after I was diagnosed with panic disorder. I know they aren't panic attacks because my attacks are brought on by an obsession like thinking my bp us high and I check it and its high then I panic. Or feel a twitch in my stomach then I panic.  I checked my bp when standing and my bp doesn't really change much. It might go up if I panic but otherwise it remains pretty steady. But my hear increases way beyond what is normal.  Is this some form of pots? Can panic and anxiety cause dysautonomia? Or is it that due to overstimulation from all the stress, panic and anxiety, my sympathetic nervous system is responding innapropriately? I can't do anything without my heart racing and its really uncomfortable and hard to live like this.  0 likes, 2 replies "

The Second episode was when he was at work, he was out cold until the paramedics arrived. The third episode was when I was giving birth to our second daughter (although I know that’s not uncommon) unfortunately on this occasion he fell so heavily he fractured the back of his skull and was in hospital for a few days. The fourth episode was this morning, he got up to urinate and after going, felt hot so went to splash his face with water. He felt faint and managed to get himself onto the floor before he fell down.  Each time I have seen him immediately after fainting he is sweating profusely, slurring his words and is taking longer to come round each time. His HR this morning went down to 44bpm. After his second episode, we decided to get it investigated. He was seen by a cardiologist and a neurologist. He’s had multiple tests done over the years like ECG’s, Bloods, MRI, CT, EEG, and a Tilt Table Test. All of which came back normal.   Consultants couldn’t come to a conclusion as to why he faints, and said perhaps he’s just a fainter. Surely there is a reason why he faints?

Suddenly everything went black and I could hear noises of me falling and my phone falling off my hand and feel my head and arms hitting my table and then the floor. I didnt have any control over my body at the time and I had just fallen on the floor. Afterwards I was extremely confused and still cant believe that just happened so randomly.

I'm scheduled to see a neurosurgeon next month, but my doctor doesn't know if that's even the cause of my fainting. I am so tired all the time. My body constantly hurts, which they believe is from the hyper mobility. The vertigo is so much worse. Does anyone have any insight? Does Chiari seem like it could be the culprit? I have never read of a POTS patient with high and low readings, so I am startled, to say the least. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I was in the car with my husband (thank god he was driving that day). We were talking and all of a sudden I hear his voice fading away. Then I felt tunnel vision and sort of a “drowsiness” feeling. Feeling confused and lightheaded by then, I try to blink and look around my surroundings, and I felt as if I was almost fading away from everything (sort of the feeling when you are right about to fall asleep). I also remember my breath slowing down. I struggle not to “fall asleep” and try to keep my fluttering eyes open. I can feel my breathing being heavy and slow, I was sort of gasping for air. I manage to come back to normal and ask my husband what he was saying and if anything happened because for those short few seconds/minutes (I honestly have no clue how long this went on for in reality-to me it felt like a while) I couldn’t clearly recall what he had said. During this time, his words sounded very distant and then eventually I couldn’t hear anything. He asked me if I was OK. I think this sort of occurrence happened once before this and once after this again, but both of them were not as scary as this one. I don’t know if this is in any way related, but I do experience lightheadedness often (whether it is after standing up or random), Does anybody have any idea why this happened? 1 like, 2 replies "

It is difficult to tell how its started but the feeling is following - I feel a weird vibration/sensation feeling around my chest area which progresses to the head, includes dizziness and lightheadedness, sometimes it is followed by fainting (It happened 4 times when I completely fainted). I have this almost every day, did some tests and everything is fine except for hemoglobin and vitamin d (both pretty low). Different doctors are telling me different problems like one told me it might be anxiety (which I am not sure, I don't think I am so anxious I can faint (If I am at all), one told me It might because of the body rhythm and etc.  Does anyone ever have the same problem?

Kind of like a spaced out feeling all the time, with some mild eye floaters and some mild visual snow. A constant bounding pulse, which is visible in many parts of my body including, my stomach, my neck, my wrist, my groin etc even my feet. It is really frustrating as it rocks me about in bed at night and I struggle to sleep because of it. I can also hear my pulse loudly when I have my head on my pillow. , which is high pitched and very distracting Headaches which are almost constantly... These often feel like a sinus headache. I also have a few lymph nodes that can be felt which have been scanned and said to be reactive and just working normally. Possible IBS as well. So far I  have seen ENT, gastro, cardiology, neurology, immunology. I have head two head mri's, echo, colonoscopy, immuno investigations to name a few but everything is coming back good. I've even done an at home tilt table test and my bp and hr were fine. I am a 29 year old male who was previously a fit, active gym goer. Before this I had a stomach bug which I seemed to recover from, however I am not sure if it is a potential cause or seperate. I've suffered with lower back pain to for many years, which I have just put down to the gym and sports. If anybody has some insight or useful knowledge, I would be extremely greatful.

I broke my wrist badly at the end of August last year which is when my problems all seemed to start. i I also wonder if the metal plate that was used to fix the fracture could be causing some kind of strange reaction. If anyone else is having these symptoms please let me know if you've been able to identify the cause and how to deal with it.   3 likes, 192 replies "

Shortly after a week of taking Azathioprine I became unwell; completely lost my appetite (due to sometime feeling full or even sick); developed a high temperature; had some dizzy spells; experienced severe aching in joints and muscles from head to foot; developed a severe outbreak of spots all over head and neck as well as on chest back and limbs to a lesser extent. Unfortunately I had thought that the initial effects that I was seeing (temperature, aching) were associated with lowered resistance to a cold to which I had been exposed, rather than an actual reaction to the drug. Fortunately I had been in close touch with my GP that week and his support was excellent.  Once off of the drug the reversal of symptons was very quick, most within a day, and now only a couple of days later I feel much better again, and only a very small proportion of the spots remain. In hindsight I can see how ill I became, but at the time I think that mentally I also couldn't function efficiently (conversation and concentration were extremely difficult) making it hard to see how its effect had been gradually worsening as I continued to take the drug.  I think this shows that it's important to remember how side effects can build up gradually and not always appear instantly one or two days after you start a course of treatment. "

I was recently admitted to hospital after visiting my GP with persistant stomach pain (about 2 months on and off) and to cut a long story short, a CT scan showed an inflamed bowel which I was told was most likely down to Crohns diesese. I ened up having a small section of bowel removed by the surgeon, and am now back to normal - e.g. no pain or discomfort what so ever, eating and drinking normally, normal bowel movements... in fact you'd never know I had been ill!  Now on a follow up at the hospital I have been prescribed Azathioprine tablets. I was given a 30 minute pep-talk by a pharmacist explaining the drug, which if I'm honest terrified me. Risk of cancer, nausea, feeling unwell, reduced bone marrow etc... In fact, lots of very unpleasant side effects. Basically, I feel great right now; 100%, and it sounds like these tablets will make me feel 'not great.' I want to talk to the consultant before I start taking them, but cant get appt until April. From reading posts on the forum, and some general research, it sounds like Azathioprine is used to control inflamation during flare ups, or treat chronic Crohns that is affecting quality of life? Yet I have no symptoms, no pain or discomfort, and feel great. I appreciate that Azathioprine can also be used to prevent Crohns from coming back again, but with all the associated risks, and I gather you can only take it for a total of around five years before it stops working, is now the right time for me to be starting this drug? Should it not be held in reserve in case I have problems in the future? Yes, I will be guided by my doctor, but until I can get to see him, I just wanted to get some feedback from anyone else on here using Azathioprine. Has anyone been in my position and started taking it? Sorry if I sound like an idiot - I'm feeling very confused and a little concerned about this drug. Do I really want to take something that will make me feel worse than I do now, and possibly even give me cancer? Any feedback greatfully received!    3 likes, 42 replies "

He then referred me to a gastroenterologist. The gastroenterologist checked for blood in my feces and there was none and he did a CBC and CMP blood test. The only thing that came back wrong was a low white blood cell count. So for the next month, my family care doctor ordered three more CBC tests, along with a SED Rate test, Peripheral Smear (immaturity not observed), CRP C-REACTIVE PROTEIN, Parvovirus, IRON AND TBC, HIV, HEPATITIS PANEL ACUTE, EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS, and COMP METABOLIC PANEL blood tests. Everything was normal and good except that my white blood cell count values were low from 2.8-3.8 during that time, a high monocyte percentage of 11.8, and it was noted I have bilirubinemia. Through much of October and early November my symptoms went away again except for the fatigue but now I am experiencing much of the same symptoms again.

I am a 22 year old male, weighing approximately 158 and am 6 feet tall. In mid-July I was started to feel a lot of discomfort in my stomach and abdominal area along with nausea, bloating, and constipation. It got worse after eating. All the symptoms left in early August but then came back in early September. So, I went to my family care doctor and he ex-rayed my stomach to show that there was air in my colon. He then referred me to a gastroenterologist. The gastroenterologist checked for blood in my feces and there was none and he did a CBC and CMP blood test. The only thing that came back wrong was a low white blood cell count. So for the next month, my family care doctor ordered three more CBC tests, along with a SED Rate test, Peripheral Smear (immaturity not observed), CRP C-REACTIVE PROTEIN, Parvovirus, IRON AND TBC, HIV, HEPATITIS PANEL ACUTE, EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS, and COMP METABOLIC PANEL blood tests. Everything was normal and good except that my white blood cell count values were low from 2.8-3.8 during that time, a high monocyte percentage of 11.8, and it was noted I have bilirubinemia. Through much of October and early November my symptoms went away again except for the fatigue but now I am experiencing much of the same symptoms again. As of last week I was referred to a hematologist and he took my blood in four or five tubes. I go back in mid-December to see what he says. The hematologist also asked me to go to a gi doctor while I wait so I did today. My gastrointestinal doctor said it was mostly out of his hands because all my blood tests only show a low white blood cell count. So, he put me on two medicines to help me use the restroom (#2) more frequently. Could anyone lead me to possible causes of the low white blood cell count with the stomach/abdominal pain and the fatigue? I am quite nervous about what it could be because at this point I have no clue. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!  1 like, 38 replies "

I am sharing my full story in Hope's it gives someone comfort. however, I am not a doctor and this is just my experience. It all started with swollen lymph nodes in my groin in 2017. After 6 months of never going away a biopsy was done, around the same time several new ones appeared in my left armpit. The biopsy came back all clear. I was then concerned about the multiple lymph nodes in my armpit, a few were confirmed 3cm in size. from early 2018 through 2019 I began to experience abdominal pain and issues, pain in my left shoulder,  pain in my left pectoral, pain in my back, and pain up the left side of my neck. I found 2 lymph nodes in my neck and one under my jaw.. again all on the left side. Although they were there, these nodes were much smaller than those in my armpit. I then began experiencing pain behind my right knee and lower right groin again. I was going crazy! After several x rays, CT's, and two ultrasounds we decided to biopsy a node from my armpit. Both of my biopsies were excision and removed completely. I got my result on this past Monday and again it came back benign. What is going on?? right. They think it may be autoimmune and more testing is underway, but it could also be nothing. Apparently your lymph nodes can simply swell for no identifiable reason or swelled up a while back and just remained large indefinitely. My doc thinks the pain in my shoulder and chest led me to identify the nodes, which then put my mind in overdrive. Why wouldn't it? both sides should feel somewhat similar so I was obviously concerned. Thousands of dollars later I am done with surgeries and biopsies and will be doing what I can to improve my health. Eat better, exercise more, take antihistamines (because this can apparently help), and stress a little less. feel free to ask any questions you have. 0 likes, 1 reply "

My 8 year old son is a G6PD confirmed child. He always has this sudden increase of body temperature but doesn't go up to 38°C so it is not considered as a fever.  I really wonder what makes him warmer than the normal body temperature. His hands, feet and whole body is warmer than usual. It concerns me a lot but unfortunately, doctors here in my area aren't that aware of G6PD. Does it have to do with his G6PD? Or can somebody here might have some informative advice about this. I would be really glad to have some conversations with you. Thank you. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I don't have any swollen nodes and I recently had a chest x ray because I had a blocked colon. But, most recently, I noticed that when I drink alcohol, the left side of my neck hurts (it's like a stretching pain, not a sharp pain. But, my neck also hurts when I look to the left because I sleep weird, but I don't feel the pain like this throughout the day), but I am freaking out because I googled this and it said that this is a sign of Hodgkins Lymphoma.  Could this just be because I'm thinking about it?  I have no swollen nodes.

I'm now back to about the weight I was when this started. In June, an iron test came back with ferritin levels at 1050 ug/L, then in September another test was over 1500ug/L. I had a CT scan in October that ruled out asbestos related lung illness, as I had had prior exposure to asbestos.  My transferrin saturation was tested in October, and came back in a normal range (35%), so hemochromatosis was ruled out. I've been tested for various fungi, moulds, asthma, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, mono, and everything has come back negative. I had an abdominal CT scan done in late January, and there is no obvious inflammation or cancer. My doctor had suspected possible lymphoma, which isn't there. In our meeting yesterday, he was about to suggest watchful waiting.  I feel like death warmed over, and asked him about Ferroportin disease, having read some posts on this site. He admitted not knowing much about it, but agreed to another ferritin test, and said if it was still high, he would refer me to someone else to investigate that. He said he would have to figure out who to refer me to. I had that ferritin test taken yesterday, and will have a follow up appointment in two weeks. We'll see what happens from there. I presume he will refer me to a hematologist if I still have high ferritin? I have had unusual skin pigmentation since November--I look like I've been on a beach all summer, except that I have no tanlines, and the insides of my arms are unusually almost the same colour as my forearms. I've had high blood pressure for about 3 years (normal with meds), that I imagine could be connected to my other symptoms. In December, my shoulders started hurting badly, almost constantly, and most days my fingers feel arthritic, even without any major activity. I'm starting to experience what I would describe as ""brain fog"". I lose my train of thought easily, and am forgetting things I normally would not. My doctor didn't run any genetic tests, as he figured that the normal transferrin saturation ruled out standard hemochromatosis.

I'm after some advice for my husband, who is 68.  There's  been something not right for ages.  He's very lethargic/fatigued, suffers with skin complaints, mild confusion and memory loss. He's had numerous blood tests including LFTs and the only tests that have come back abnormal are ferritin at 860 and transferrin at 60%.  He has access to his online record which now says, suspect Haemochromatosis. My query is, what should happen next?   He's quite anxious and wants answers.  It's always a wait for appointments at our doctors, so when we do go, we want to ask all the right questions.  Thanks. Edit:  I've just remembered, his platelet count is low and urea is high, although neither result seemed to bother the GP.  Perhaps these results are concerning, in light of the possible diagnosis? 0 likes, 16 replies "

As I am writing this post it is 11:30pm and am in the bath again (3rd Time since I’ve been home). I Also would like to add that I am using extremely hot water because that seems to help better but am wondering if that could be harmful to the surgical area (any input would be greatly appreciated). The pain meds make me really tired but am not able to sleep for more than 15 mins because the pain wakes me up.  All in all so far it is every bit as painful as advertised and i ABSOLUTELY DREAD when I have to have my first bowel movement. I am hoping that this doesn’t become one of those horror stories but so far it has been. But on the bright side, it has only been about 6 hours post op.  I will be updating this frequently so feel free to any questions.  3 likes, 49 replies "

Forgive me in advance for the long post but I am trying to be as detailed as possible.  First of all, I am a 33 years old male, 5’6 and 110 lbs. I have suffered from hemorrhoids since my teen years but within the last few years they have seriously affecting my life. I had 2 very large grade 3 internal,  2 external hemorrhoids and an extremely painful  . I had the 2 internal ones banded in April of last year but it didn’t work.  My surgeon suggested that I do a complete Hemorrhoidectomy of int and ex hemorrhoids along with a sphinterotomy, HOWEVER, I have decided not to do the sphincterotomy because I was afraid of getting incontinence.  DAY 1: I woke up in recovery at 6:00pm in excruciating pain, was given dilaudid thru IV with no relief and again about 15 mins later and then fentanyl about 10 mins after that and then 10mg of oxycodone by mouth, all which didn’t even touch the pain. I was then taken back to my room to get discharged. While waiting for the discharge nurse I decided to try to urinate but only a few drops came out. I then Signed my discharge papers and was wheeled out to my car and my father drove me home. During the car ride home (about 20 mins) the pain was still the same, I got home around 8:00pm, took stool softeners and ran a bath which offered some welcomed relief, repeated the bath about 30 mins later, ate some soup and crackers and took my second dose of 10mg of oxycodone and 1,000mg of Tylenol at 10:00pm.

I wanted to share a day by day experience of my hemorrhoidectomy and Lateral Internal Sphincterotomy surgery and recovery. I had read every single story on here before I went for the surgery myself, and I’m not going to lie, they were really scary and I almost called it off.  However, I wanted to provide a somewhat positive story to counter balance the more negative ones out there.  If you are considering this surgery - it is only day 3 and I am already happy I did it.  I will add the caveat - I only had one external hemorrhoid removed.  I also have read a few medical studies that say LIS helps with hemorrhoidectomy recovery. Prior to surgery, I was very anxious and therefore I did not eat much two days before.  I’m not sure if I recommend this or not, and wouldn’t want to suggest anyone not eat.  I also started stool softener about two weeks before, and started eating clean two weeks before. I also highly recommend installing a bidet - I got one off of Amazon for really cheap and it’s been the best thing for recovery so far, because you don’t need to wipe as much and irritate the area Day 1 - Surgery day I arrived two hours before my procedure.  I was not instructed to do any bowel prep, just not to eat past midnight the day before. They get me in the gown and insert the IV.  I meet with my surgeon, 3 different nurses, and the anesthesiologist.  They’re very kind and reassuring (I was definitely in a bit of a panicked state).  They were able to get me in early and before I knew it I was asleep! I wake up in recovery and feel nausea, which they give me something for that makes me feel better immediately.  I did not have any pain.  I did have a terrible uneasy feeling which apparently is common. All in all, I was at the hospital for 4 1/2 hours from start to finish. Day one is uneventful otherwise.  I go home, I have some chicken noodle soup with crackers and take my first Percocet to try and stay ahead of the pain.  I also take stool softener and Zofran for nausea from the pain meds.  I take my next Percocet 8 hours later, then drift in and out of sleep.  I then had some bone broth with more crackers later on that day.  No pain all day today! Day 2 - Day after surgery The morning of day 2 is just like day 1.  I wonder if I even had surgery, that’s how good I felt.  I was able to get up and walk around and do some very light housework.  I felt like I had to go to the bathroom, so I try for my first bowel movement that morning which is unsuccessful but not painful.  I am noticing some gas and that if kinda just comes out on it’s own, but this is normal.  I had some chicken and rice soup, of which I barely ate the rice.  I also was able to take a shower, which felt really amazing.  I am still taking Percocet every 6 hours but find I am often counting down until the next one as the day goes on.  Take the pain pills if you are able, trust me.  This is no time to be a tough guy! I tried two more times today to have a BM with no luck, but very little pain.  I think the fear of pain was keeping me from going. I ate some miso soup, and I then ate some more chicken soup and crackers.  I also ate an avocado to try and get some fiber.  I managed to have an extremely pathetically small BM towards the end of the day.  It was a victory though! I ended up having the BM in the Sitz bath, but honestly, no shame at this point. Then right before bed I started to develop really bad neck and abdominal muscle pain.  Like you get after a really hard workout x20.  No fever, so it’s only what I assume is post surgery soreness.  This was the worst of it so far, and Percocet only helped a little.  Eventually I was able to go to sleep. Day 3 In the morning I had a successful BM with no pain! It was runny and only partially solid, but my surgeon said that was probably a good way to have them for the first week or so.  I was so nervous about pain but I just let nature do it’s thing and didn’t force it.  Kinda just let it “fall” out of you if you can and it’ll be a much better time. Still having the neck and abdominal pain, but nothing too terrible.  The Percocet every 6 hours is still greatly appreciated but I can see myself not needing it soon. I will continue to keep this updated!  All in all, probably max 4.5/10 on the pain scale so far, and mainly from the body soreness! 2 likes, 13 replies "

I had appointments with the hospital (UK- NHS) on and off for about 18 months and was repeatedly told that they're been banded and i should be fine.  The problem continued and I kept going back. After one particular sigmoidoscopy the nurse was wheeling me back and was saying everything was fine. It was at this point i had to stop her and said no, everything wasnt fine. I explained id been in several times before and I kept getting told i was fine only to go home and bleed profusely. The bleeding was excessive to the point that I was anemic and was on verge of a transfusion.  Upon hearing this, the nurse took me back into the surgeon who said he would have another look. I dont know HOW differently he looked but he told me I had an extreme case of circumferencial hemorrhoids that were actively bleeding as i was on the table and that surgery would be required.   I had a weird sense of dread and relief. FINALLY they've found the problem but OH GOD, SURGERY.  I woke after the surgery and was discharged soon after having been told that i may have some discomfort but  healing time would be 2-3 days.  I say this with no exaggeration or dramatics but that was just absolute inaccurate bullsh*t.  I was in excrutiating pain when the morphine wore off. I couldnt move without severe pain, I couldnt walk or stand up or do anything without help and severe pain.  I didnt need to go the toilet until the following day and every single minute motion caused severe pain and the act of actually passing my stool was almost unbearable.  To give you some perspective on me and my threashold. I've been knocked over by a car and fractured by skull, I've broken my hip, pelvis and elbow in a bad fall, ive had tattoos etc etc....NOTHING comes close to how painful this was.  I dont tell you this to put you off....i tell you this because at one point i found myself sat on the toilet almost in tears (LOL i have to laugh at this now!) wondering if this pain would ever actually end and it was in this mood that i came across this website. It was a weird relief to read that other people have had horrendous experinces too and that it was not just me. I read about having sitz baths and what foods could help with toilet visits etc and I actually had some hope that I would get better. The only thing that helped with toilet visits was showering after. I cralwed into the shower after each visit and let the warm water wash me up and it soothed the burning pain considerably.   I was bed ridden for 3 weeks and even when i could move around a bit easier on my own, i had these muscle spasms that would come on unexpectedly, cause a short blast of pain and then disappear.  All in all i experinced pain to varying degrees for around a month. I had on and off bleeding for around 1 - 2 months to the point that the doctor actually recommended i wear sanitary pads which i did!  The recovery obviously depends on how serious the piles are but if they ARE serious, you can expect a horrible bumpy ride after. I say this....because I wish someone had told ME this so i at least knew what to expect other than being told id be out of action for 2-3 days.

The bleeding was excessive to the point that I was anemic and was on verge of a transfusion.  Upon hearing this, the nurse took me back into the surgeon who said he would have another look. I dont know HOW differently he looked but he told me I had an extreme case of circumferencial hemorrhoids that were actively bleeding as i was on the table and that surgery would be required.   I had a weird sense of dread and relief. FINALLY they've found the problem but OH GOD, SURGERY.  I woke after the surgery and was discharged soon after having been told that i may have some discomfort but  healing time would be 2-3 days.  I say this with no exaggeration or dramatics but that was just absolute inaccurate bullsh*t.  I was in excrutiating pain when the morphine wore off. I couldnt move without severe pain, I couldnt walk or stand up or do anything without help and severe pain.  I didnt need to go the toilet until the following day and every single minute motion caused severe pain and the act of actually passing my stool was almost unbearable.  To give you some perspective on me and my threashold. I've been knocked over by a car and fractured by skull, I've broken my hip, pelvis and elbow in a bad fall, ive had tattoos etc etc....NOTHING comes close to how painful this was.  I dont tell you this to put you off....i tell you this because at one point i found myself sat on the toilet almost in tears (LOL i have to laugh at this now!) wondering if this pain would ever actually end and it was in this mood that i came across this website. It was a weird relief to read that other people have had horrendous experinces too and that it was not just me. I read about having sitz baths and what foods could help with toilet visits etc and I actually had some hope that I would get better. The only thing that helped with toilet visits was showering after. I cralwed into the shower after each visit and let the warm water wash me up and it soothed the burning pain considerably.   I was bed ridden for 3 weeks and even when i could move around a bit easier on my own, i had these muscle spasms that would come on unexpectedly, cause a short blast of pain and then disappear.  All in all i experinced pain to varying degrees for around a month. I had on and off bleeding for around 1 - 2 months to the point that the doctor actually recommended i wear sanitary pads which i did!  The recovery obviously depends on how serious the piles are but if they ARE serious, you can expect a horrible bumpy ride after.

I had suffered from haemorrhoids for 20+ years and it is only because I became severely anaemic due to blood loss from passing stools that I was forced to do the operation. With hindsight I could have avoided 20 years of misery, of lost sports, of severe discomfort in cars and planes by taking the plunge and doing it earlier.   First and foremost, Haemorrhoidectomy is a very common operation and albeit there is a very small percentage where things get complicated the cases are getting less and less each year. I'm saying this because each and every person that does this operation will pass through so much pain that instinctively he or she will think that they are one of the few that is unlucky.   Secondly the pain WILL PASS! I repeat it WILL PASS! The absolutely horrible, can't take it anymore, about to throw up, about to faint, never going to be the same, never going to be happy, stuffiness, bloated feeling, blade cutting through your backside pain WILL PASS!   Realistically a person who does this operation will experience two annoying factors namely pain and discomfort. In the first few days the pain is so bad that you cannot think of anything else including the discomfort. After that the pain between going to the bathroom will slowly subside but the discomfort will increase primarily due to constipation. Hereunder please find my tips and what I would do differently if I could go back in time.   1.   Increase your intake of fresh fruit and vegetables and water weeks before the operation to soften your stools and prepare your body for a life change. This diet change is a must EVEN AFTER the operation unless you’re a masochist and want to pass through it again. 2.   Cut out anything that might make you constipated – research. This includes alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, refined foods etc. 3.   Do a fresh water enema the day before the operation. 4.   Do a list of all the things you missed out on because of your condition and promise yourself to enjoy life more after the operation and to take care more of your physical well being. 5.   Mentally prepare that you are going to be in severe pain but also be aware that this is only temporary and that you’ll be tons better after that and the effort would have been worth it. Incidentally I was in excruciating pain for about 5 days, in agonising pain 5 days after that and in manageable pain 5 days after that. By the end of the second week I was 60% better. By the end of the fourth week I was 90% better with only the annoying leakage to take care of. By the end of the fifth week I’m 95% there. 6.   Try and limit pain killer as much as possible as they will slow your digestive system and the resulting constipation is worse than the pain. 7.   The feeling of still feeling massive haemorrhoids after the operation is normal. This is due to the swelling. The importance of having formed stools that are SOFT is important. Underline formed not diarrhoea as you need your system to re-function even if it means a little more pain. 8.   The feeling of passing sharp blades during the first few days is unavoidable. This mixed with blood and excrement is not a pretty felling or site but I PROMISE YOU it will get better. 9.   Keep the are dry otherwise you’ll develop sever rash – been there done that – more pain to avoid. 10.                 Keep moving. The more you move the better your digestive system works, the less laxatives, the less bloated feeling, the happier you will be. 11.                 Be prepared to go the bathroom at a moments notice. 12.                 Run a warm sitz bath often – it does wonders to sooth the pain 13.                 Squat not sit to pass stools. It’s easier to excrete, less painful and quicker. I’m still squatting and there is no way I’m going back to sitting. Before I sometime spent between 30 – 45 min on the loo. Now I’m in an out in 3 minutes. 14.                 Keep the area clean. Use a bidet, shower or whatever you want. Use only toilet paper to pat dry the excess water. Again with hindsight this should be norm. After all if you covered you hand in excrement you wouldn’t simply wipe it off with toilet paper but you’d wash the hell out of it. 15.                 Drink lots of water and take a reasonable amount of fibre. Taking fibre without water is a recipe for disaster. 16.                 You are going to have to live with sanitary pads for a few weeks until the area heals sufficiently. It will get gradually better. I have gained a new respect for women who have to wear these things once a month; very annoying. 17.                 After you recover promise yourself to share your positive experience and the things that worked out for you on a blog for the benefit of others. It’s kind of a chain get better advice blog. 18.                 Most important of all – KEEP POSITIVE and take care of your health. You only have one body.     26 likes, 286 replies "

By the end of the fifth week I’m 95% there. 6.   Try and limit pain killer as much as possible as they will slow your digestive system and the resulting constipation is worse than the pain. 7.   The feeling of still feeling massive haemorrhoids after the operation is normal. This is due to the swelling. The importance of having formed stools that are SOFT is important. Underline formed not diarrhoea as you need your system to re-function even if it means a little more pain. 8.   The feeling of passing sharp blades during the first few days is unavoidable. This mixed with blood and excrement is not a pretty felling or site but I PROMISE YOU it will get better. 9.   Keep the are dry otherwise you’ll develop sever rash – been there done that – more pain to avoid. 10.                 Keep moving. The more you move the better your digestive system works, the less laxatives, the less bloated feeling, the happier you will be. 11.                 Be prepared to go the bathroom at a moments notice. 12.                 Run a warm sitz bath often – it does wonders to sooth the pain 13.                 Squat not sit to pass stools. It’s easier to excrete, less painful and quicker. I’m still squatting and there is no way I’m going back to sitting. Before I sometime spent between 30 – 45 min on the loo. Now I’m in an out in 3 minutes. 14.                 Keep the area clean. Use a bidet, shower or whatever you want. Use only toilet paper to pat dry the excess water. Again with hindsight this should be norm. After all if you covered you hand in excrement you wouldn’t simply wipe it off with toilet paper but you’d wash the hell out of it. 15.                 Drink lots of water and take a reasonable amount of fibre. Taking fibre without water is a recipe for disaster. 16.                 You are going to have to live with sanitary pads for a few weeks until the area heals sufficiently. It will get gradually better. I have gained a new respect for women who have to wear these things once a month; very annoying. 17.                 After you recover promise yourself to share your positive experience and the things that worked out for you on a blog for the benefit of others. It’s kind of a chain get better advice blog. 18.                 Most important of all – KEEP POSITIVE and take care of your health. You only have one body.     26 likes, 286 replies "

The doctor warned me that recovery process would be painful. But I didn't think it would be this intense. Here are a few tips to ease the pain. It made a world of difference in pain management for me: 1) ice packs-- most ice packs are not shaped for your butt and the flat ones only numb the butt cheeks,  not the surgical site where you need relief. So make your own! Buy diapers (any size 3-6) and fill it with 3-4 cups of water and put it in a ziplock bag (for hygienic storage) and in the freezer. Once frozen, the diapers are curved perfectly to your anus area and won't drip as it melts either because the gel is designed to hold in liquid. I use one diaper several times before tossing. Just put it in a ziplock bag and refreeze.  2) squirt bottles--clean yourself with squirt bottles, not even wet toilet paper or baby wipes were gentle enough post surgery when the area is extremely raw. I bought two big squirt bottles at the drug store and fill them up before any bowel movements.  3) Boneal-- after cleaning the anus with the squirt bottles, I apply boneal (otc lotion for anal cleaning) lotion on toilet paper and dab it on my anus. It relieves the pain and itching that come later in the healing process.  4) sitz bath-- Do this 2-3 times a day and definitely after a bowel movement. Sometimes, I have my bowel movements in the sitz bath to ease the pain. Just remember to rinse it with soap and hot water right away if you have a bowel movement in there so you don't sit in fecal water and develop a uti on top of everything else. 5) if possible, stick to lots of veggies and soups for the first two weeks to allow the wound to heal. No starchy foods and anything binding!!!  These tips were given to me by the maternity nurses after I had a baby, but they are completely relevant here and I am especially grateful for the ice pack diaper trick! It was the ONLY way an ice pack can be applied to that anus area and not to my butt cheeks. Good luck and speedy recovery. BTW-- get all this ready, especially the diaper ice packs before surgery so you will have it immediately after you come home from surgery. You'll be in so much pain and not very mobile, so have all the relief remedies prepared ahead of time! 12 likes, 423 replies "

I had chemo 4 years ago for ovarian cancer so that is when I was most constipated. She said the skin tag could be removed in office with shots in the anal area.  Um, no.  She then said, because I have a previous cancer diagnosis and my aunt died of colon cancer, I qualified to get a colonoscopy.  She could take it off the skin tag during the colonoscopy. She would cut it off and cauterize it. I decided to do it.  I was told I would need a week to recover. The prep was the worst.  I got through 7/8ths of the prep before I threw up.  Then I waited two hours to drink the remaining prep. The next day I felt nauseated but didn't throw up again. The colonoscopy portion went ok.  The IV was fine because they gave me some numbing medicine.  I have had a lot of IVs and they are way easier with the numbing shot first. However, when I was in the procedure room, the anesthesiologist pushed the meds through my IV way too fast, it totally burned, way more than it burned with chemo. Then I quickly fell asleep. I woke up afterwards with gauze in my bum.  They sent me home and I drank a milkshake to calm my stomach, then I went straight to sleep.  I woke up later and ate a small dinner and took a normal dose of Miralax.  Then I took a bath.  I tried removing the gauze early on in the bath but it hurt. So I waited for the bath water to let the gauze float off.  Then it didn't hurt.  That night I took another normal dose of Miralax. The next day I pooped, but it didn't hurt. It was very loose.  So daily I have been told to take 3 baths a day AND after every poop. I have been taking two doses of Miralax a day and it has totally worked to keep my poop loose and pain free. My doctor had said to take a different stool softener but I know Miralax works for me so that is why I am taking it. My doc gave me a SPRIX prescription. It is an anti-inflammatory pain reliever that is a nasal spray.  Follow the directions and it won't burn as much. Holding your breath is key.  I have found it to be helpful in reducing the swelling of my anal wound and the pain has decreased. I am on day 3.

Then the person goes MIA when people ask for a update.  So some back story im 27, and had my surgery on 11/23/17. So in about a week i will be at the 6 month mark. I had 4 hemorrhoids removed all together. 3 smaller internal ones and one medium sized external one. Overall would i do it again? definitely, but there is alot of stuff i wish i knew before hand.  Plan on taking atleast 2 weeks off of work, more if you in any kind of driving job/physical labor job. If you fall into that category take a month off if you can, if your doing physical labor take it easy for atleast 2 months. My doctor originally told me i would be back on my feet within 3-5 days. But i spent the first week pretty much laying in bed on my side. After about a week i was able to walk around and do normal activities somewhat, but it was not a comfortable experience at all. Bending over hurt, walking up and down stairs hurt, getting in and out of the car hurt and i pretty much carried a pillow around everywhere i went. Overall though i think the 2nd week was worst than the first. You should get some good pain meds to get you through the first week or so, but once they run out you start to feel everything u didnt feel the first week, plus combined with the fact you going to be moving around more. If i had to do it again, i probably would have suffered more the first week and taken less meds then saved them for the 2nd/3rd week. A word of advice looking back is even though you are in pain you should take the minimum amount of pain meds you can. They will make you constipated and the last thing you want after hemorrhoid surgery is to be constipated. Trust me i learned that hard way. Start taking fiber pills a week or so before surgery and dont stop until you feel 100% better. Try not to eat anything hard either. I pretty much ate, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese and bought a bunch of those ensure drinks for the first two weeks. You want whatever is going in you to come out as easy as you can. Liquids/soft foods are your friend. It took me about 4 days after my surgery to finally use the bathroom (why i said dont take to many pain pill) and im not going to lie it was excruciating. It took about 2weeks in total to be able to use the bathroom without being in alot of pain and 3 weeks for it be be ""comfortable"". But the first two weeks were definitely the worst. I legit almost passed out i was in so much pain a few times. Dont push just sit and wait. If it doesnt work try again later. You will be in there for a bit, take you time. Over all id say it took about a month to use the bathroom normally. I bled almost every single time for the first 2-3 weeks. Then it slowly stopped over time. In the end it took about 2 months for me to stop bleeding. Also dont be afraid if you look in the mirror and see what it looks like. Its going to look horrible the first month or so. But after about a month most of the swelling should have gone down and it will start to look more ""normal"". Within 1-2 months id say about 50-75% of the swelling should be gone depending on how much work you needed.  It took me about a month in total for me to be back to doing my normal activities without being to uncomfortable. The only real issues i had was sitting for to long, or bending over to pick stuff up. It isnt really a pain, its more of a tightness, kind of the feeling of having a pulled muscle. I was originally told the swelling/tightness would last for 2-3 months. For me i say that more of a minimum. While the swelling went down alot after 2 months (id say about 75%) the tightness and stiffness stuck around. I went back to the doctor at the 4 month mark to ask him about it and he told me i still had some healing going on for the external one and to give it a month or two. After 5 months the stiffness has gone away, now that im coming up on month number 6 and i would say im about 99% back to normal. Which sort of makes sense since scar tissue takes around 5 months to heal. While 6 months seems like a long time to deal with this its really more like 2 months of actual pain. The third month your going to be annoyed here and there by it, and 4-6 you should start to forget you even had the surgery.  The only real issue id say after its all said and done is i still have some loose skin where the stitches were on the eternal one. When i mentioned it to the doctor on the 4th month he said it can be easily removed with a office procedure in about 2 minutes if i wanted. But i should wait to see if it goes down a bit. I originally had a little loose skin on the other side (from the internal one swelling) when talked to him and thats completely gone now. So i figured id wait another month or to see what happens before i have that done. But once that is gone it will almost look like i never had the surgery at all.  Overall im really happy i had it done. Yeah it sucked for a few months, but ive been dealing with them since i was 15 years old. So 5 months of pain to no longer deal with hemorrhoids was well worth it. Id definitly do it again if needed (but i pray i never have to) lol Lastly this might fall into the TMI catagory but im bi some im going to include this for the girls/guys out there who like anal sex because when i searched i found almost nothing. One of my concerns about this whole thing was my sex life. My advice is take a break for atleast 5-6 months before you try to put anything in there, then when you do start small. I tried around month 4 and it hurt alot, wait till your feeling 100% better then wait a extra month. Your getting a new a**hole in the end. Imagine the first time you ever put something in there, well thats how its going to be again. If you feel any discomfort, just wait a bit longer. I tried again about a week ago, and while it still wasnt easy it was 100x easier then it was at month 4. So you sex life isnt gone, its just postponed a bit and you need to slowly get back into it. It was a night and day difference between month 4 and 6, so i assume its going to get even easier as time goes on.  1 like, 3 replies "

Then the person goes MIA when people ask for a update.  So some back story im 27, and had my surgery on 11/23/17. So in about a week i will be at the 6 month mark. I had 4 hemorrhoids removed all together. 3 smaller internal ones and one medium sized external one. Overall would i do it again? definitely, but there is alot of stuff i wish i knew before hand.  Plan on taking atleast 2 weeks off of work, more if you in any kind of driving job/physical labor job. If you fall into that category take a month off if you can, if your doing physical labor take it easy for atleast 2 months. My doctor originally told me i would be back on my feet within 3-5 days. But i spent the first week pretty much laying in bed on my side. After about a week i was able to walk around and do normal activities somewhat, but it was not a comfortable experience at all. Bending over hurt, walking up and down stairs hurt, getting in and out of the car hurt and i pretty much carried a pillow around everywhere i went. Overall though i think the 2nd week was worst than the first. You should get some good pain meds to get you through the first week or so, but once they run out you start to feel everything u didnt feel the first week, plus combined with the fact you going to be moving around more. If i had to do it again, i probably would have suffered more the first week and taken less meds then saved them for the 2nd/3rd week. A word of advice looking back is even though you are in pain you should take the minimum amount of pain meds you can. They will make you constipated and the last thing you want after hemorrhoid surgery is to be constipated. Trust me i learned that hard way. Start taking fiber pills a week or so before surgery and dont stop until you feel 100% better. Try not to eat anything hard either. I pretty much ate, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese and bought a bunch of those ensure drinks for the first two weeks. You want whatever is going in you to come out as easy as you can. Liquids/soft foods are your friend. It took me about 4 days after my surgery to finally use the bathroom (why i said dont take to many pain pill) and im not going to lie it was excruciating. It took about 2weeks in total to be able to use the bathroom without being in alot of pain and 3 weeks for it be be ""comfortable"". But the first two weeks were definitely the worst. I legit almost passed out i was in so much pain a few times. Dont push just sit and wait. If it doesnt work try again later. You will be in there for a bit, take you time. Over all id say it took about a month to use the bathroom normally. I bled almost every single time for the first 2-3 weeks. Then it slowly stopped over time. In the end it took about 2 months for me to stop bleeding. Also dont be afraid if you look in the mirror and see what it looks like. Its going to look horrible the first month or so. But after about a month most of the swelling should have gone down and it will start to look more ""normal"". Within 1-2 months id say about 50-75% of the swelling should be gone depending on how much work you needed.  It took me about a month in total for me to be back to doing my normal activities without being to uncomfortable. The only real issues i had was sitting for to long, or bending over to pick stuff up. It isnt really a pain, its more of a tightness, kind of the feeling of having a pulled muscle. I was originally told the swelling/tightness would last for 2-3 months. For me i say that more of a minimum. While the swelling went down alot after 2 months (id say about 75%) the tightness and stiffness stuck around. I went back to the doctor at the 4 month mark to ask him about it and he told me i still had some healing going on for the external one and to give it a month or two. After 5 months the stiffness has gone away, now that im coming up on month number 6 and i would say im about 99% back to normal. Which sort of makes sense since scar tissue takes around 5 months to heal. While 6 months seems like a long time to deal with this its really more like 2 months of actual pain. The third month your going to be annoyed here and there by it, and 4-6 you should start to forget you even had the surgery.  The only real issue id say after its all said and done is i still have some loose skin where the stitches were on the eternal one. When i mentioned it to the doctor on the 4th month he said it can be easily removed with a office procedure in about 2 minutes if i wanted. But i should wait to see if it goes down a bit. I originally had a little loose skin on the other side (from the internal one swelling) when talked to him and thats completely gone now. So i figured id wait another month or to see what happens before i have that done. But once that is gone it will almost look like i never had the surgery at all.  Overall im really happy i had it done. Yeah it sucked for a few months, but ive been dealing with them since i was 15 years old. So 5 months of pain to no longer deal with hemorrhoids was well worth it. Id definitly do it again if needed (but i pray i never have to) lol Lastly this might fall into the TMI catagory but im bi some im going to include this for the girls/guys out there who like anal sex because when i searched i found almost nothing. One of my concerns about this whole thing was my sex life. My advice is take a break for atleast 5-6 months before you try to put anything in there, then when you do start small. I tried around month 4 and it hurt alot, wait till your feeling 100% better then wait a extra month. Your getting a new a**hole in the end. Imagine the first time you ever put something in there, well thats how its going to be again. If you feel any discomfort, just wait a bit longer. I tried again about a week ago, and while it still wasnt easy it was 100x easier then it was at month 4. So you sex life isnt gone, its just postponed a bit and you need to slowly get back into it. It was a night and day difference between month 4 and 6, so i assume its going to get even easier as time goes on.  1 like, 3 replies "

Also temporary handicap placard,"So, my surgeon, very reputable, one of the very best, said from the beginning that he is not a fan of physical therapy and that sometimes PT causes bunions to return.   However, he said, if I really wanted PT, he could give it to me.   Well, now after 2 1/2 months since surgery, seeing that I cannot walk properly, my big toe and second toe (former hammer toe) are too stiff, I decided to go for PT but.... my surgeon will not accept to prescribe it to me.   I have researched and apparently there are no contraindications for PT with this type of surgery.   What has your experience been?  And if you do have PT, what do they do for you there?  How many sessions? On another note, I found out that after surgery, your doctor can fill out an application for you to get a temporary handicap placard which is usually for 6 -12 months.   Since my surgeon is very stand offish and not easy to talk with, I talked with my PCP and initially she was on board with this.   But, she filled the application wrong and I was deemed ineligible and only due to the mercy of the people from DMV, I got a two month handicap placard.  But it should have been for at least 6 months.  What do you know of this and if you do, how was your experience? 0 likes, 3 replies "

Began symptoms of back pain this Sunday.   Monday severe back, hip, knee pain - although at first mistaken as severe period pain.  Left eye red and sore.  That evening fingers started feeling like I'd been touching prickles but I had been handling cactus plants.   Tuesday small red spots appeared on palms of both hands.  Viral conjunctivitis in left eye, my friend the eye rock snot!!!  Also a tingling sensation in palms and soles of feet.  By the end of that evening fingertips had started to crack.

Physio not won't work, the best thing for it would be to fuse the toe so it is straight. Not only that it looks like I broke my big toe in the fall I had the other week.. not sure exactly what was said, but the it means possibly another op on my big toe too..I am going to leave it for a few months and wait for my foot to heal before going ahead and choose exactly what to have done..  I just wondered if anyone has had their second toe fused and what it feels like to have it done, does it feel strange not being able to bend the toe? Has it changed the footwear you can wear? Flip flops for example.. Do your old shoes fit? Not sure how I feel about it all at the moment, I guess I was ok at first, but now I am a bit scared..😟 0 likes, 31 replies "

The numbness is still quite bad which i thought it would be.  I had a stitch behind my Hammer Toe which my Surgeon  pulled out, my stitches are dissolvable which is good. My Toe where he took the Pin out is swollen more so than the other, i guess it is because of the Pin. When i went for my 6 weeks checkup. After my Surgeon yanked my pin out my Surgeon asked me to walk, my goodness i was  unable to  put my foot flat on the floor to walk,  is very painful to do so. I am seeing my Surgeon in 6 weeks will chat then.  I bought some Birkenstocks  sandals as i have read they are comfortable they really are, but alas i am unable to get anything on my left foot, still wearing my Surgical Boot.

My doctor said that I could walk in soft wide tennis shoes.   Well, I tried with wide, large sneakers and then wide Lem shoes and my foot does not fit into anything.   It is swollen and frozen.   Also the skin on top of my foot and also sole, toes is very thick and hardened and now peels like crazy.   I am limping along still in my neoprene surgical sandal.   I know that it does not offer enough support but there is no shoe of any kind that I can put my foot into.   My doctor said that I could drive when I can wear normal shoes.   But I cannot wear even wide, soft sneakers.   So, I am still elevating my foot a lot.  It helps but not much.   I know that swelling is normal and it will last quite a while.   But I am worried that I cannot wear even wide soft athletic shoes.   Have you experienced this?   What did you do?   I know there is light at the end of the tunnel but how long is this tunnel?

About 5 I begin to notice blister like bumps forming on my feet. By now I am getting scared because I don't know what is going on. I ended up going to the ER. Long story short, I stayed there for 6 hours to tell me I only had a allergic reaction but couldn't tell me to what. Gave me some pain pills and sent me on my way. On Monday, I called my main doctor and made an appoinment to come in. By now my feet are so sore, can't stand to touch them. Didn't want to put on any shoes and didn't even attempt to put on socks. My doctor comes in and she wasn't in the room 10 minutes before she could tell me exactly what I had. By then I am literally in tears from the pain. Hand, foot, and mouth disease was the diagnosis. I told her I had went to the ER and that they didn't take any blood or urine and let alone couldn't tell me what was going on. Keep in mind, I was contagious then and if they didn't clean the room in the ER after the left, the next person could have easily picked it up. Not my fault and I pray no did. I leave doctor office, get my pain meds cause that's all she could give me. This is virus that isn't caused by bacteria. She told me if she gave me anything else that it would weaken my immune system and make it spread to other places so all she could give me was some pain meds. There is no cure or any kind of meds that they could give you for this. If it was caused by bacteria, then they could. By Tuesday, I couldn't even get up on my feet to stand let alone go to the bathroom. My feet would burn so bad. I had to have an ice pack on top and the bottom of my feet. I just took my meds, rub my feet down in gold bond lotion ( which it doesn't help with itching). Take benadryl for the itching. Stayed in bed. By Wednesday, I could tell it was starting to dry in some. I could finally make it into the bathroom. I could stand on my feet for a few mintues at a time. I could walk in the house some but boy would I pay for it once I sat down. Like pure fire on my feet. By Thursday, I got up and gently put my feet on the floor. Praise God, I could stand on my feet. You never know how important a body part is until you can't use it. I was able to finally get out the bed and move around. Something I hadn't been really able to do the last 3 days. I am in week 2 of the healing process. I no longer have my pretty feet because they are peeling so bad. My heels is like the entire skin is going to come off, even over top of my nails. I am so scared my toe nails are going to come off. I do believe both of my entire feet skin is going to come off. I have been soaking them and letting the skin peel. But my heels are so sore now from the peeling. I am literally tired of the peeling and my feet have brown patchy places here and there that haven't peeled yet. My finger tips are so sore from where the skin has peeled. My dear God, how long does this stuff last? I just want my hands and feet to be back to normal. I am ashamed to show my feet out so I make sure I have on socks when I go out. I feel sorry for anybody kid that gets this. You would think since they know what it is by now they would have made some kind of pill or shot for this stuff.

This is now her fourth time. I would be interested to know if anyone else has had it repeatedly. She seems to get it very bad and it can go on for up to two weeks before the spots show. This time the blisters do not seem to be as bad as last time. The previous time the spots appeared all over her body. and even on her face. It is quite a worrying time when she has it as her fever can get very high and she can sometimes not walk as her feet do be so sore.[code:1:863a0d4987][/code:1:863a0d4987] 0 likes, 7 replies "

My 3 yrs old daughter contracted the virus during our recent trip to a kid's playground in a hotel (which i believe was the place that started it all to the irresponsible parents taking sick kid to a playground). On the first day she had high fever at 38 C, We took her to a doctor and the doctor prescribed a paracetamol for her and asked us to wait 3 days. On the 3rd day, she didnt want to eat as much as usual and had some visible red spots on her hands,thighs,private part, buttocks. We immediately took her to another doctor a specialist and checked her mouth and saw alot of ulcers inside, we were told she got HMFD a highly contagious viral disease. She said antibody will heal the virus but she prescribed a formula for her mouth so that she can drink as much liquid and eat again. The formula acts as an numbing agent; thankfully she is back to her normal activity after choking the formula for 3 days. At this moment, her red spots are gone and shes back to full health physically but we were told that the virus is still contagious and it can live up to 4 weeks. Both my wife and I spent alot of time nursing for our daughter because we were told the virus only attacks children under the age of 10. We had no fear of being caught sick at all, thats when we were wrong; After my daughter's 5th days of being sick i had a super headache that i thought someone split my head open; couldnt even sleep and my temp was at 38.3 C immediately went to an ER, they gave me strong antibiotics (which was useless) and they told me i had tonsil infection and paracetamol to help with the fever. Swallowing was like being sliced with knives in the throat, On my 3rd day I recovered from the fever, but red spots beginning to appear on my hands and fingers nothing on my feet. I went to another doctor and she prescribed Isoprinosine and Acyclovir topical cream both are anti-viral medicines. After taking them day to day and now the 5th day. I notice the red spots are getting worse it multiplies more on fingers and now my feet also blistered. Walking with winching as i go through each day. My question is there anyone having the same prescribed medicine and became worse?      0 likes, 0 replies "

I contracted it from my 1 year old niece and she had a much milder case than I did!  Day 1: mild sore throat and 101 fever  Day 2: searing terrible sore throat, 101 fever and red spots on back of throat.  Day 3: little red pimples, super itchy, started appearing on my fingers.  Day 4: full blown red spots and blisters on hands and feet. One blister on my tongue, and no more red spots on my throat. My hands were so itchy I thought I was going to pass out. I also developed a ring of scabs / bumps around my ears, beneath my hair, and sort of around the hairline in the back of my head. Not itchy at all but really dry and scabby.  Day 5: same as day 4, although my feet started to swell where the red spots and blisters were. Miserable!  Day 6: itching has fully disappeared but red spots and blisters are still here. They are dry now. No pain or burning any longer, but some tenderness.  What remedies I used:  Nyquil (day one and two only, as I thought I had a cold)  Antihistamine - helped a lot! (After day one and two when I knew it was HFMD, and only sparingly, as I had a prescription anti-inflammatory I used instead for the remaining days).  Lavender oil - small soothingness  Aloe Vera gel - my saviour  Oats and water - made into a paste and applied to hands and feet - also my saviour!  Head and shoulders shampoo for my scalp scabs.  It was hour by hour what would help. In the end only the oats and water and the anti-inflammatory would ease the itching long enough for me to nap.  Folks this is a TERRIBLE virus!  I hope it all goes away soon.

I had a shower and I cried the entire time in the shower due to the pain of standing on my feet. My throat still hurts and my ears are in so much pain as well.  I leave for a trip on Tuesday. Hoping it will be on its way out by then. Trying to stay positive.  Would love to know how long other people’s hand foot and mouth lasted. Any remedies to help with the pain?

A sore throat and the aches and pains continued. I thought I got the flu.  On Wednesday the aches and pains were gone but the hot and cold flashes still happened. I also continued to have a sore throat.  On Thursday I was feeling better but still had a terrible sore throat. Went to the doctors and he thought I had strep throat.

Took some meds and went to work. Felt pretty good most of the day. Wednesday I didn’t feel too great and noticed my thumb felt like it had a small burn on it, but I couldn’t see anything. Chalked it up to fireworks from the night before. The day progresses and I noticed a blister on my youngest sons toe, nothing else. Think maybe his shoe or something caused it. Went to bed early and got up for work yesterday. Felt ok but as the day progressed I started getting red spots on my hands and my feet started to hurt. I left early and by the tim I got home it was full blown. I am a nurse and take care of immunosuppressed people. Yesterday I wore gloves all day long and bleached anything I came into contact with. I called in for today and have a dr appt this afternoon. I have no idea how long I’ll be out of work. The spots seem to be under my skin more than raised. I’ve just noticed I now have a rash on my legs and thighs and my biceps and some on my stomach. My feet kill me. I have 3 spots on the Righg side of my throat that get irritated when I eat but not nearly as bad as it was. I’m in panic mode over here I can’t miss any more work I don’t have enough pto.

She went through all the classic phases and is now pretty much over it.  She never really had much trouble other than malaise and mild fever. No itchiness or pain. She still has some of the red spots but most of her skin is peeling and replacing these. She's pretty resilient and as far as I know this was the first time she'd ever been sick in 3.8 years. I started noticing muscle aches about 5 days ago and that quickly turned into full body aches and fever.  I couldn't sleep that night and was beginning to think I had the flu so I visited a walk in clinic and was tested for Flu, Strep,   and this of course was negative. They simply left it most likely a virus. Of course that evening I started developing the blisters on my hands and they quickly became itchy. Over the next 3 days my hands and feet were covered with these pustules. They were itchy to the point of madness. I couldn't sleep, relax, watch tv or even think for this. I truly went to the edge... Now for pretty much most of my life I've suffered from Dishidrotic Excema. For those familiar it can be equally maddening. My hands would develop similar looking pustules just beneath the skin with itchiness always present. Occasionally this would happen on my feet. I learned years ago about bleach baths and that had always been my go to defense for this. After a few soaks of just my hands or feet in tubs of strong bleach water the excema would always halt and then retreat. This HFMD presented in much the same way and I figured I'd fight it just like the excema. It took a bit longer to halt than the excema but I feel like the bleach bath was effective. The itchiness is all but gone. The spots are still here and will be until the skin replaces itself but my sanity reserves are replenishing. I can actually sleep and do most everything normally. During this I also used Calamine which provided absolutely no relief. I used Nyquil with 10% alcohol, may or may not have helped.. not sure. I used benedryl capsules, I think helped with itchiness. I used ibuprofen for pain. Nothing I believe helped more than the bleach baths. The way I mixed it was probably something like 8 parts water, 2 parts bleach. I always mixed it to where the solution felt very slippery when I rubbed my fingers together in the solution. Now this is strong. It left my skin smelling like bleach even after washing and did produce minor chemical burning on the more sensitive skin areas of my hands and feet but for me was definitely well worth it. I just wanted to post what had worked for me as I know what a nightmare this is. Good luck to all. 0 likes, 1 reply "

My hands would develop similar looking pustules just beneath the skin with itchiness always present. Occasionally this would happen on my feet. I learned years ago about bleach baths and that had always been my go to defense for this. After a few soaks of just my hands or feet in tubs of strong bleach water the excema would always halt and then retreat. This HFMD presented in much the same way and I figured I'd fight it just like the excema. It took a bit longer to halt than the excema but I feel like the bleach bath was effective. The itchiness is all but gone. The spots are still here and will be until the skin replaces itself but my sanity reserves are replenishing. I can actually sleep and do most everything normally. During this I also used Calamine which provided absolutely no relief. I used Nyquil with 10% alcohol, may or may not have helped.. not sure. I used benedryl capsules, I think helped with itchiness. I used ibuprofen for pain. Nothing I believe helped more than the bleach baths. The way I mixed it was probably something like 8 parts water, 2 parts bleach. I always mixed it to where the solution felt very slippery when I rubbed my fingers together in the solution. Now this is strong. It left my skin smelling like bleach even after washing and did produce minor chemical burning on the more sensitive skin areas of my hands and feet but for me was definitely well worth it. I just wanted to post what had worked for me as I know what a nightmare this is. Good luck to all. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Asthma is getting progressively worse. ,"Hello, I wanted to see if  I could get some insight on this issue. Lately, I have been having severe asthma attacks along with constant shortness of breath ( I have to yawn to catch my breath otherwise it feels like I am suffocating or someone is sitting on my chest ) and very bad coughing with phlegm and sometimes blood. I have had asthma all my life and it used to be bad when I was little, then it somewhat subsided for a few years, then it returned recently. It got worse after I had two very bad bouts of bronchitis ( both lasting a month ) within the last 3 months. I have been having very bad asthma attacks every day now and have to take about 10 puffs of my albuterol inhaler ( ProAir brand ) everyday as well as 3 breathing treatments too on average. It is usually worse at night where I wake up multiple times wheezing horribly and feel breathless.  I have almost had to go to the hospital on multiple occasions.  I saw a doctor when this first started and was prescribed with Montelukast SOD 5 Mg ( Singulair ), Pulmicort, and Dulera 200 mcg-5 mcg/actuation HFA aerosol inhaler , but none of those helped me.

Hard to know whats been done exactly as I am still waiting to see my surgery notes and was too out of it when they explained it in hospital. Mainly in hospital they were focused on my horrific skin damage. Now 6 weeks later they are pleased with how my frankenstein looking leg has healed. However i have yet to see an ortho doctor and am concerned with how swollen my foot is every day and how much my ankle currently hurts. They had me weight bearing from day 4 as couldn't have a cast due to the skin damage and bandages needing to be changed. Was doing really well with my walking and exercises but now it hurts too much to do them. Feeling like I've taken a massive step back in my progress.

However a couple of days later I was driving down the motorway and bang a thought hit me ""What If i'm not here for the baby and my wife or what If I get ill and I dont have many years left to support them"" Major panic attack set in and I couldn't regulate my breathing, I had to pull over to catch deep breaths. The following week I woke up and noticed I had a twitch above my heart straight away googled it "" "" I went into hysterics, crying panicking I was going to die. So I took myself off to walk in who checked my heart and oxygen level which were all fine. The twitch stayed for 24 hours and disappeared.

I noticed i'd been yawning more than usual which can be a symptom of ALS so I went into meltdown so I booked in with GP who gave me a telephone consultation. I told him my concerns and he said its so rare so don't worry it sounds like anxiety but I will book you in for a full bloods test. I went to get my bloods done, hot sweats looking at how many there are on the sheet. They told me to call back after the weekend bare in mind I was in tears what if its something wrong coming up. So time went on and I decided to phone on Friday before the weekend, bloods were in....6 out of 7 fine, then the 7th was raised which was the Liver function test. So I had to wait until Monday to get Gamma and Liver blood test, by this point i'd wrote myself off with Liver disease. Monday came and I got bloods done, phoned everyday until Wednesday when they said they were inconclusive and needed another sample. I went and gave another the same day. Friday I got my result back and all was clear. Thank god. I cried with happiness. The next obsessive was MS a couple weeks ago (my auntie had this and passed away at 40) where I felt a numbness or tingling in my right leg which stayed for a week and I wern't sure there was a weakness but I manage to walk on it ok. Then recently i started getting these muscle twitches which I still have now, there usually in the same spots on the calfs, thigh and arms, they happen when i'm at rest sitting down usually. Last week I went on a run (I haven't done in about a year) and I think I over did it as my thighs were really sore for 3 days which got me worried again about the route of my problem ALS. i'm still going on runs daily to which my legs have been fine but I can't stop googling symptoms and it is working my up to the point of tears thinking i'm not going to be around for my wife or my future child.

It was perforated when it was removed. A week later I was out of hospital and was mobile. For the last few months i've been experiencing mild (in comparison to appendicitis pain) pain in that region. This can occur when I eat certain spicy foods or when i'm tensing my abdominals. Otherwise, it can occur just when resting.

I suffer from anxiety and have for a fair few years now. Lately when it comes to my health it tends to take over and make me panic. The latest thing I'm obsessing over is having appendicitis. About 3 months ago I started feeling pain in my groin area (where your leg joins your body) on my right side. I went to my doctor about it and he put it down to a pulled muscle. The pain stuck around for a little but went away. Then about a month later it came back again in the same place. I went to my doctor again and he said it can take up to 8 weeks for the muscle to repair itself and if it was still hurting after that come back and he would investigate it further. It's now at the 3 month mark and the pain is still there. It has moved though. I am getting a dull coming and going pain in my right hip and groin area now. It's constantly moving. Also when I wake up in the morning along the bottom of my back kills me but that does leave within half an hour. My anxiety has me so worked up that its my appendix that I feel like I'm feeling weird sensations along my right side stomach near my hip and just under my last rib. The same sensation is also happening along the bottom of my abdomen as I say ""under my fat roll"" There is defiantly pain there but I'm not sure if something is actually wrong or its my anxiety blowing things up in my mind. I had an x-ray on my right hip today and I'm finding out the results from my doctor tomorrow. I'm also having an ultrasound of my hip but I can't get an appointment for that for 2 weeks. I might add about 2-3 weeks before all this pain started I fell over onto concrete and landed front forward pretty hard. Im not sure if that could have affected anything.  No vomiting, fever, lack of eating, none of that. Any advice or reassurance would be great because I am quietly going crazy inside my own head.  0 likes, 5 replies "

Kinda felt like a full off feeling like I worked out to hard. This accompanied odd bowl movements & no pain.  Two days past & I decided to go to a small clinic as I felt the odd sensation move to my right hip. I almost instantly knew it was something to do with my appendix. I got the okay. So I continued on with school & work but felt off. Later that week I was in the er I got a cat scan blood work ultrasound urin everything came back fine! So I moved on with this odd stomach sensation. Felt like a ball was in my stomach a fullness or something just very uncomfortable. By this point I didn’t want to eat. So the next day I went back to the er & they did the same tests blood cat scan physical test told me I had 50% of appendicitis symptoms. I got the results back & they said I was fine & it was anxiety. So I graduated from school on that Friday I felt awful stomach was upset I thought i was going to pass out when I walked across the stage but I got through it. So I thought it was nerves but I broke down that day literally freaked out started running around yelling & crying saying that there was something wrong with my appendix. I was constipated my stomach felt weird the ball feeling & now sharp right side pains on & off. Again I’m thinking appendix so I freak out all weekend had chills no fever no vomiting no nausea just weird sharp pains randomly & odd bowl movements no appetite etc.  I go back to the er on Sunday night day (9) I get a cat scan blood work physical test, GI cocktail whatever that nasty thing is. & they tell me it’s because of alcohol intake & that my appendix is fine. So finally I start to think okay maybe they are right maybe it’s in my head. But now everything is full force I’m not sleeping well I have on & off sharp right side pains that last sometimes a full hour.  this weird sensation in my belly button that feels like somethings poking  out of it, the ball feeling in my right side kinda feels like trapped air & this nagging hip feeling like I pulled someting. Now am I losing it?is this something that I’m making up? Could all of this be me? Or could this be something serious??  I’m having mental break downs through out the day & night cry & freaking out & googling like an idiot about the possible causes, everything I mean EVERYTHING comes back as my appendix. PS sorry for the book but I really needed to get this off my chest & mind cause I feel hopeless.  0 likes, 2 replies "

It is localized to a point between my belly button and right hip-bone. I did not suspect appendicitis because all the stories I've heard are of excruciating pain, which I do not have. Yesterday the pain became more pronounced and more localized to a single point in my right lower abdomen that radiated to my lower back. I called my local nurse-connection advice line and they advised me to be seen in urgent care as a precaution. I had also developed nausea, constipation and excessive bloating, however the pain was still more akin to a pulled muscle and was not overwhelming. The Urgent Care doctor referred me over to the ER to get a CT scan and Ultrasound because he said he suspected that I was developing appendicitis but couldn't be sure. I went to the ER last night and after waiting over two hours, decided to go home, as it was already very late, and I wasn't due to even be triaged for another two hours! I slept almost normally last night, and just felt a slight pressure/sharp twinge of pain intermittently through the night. I had a normal bowel movement this morning, but the pain is still localized to my RLQ and varies from a dull ache to a sharp, gas-like twinge. I still have mild nausea and feel like I constantly need to use the restroom. Because the pain is not overwhelming, I am hesitant to go back to the ER, but all the other symptoms of appendicitis are there. Does anyone have any advice?  0 likes, 1 reply "

I brushed it off to start with because I thought it was maybe just growing pains but it’s gotten worse recently. It comes and goes it doesn’t radiate to any other parts of my stomach. It’s sometimes a dull pain but it can be pretty sharp at times. I’ve also lost my appetite (which is not like me) and lost some weight. I’ve read online and I think that a lot of my symptoms fit that of chronic appendicitis, but it’s also something that isn’t that well documented in medicine. Anyone else had a similar experience that could give me some advice? I do also have issues with my  brain ladder (frequent UTIs) which I’m not sure could be causing the pain.

While I initially felt my recovery was going well, but now going into my 6th week I am experiencing pain in my left side around the first incision hole and the pain shoots around the front of my belly this has been the case for the past 2-3 weeks. I can only describe this pain as something inside being torn or stretched, this happens when I move, such as turning or sitting down for getting up. also discomfort is felt when walking or going upstairs (putting weight on left leg).  I don't know if I've damaged myself during recovery with maybe lifting something too heavy or lifting myself out the bath. Has anyone else experienced this or know what it might be?  Thanks Rob. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Now, I'm just feeling it in my right side. There is a little bit of pain and some discomfort. I had quite a few people press down on where it hurts and it doesn't hurt any worse when they removed their hand.

My appendix hadn't ruptured but it was chronically inflamed as I apparently had   in September but was wrongly diagnosed in hospital. Everything seemed to be healing ok and the pain was easing, but exactly 2 weeks after the op I noticed the site where my original pain was had become very sore and tender again, and I then also got what felt like muscle pain under my ribs. I saw my GP and got signed off work for a couple more days, and he sent me for urgent bloods. My bloods all came back fine but he told me to go to A&E if I was still in pain on the Saturday (yesterday) as he thought the pain should have gone by this time. The pain eased again and was fine until yesterday afternoon, after I had taken a train journey and walked more than I have for a while. Now I am very sore again. Is it possible I have just done a bit too much and strained myself? I don't want to go to A&E as the pain isn't bad enough to feel like an emergency but I really don't know what's happening. Does this sound normal? I'm really anxious and frustrated as I've been in pain since September and I thought everything would have resolved by now! 0 likes, 5 replies "

I've had to pay for all my neuro investigations as a result because she won't refer me or do any more blood tests etc.  I'm trying homeopathy, osteopathy and acupuncture as I want to find something that will relieve these weird symptoms and prefer to avoid drugs if I can.

Whenever anyone in my house decides to go grocery shopping I cringe and double check with them to stay as far away from other people as possible. I myself hadn't left the house since over a month ago when I had a doctor's appt for an upper respiratory infection. The only other times I've left the house were to walk my dogs. My neighborhood is pretty quiet but on nice sunny days like today, people were outside. I make sure I stay very far away from them, and I did so again today. However at one point I stepped off the curb to avoid people who were in their garage at a nearby house. As soon as I did so this guy rode past me on his bike. I'm pretty sure he was less than 6 feet away (maybe 4-5?). It happened so fast I barely had time to react and I couldn't go back up on the curb because a car was blocking it.

I'm very worried that this guy could have been infected with coronavirus and could have passed it to me. He didn't show any symptoms - no coughing, sneezing, clearing throat, spitting etc, even had his mouth closed - but they now say that people who are asymptomatic can spread it. So now I feel like I'll have heightened anxiety for the next 2 weeks at least, worrying that I've caught it and just waiting to show symptoms. I got really upset when they mentioned people with underlying health conditions getting it worse. I was diagnosed with asthma when I was 12 and I still see a pulmonologist, but I talked to him and he assured me my asthma was now so minimal, he'd put me in the same category with regular, healthy people.

My cardiologist sent me to a Gastro Dr, I was still complaining of tightness in the middle of my chest and being out of breath. This was in June. I wound up being sent to emergency at NYU in New York by both Drs.

I’m trying to do some exercise but I find myself in the same situation. It’s 9 months since the surgery. I asked the surgeon originally if I needed rehab, I was told no.

I'll just get straight to the point, I'm extremely worried about having an aortic anyurism (abdominal or thoracic) I'm at my wits end to be honest.  Im 23yrs of age, male, about 220lbs, don't smoke or drink. I consider myself healthy but overweight which I am working on.  My uncle had an abdominal anyurism two years ago although he is a heavy smoker with 40 plus years. Since then it's crosssed my mind from time to time but in the last month I'm going crazy with worry. I also have OCD which I dont think helps. I keep trying to tell myself to stop worrying.  Just last month I had to go to A&E with what my doctor thought was a slightly collapsed lung. My doctor listened to my chest, took my oxygen levels, and sent me I guess just to be sure. At the hospital I had Bloods taken, blood pressure checked about 3 times  and a Chest x ray front and side, doctor At the hospital said it was a pinched nerve. Would a chest x ray have found an aortic anyurism in the upper chest or in the abdomen? I had the chest x ray just over a month ago  I also had open gallbladder surgery two years ago, I don't have much feeling near the scar it's  numb but sometimes my lower abdomen gets sore. Would this have anything to do with what I mentioned above? I'd appreciate any help guys thanks.   0 likes, 3 replies "

For the past 4 weeks or so I've constantly been obsessed with my breath. I feel when I lie down I don't breath properly. Every single breath I take lying down trying to sleep is done manually and consciously. Normally it's something you don't even have to think about. I often struggle to find a good breathing rythm. These days on a bad night I can only sleep about 3-4 hours, and on a good night I get around 7. The quality is not great as I cannot sleep for more than 2 hours at a time. Between the hours of 0200-0400 I'm usually awake feeling extremely frustrated. So how are you suppose to breath when you are trying to sleep? Deep breaths? Shallow breaths? Fast? Slow?

For the past 4 weeks or so I've constantly been obsessed with my breath. I feel when I lie down I don't breath properly. Every single breath I take lying down trying to sleep is done manually and consciously. Normally it's something you don't even have to think about. I often struggle to find a good breathing rythm. These days on a bad night I can only sleep about 3-4 hours, and on a good night I get around 7. The quality is not great as I cannot sleep for more than 2 hours at a time. Between the hours of 0200-0400 I'm usually awake feeling extremely frustrated. So how are you suppose to breath when you are trying to sleep? Deep breaths? Shallow breaths? Fast? Slow? I know everybody is a little different but there should be a general pattern. Many thanks for any input. 0 likes, 4 replies "

We were told to prepare her funeral as she was not expected to live long , we were given around 2 weeks . We were devastated , my Mum had Alzhiemers and was in care and was watching her slowly slip away from us , we were very lucky as she remembered us all and enjoyed her life. I took 6 weeks off work just to spend as much time with her as I could. Every time she had a pain or felt faint etc we thought it no this is it !!! Now March 2019 Mum is still here and still enjoying herself and is going to celebrate her 90th birthday on 8th March !!! The doctors are amazed stating she is a miracle that they did not really think she would have lived past her prognosis they all have. They have said that because of her Alzhiemers she is not stressed and that she really does no exercise , she is not very mobile,  she is not putting pressure on her heart and she has good Blood Pressure c control.  She really us our miracle and although we know it could rupture at anytime we are grateful f out the time we have had with her. So anyone out there who is facing the same prognosis ,do not take what specialists intensive care doctors cardiologists etc as always correct , they are just making assumptions based on statistics. 2 likes, 1 reply "

I thought: maybe it's the way I'm laying? So I tried to lay on my back. No luck. The pain only intensifies. My instinct was to go find my muscle rub. Limping around for a few minutes (I couldn't put any weight on it), and unable to locate said muscle rub, I grabbed my heating pad and wrapped my leg in it for some temporary relief. That's where I am now. I have a big day on my feet tomorrow, but I can barely walk right now. What is happening & do I need to see a doctor? 0 likes, 3 replies "

This could last from two to four weeks and usually stop for about eight weeks in between. Recently, I have been having the pain consistently on one foot or the other. I have been to my doctor multiple times in the past few months and have been semi-diagnosed with gout as they aren't 100% sure if it is it or not. The pain isn't around my big toe it is affecting the top of the foot and the outer part of the bottom of the foot. I have changed my diet to a mainly vegetarian one having meat once a week and consume alcohol once a week. Would love some advise on what i should do to get this treated or if it sounds like how gout is meant to behave. Thanks in advance! 0 likes, 11 replies "

I have had joint issues since I was 9 or 10 years old. I first noticed something was wrong playing little league baseball as an outfielder. I had always been an outfielder because my left arm was a cannon and I was able to throw a baseball farther than many of the kids I played with. One game I threw a ball a little harder than usual and my shoulder became extremely painful and remained that way for the remainder of the game. Over the course of the next four or five years of my life I began to use my left arm less and less and now don't use it for nearly as many activities as I did before. My right shoulder experiences similar pain, but it isn't to the same degree as my left shoulder. When i was in college I worked at a Sam's club pushing carts for two months short of two years, and never really experienced any problems with my ankles or knees. Since graduating college and beginning my career, my knees and ankles will occassionaly sort of collapse after randomly experiencing intense pain for a second or two. this happens while walking, going up or down stairs, running, or any activity where i have to put pressure on my knees. I really don't understand why it happens because it is so random so if anyone has any advice or has experienced this before I would really appreciate some advice. Thank you. 0 likes, 0 replies "

It began with an injury at my midfoot which is fairly high arched(or was). I recovered, sort of, but began with pain in my 2nd and 3rd toes. This was before a much later consultant diagnosis of midfoot   after MRI. My arch, at that time was higher then usual. Instead of dropping more it was stuck up high. I have seen at least 5   and each has treated me differently. I sought 2 more foot consultant diagnoses. My symptoms evolved mysteriously and painfully. It became either   with outer foot weakness or inner foot pain, especially around the toes. A back consultant did an MRI. I had some minor disc protrusions around L5/S1 but nothing too significant. With no real help...and the GP has been useless I have continued trying to improve. Walking any distance or standing is painful after a short while. I seem to have been able to change things by sticking to a Pilates routine every morning and doing some cycling and swimming and Aqua aerobics. I seem to have less back pain now but I have a significant pulling soreness through the foot to my lower inner buttock. I believe I have been dealing with, apart from the foot arthritis, an externally rotated leg(maybe due to altered gait or maybe scar tissue in my sacral back area) which I am changing back. However, my foot feels sore and stiff. It feels like I am attempting to walk in a different way and through scar tissue. I do feel fairly hopeless and often wonder if I am doing too much or too little and many pain flares. I have no-one to advise me. Any suggestions from people who have managed to change old scar tissue around joints would be welcome please. 0 likes, 0 replies "
