So I started to take the oil beside the Olanzapine followed the doctors instructions. Now I am 1 week after withdraw from Olanzapine completely, but started to feel symptomps again (sweating and insomnia) I don't want to return to Olanzapine again, I hope if I increase the CBD amount, the withdraw symtomps disappear.

These can all be overcome via The crux of the problem is that GABA receptors in the brain have been damaged so need repairing.  These two steps can help with that.

Hoping someone can give me advice and some hope that things are going to get better. I was taking 15mg of Olanzapine for a period of 4yrs and with the support of my psychiatrist decided to discontinue it this year. I followed my psychiatrist weaning schedule which was reducing the dosage over a period of 4 weeks and completed this process 2 months ago.  To throw in the mix I have also discontinued Valium over the same period. Since stopping these medication my life has been hell I have had really bad chronic insomnia, sweats, bad anxiety, Itchiness of my skin and tremors.   I have been tempted to go back on the medication but I really don't want to so soldiering on,  I went to see my GP who said that it's going to take time for things to settle and he also prescribed me some Zopiclone to help me sleep which has made no difference. I'm really worried that these withdrawal symptoms won't get better so would like to hear from anyone who has gone through similar and any advice would be most welcome.   If I was told how hard it was to come of Olanzapine I would not of agreed to take it. I am still taking Prozac and not planning to come of this. Help? Ben 0 likes, 13 replies "

I have been taking 10mg every night for that time and piled on loads of weight, felt lethargic no confidence and started experiencing heart pains. I have had absolutely zero social life in that time and felt unable to think or communicate with other people. I decided just over a month ago to stop the treatment and now am starting to feel much better. I have lost a stone in 2 weeks and look much better ,I am now able to think clearly and have much more energy and motivation to do things. To help me stop the Olanzapine I have avoided alcohol completely (this always put me back to square one in the past). I am finding it difficult to get off to sleep without the aid of the drug but more excercise through the day is helping with this. I will never return to taking this drug again as I feel it has robbed me of 6 years of my life. 9 likes, 326 replies "

It started out that after eating dinner every night, I'd begin to feel this nagging tension in the back of my mouth. It has varied in location, sometimes at the top or bottom of my mouth, and between my actual back molars and centered around my premolars. I began tracking my meals, and believed that this was particularly triggered by consumption of wheat-containing foods or perhaps some unidentified spices, but today I had this oral reaction to an eggs and sausage breakfast which I have had almost every morning for years without issue. Additionally, a recent skin-prick allergy test did not demonstrate a wheat allergy, although the allergist did not provide the wheal size of each tested item. Notable is that during these experiences, I have yet to feel any gum soreness or tooth pain in the areas where this tension has occurred, nor I have I felt any itchiness/scratchiness in the mouth or seen any skin/tongue bumps or swelling. About two to three years ago, my dentist identified one or two wisdom teeth that appeared to be positioned towards an eventual problematic eruption. However, my symptoms are inconsistent with an ill-positioned eruption in several ways. Again, I am not experiencing any pain from this, and up until today, these symptoms for the most part only seemed to follow dinner. In addition, unless the growth trajectory of some of my wisdom teeth has changed, it does not follow that I’d be experiencing these sensations in all four back corners of my mouth and at varying times. The only habit of mine that has noticeably changed recently is that I have not been consistently brushing my teeth before going to bed, and perhaps it is possible cavities have developed in the back of my mouth and there has been increased sensitivity as a result. As you might see from my other threads, I’ve also experienced an increased anxiety over food allergies in the lead up to the test I had earlier, and have developed weird facial tics occasionally involving twitching of my zygo/buccal muscles. It is possible something has changed about the way I eat food given my new apprehensiveness. Anxiety may very well play some factor here given that I now experience mouth swelling sensations in the shower and swallowing discomfort using the same shampoo and soap on my hair/face I have used for at least 2 years now. That being said, it is notable that on the few occasions I have tried Benadryl in response to these symptoms out of curiosity that these symptoms seem to mitigate at a much quicker pace, e.g. yesterday within an hour of 25mg ingestion. One last potential contributor to consider is that I have had ongoing issues with earwax hyperproduction that have resulted in many trips to the doctor to clean out the canals. The last few times this has become an issue I’ve syringed the ears myself at home. It is possible a sloppier DIY syringing at home may have caused some sort of ear infection, or that soap from the shower may be trapped within the earwax and causing these issues if I am actually sensitive to the soap.

The reflux feeling is fairly infrequent. I also occasionally get tonsil stones. I have good oral health. Brush twice per day, floss, moutwash. Dentist confirmed gums are healthy. Yet I can taste bad breath coming on again shortly after my morning routine. NOW, I recently took metronidazole for something completely unrelated, and to my utter amazement, my breath became as fresh as a babies! Reflief after a decade! Even my morning breath smelt of nothing. I was so happy until I read online that other people had experienced this phenomenen, but that the bad breath returns when you stop taking the antibiotic. I stopped taking it 4 days ago, and I think that my breath may finally be reverting back   This morning wasn't quite as fresh as yesterdays. I'm depressed now that my bad breath is likely to return in full force within a few days. I'm wondering if anyone can shed any light? Anyone been in the same boat and found a cure? Can any knowledge be gained from the fact that the antibiotic temporaily cured me or not?   6 likes, 490 replies "

The reflux feeling is fairly infrequent. I also occasionally get tonsil stones. I have good oral health. Brush twice per day, floss, moutwash. Dentist confirmed gums are healthy. Yet I can taste bad breath coming on again shortly after my morning routine. NOW, I recently took metronidazole for something completely unrelated, and to my utter amazement, my breath became as fresh as a babies! Reflief after a decade! Even my morning breath smelt of nothing. I was so happy until I read online that other people had experienced this phenomenen, but that the bad breath returns when you stop taking the antibiotic. I stopped taking it 4 days ago, and I think that my breath may finally be reverting back   This morning wasn't quite as fresh as yesterdays. I'm depressed now that my bad breath is likely to return in full force within a few days. I'm wondering if anyone can shed any light? Anyone been in the same boat and found a cure? Can any knowledge be gained from the fact that the antibiotic temporaily cured me or not?   6 likes, 490 replies "

As I know what I am doing is wrong but it’s getting worse. I had a severe motorbike crash in 2014, a drunk driver pulled out in front of me at 60mph and I ended up wrapped around a lamp post, it was a good 20 mins before a passer by saw me as it was early and on the way to work. I was airlifted to hospital, I had to have my spleen, gallbladder, left kidney removed, I had a collapsed lung, broken ribs, wrist leg and severe damage to my spine. I suffered 3 cracked vertebrae L4/5 s1. And had to have several cages, bolts and rods put in my spine. I managed to walk again after nearly a year in hospital. But I was left with severe blinding pain, caused by nerve damage to my legs, bladder. As a result I have to self catheterise 4/7 time a day depending on how hot it gets. I am on strong opiate medication along with diazepam, noratryiptilin, duloxatine, mirtazipine. I have got to a stage where my body has gotten used to the drugs so the pain de just keep increasing them. I have been put on co-codomol 30/500 2 x 4 or and naproxen 500 mg 1. X 2 time a day.  But I found that I have just got addicted to these or all the drugs I am on. But cocodomol I am currently taking 20 30/500 10 am and 10 pm and 4 naproxen am and PM. I don’t feel it helps with the pain but it helps me feel drowsy, but I get less than 3 hrs sleep a night as I am up pacing the house. I know it’s wrong to be taking this amount of meds but I can’t stop, I am craving more and more.  I go to my GP and they never check the scripts they just sign off and I can do a months supply in a week. I am beginning to wonder what effect this is having on my body.  Any help or suggestions would be great. Thanks  Buggsy  0 likes, 6 replies "

Slipped 5 discs (L1-L5) Since then, I've been battling with  hospitals, GP's, physio etc and my condition seems to be getting worse. In the last 8 months, my condition took a turn for the worse, another MRI has shown that my S1 is now involved with  discs still bulged (L4-L5). I'm also awaiting my results on my last MRI from my pelvis and hip, which in my thoughts will be bad due the the crunching and chronic pain their giving me. I'm currently getting prescribed for pain relief: oramorph (60ml daily), codeine (90mg daily). (i used to get pregabalin 225mg- i asked to stop because they made me feel doped up and that affected my job). Here's my problems(!): This is a lot of medication - and most days its not enough, some days not enough at all! I also have IBS, the oramorph seems not to agree with me. Telling the above to my GP - is like banging my head on a brick wall. My GP suggests taking me off oramorph,which we've tried before with no avail, leaving me in chronic unmanageable pain. I just dont know where to go from here... Please help!! 0 likes, 7 replies "

I have given them up twice before, first time totally cold turkey which was absolute hell but my Dr put me on pregabalin (pregabalin has been tested up to 8000mg in a single dose without any damage to the tester, but bet he was off his nut lol. It will make you feel a bit drunk so I would recommend not going to work, NOT DRIVING,  and stay in bed for the 5 days or so this will take) for another reason and I found it releleaved the snake bones, itchy joints and the jerks (from here on called the heeby geebies) . Your going to need fairly high doses well well beyond what NICE (UK) recommend, I've read that some clinics in the US use it(they say 1200mg but that I'll blow you away) . I found 900mg every three hours is about what you are going to need, but your milage will vary as I am 160kg (22 stone)  and you may get away with less, best bet would be wait for the heeby geebies to start and take one (300mg) if that doesn't help after 20mins take another etc..this will find your needed dosage. The heeby geebies for me return after 3 hours at which point I take another dose. I would recommend not pre-empting the onset of the heeby geebies as towards the end they seem to become less frequent and severe. Pregabalin is expensive, its about £250 a box of 56 on a private prescription and may not quite be enough I was lucky living in the UK and having a awesome and very understanding GP (General Doctor) who prescribed what I needed under the UKs NHS... Your milage may vary..  I truly hope this helps some folks. Best of luck, its still not easy but the flu like symptoms are  a lot easier to deal (and much reduced on pregabalin, just got a stuffy nose and aches and pains this time)  with than the heeby geebies you get at the start, I was  flipping between the oxy and the DHC  100mg of oxygen a day and 120mg of DHC (to stop the withdrawal from the DHC being) g a tri acting opiate or 400mg/day of DHC that way I got far better pain relief as my tolerence would drop for the oxy (a single acting opieate) a while taking the DHC and vise versa I am told that due to the poor quality of street drugs I was doing about a 10 bag a day.. ) Anyhow I wish you all the very best breaking your dependence/addiction. Please post a comment if you have success with this procedure or have any questions.  Best of luck Jay 0 likes, 2 replies "

When I was first diagnosed back in 1988 my doctor had no material on this subject.  I was told to go home and find it on my computer, which I did.  There was a researcher in Canada who hit the nail right on the head, Forestier's is no pick nick! He was so right! When I was first diagnosed with the disease, I was in a lot of back pain. I had x-rays done and this article is correct....my vertebral area looked as if I were leaking wax.  I saw all sorts of bony hooks hanging from each and every vertebrate and I was in a lot of pain; but my doctor at that time said I couldn't be in pain, as it wasn't painful??? On the contrary, the article I was told to research stated that there is a great deal of pain associated with the disease and eventually it would be crippling and that is where I am, 20 years later. At the first time I was diagnosed, I didn't know that my choking could be associated with the disease itself, I thought it was just asthma...after all \""it isn't that bad.\"" I was placed on many anti-inflammatory medications. I was place on one that I suddenly would loose my speech and get confused...I was told they might be TIA's. Later this particular drug was found to do just that.  Since it wasn't helping, I was put on another anti-inflammatory and the doctor doubled the recommended dose and later I found that the sphincter muscle to my stomach and been burned away from too much of a good thing.   I was told not to see a chiropractor and for good reason! I had a complication from a surgery and they had to knock me out in order to go down my throat....while under someone turned my head further than I could myself and broke a facet in my neck; now I have plates in my neck and need more surgery....Once my neck was repaired, I didn't choke any longer.  Right now, the disease has gotten so bad that I have many areas of stenosis and nerve root cut off.  The neurosurgeon who performed my first neck surgery stated that every opening that allows the nerve roots to channel through my body was loaded with razor sharp spurs. This is just the spinal region of my body. I am beginning to calcify at every ligament insertion site.  I have bony over growth in my feet, which interfere with the articulation of my foot joints. I can feel the bones sticking out of my ankles and the tops of my feet; I'm beginning to fuse in my left foot.  In three weeks I'm heading for a double knee replacement because my left knee can't support my knee cap; over growth of bone has pushed it away.  It is getting more and more difficult to participate in daily activities as my range of motion is becoming limited. My elbows and my shoulders are affected as well...I can feel bony growth there as well. I'm losing feeling in my legs, as my nerves are being pinched; the pain shoots down to my feet and it is gripping. My hands can't grip a phone for any length of time. I found if my pain can be controlled, I can function well, but too many doctors are not up on the pain this disease produces.  Controlling the pain  keeps me moving, and that is what you need to do, but the support isn't there for this.  The disease is so rare that it is brushed off as regular osteoarthritis and it isn't, it's no where near the same.   I was diagnosed in my thirties and I have lived with chronic pain for over twenty years now.  I was told that it affects mostly males over the age of 70....bunk! It is genetic, as my mother had it and wasn't properly diagnosed with the disease and my brother has it as well.  My mother and I were deeply affected, she had it her feet as well and by the time she reached 70, she couldn't walk without crying in despair. I had one doctor treat me with Suboxone and it was the only drug that gave me back the quality of life others enjoyed.  He left for the north and I am back in severe pain once again. The problem with this disease, it's a square peg and everyone wants to fit into a round hole. I try to keep a smile on my face for my families sake, but the pain can be read all over my face.  I'm still young, by today's standards and I just want to be a participant in this life, not stuck in some corner watching my life and the world go passed me. 12 likes, 212 replies "

I was told the surgery was needed but by the time I get the appointment I am supposed to have my leg in a foot orthosis(air walking boot). The problem is that the boot causes pain in my ankles (there is also a slight redness on the ankle skin). When I told it to my doctor he just said that I had to bear the pain because this is still the most comfortable solution. He also didn't allow me to loosen the boot when the pain is occuring. However, at night the pain is so unbearable that I must loosen it when my foot is not moving. So is there any solution how to ease this pain? 0 likes, 0 replies "

I saw GP two days later, he examined my and informed that i had a muscle strain and to rest for two weeks. After 2 weeks i was still in pain  so i visited GP again and i requested xray.  The xray was done in my lumbar region ( ive recently discovered) and not where my pain is in thoracic region. XRAY showed no fractures in my lumbar spine, but did show evidence of osteopenia. I was then sent for a bone density scan. I then had a call from GP informing  that i have a vertebral fracture of T10 , but it is healing. I was then sent for another scan on my thoracic spine. Before the X ray the radiographer informed me that a DeXa scan isnt accurate at diagnosing vertebral fracture and that it may be something else. Wonder if anyway has knowledge of dexa scan and the likelihood that ive fractured T10 vertebra. Dont know what to think as im getting mixed information. I continue to have painful muscle spasms and struggle to walk for any length of time, stand or sit unsupported.  I'm still signed off work. THANKS 0 likes, 2 replies "

In relation to this, I looked at the mirror only to realize a lump in the right side of my neck which got me even worried. I immediately set up an appointment with an ENT.

Still, he couldn't make sense of the fact that my hyoid bone was clicking, since according to him it's a very rare condition that only occurs after a trauma, which I'm pretty sure I had no history of. He told me not to concern myself too much with the clicking in my throat for as long as it doesn't obstruct my airway and doesn't cause any pain. I have (-) pain (-) difficulty in swallowing. He advised me to massage the area near the hyoid bone for 2 weeks, 3x a day for 15 minutes and maybe put warm compress on it. It's been more than a week after the check up yet I feel no improvement.

My pain is still there, and right now one of my joints (right around the base of my neck) hurts to the touch and feels a bit swollen. I was at first terrified it might be because of a tumour, but have since been reassured that it might be because I put a lot of strain on my neck, and the pain has decreased a bit. I was also concerned about arthritis: which I might have, but I am 19, so I'm not sure if that's possible or not. Anyways, what's really been worrying me the past few days is that my left calf, from about the knee to the ankle area, has started to hurt a lot. It's a pretty consistent pain, although its worse going up or down stairs, and sometimes makes me limp a bit when I walk. The last time I got pain like this, it was from hiking a really difficult trail: but I haven't done any really intense excercise (and tbh, not much exercise in general) lately. There's a bit of occasional pain in my hip too, and it sometimes ""pops out"", so to say. I'm scared that the pain might be from bone cancer, because it's not going away like muscle pain usually should. And it's not really related to my back, so I doubt it would be blamed on the sculiosus (which I'm probably spelling wrong). I know I need to see a doctor about it, but right now nothing is helping my panic. I do have a history of being a big hypochrondriac, but still. This time, it really does feel like something is wrong. Has anyone had similar pain?? What did it turn out to be?? 0 likes, 0 replies "

I'm not given a whole lot per month but I always find myself running out early as I'm only supposed to stick to 3x 50mg per day. I take about 200mg daily right now down from 400mg daily. Yesterday I took 150mg.  I have been 24 hours now without it. I take pregablin also so that's kept me calm. I am feeling okay apart from a little RLS in my knees.   What can I expect? How can I cope, I've a whole week of work now ahead of me so I have to pretend to be normal. I'm very prone to depression. I will continue to take it when my pain is really bad, but I'd rather not take it every day. Eventually, I'd like come off it altogether and live a healthier life.

182,C0035258,Restless Legs Syndrome,C0404484,Chronic pelvic pain of female,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/tramadol-withdrawal-387751,Tramadol Withdrawal,"Hi There I'm not sure if anyone here can help. I saw some discussions on tramadol withdrawal on this site but it was from about 6 months ago so i'm just praying someone is still on who can help. Here is my story, I began taking tramadol about 5 months ago for chronic pelvic pain. I had told my doctor i had some trouble becoming dependant on Vicodin in the past so instead she prescribed Tramadol saying that i would not become addicted if i follow the appropriate dosage. Well that didn't work because eventrually it made me feel so good and happy i took it for recreational purposes. I blew through all 90 pills in 7 days. I was taking up to 500mg a day but then they wouldn't refil my prescription for three more weeks so i would withdraw and then get right back on the tramadol once my prescription was up. This time, I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK. I stopped cold turkey Wednesday night at 9:30pm after taking my last 200mg and now it is Friday morning. I have some minor restless legs but i have NO ENERGY and i feel like LIFE TRULY SUCKS. I know that working out will help and eating might help and getting some excercise but get this, i actually came to my office job today. I figure that rather than call in i'll try to push through the last work day of the week. My 5 year old son comes home on Sunday afternoon so i want to do all that i can today and Saturday to at least get back to the point where i can care for him. Any suggestions on how to get out of this slump in the next two days would be grately appreciated. Nobody knows about this, not even my boyfriend. I'm just so afraid of being judged. I feel like anyone i tell will judge me and i feel like my boyfriend will run the other way if i tell him so i HAVE to do this alone. PLEASE HELP!   1 like, 50 replies "

Not very fast, not very steep, was just trying to get my steps in. I have been regularly active (weightlifting and cardio) for about three years, so this was not out of the ordinary for me, I consider myself in pretty good shape. Later that same day, I noticed I had unusual pain all throughout my left leg. I figured I just walked on it funny and it would go away with time, so I just rested and stretched. Within a week it got worse, and the pain was especially bad in my left low back, left glute, left hip flexor, and left IT band (and sometimes the left knee if I was on my feet a lot during the day). I was even limping for a couple days and could not find a way to make the pain stop (sitting, standing, lying down, nothing). I went to see a sports medicine orthopaedic doctor (specialized in the hip), and she diagnosed me with a strained muscle in the glute (no imaging or testing done, she diagnosed off of the symptoms I described). She told me to stretch and rest. I tried that but still had a lot of pain. So I went online to do some research about my pain, and found exercises and stretches for ""Piriformis Syndrome"" and within a few weeks my pain was much better, but still there. About 3-4 weeks ago it started getting pretty bad again, to the point that it is keeping me awake at night. I get the most severe pain in my left low back (SI joint maybe? I'm not sure) and left hip flexor (and sometimes the upper left quad closest to the hip flexor/groin) almost constantly, no matter what I do. It gets especially bad when doing any type of squatting motion (ie to pick something up off the floor), bending over motion (ie to get something out of the fridge or pantry), and sometimes sitting irritates it as well. I have rested my legs for these ~3 weeks (no working out, only going on gentle walks around my neighborhood 2-3 times a week) and it is not getting any better. I've googled stretches and exercises and tried them out, they give temporary relief but it always comes back (examples: butterfly stretch, static lunges, glute bridges, cobra push ups, hamstring stretches, etc). I have tried massaging the hip flexor, and it is tender to the touch, and it gives temporary relief as well, but the pain comes back very quickly once I stop. The pain is not debilitating, I can still function from day to day, but being unable to workout is bothersome and the pain coming and going from day to day is getting stressful and burdensome. Some days I feel like it's getting better then the next day it's back, even if I did nothing strenuous or abnormal the day before. I do not know what else to do. Due to the global pandemic right now, it is very difficult to get into the doctor for non-emergencies, so that isn't really an option for me at the moment. I am hoping to go to the doctor again once things in my city settle down. Any advice is very appreciated. Thank you in advance! 0 likes, 0 replies "

On being discharged the nurse gave me a packet of 50mg Tramadol capsules to ease the pain, although the pain wasn't that bad. I had been walking to the toilet (in hospital) within 4 hours of recovering from the op. Anyway, I got home on Saturday and what with the fairly long walk from the hospital to the taxi, plus getting in and out of the car, I was starting to feel some twinges, so I took 2 Tramadol. Much later that evening I started to have really weird side effects. They are so difficult to describe. A combination of panic attack, dizziness, extreme fatigue, and difficulty nodding off to sleep. I'd nod off, like one does, then I'd immediately have these images in my head - people I'd seen on TV that day, cars, animals, all jumbled up.  Then I must have fallen asleep for an hour or two only to come awake with a start after having this veritable nightmare of there being someone in the room and when I opened my eyes (in my sleep just before coming awake) there was this extremely tall guy, 9 feet tall, his head was literally brushing the ceiling. Then \""he\"" walked across the room to another bed (my mind thought it was still in the 4-bed unit in the hospital ward) and disappeared! As if in a puff of smoke. And at that point I awoke feeling hot and sweaty. So those were the last Tramadol *I* was ever going to take, I can tell you. And then, yesterday, Thursday I had severe itching at the surgical wound site. This had nothing to do with the Tramadol I'd taken on Saturday, which must have been out of my system by then. Anyway, apart from the itching there was still a bit of an ache, so I thought I'd take just a single Tramadol capsule. The itching went; the dull ache went. But this morning, very early, about 04:00am, I awoke feeling anything but refreshed. I had some numb feelings in my hand and thigh, they kept coming and going. I got up at around 05:45am, make a cup of tea, then suddenly felt very weak. Jittery, fast pulse, zonked. Since then I have just lain on my bed in between going for a short walk and am drinking glasses of water in an attempt to flush this [b:095f76e716]POISON[/b:095f76e716] out of my system and am starting to feel a little better. Earlier in the week on doctor's recommendation I booked an appointment with the nurse for this afternoon to have the dressing changed and the incision checked (it's a long, vertical cut about 4 inches long; they found  two hernias), and in order to save on taxi fares I booked one of the free pick-up buses to take me and bring me back. However, I've just cancelled them and have ordered a taxi instead as I cannot face the lengthy zig-zag route these buses often take as they have to pick up numerous other people. I'll talk to the nurse about Tramadol and see what she says. I don't need any pain killers now and if I still get one or two twinges in the next few days, I shall take only paracetamol if necessary. (Not allowed to take ibuprofen or similar NSAIDs as I have a tendency to gastritis and duodenal ulcer.) So, I am never going to touch Tramadol ever again and this time I mean it. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy. If some people take it just to get \""high\"" they must be stark, raving mad. 5 likes, 53 replies "

Then after the season finished, i only took it when i experienced bad pain walking home from work, but its getting consistently more difficult not to take it when i don't actually need it for pain relief. i got up to 500mg and occasionally 600mg a day, but this made me feel uncomfortable as this much is definitely not safe for consumption on a daily basis. i only take a maximum of 300mg a day now, but it is everyday at the minute. i need to stop, although this is a great reliever of physical (and emotional) pain relief for me, i need to learn another way to beat this disease i have. i cant turn to family because they don't agree with any drugs and our relationship would diminish, and i know my girlfriend, although she loves me would leave me out of selfishness for her own quality of life, but i understand that. so i'm alone with this, this is the first time i have spoke about it on any platform anywhere, ever. i need advice, and some help.  Thanks for your time.

It all started with an operation on my wrist. Like most people I was prescribed it for the pain but, despite being a sensible, mature and reasonably successful young woman at the time, I found myself hooked and unable to stop. I spent most of the last 10 years feeling guilt, shame and a sense of weakness that I’d found myself in this position. Over the years, I’ve read lots of these forums and threads with advice regarding the best way to quit, tapering, cold turkey, replacement etc.... and they’ve been a massive support to me. Firstly, they made me realise I was not alone and that this drug, whilst a necessary evil, is genuinely addictive and that helped with the shame and guilt. Secondly, the forums gave me hope that some day, I would find the same strength as others to quit for good.  So, that’s the reason I’m here. Just maybe I can give someone else the same hope and eventual success that I have been fortunate enough to have. I’m clean. I have been for the last 3 months and I feel like I’ve really done it. I’m not going to flower it up, it hasn’t been fun at times. However, I’m here, sleeping well, pain free and feeling healthier than I have in years.  I tried a few methods but I have tapered in the end. It took a long time to get to zero (14 months) but month by month, I’ve lowered the dose and I’m finally there.  In the UK, the capsules come in no lower than 50mg strength.I’m not ashamed to say that I’ve even found myself opening a capsule and removing half the powder and putting it back together when reducing by a whole cap was a step too far. It’s a tricky and fiddly thing to do but it was the saviour to get me down between 100 a day and 50 a day. I don’t know why that bit was so hard, I stuck at that point for a long time.  In the last few months, I added new healthy foods and gentle exercise to my regime and I found that this really helped with the  .  Anyway, I’m off, it’s over and I’m thrilled. For those of you trying, please please keep going, you CAN do it and I can confirm that there is a better you on the other side. I feel like my appetite for life has returned.  Good luck and best wishes to all of you . X  1 like, 7 replies "

I dropped the klonopin as well.  will only do one at a time safer and less withdrawals if I had know the process of this I would never would have taken either drug.   think health care providers should tell patients what they are up against and off alternative s to addictive drugs.

Tramadol provides a reliable source of relief to many pain sufferers and patients with other medical problems. The VARIABLE in all this ... is the individual patient, everyone's body makeup is different and so will react and produce different side effects with every drug they take. The only way to find out how your body will react is to give the prescribed drug a try, preferably for a couple weeks if this will be a long-term drug and if it doesn't suit you talk to your doctor. They most likely can find an alternative that will suit you. That's one of the reasons why there are so many drugs that do the same thing.  As for not knowing the possibilities of what might happen - there's only two people you can blame, one - your doctor for not giving you some important facts and two - yourself for not researching your prescription online.  Personally I think doctors even on the NHS should take more time to spell out the common effects and if it can be addictive but I do understand that they don't usually have the time. This isn't going to change anytime soon though, so... There is a plethora of information online, on any prescription drug and it will tell you everything you need to know before you take it. Some websites, like  , even have an Interactions Checker which you can input all your medications into and check if they will react badly. It's very cool and I even was able to bring a bad mix up to my doctor who was able to clarify that the short amount of time I was taking the new drug would be ok with my regular prescription.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Tramadol is a synthetic (man made) opiate. It does not mix well with natural opiates such as cocodamol as one person was complaining about in this forum. Always check with your doctor if you feel uncomfortable and always take prescriptions as advised. If you start mixing things up and not understanding the chemistry behind it then what do you expect? COMMON SIDE EFFECTS:   Constipation; diarrhea; dizziness; drowsiness; dry mouth; headache; increased sweating; indigestion; mild itching; nausea; trouble sleeping; vomiting; weakness. Constipation seems to be the most common and would advise a gentle laxative.  If you have any SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS (see following) then go to A&E or see the doctor the next day depending on how bad it is, stop taking the Tramadol until you can get medical advice:    Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue; unusual hoarseness); burning, numbness, or tingling; chest pain; confusion; difficult or painful urination; disorientation; excessive sweating; fainting; fast or irregular heartbeat; fever; hallucinations; loss of coordination; mood or mental changes (eg, depression, agitation); red, blistered, swollen, or peeling skin; seizures; severe dizziness or light-headedness; severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; severe or persistent headache; slow or shallow breathing; suicidal thoughts or behaviors; tremor; vision problems; wheezing. I DON'T WANT TO BECOME ADDICTED:   Well most people don't. If your condition will be temporary then consider asking for Codeine (a natural opiate) which doesn't work as well but will help relieve some of the pain. Always take paracetamol at the same time you take any opiate, my NHS doctors have always told me this, saying that they both work better together than just the opiate alone and in my experience this is true. Also when you feel the pain is minimal to moderate, try taking just paracetamol and skipping a dose of your opiate when possible. Once you do this more often than not you can either realize that you can live with minimal pain or only take the opiate sporadically as needed. If you have a long term condition like me, then I'll tell you what my doctor in the US told me when I told her I didn't want to become addicted. First, she said, you're only an addict if you're taking the drug to get a high, otherwise you're just dependent. Then she told me I can either take the drug to alleviate the pain and get some normal things done on a daily basis or don't take it and live with a pain that will most likely prevent me from leaving my bed and become agitated and irritated with everything and everyone because of my relentless pain. She said there is no shame in become dependent and that when the time came to stop there would be a safe period of weaning the drug and a plan for the withdrawal. I added that most NHS doctors are ambivalent towards things like this and she said, then demand it. I did and I was helped, no NHS doctor ever judged me for being dependent and it does seem like they deal with this often. They are not as organised as in the U.S. where you can get a 'kick pack' which contains valium, supplements and many useful tips but my NHS doctor did prescribe me valium for 4 days which was enough to get over the 'hump' and I researched and procured the other supplements and tips I needed online.  WHY YOU BECOME DEPENDENT:  In plain speak, Tramadol does the job of making your body feel good and does it so well that it relieves the overabundant amount of pain your going through because of your medical condition. Once your body realizes it doesn't have to do this job anymore, it will stop, that's when your body has become 'dependent'. When you stop taking the Tramadol and your body hasn't yet taken it's 'job' back, you feel withdrawal symptoms because there is nothing making you feel good. The withdrawal will end once your body takes back it's normal job of releasing the chemicals which make you feel good. HOW TO OVERCOME THE WITHDRAWAL PERIOD:   If you have become dependent Tramadol and you most likely have if you've been taking it for a long time, it's almost always best to consult with your doctor about a withdrawal plan. They can help give you a plan to wean the drug and also be there for when you need muscle relaxers if you need them once you stop the drug. If they are not helpful, see another doctor, rinse and repeat (especially if you're on NHS!).  Even better   -   What you can do is research all this on the internet but I will include this one link because I felt it was the one who helped me the most when I went through it. Not just the info but the people who commented and gave support. There are many forums that will do the same thing, find one which has active supportive members (and a plan you feel comfortable with) and I promise you will feel better about being able to get feedback from people who have felt what you are going through. Actually I'm going to link the process I used for withdrawal, it's from the same site and you can explore that further if you want or just Google 'opiate withdrawal forum' for support and plans. Oh and I should also warn that you will come across a lot of people who don't know what they are talking about, but you should be able to spot them pretty quick,. Just ignore them, find good info and support, that's the best thing to do.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I hope this is more helpful than not. I'm not sure why people come here to complain about a drug. The drug has been well tested and it's not dangerous. However being ill-informed about a drug, how you take it and the possibilities ...well that certainly can be.

Always check with your doctor if you feel uncomfortable and always take prescriptions as advised. If you start mixing things up and not understanding the chemistry behind it then what do you expect? COMMON SIDE EFFECTS:   Constipation; diarrhea; dizziness; drowsiness; dry mouth; headache; increased sweating; indigestion; mild itching; nausea; trouble sleeping; vomiting; weakness. Constipation seems to be the most common and would advise a gentle laxative.  If you have any SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS (see following) then go to A&E or see the doctor the next day depending on how bad it is, stop taking the Tramadol until you can get medical advice:    Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue; unusual hoarseness); burning, numbness, or tingling; chest pain; confusion; difficult or painful urination; disorientation; excessive sweating; fainting; fast or irregular heartbeat; fever; hallucinations; loss of coordination; mood or mental changes (eg, depression, agitation); red, blistered, swollen, or peeling skin; seizures; severe dizziness or light-headedness; severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; severe or persistent headache; slow or shallow breathing; suicidal thoughts or behaviors; tremor; vision problems; wheezing. I DON'T WANT TO BECOME ADDICTED:   Well most people don't. If your condition will be temporary then consider asking for Codeine (a natural opiate) which doesn't work as well but will help relieve some of the pain. Always take paracetamol at the same time you take any opiate, my NHS doctors have always told me this, saying that they both work better together than just the opiate alone and in my experience this is true. Also when you feel the pain is minimal to moderate, try taking just paracetamol and skipping a dose of your opiate when possible. Once you do this more often than not you can either realize that you can live with minimal pain or only take the opiate sporadically as needed. If you have a long term condition like me, then I'll tell you what my doctor in the US told me when I told her I didn't want to become addicted. First, she said, you're only an addict if you're taking the drug to get a high, otherwise you're just dependent. Then she told me I can either take the drug to alleviate the pain and get some normal things done on a daily basis or don't take it and live with a pain that will most likely prevent me from leaving my bed and become agitated and irritated with everything and everyone because of my relentless pain. She said there is no shame in become dependent and that when the time came to stop there would be a safe period of weaning the drug and a plan for the withdrawal. I added that most NHS doctors are ambivalent towards things like this and she said, then demand it. I did and I was helped, no NHS doctor ever judged me for being dependent and it does seem like they deal with this often. They are not as organised as in the U.S. where you can get a 'kick pack' which contains valium, supplements and many useful tips but my NHS doctor did prescribe me valium for 4 days which was enough to get over the 'hump' and I researched and procured the other supplements and tips I needed online.  WHY YOU BECOME DEPENDENT:  In plain speak, Tramadol does the job of making your body feel good and does it so well that it relieves the overabundant amount of pain your going through because of your medical condition. Once your body realizes it doesn't have to do this job anymore, it will stop, that's when your body has become 'dependent'. When you stop taking the Tramadol and your body hasn't yet taken it's 'job' back, you feel withdrawal symptoms because there is nothing making you feel good. The withdrawal will end once your body takes back it's normal job of releasing the chemicals which make you feel good. HOW TO OVERCOME THE WITHDRAWAL PERIOD:   If you have become dependent Tramadol and you most likely have if you've been taking it for a long time, it's almost always best to consult with your doctor about a withdrawal plan. They can help give you a plan to wean the drug and also be there for when you need muscle relaxers if you need them once you stop the drug. If they are not helpful, see another doctor, rinse and repeat (especially if you're on NHS!).

They are not as organised as in the U.S. where you can get a 'kick pack' which contains valium, supplements and many useful tips but my NHS doctor did prescribe me valium for 4 days which was enough to get over the 'hump' and I researched and procured the other supplements and tips I needed online.  WHY YOU BECOME DEPENDENT:  In plain speak, Tramadol does the job of making your body feel good and does it so well that it relieves the overabundant amount of pain your going through because of your medical condition. Once your body realizes it doesn't have to do this job anymore, it will stop, that's when your body has become 'dependent'. When you stop taking the Tramadol and your body hasn't yet taken it's 'job' back, you feel withdrawal symptoms because there is nothing making you feel good. The withdrawal will end once your body takes back it's normal job of releasing the chemicals which make you feel good. HOW TO OVERCOME THE WITHDRAWAL PERIOD:   If you have become dependent Tramadol and you most likely have if you've been taking it for a long time, it's almost always best to consult with your doctor about a withdrawal plan. They can help give you a plan to wean the drug and also be there for when you need muscle relaxers if you need them once you stop the drug. If they are not helpful, see another doctor, rinse and repeat (especially if you're on NHS!).  Even better   -   What you can do is research all this on the internet but I will include this one link because I felt it was the one who helped me the most when I went through it. Not just the info but the people who commented and gave support. There are many forums that will do the same thing, find one which has active supportive members (and a plan you feel comfortable with) and I promise you will feel better about being able to get feedback from people who have felt what you are going through. Actually I'm going to link the process I used for withdrawal, it's from the same site and you can explore that further if you want or just Google 'opiate withdrawal forum' for support and plans. Oh and I should also warn that you will come across a lot of people who don't know what they are talking about, but you should be able to spot them pretty quick,. Just ignore them, find good info and support, that's the best thing to do.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I hope this is more helpful than not. I'm not sure why people come here to complain about a drug. The drug has been well tested and it's not dangerous. However being ill-informed about a drug, how you take it and the possibilities ...well that certainly can be. Best of wishes to everyone struggling with their conditions, keep looking towards the future! Ronni <3>3> 22 likes, 181 replies "

Just getting nervous, because the week of July 4th after a camping trip I was admitted to the hospital with osteomyelitis of the calcaneus (and possibly according to the MRI) the talus.  I spent almost 3 weeks in the hospital having a debrediedment of the bottom of my foot and back of my ankle/heel, and IV  .  I was sent home on oral antibiotics for another 4 weeks. At first I was able to walk with a limo and a little pain, fast forward to 2 months ago and I'm in excruciating pain and can no longer walk without crutches. After finally getting some insurance together an xray showed some possible bone softening a month ago in the ER and I finally have an MRI scheduled for 2 days from now. I'm nervous that I may still have om, but in a way will be relieved because then I know what is going on...and the treatment that will follow, probably another few weeks in the hospital for antibiotics and possibly surgery, BUT if not...then what?! I've been waiting 2 months already for insurance to clear so I can get treated for this, I guess I just needed to vent a little because no one else can understand what I'm going through. I'm a scrub nurse so the idea of being in the hospital and surgery don't bother me, lol it's the not being able to walk or bear weight for 2 months is killing me, and if it's not om, well then it's like I'll have to start this over. Has anyone else out there not responded to initial treatment? Any responses would be sincerely appreciated: ) 0 likes, 9 replies "

As the day progressed it got so bad my sister and husband had to take me to the emergency room that night (just barely able to get in the car). When I got to the ER they pumped me up with morphine and chalked it up to just favoring one leg over the other while sending me home with oxycodone. The next day while on oxy the pain got even worse and that night I was taken back by ambulance two parameds and cops to get me on the stretcher.  When I got back to the ER they said I had a 101 fever.  Long story short and after the second mri with contrast I was diagnosed with it. The doctor had a suspicion since I had no sciatica pain and was started on antibiotics.

I was diagnosed with Osteomyelitis of the jaw just over two and half years ago, at the age of 56. In November 2015 I developed excruciating toothache, accompanied by a numb section of my chin, and a swollen face. I spent several days and nights trying to get emergency dentist treatment, going to my doctor and getting fobbed off (it was a dental problem, therefore he couldn't/wouldn't treat me, or even prescribe any kind of pain relief!), and finally ending up at A & E. When I finally got an appointment to see my dentist, he was very concerned about the numbness and contacted the local Maxiofacial unit. They said it wasn't urgent and he should either give me root canal work or extract the tooth! My dentist asked which I would prefer and, due to the immense pain, I opted for extraction. The tooth in question was a back molar (second to last tooth, left side, bottom jaw), he gave it the slightest of tugs and it was out - I barely felt it come out - then referred me to the Maxiofacial unit because he still wasn't happy. They finally saw me in January and after a few appointments there, with scans and finally a CT scan, the consultant informed me that I had Osteomyelitis and that some of the marrow in my jaw was dead. Surgery was arranged and I had the dead marrow removed, long with a fair portion of gum - I am now left with a sizeable gap between my last back molar and the next tooth. Eventually the numbness went and the swelling went down - not before my 'day patient' experience became a three-day stay due to my blood pressure crashing through the floor after my op, and no-one being able to get a doctor onto the ward to see me, and extreme difficulty in getting a blood test done (an anaesthetist finally managed to do a blood test after one particular doctor appeared, tried ham-fistedly once, failed, gave up and said he couldn't do it and went off!). My op was around 10 am and a doctor finally saw me around 8 pm and insisted I be sent up to a ward immediately! During my illness, and recovery, I experienced absolutely crashing fatigue - the type that makes you so tired that even the thought of having to get out of bed makes you want to cry. Since then, this tiredness has not one away. I find that I am permanently exhausted, regardless of my diet or amount of exercise I take. Although not as severe as when I had osteomyelitis, it is debilitating and constant.

I was just diagnosed with Osteomyelitis of the upper left maxillary area after suffering for the last few years with facial swelling, intense dizziness, & stabbing pains spreading from my ear to jaw. Needless to say this has been an absolute nightmare & I figured I would share my experience in the hopes that someone can relate & possibly offer their own experiences & advice.  So for years I started suffering from chronic sinus infections & dizziness always on the left side of my head. I learned to live with it for the most part until around a year ago  when it became debilitating. I went to every doctor imaginable thinking it was my thyroid or something. Every blood test came back normal. One morning I woke up & noticed my upper left jaw was throbbing & I started wondering if I had a tooth infection. I remembered that I had a root canal done about 5 years ago on that side & the gum had gotten infected 3 x after it was done. I was always given antibiotics & the gum infection would go away.  I went to the dentist & he didn’t see any infection or anything wrong with the tooth. The throbbing & pain continued to intensify & I went to an oral surgeon who also said the tooth looked fine & that he believed I had a sinus infection & referred me to an ENT. The ENT couldn’t see anything wrong with my sinuses.  I finally decided to have the tooth extracted because even though they said it wasn’t infected by that point I was convinced it was as the pain continued to intensify & it was absolutely coming from right above that tooth.  The dentist who performed the extraction said that a canal was missed & there was significant bone loss around the tooth. She believed that this was the cause of all the pain & dizziness. I was prescribed Clindamycin & went home feeling happy thinking I was finally going to start feeling better....How wrong I was!! That’s when the real problems started. The day after the extraction I felt like I was dying. My face & ear felt like it was going to explode, my heart was pounding over 110 bpm & it felt like someone was stabbing the top of my head with 10 knives & was set on fire.  I went to the ER but because I didn’t have a fever & my gums looked like they were healing they refused to do a CT scan or give me additional antibiotics. They told me I had anxiety.  Over the next few days the pain continued to increase & I went to a local walk-in clinic & begged them for additional antibiotics. They took pity on me & gave me Bactrim & along with the Clindamycin the pain started to subside & I was able to go back to work even though I continued to feel achy & dizzy.  Long story short I had been seen by 3 oral surgeons, 2 ENTs, a neurologist, and every other type of doctor under the sun. None of them wanted to do a CT scan or MRI because they said that it couldn’t be an infection because my gums were healing, my face didn’t have really overt swelling & I was running a high temperature. I spent many many nights crying-half because of the pain & half because of frustration of not being listened to or taken seriously.  I finally went to an infectious disease doctor who immediately ordered an MRI of the area & put me back on antibiotics. Im still waiting for the mri report but I brought her the CD & she said I have a deep spatial face infection & that she’s 99% sure that it spread into the bone based on the appearance of the pics.  I’m supposed to have surgery to drain the abscess & scrape away pieces of the infected bone. She told me I will most likely be on long term antibiotics after.  My question is has anyone else been through this? How bad was the surgery & recovery? Did you feel better after? Was your infection ever cured or does it never really go away? I know that this is really rare & both difficult to diagnose & treat.  *Also side note...I’ve been reading about the dangers of root canals & how it is impossible to get all of the bacteria out of an infected tooth. On top of that once the procedure is done the tooth has no way to receive blood, oxygen, etc. as it has no root & it becomes a breeding ground for bacteria & toxins that your immune system & antibiotics can’t reach. Have any of you had a root canal & did you find that your problems started or worsened in that area of your jaw even years after? I feel like this is the case with me...The crazy thing is the tooth never ever looked infected on an X-ray. I decided to extract it only because I had a gut feeling something was wrong with it because the gum above it got infected a few times since having it done.  I was curious if anyone ever considered a normal seemingly uninfected root canal tooth as a possible “silent” cause? & that while it’s still in the mouth no matter how many surgeries or rounds of antibiotics the infection will always come back since the root canaled tooth is causing it?  That may explain why this condition is so hard to treat. Did anyone have a root canaled tooth extracted & did your condition improve?  Thanks for reading    1 like, 4 replies "

I was just diagnosed with Osteomyelitis of the upper left maxillary area after suffering for the last few years with facial swelling, intense dizziness, & stabbing pains spreading from my ear to jaw. Needless to say this has been an absolute nightmare & I figured I would share my experience in the hopes that someone can relate & possibly offer their own experiences & advice.  So for years I started suffering from chronic sinus infections & dizziness always on the left side of my head. I learned to live with it for the most part until around a year ago  when it became debilitating. I went to every doctor imaginable thinking it was my thyroid or something. Every blood test came back normal. One morning I woke up & noticed my upper left jaw was throbbing & I started wondering if I had a tooth infection. I remembered that I had a root canal done about 5 years ago on that side & the gum had gotten infected 3 x after it was done. I was always given antibiotics & the gum infection would go away.  I went to the dentist & he didn’t see any infection or anything wrong with the tooth. The throbbing & pain continued to intensify & I went to an oral surgeon who also said the tooth looked fine & that he believed I had a sinus infection & referred me to an ENT. The ENT couldn’t see anything wrong with my sinuses.  I finally decided to have the tooth extracted because even though they said it wasn’t infected by that point I was convinced it was as the pain continued to intensify & it was absolutely coming from right above that tooth.  The dentist who performed the extraction said that a canal was missed & there was significant bone loss around the tooth. She believed that this was the cause of all the pain & dizziness. I was prescribed Clindamycin & went home feeling happy thinking I was finally going to start feeling better....How wrong I was!! That’s when the real problems started. The day after the extraction I felt like I was dying.

On top of that once the procedure is done the tooth has no way to receive blood, oxygen, etc. as it has no root & it becomes a breeding ground for bacteria & toxins that your immune system & antibiotics can’t reach. Have any of you had a root canal & did you find that your problems started or worsened in that area of your jaw even years after? I feel like this is the case with me...The crazy thing is the tooth never ever looked infected on an X-ray. I decided to extract it only because I had a gut feeling something was wrong with it because the gum above it got infected a few times since having it done.  I was curious if anyone ever considered a normal seemingly uninfected root canal tooth as a possible “silent” cause? & that while it’s still in the mouth no matter how many surgeries or rounds of antibiotics the infection will always come back since the root canaled tooth is causing it?  That may explain why this condition is so hard to treat.

I was just diagnosed with Osteomyelitis of the upper left maxillary area after suffering for the last few years with facial swelling, intense dizziness, & stabbing pains spreading from my ear to jaw. Needless to say this has been an absolute nightmare & I figured I would share my experience in the hopes that someone can relate & possibly offer their own experiences & advice.  So for years I started suffering from chronic sinus infections & dizziness always on the left side of my head. I learned to live with it for the most part until around a year ago  when it became debilitating. I went to every doctor imaginable thinking it was my thyroid or something. Every blood test came back normal. One morning I woke up & noticed my upper left jaw was throbbing & I started wondering if I had a tooth infection. I remembered that I had a root canal done about 5 years ago on that side & the gum had gotten infected 3 x after it was done. I was always given antibiotics & the gum infection would go away.  I went to the dentist & he didn’t see any infection or anything wrong with the tooth. The throbbing & pain continued to intensify & I went to an oral surgeon who also said the tooth looked fine & that he believed I had a sinus infection & referred me to an ENT. The ENT couldn’t see anything wrong with my sinuses.  I finally decided to have the tooth extracted because even though they said it wasn’t infected by that point I was convinced it was as the pain continued to intensify & it was absolutely coming from right above that tooth.  The dentist who performed the extraction said that a canal was missed & there was significant bone loss around the tooth. She believed that this was the cause of all the pain & dizziness. I was prescribed Clindamycin & went home feeling happy thinking I was finally going to start feeling better....How wrong I was!! That’s when the real problems started. The day after the extraction I felt like I was dying. My face & ear felt like it was going to explode, my heart was pounding over 110 bpm & it felt like someone was stabbing the top of my head with 10 knives & was set on fire.  I went to the ER but because I didn’t have a fever & my gums looked like they were healing they refused to do a CT scan or give me additional antibiotics. They told me I had anxiety.  Over the next few days the pain continued to increase & I went to a local walk-in clinic & begged them for additional antibiotics. They took pity on me & gave me Bactrim & along with the Clindamycin the pain started to subside & I was able to go back to work even though I continued to feel achy & dizzy.  Long story short I had been seen by 3 oral surgeons, 2 ENTs, a neurologist, and every other type of doctor under the sun. None of them wanted to do a CT scan or MRI because they said that it couldn’t be an infection because my gums were healing, my face didn’t have really overt swelling & I was running a high temperature. I spent many many nights crying-half because of the pain & half because of frustration of not being listened to or taken seriously.  I finally went to an infectious disease doctor who immediately ordered an MRI of the area & put me back on antibiotics. Im still waiting for the mri report but I brought her the CD & she said I have a deep spatial face infection & that she’s 99% sure that it spread into the bone based on the appearance of the pics.  I’m supposed to have surgery to drain the abscess & scrape away pieces of the infected bone. She told me I will most likely be on long term antibiotics after.  My question is has anyone else been through this? How bad was the surgery & recovery? Did you feel better after?

I will start from the beginning... It started when I was 14 out of nowhere.  The dentist I saw said I had a displaced jaw bone and this was the reason for my pain. I will always remember him asking if I had a boyfriend 'as kissing would make it worse?!' I did not.  So at this stage I thought that this was the reason for my pain - a displaced jaw bone. I was given 600mg of Iboprufen and took this every day alongside paracetomal (8 tablets a day). Over the next year the pain got particularly worse and my face swelled like a balloon. At the age of 15 I did not sleep at all. I had constant pain and was taking as much painkillers as I possibly could. The swelling got that bad on the right side of my face I felt like a monster. I grew my hair to as long as I could and would constantly cover my face with my long hair and a scarf.  Over the summer it would be increasingly difficult to cover my face without a scarf and when I was 15 I could no longer take this pain from my 'displaced jaw'. My mum and dad took me to A&E. Instantly the doctors here realised something was not right and I was admitted. Many tests were done to see what the problem was. I was discharged from hospital with painkillers and had to wait for my results. I went to see one doctor for my results who I had seen whilst in A&E she specialised in cancer but luckily I was told by her I did not have this. I had tests such as blood tests, bone scans, MRI scans, CT scans and a biopsy which told me that I had Osteomyelitis in my right lower jaw bone. I was referred to a very good consultant in the 'maxfax' department. He said that the steps that would be taken would be firstly an operation which would be done internally to shave away the acess bone and would hopefully relieve me of some pain. Whilst waiting for the operation I was given the antibiotic Amoxycillin. I had the operation when I had just turned 16 I think. By this point I had not had a full night sleep for a year and a half. This was very frustrating as I was trying to live a normal life as possible. I was trying to be a good student at high school and not get behind with work. I was in excrutiatiing pain- I constantly felt like I was being viciously stabbed in the right side of my jaw. This pain often went up into my ear and below my eye. Often I was in too much pain to attend school, luckily I had one amazing teacher there that always sent work home and constantly reassured me that everything would be fine. I was particularly worried as this was happening whilst I was  preparing for my GCSE's. After the operation my face was badly bruised and I had very bad swelling. This was expected though as the operation wasn't plain and simple. One part of my face looked as though I had a tennis ball in it. I also had drains coming from underneath my chin that was draining access blood. I recovered in hospital for around 10 days and was given oral antibiotics to take home.  I saw my consultant regularly. Once the swelling had gone down from the operation- the swelling that was normally there from my osteomylitus wasn't as bad at the side of my jaw as this had been shaved away. Swelling of the bone was still there though. My consultant suggested I have hyperbaric treatment every day for 6 weeks. I was just waiting for a space to become available.  A space came available for the hyperbaric treatment - I remember being at school , I was taken out of my class to be told this treatment was going to start. I cried. A mixture of relief that the pain and this horrible swelling might eventually go. Again I missed a lot of school as I went every day to hull for this treatment. I have sworn to myself I would never have this treatment again. Hyperbaric treatment helps to get oxygen to the jaw so there is a better blood supply to the bone. A lot of cancer patients attended this treatment also. I had to enter a tank every day- put a oxygen mask over my head - something I can only describe as something astronauts would wear! For around two hours I was In this tank with a nurse and around 6 other patients- the pressure in the tank is changed and you have to make your ears pop like you would do on an aeroplane before the pressure goes below a certain number- a weird treatment but I can see the logic in it. I don't think the treatment really worked for me to be honest and I wouldn't do it again- but it may work well for others. For the next couple of years I went on to do my a levels. I was on long term anti biotics as the osteomylitus had not gone away. I found Amoxycillin did not work for me so I was put on long term penicillin whilst on painkillers. I found that stress aggravated my jaw bone and I had episodes where my jaw would swell up more. At this point I had always said to my consultant that it may be my wisdom teeth were making my jaw worse. I was put to sleep and I  had these removed from my right side- my pain did not stop so unfortunately this was not a cause of my osteomyelitis.  After my A levels I decided to take a year out and work full time at the job I was currently working part time at. At this point I was 18-19- during this time as I was older I could take stronger pain killers. I am intolerant to codeine so my options were ibuprofen and paracetomals or dicloflenac when this didn't work I would take tramadol which would have horrible side effects. When these did not control my pain my only option would be to go to A&E and be admitted to have stronger pain killers and anti biotics through an IV.  When I was 19 I was admitted to hospital because I was in so much pain. My consultant wasn't around at the hospital in this occasion so people he worked with decided they would operate as they wanted to drain my swelling at the side of my face of fluid as the swelling was getting uncreasingly worse. I have forgotten to mention that most of the time the opening of my mouth is restricted due to the swelling in and around my bone. This is another reason for operating. When they operated there was not a lot of fluid. The IV antibiotics took my pain and swelling done as well as a lot of morphine! And this episode seemed to be over with. That's what there seems to be these episodes where my face swells and which then leads to a lot of pain. Some times I go months without these flare ups. From the age 19.5 - 21 I had minor flare ups which were bare able.  At 19 I started the studying for my 3 year course for my degree- I didn't want this horrible infection to take over my life. During this time I was given a mouth guard to wear at night to make sure that grinding my teeth is not an aggravating factor, and I also had root canal treatment to make sure I had nerves in my teeth and that a tooth was not dead and the cause of the osteomylitus. All of my teeth are fine. It is now December 2011 I am 22. I am in the 3rd and final of my university degree. This year I have had many episodes/flare ups of my osteomyelitis - even though I always have it- my face can flare up and swell more and the pain is worse and becomes unbearable. This year I have been admitted into hospital twice.  First in April- the reason for this flare up I believe to be because of stress  with work from university as I had 4 exams in a week so lots of intense  studying. I had IV of antibiotics and Painkillers in hospital which seemed to work. I was in hospital for 4 days. August of this year I was admitted for the second time. This was a very different experience for me and not a pleasant one. My consultant was not informed that I was admitted and I had doctors which new nothing about my Illness working on me. I was in for 8 days. I was not happy and did not feel any better from me entering hospital until the time I left. Normally when I am given metrodisonal and clindamycin through IV this reduces the swelling this did not happen and the swelling started to go to the side of my throat. After seeing my consultant he suggested that we operate again as the anti biotics are not working as effectively. I really want to finish my degree at uni so I am trying to simply power through the pain. My consultant is fantastic and we work together as he rightly says nobody knows my condition as much as me. So I am delaying another operation at the minute. The operation Wil not guarantee that the osteomyelitis will go completely and this time he would have to operate externally which will leave me with a big scar. This is the reason for him not wanting to operate before with me being young he does not want to leave me with a big scar.  At the minute I am in the middle of another flare up it is close to Christmas  and I do not want to be in hospital again So I am trying to control the pain at home.  A few things I have forgot to mention: at one point my consultant explained to my mum the pain I was going through like having 10 abcesses under each tooth on the side of my face ( hopefully this will put the pain I go through in context)  Also factors I have found which make my osteomylitus flare ups worse: Cold weather (the reason for my recent flare up) The change in weather Lack of sleep Cold drinks Alcohol assumption when I am having a flare up. Finally, sorry if my story is a bit all over the place it is hard to remember everything that has happened in 8 years. Please anyone get in touch who have this condition maybe we can help each other?! 8 likes, 252 replies "

Over the summer it would be increasingly difficult to cover my face without a scarf and when I was 15 I could no longer take this pain from my 'displaced jaw'. My mum and dad took me to A&E. Instantly the doctors here realised something was not right and I was admitted. Many tests were done to see what the problem was. I was discharged from hospital with painkillers and had to wait for my results. I went to see one doctor for my results who I had seen whilst in A&E she specialised in cancer but luckily I was told by her I did not have this. I had tests such as blood tests, bone scans, MRI scans, CT scans and a biopsy which told me that I had Osteomyelitis in my right lower jaw bone. I was referred to a very good consultant in the 'maxfax' department. He said that the steps that would be taken would be firstly an operation which would be done internally to shave away the acess bone and would hopefully relieve me of some pain. Whilst waiting for the operation I was given the antibiotic Amoxycillin. I had the operation when I had just turned 16 I think. By this point I had not had a full night sleep for a year and a half. This was very frustrating as I was trying to live a normal life as possible. I was trying to be a good student at high school and not get behind with work. I was in excrutiatiing pain- I constantly felt like I was being viciously stabbed in the right side of my jaw. This pain often went up into my ear and below my eye. Often I was in too much pain to attend school, luckily I had one amazing teacher there that always sent work home and constantly reassured me that everything would be fine. I was particularly worried as this was happening whilst I was  preparing for my GCSE's. After the operation my face was badly bruised and I had very bad swelling. This was expected though as the operation wasn't plain and simple. One part of my face looked as though I had a tennis ball in it. I also had drains coming from underneath my chin that was draining access blood. I recovered in hospital for around 10 days and was given oral antibiotics to take home.  I saw my consultant regularly. Once the swelling had gone down from the operation- the swelling that was normally there from my osteomylitus wasn't as bad at the side of my jaw as this had been shaved away. Swelling of the bone was still there though. My consultant suggested I have hyperbaric treatment every day for 6 weeks. I was just waiting for a space to become available.  A space came available for the hyperbaric treatment - I remember being at school , I was taken out of my class to be told this treatment was going to start. I cried. A mixture of relief that the pain and this horrible swelling might eventually go. Again I missed a lot of school as I went every day to hull for this treatment. I have sworn to myself I would never have this treatment again. Hyperbaric treatment helps to get oxygen to the jaw so there is a better blood supply to the bone. A lot of cancer patients attended this treatment also. I had to enter a tank every day- put a oxygen mask over my head - something I can only describe as something astronauts would wear! For around two hours I was In this tank with a nurse and around 6 other patients- the pressure in the tank is changed and you have to make your ears pop like you would do on an aeroplane before the pressure goes below a certain number- a weird treatment but I can see the logic in it. I don't think the treatment really worked for me to be honest and I wouldn't do it again- but it may work well for others. For the next couple of years I went on to do my a levels. I was on long term anti biotics as the osteomylitus had not gone away. I found Amoxycillin did not work for me so I was put on long term penicillin whilst on painkillers. I found that stress aggravated my jaw bone and I had episodes where my jaw would swell up more. At this point I had always said to my consultant that it may be my wisdom teeth were making my jaw worse. I was put to sleep and I  had these removed from my right side- my pain did not stop so unfortunately this was not a cause of my osteomyelitis.  After my A levels I decided to take a year out and work full time at the job I was currently working part time at. At this point I was 18-19- during this time as I was older I could take stronger pain killers. I am intolerant to codeine so my options were ibuprofen and paracetomals or dicloflenac when this didn't work I would take tramadol which would have horrible side effects. When these did not control my pain my only option would be to go to A&E and be admitted to have stronger pain killers and anti biotics through an IV.  When I was 19 I was admitted to hospital because I was in so much pain. My consultant wasn't around at the hospital in this occasion so people he worked with decided they would operate as they wanted to drain my swelling at the side of my face of fluid as the swelling was getting uncreasingly worse. I have forgotten to mention that most of the time the opening of my mouth is restricted due to the swelling in and around my bone. This is another reason for operating. When they operated there was not a lot of fluid. The IV antibiotics took my pain and swelling done as well as a lot of morphine! And this episode seemed to be over with. That's what there seems to be these episodes where my face swells and which then leads to a lot of pain. Some times I go months without these flare ups. From the age 19.5 - 21 I had minor flare ups which were bare able.  At 19 I started the studying for my 3 year course for my degree- I didn't want this horrible infection to take over my life. During this time I was given a mouth guard to wear at night to make sure that grinding my teeth is not an aggravating factor, and I also had root canal treatment to make sure I had nerves in my teeth and that a tooth was not dead and the cause of the osteomylitus. All of my teeth are fine. It is now December 2011 I am 22. I am in the 3rd and final of my university degree. This year I have had many episodes/flare ups of my osteomyelitis - even though I always have it- my face can flare up and swell more and the pain is worse and becomes unbearable. This year I have been admitted into hospital twice.  First in April- the reason for this flare up I believe to be because of stress  with work from university as I had 4 exams in a week so lots of intense  studying. I had IV of antibiotics and Painkillers in hospital which seemed to work. I was in hospital for 4 days. August of this year I was admitted for the second time. This was a very different experience for me and not a pleasant one. My consultant was not informed that I was admitted and I had doctors which new nothing about my Illness working on me. I was in for 8 days. I was not happy and did not feel any better from me entering hospital until the time I left. Normally when I am given metrodisonal and clindamycin through IV this reduces the swelling this did not happen and the swelling started to go to the side of my throat. After seeing my consultant he suggested that we operate again as the anti biotics are not working as effectively. I really want to finish my degree at uni so I am trying to simply power through the pain. My consultant is fantastic and we work together as he rightly says nobody knows my condition as much as me. So I am delaying another operation at the minute. The operation Wil not guarantee that the osteomyelitis will go completely and this time he would have to operate externally which will leave me with a big scar. This is the reason for him not wanting to operate before with me being young he does not want to leave me with a big scar.  At the minute I am in the middle of another flare up it is close to Christmas  and I do not want to be in hospital again So I am trying to control the pain at home.  A few things I have forgot to mention: at one point my consultant explained to my mum the pain I was going through like having 10 abcesses under each tooth on the side of my face ( hopefully this will put the pain I go through in context)  Also factors I have found which make my osteomylitus flare ups worse: Cold weather (the reason for my recent flare up) The change in weather Lack of sleep Cold drinks Alcohol assumption when I am having a flare up. Finally, sorry if my story is a bit all over the place it is hard to remember everything that has happened in 8 years. Please anyone get in touch who have this condition maybe we can help each other?! 8 likes, 252 replies "

After spending nearly entire childhood on and off in hospital for long periods of time with full plaster casts up to underarms and frames, finally at the age of 12 last operation was done. I have just turned 52 and whilst up till the the last 3 years have managed pretty well. Married had 3 children and worked. Often got extra tired, but have always tried to keep up with others.  In the last 3 years things have been VERY difficult and scary. Endless tests,lack of understanding and neurological type problems, spine issues and still more tests and so far no resolution. I am pretty sure all the problems stem from having a long standing fused hip and it has taken it's toll on the rest of my body, especially spine.  I feel so alone with my problem because I have NEVER met or communicated with anyone who has a fused hip. I have gone on various sites, googled endlessly, but cannot find a single person who has same problem. It would be such a comfort to communicate with someone else with same situation or some support group. Even the medical professionals seem to lack understanding on fused hip and I feel like an alien because of this. So PLEASE, if you have a fused hip,especially one that has lasted this long I would love to here from you and hopefully we can change things for ourselves and others for the better. 8 likes, 223 replies "

Out of the blue I now have a tooth sensitive to hot and cold, and cannot chew with it and I fear a nerve is causing the problem. I am also on prednisone for PMR/GCA although have managed to reduce from 50mg to 2.5mg over the last 18 months. My fear is that I may have to have the tooth out, as my jaw and neck are now aching on that side, and I'm very concerned as to what is ahead as far as dental work goes, I know it can be very complicated.

So she agreed there was a curve and is querying whether I may have a compression fracture because of the appearance of my upper spine. I've been for an xray been referred to a spine clinic and also had   done. So obviously I have to do follow up to discover if it is, as she suspects it might be, osteoporosis. So the worry is what can they do if my spine is in fact fractured? I hope it's not the case. But if it is and it's old I am not sure what they can do with that. Any advice? Anyone else had a similar experience? thanks 0 likes, 23 replies "

Or so I thought. Fast forward to the tail end of January (27-28th). Started developing slight vertigo. It would come and go throughout the day (I mostly noticed it in closed corridors or whenever I showered). The vertigo eventually went away however after a few days. Weird. Fast forward a week later, maybe the 8th of February. I started developing ear fullness, and crackling. It was dull but constant . Eventually I got slight facial tension on my cheeks as well. No paralysis but almost like a sunburn or my face being pulled back. I spoke to my mother in law who's a nurse. She checked my ears and noticed they were swollen but no fluid. She suggested Motrin and Sudafed. Maybe it was sinus issue? I used it for one week straight. Didnt work. Eventually the vertigo came back. And now it came back even stronger. This was like the 14th of February. I started freaking out. I would get lightheaded out of nowhere and feel like passing out. My head felt so swollen. Almost as if someone wrapped a belt around my head. So I go to urgent care thinking Im dying. They checked my blood sugar. It was fine. Hemoglobin. Okay. Blood pressure? A little high due to panic attack. The urgent care doctor runs a basic neuro test on me...my finger following her finger, eyes following her finger etc. She checked my eyes and ears and her conclusion was... Migraine. Migraine...I've had migraines before. This did not feel like it. She prescribed me Sumatriptan for headaches and Zofran for nausea. It did not help so a few days later I went to the physician (17th of February). Physician ran the same test as urgent care doctor however he concluded I had middle/inner ear infection due to a virus that stuck around since January. He prescribed me ear drops, Meclizine for vertigo and Ibropufen. Now its been a few weeks since my appointment. My head still feels swollen but not as much during the day as before. Also, my facial tension has slightly diminished. Not as much vertigo. My eyes arent spinning anymore however I still have ear fullness and crackling. That being said, the odd thing is even though some symptoms are diminishing, I feel like I'm developing new symptoms. It almost feels like I am drowsy, drunk. I get tired very easily. Like I need to put my head down during the day. Also my heart rate would spike randomly. I could be resting at 60bpm then all of a sudden it can go to 90bpm as soon I start thinking about it. The best way to describe the feeling is like I have low blood sugar with high blood pressure. Secondly, I would get a throbbing sensation in hands and feet accompanied by cold sensations and pins and needles. Lastly, I feel like I can hear my heartbeat and it feels like its pumping harder. I'd like to note that all these symptoms come and go throughout the day. Some hrs are better than others but still constant every day. Doctor likes to say that its my anxiety due to panic attacks. He says it put a lot of pressure on my nerves. But I'm not sure. Its just so odd. I was perfectly fine leading up to the new year (working out 4 out of 7 days a week) then all of a sudden I'm having all these odd symptoms. Is the doctor right in saying this is an inner ear infection mixed with anxiety? Vestibular neuritis? Labyrinthitis? Cancer Its on my mind everyday. Maybe thats why I feel so fatigued? 5'7 male 29 years old 175 lbs Filipino Mexican Any advice would be amazing. Thank you so much.* 0 likes, 13 replies "

Or so I thought. Fast forward to the tail end of January (27-28th). Started developing slight vertigo. It would come and go throughout the day (I mostly noticed it in closed corridors or whenever I showered). The vertigo eventually went away however after a few days. Weird. Fast forward a week later, maybe the 8th of February. I started developing ear fullness, and crackling. It was dull but constant . Eventually I got slight facial tension on my cheeks as well. No paralysis but almost like a sunburn or my face being pulled back. I spoke to my mother in law who's a nurse. She checked my ears and noticed they were swollen but no fluid. She suggested Motrin and Sudafed. Maybe it was sinus issue? I used it for one week straight. Didnt work. Eventually the vertigo came back. And now it came back even stronger. This was like the 14th of February. I started freaking out. I would get lightheaded out of nowhere and feel like passing out. My head felt so swollen. Almost as if someone wrapped a belt around my head. So I go to urgent care thinking Im dying. They checked my blood sugar. It was fine. Hemoglobin. Okay. Blood pressure? A little high due to panic attack. The urgent care doctor runs a basic neuro test on me...my finger following her finger, eyes following her finger etc. She checked my eyes and ears and her conclusion was... Migraine. Migraine...I've had migraines before. This did not feel like it. She prescribed me Sumatriptan for headaches and Zofran for nausea. It did not help so a few days later I went to the physician (17th of February).

That being said, the odd thing is even though some symptoms are diminishing, I feel like I'm developing new symptoms. It almost feels like I am drowsy, drunk. I get tired very easily. Like I need to put my head down during the day. Also my heart rate would spike randomly. I could be resting at 60bpm then all of a sudden it can go to 90bpm as soon I start thinking about it.

Also, I understand K2 is beneficial  in preventing calcium build up - in the arteries, heart etc ? Am I right? If so, does it just help prevent build up from the onset of taking it or chip away and dissolve pre-existing calcium build up which has  possibly already been created? 10 out 10 for any answers with this one!

For the past 8 weeks I've had bouts of confusion/sedation/balance problems and general cognitive decline that has steadily increased in severity and comes on in 'waves' throughout the day. Recently it seems to be worsened by physical/mental exertion or having a large meal. At this point I can no longer work and at times have extreme difficulties in maintaining normal conversation or watching a movie. Just last night I was watching a movie and honestly couldn't make sense of the story or subtitles. The only thing noteworthy about my recent medical history is elevated liver enzymes (ALT: 200 MAX, now about 60-70 & AST: 80 MAX, now about 40), Carnitine deficiency and a noticeable but bearable pain/discomfort in my right side/abdomen for the past 8 weeks. Nitroglycerin patches seem to mildly alleviate symptoms. Very much interested in any insights/suggestions you all might have. Thank you. 0 likes, 5 replies "

I'm currently recovering from a supposed ""ear infection"".  Its been a month and a half and I dont see any improvements. I still feel lightheaded, heavy head, ear pressure, facial tension and heart palpitations. But Ive also noticed that whenever I have mucus from my nose its pure white, somewhat sticky and dry. I rarely get mucus in the first place but after the shower is when mucus comes out of my nose, but its not clear whatsoever. No cough, no fever. Just sticky white then hardens very quickly.   Its been this way for two months now. Also when I try and blow my nose to clear air  just a little bit, i get extremely lightheaded and out of breath.  like this pressure in my head What could be happening to make me feel this way along with the facial pain and ear pressure? 0 likes, 6 replies "

I was checked for blood clot and pneumonia as well. In the last couple months I’ve had chest X-ray, abdominal X-ray, two CT-scans and one showed diverticular disease.

PLEASE HELP. ,"I have no where else to turn, please someone take the time to read this and help me, it would be much appreciated.  I am a 19 year old female, 5’5 and 128 pounds. I exercise daily (except since I’ve been sick) I eat relatively healthy with the occasional fast food. It all started one day in nursing class, I became very very hot and sweaty and an all around overwhelming feeling like I was going to pass out, I felt like I couldn’t breath and became tingly all over. I was able to get some air and did not pass out. That following week I was vomiting profusely with the addition of feeling disoriented and shaky and on and off feeling of going to pass out. I also experienced a lot of diarrhea. The diarrhea wasn’t alarming because I have experience that on and off at least once a week for as long as I can remember (years). After that I got sick with a cough and runny nose, chest pains (extreme) that have since been checked by a cardiologist and he called it sinus tachycardia, as well as a bit of an irregular heartbeat. After that I started experiencing extreme abdominal pain and was hospitalized because they thought it was my gallbladder (still do) but there were no kidney stones. I was checked for blood clot and pneumonia as well. In the last couple months I’ve had chest X-ray, abdominal X-ray, two CT-scans and one showed diverticular disease. After that I got a bit better with on and off abdominal pain (it feels sharp and seems to move around my abdomen) and became ill will bronchitis and a sinus infection. Both have cleared up well. But, I still do not feel well. Everyday I have this dreaded brain fog feeling, terrible head pain and pressure as well as headaches. The head pain almost feels like my head is bleeding on my brain, like a warm liquid. I feel tired and weak, I’m shaky and itchy. My legs ache so so bad all of the time especially when lying down, I have terrible pain in my kidneys that comes and goes, vision troubles and sometimes my legs and feet flare up in hives for no reason. I have told my doctors this but they only address one symptom and send me on my way. I know I am not crazy, this is not anxiety or depression it is physical and it is there. It’s becoming almost crippling to my everyday life.

It started with very mild body pains,   then some mild   on the 5th of March. My body was feeling hot like a kettle but thermometer was showing 37C only because I was sweating profusely at night which kept the temperature down.

By 17th March  I developed a mild   which worsened the next day. I took paracetamol again along with cpm(antihistamine) twice for a couple of days. Also did salt water gargling twice that completely got rid of the sore throat by 19th March. 20th March I woke up at 3AM completely drenched in sweat. Took paracetamol again(I think thrice) that helped controlling the temperature. Called 111 first time and was advised to self-isolate for 7-14 days. From 21st to 26th March I was feeling mostly normal with some mild sporadic bouts of temperature and sweating. Was feeling bit dull on odd days so kept taking paracetamol once a day throughout. From 27th-30th March I was feeling completely cured with no symptoms of any kind and I thought I had shaken it off. On 31st March I woke up NOT feeling 100% well.  I sweat profusely again that night. Had mild bouts of temperature and sweating again over the next 3-4 days.  Started taking 1/2 a paracetamol every day again. On 5th April started feeling dull and worried more than the previous days. Body felt like a hot kettle again at night and couldn't sleep. 6th March 4:00 AM called 111 and tried to explain my symptoms to them and my concern that even though the symptoms are mild to moderate its exactly a month since they started. They couldn't help and asked me to wait for a few more days or call my GP for further advice. One common persistent symptom that I felt everyday during the ordeal is numbness and pain in my legs towards the evening each day.  Haven't seen anywhere online where this has been listed as a possible symptom of Coronavirus. Along with paracetamol I have also been taking some home remedies daily like Vitamin C effervescent drink, honey with ginger in warm water, a egg a day and other remedies. Please can anyone who has had similar symptoms or who has the know how of the symptoms of coronavirus please advice  if my symptoms indicate that I have Coronavirus and if so why would I be taking so long to get cured.

I've had one doc say that I could leave it and watch it but that it may continue to grow indefinitely and still eventually need to come out. One doc said sometimes they get smaller after menopause. Then I've had several others say I should get it out now before it gets bigger because it could also take over more of the ovary and be harder to remove or cause other issues like torsion or turn into something bad tho it looks benign now and honestly doesn't physically bother me that I can tell. I have more symptoms from peri and my giant fibroid. QUESTION: I'm confused about the surgery, if anyone's had it. I had one surgeon say she could leave behind part of the dermoid to save my ovary. Another said no, he'd need to peel away the whole dermoid so some of my ovary cells would come with it (like peeling an orange out of it's skin) but that the bulk of my ovary would stay behind and recover, but that I would have more hormonal issues at first post surgery (I'm already in peri). For you ladies who have had dermoid surgery and kept your ovaries, which was the case? Did they take the whole cyst and peel back/shave off a small portion of your ovary? Or did they just take part of the cyst and leave your entire ovary, no peeling? And did your ovary recover in either case? Thanks!!! 0 likes, 0 replies "

Was upset a few days ago, thinking about Ovarian cancer because my mother died at 40 from Breast Cancer but I think my nerves have calmed a little now, especially as I'm trying to stay rational and remind myself that I've had no other symptoms (no weight loss, no loss of appetite etc), just the pain last month and mild pain this month. I guess what frightens me as well is the possibility of losing an ovary when I don't have children yet and I already have PCOS but trying to stay positive. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I also have a constant dull ache in my lower left tummy, and every now and then a really horrible sharp pain, so the point where I want to cry and throw up. Not sure if it is related at all, but every single time I eat, I get heartburn. I also am afraid to have sex, because the last time I did it, I cried in pain. I can't even put a tampon in without my lower left hurting. Now, I went and had my scan done recently, and they have said I have a 5cm cyst on my left ovary. Fine, I know what the cause of the pain is, My doctor has told me to wait 4 months for another scan to see if it has shrunk or gotten worse, and I understand this is procedure, however I don't think I can put up with the pain and symptoms for another 4 months. She didn't recommend anything to help with the pain, just simply said I have a 'normal' cyst.. What is classed as normal?! I'm probably overreacting, but I am in tears because of the pain and I am simply not happy with what the doctor has said to me. Please can someone give me some advice about what to do next?

I’d doesn’t say anything on the letter about scans but I’ve already had two invasive ultrasounds and mentally don’t think I can do a third (the last one was really traumatic and made me vomit afterwards) What I’m really worried about is if I refuse another scan the doctors will refuse to see me even though they have 2 sets of clear images of a large cyst. Can they do this? Do I have the right to refuse? 0 likes, 2 replies "

It was much smaller at that time and I was told it only required monitoring and to have a follow up ultra-sound done within the next 3 years.

My doctor said this was completely normal due to the birth control (lolo) I'm on and have been taking daily for approximately 5 years now. Last month I made an appointment to see my doctor after doing some research online which lead me to discover polycystic ovarian syndrome.  I have every symptom it describes so I was eager to have another ultrasound done and some bloodwork to determine for sure.  If I did have PCOS I wanted to begin treatment right away and was excited to finally have something to explain my adult  , hair thinning, lack of periods, etc. My bloodwork came back pretty much inconclusive due to the birth controls affect on hormones levels.  Except that my estridol levels are low and prolactin levels are high.   My doctor pretty much dismissed my blood test results and said to have follow up blood work done just to monitor the prolactin levels. My ultra sound did not show multiple cysts like polycystic would imply.  Just one large avascular complex cyst with small mural solid component(s) and further characterization with MRI and gynecologic consultation required.

Or should I take it easy to avoid torsion or rupture till I can have surgery to have it removed? Will surgery likely be able to remove just the cyst/tumor or will they have to take one or both of my ovaries? Has anyone had a large but benign ovarian tumor removed and went on to carry a pregnancy to term? If my tumor is malignant does that mean I likely have less then 5 years to live?

Last month I made an appointment to see my doctor after doing some research online which lead me to discover polycystic ovarian syndrome.  I have every symptom it describes so I was eager to have another ultrasound done and some bloodwork to determine for sure.  If I did have PCOS I wanted to begin treatment right away and was excited to finally have something to explain my adult  , hair thinning, lack of periods, etc. My bloodwork came back pretty much inconclusive due to the birth controls affect on hormones levels.  Except that my estridol levels are low and prolactin levels are high.   My doctor pretty much dismissed my blood test results and said to have follow up blood work done just to monitor the prolactin levels. My ultra sound did not show multiple cysts like polycystic would imply.  Just one large avascular complex cyst with small mural solid component(s) and further characterization with MRI and gynecologic consultation required. I was informed of the results in a follow-up appointment with my family doctor on January 15st.   I have to wait till March  21st for an MRI.  And I am still yet to get an appointment with a gynecologist despite my doctors urgency in her request. So what do I do while I wait?    Any and all the research I do only scares me more.  And I am much more aware of the discomfort it is causing me physically.  I'm sure I just ignored it before and that it has been present for a while but now it is not as easy to ignore.  I often have a strange leg pain/discomfort in my left leg.  Back pressure and discomfort.  Substantial bloating around my mid section. And I have so many questions.  My whole reason for sharing my story was to hopefully get some answers.  And hear of others similar experiences. Is it safe to continue with normal physical activity with a cyst of this size? Or should I take it easy to avoid torsion or rupture till I can have surgery to have it removed? Will surgery likely be able to remove just the cyst/tumor or will they have to take one or both of my ovaries? Has anyone had a large but benign ovarian tumor removed and went on to carry a pregnancy to term? If my tumor is malignant does that mean I likely have less then 5 years to live? Is there anything I can do while I wait to have an MRI done/surgery? Is it normal to wait weeks to get in to see a gynecologist? Thank-you for taking the time to read my story.

I had some pain in my right shoulder blade and right chest also. I've got old gerd for a decade and have taken Prevacid and Protonix. I'm terrified that I have esophageal cancer as I've lost a few pounds. The trouble swallowing comes and goes but it's mainly with solid food. My regular doctor is sending me to do a barium swallow this Friday. I was glad to get to do that because I am terrified of an endoscopy That Could perforate my esophagus. Now I went to a new GI doctor and she said that you have to have an endoscopy to rule out esophageal cancer. My question is, can a barium swallow not show esophageal cancer? Should I have an endoscopy before the barium swallow? I'm wondering if I can get by with just the barium swallow for now. Any advice would be greatly appreciated because I have three little kids who desperately need their mother back and I'm so anxious from all of this. 1 like, 18 replies "

After all this time, I found a new doctor, and she prescribed  Bentyl for me.  It helps tremendously.   It's not a cure, but I would say it has stopped the burning pain by about 90% .

So far there has been a big improvement, I'm not having food stuck in my throat and food does move into my stomach (some times, I'll bring this up soon). I can go to bed now and not worry about choking in my sleep from the food stuck in my throat. I'm still getting some minor difficulties with liquids moving down my throat and I usually have to resolve this with burping. Solids can move down okay and after a few swallows, a piece of food might get stuck - once again burping to resolve this. With reflux, I'm barely getting any which I am happy with. Regurgitation is a sometimes but not very noticeable, much better than what it was. Heartburn controlled with Gaviscon and a back up of omperazole if needed. Chest pains controlled by paracetamol and about the same, so no change there. So I just wanted get other peoples opinions around the condition and experience, so just a few questions: If you've had the surgery how have you been since - any ongoing symptoms where solids and liquids still get stuck? Does anyone else need to burp to relieve the stuck feeling in the throat? Does anyone know how to improve the throat contracting, so swallowing can be improved? If I think of any other questions, I'll leave them in my comments. Many thanks. 1 like, 10 replies "

I was wondering if anyone else has had this happen, I know it is quite common but I can't find anything online that matches what I experience. I wake up at night (this has happened quite a few times now) and see someone standing over the bed, or in the doorway. I have read online about sleep paralysis and understand I am possibly still dreaming but what is different is, I can move. I know normally you can't, but I can, I turn my head away from the person and turn my head back to see them still there. I even grab my phone and shine my light, they go but when I turn my phone off and it is dark again they are there. I don't know if this is another type of sleep paralysis but it is freaky as hell! The worst was when I lived in another house, I had an office desk that at the end of the room. I woke and there was a skinny, creature, long teeth, mostly bone crouched on top of the desk. It was cocking its head and looking at me, almost like it wanted to jump off the desk towards me. Again I could move and even woke my partner up, but then when I looked back it was gone. Normally the people are that, just people, not monsters or demon like. The last one was last night, there was a man in army clothing, world war 1/2 type uniform, his face was clear and detailed, I didn't recognise him at all. But yeah, that's it, I am not really sure what I want to get out of this post, maybe more opinions or if anyone else has had the same, but I find it strange how I have all my motor functions and can move, looked away and back to see them still there. P.s I have noticed this has happened more since being on 25mg of Amitriptyline for headaches and blackouts. I had this happen before the headaches and blackouts and was put onto a daily dose of Amitriptyline. 2 likes, 12 replies "

Need Relief","I'm writing here because it'll be Agust 28th  before I can even see a doctor. Lately, when I try to go to sleep, just as I start to drift off, I get something that I can only describe as a surge of adrenaline waking me up. This happened once a few weeks ago and has been consistent ever since, especially the last 2-3 nights. Sometimes it leaves a sensation in my chest, other times, in my brain. I've heard the adrenaline feeling is a symptom of sleep apnea. My questions are if 1.) anyone else with sleep apnea can confirm this symptom as one that might be SA, or if it could be something else. 2.) In the time between now and whenever I can get to my doctor, is there anything I can take OTC, or a sleep postion, etc, that will help? I've tried melatonin, which didnt help, turning off all lights, winding down routines, etc. So if anyone can help me along with some info I would really appreciate it. 2 likes, 75 replies "

Anybody experience this?,"For the past several months now, maybe longer, when I'm sleeping at night I'll be half asleep after waking up and will hear very weird things. I have a bad habit of propping myself up on my pillow with my elbow and will fall asleep like that and right before I fall asleep I'll hear very strange sounds. Last night for example, it was around 2:00 AM and I had my eyes closed and was just about to fall asleep with my elbow resting on my pillow when I heard a loud BANG! coming from the wall at the end of my bed. It scared me so bad I thought I was going to have a panic attack. It took me a while to catch my breath. I was fully awake and didn't hear anything else. I rested my head on my pillow and went back to sleep. This doesn't happen often but when it does it scares the living hell out of me. Other times, I've even heard what sounds like voices, but they're not really saying anything that I can understand. I know what you're probably thinking, my house is haunted right? I've been living in this house for over 18 years now and it was a brand new house at the time and I've never noticed anything like this any other time. I know for a fact it isn't haunted lol but what I'm asking is maybe this could be almost like   or maybe it's something that's common when your brain is about to fall asleep and noises will just happen for no reason. It was very weird though, I thought something had fallen in my closet so I checked this morning and everything was in the same place as yesterday. Any thoughts on this? Anybody else every experience something similar? BTW I always take 37 mg of Quetiapine right before bed for a sleeping aid. I've been taking this medication every night for the past several years now. 0 likes, 3 replies "

If this helps at all, If I get incredibly drunk and pass out, I do not notice the dreaming being a problem anymore (maybe after my first awakening) but when I have drank that much, I tend to stay asleep MUCH longer than if I go to bed without drinking.

387,C0037315,Sleep Apnea Syndromes,"C0085631, C0917801, C0239313","Agitation, Sleeplessness, exercise induced",https://patient.info/forums/discuss/unusual-exercise-induced-insomnia-622168,Unusual exercise-induced insomnia,"TL;DR: I have exercise-induced insomnia for which no one has been able to explain or provide a solution. I used to exercise regularly. I would wake up every weekday at 6am, bike to the gym, and exercise for about an hour before work. I would usually jog or do some other cardio for 20-30 minutes, then do weight training for the rest of the hour. I had help from a personal trainer, so I knew what I was doing. I felt great, and I was in the best shape of my life. I kept this up for about 3 years, before something strange happened: I would wake up around 2 or 3am, unable to fall back asleep. I was 33 at the time, and I know sleep patterns can begin to change around this age. At first, I noticed that I slept much deeper on days I didn't exercise (e.g. weekends). Then I began waking up in the middle of the night, but would usually go right back to sleep. It got worse. Eventually, I would wake about 4 hours after falling asleep with a feeling like an intense adrenaline rush or panic. It would last about an hour, and I would have poor, restless sleep the rest of the night. I did not have trouble falling asleep. I was in bed at 9:30pm every night, then would read a bit with lights out by 10pm. I would fall asleep within 10 minutes. When this started happening, I adjusted my routine. I worked out during lunch, or in the evening. No change. I tried doing more or less cardio vs weight training. No change. Today, if I exercise at any point during the day, I will only get four hours of good quality sleep. I've been to several doctors, sleep specialists, and neurologists. I've had multiple take home sleep studies, as well as one on-site at a medical institution. The only thing they've been able to confirm is that I do indeed wake after 4 hours if I have exercised, but no one can tell me why. Many doctors don't even believe my story -- they think it must be psychological stress that I insist on tying to a physical cause. I have found that walking, low-intensity biking, and hiking are all acceptable forms of exercise that do not trigger my insomnia. I can hike 10 miles and be fine. But if the hike is over very steep terrain, or if I were to jog for 10 minutes, then I have insomnia. So the intensity is definitely a factor. The sleep studies did reveal that I have very mild sleep apnea. My doctors have told me that normally it would not warrant treatment, but it could be related. However, the usual recommendation for such a mild form is simlply ""get more exercise"". My current pet theory is this: following a day of excerise, one's muscles will repair themselves during sleep, usually around 3 or 4 hours into the night. This process requires oxygen from the blood, so if my sleep apnea lowers my blood oxygen levels, then the repair process might cause it to dip below some threshold; my body panics, sending adrenaline through my body to wake me up to address whatever is happening. However, my sleep studies showed my blood oxygenation stayed over 90% the entire night. I'm currently trying out a CPAP treatment. I'm still adjusting to it, but so far it hasn't made any difference. There's no real reason to think that it will, but I'm willing to try anything at this point. When I tell this story, most doctors look at me like I have three heads, so I thought I would seek the collective wisdom of the Internet. Cheers! 2 likes, 155 replies "

I just want to tell my story in full and get advice.","My story A little bit about me, I'm 32, male, i own a small repair shop and I'm often found hunched over doing a repair of some kind, I've been asthmatic for 30 years, have hay-fever, and vitamin D deficiency. A few years back I beat depression (2017). I love theatre and gaming of all kinds. I’ve smoked for 10 years (yes I know its risks, I have no other vices as I stopped drinking alcohol a very long time ago, I do plan on quitting) I don't have great posture but when walking about I try to keep my back straight. In 2008 I had a car crash and suffered from whiplash had some deep knots/trigger points in my back from this. Between 2011-2012 I had been thrown against a concrete floor on my head (it was a genuine accident). Why am i telling you that? That will come later. Okay, to the beginning. In September 2019 i was sat in my car waiting for rehearsals as I'm part of a small local theatre group, this is my normal exercise. The temperature was a little nippy outside and it was dark so between 6:30pm and 7pm. Had a bit of a neck ache which was going up the right side of the back of my neck. Immediately followed by a twang feeling at the top of my head on the right side (where a crown hairline would be) then the aches disappeared. Didn't think much of it after then. A couple of days later while fast asleep (not sure on time) i woke to what i thought was a racing heart, i pinned this down to the dream i was having as i was running in my dream, got up had some juice and a cig and went back to bed. Two nights later i woke to the same feeling but this time i had no logical reasoning for what i thought was a very fast heartbeat, so i called 111 (I'm in the UK) at this point I strongly believed i was having a heart attack and the end was here. 111 immediately got me an ambulance. When the paramedics turned up i managed to calm down thinking i was now in the perfect hands for my situation. They did a EGC and the results was good. They stayed for a little while to make sure i was okay then off to bed i pop. The following morning i went to doctors to inform them, they suggested i had palpitations for a minute or two followed by a medical grade panic attack. Not your usual panic but full-blown medical case of the nasty stuff. Which make sense to me looking back on been calmed by the presence of some amazing hard-working paramedics. The doctors took some blood for testing just be cautious. Two nights later (noticed a pattern yet?) it happened again, except this time i was also struggling to breathe, not severely but enough to raise some concern. Took my inhaler, and dialled 111 again, they told me they had dispatched another ambulance because breathing was difficult and wanted to be there in case it got worse. The ambulance station was just down the road from my house and luckily, they weren't busy so the paramedics got there before i even ended the call with 111 (amazing response times). Again, calmed down slowly, they did ECG’s which was normal, and my inhalers kicked in for my breathing. (a bit later than usual but still concerning) They stayed with me for longer this time while they were monitoring me we got chatting about all-sorts. (one was a gamer too) they stayed that much longer they got the safety call from their office making sure they're not in danger themselves. I had an idea at this point, the ECGs I've been having have all been sat up. So i asked for another while laid down. This did produce a small result in my heart (only one extra beat) but apparently it is usual when we adjust our bodies. At this point I've stopped thinking its my heart, but what else can cause a fast pace inside your chest? I decided to change my thinking and look things logically, what did i eat that day? Have i over-exerted myself? Have i not done enough exercise? Is it shaking, vibrations, where are the originating from? So on. But then nothing. It disappeared. Got my bloods back and i went in to see the results. First doctor thought I had gout because my cholesterol was a little higher than usual. Everything else came back normal. Well, been told I'm on a fast track to gout scared the bejesus outa me. I switched to high Fibre bread and cut out all pastries, cream buns, and high sugar snacks overnight. (i did love a couple of sausage rolls a day) in the space of a week i dropped two trouser sizes, 34's to 32's and even they were a little slack. I lost weight in my face, legs, and stomach area. I looked ill. Was told by many people that was a silly thing to do and shouldn't have done it in one go. I agreed so i started with introducing a cream bun a week and some other little snacks here and there. I also cut my cigs down from 20 a day to almost 5 as my doctors said cigarettes can also contribute to high cholesterol. I started to gain a small amount of weight back, in some places and stopped looking ill. I thought that was the end of it. In early December these shakes came back. Didn't call 111 this time as in September we (Doctors and I) ruled out all the major issues. No cancer signs, not heart, not lungs, not thyroids (hyper or hypo) etc. So i didn't believe it was life threatening. So, what was happening? More blood tests, same results. Some theories were thought off. General Anxiety Disorder been one. I understand that this is a logical choice but nothing in my mind pointed to anxiety. The doctors also thought my asthma medication could be the cause so we changed it. Two weeks later there is no change. decided an appointment with a neurologist was the next logical step as the condition essential tremors was now on the table. Now in this next bit please understand it’s not a moan at our NHS as I understand they deal with MILLIONS of people. The next available appointment to me (as its not life threatening) was 3 months. End of February. I was getting impatient, not with the NHS but wanting answers. I saved up some cash and went private. The appointment waiting time was a week. Fabulous. A week later the episode had gone again. As I walked into the private hospital, I felt like I was in a 4- or 5-star hotel instead of a hospital. The appointment was on time, the car park was free, there was even carpets and free hot drinks. It was very soothing been there. I spent half hour explaining everything. The understaffed NHS can't donate that amount of time to individuals due to the sheer number of people they see on a day by day basis, I understand this and please don’t think I’m belittling the NHS, I'm not, I really do love them. So, 20 mins into my appointment my neurologist started doing some reflex checks and other basic movements. He was very throughout. Afterwards he explained that I don't have Parkinson’s, MS or essential tremors as there isn't anything to suggest so. Even though I asked about not currently having an episode at the time. (this was a man who inspired confidence, he also works on the NHS apparently which I’m told a lot do) As far he could see, all’s well and didn't want me to have an MRI. He suggested my problems was muscular and pointed to muscle tension and a possibility the trigger points/knots from my car crash are back:- yoga, light exercise and meditation was the prescription. So, I added medication back into my routine as I've not done it in nearly a year. Did the occasional yoga and light exercise when I could, maybe I didn't do it enough because I had an episode again just before Christmas. This one only lasted one night, so might be working. Just breaking the timeline for a moment. When an episode comes on, I try different things to ease it. (not all at the same time, just one) Rennies in case it's caused by acid, paracetamol, Epsom salt baths, Buscopan, and hot water bottles. When these episodes come on, they can last from half hour to a week and mostly notable during the evening/night. Sometimes during the day. The longer they last the more intense they can get to a point where there are external shakes/tremors that can be seen by others. They less noticeable when I'm really engrossed in a game/movie/etc but not gone as sometimes they snap me back to reality quickly. Another symptom has appeared which is constant but minor. I feel my pulse everywhere. Stomach, Ears, hands, feet. Sometime twitching for a few seconds too but the twitch passes as quick as it comes. Back to the timeline, I live with my mum because she has chrons disease and needs occasional help. Over the Christmas period we noticed black mould in the house and she was getting poorly too. She had a very strong case of antibiotics, that cleared it up. Early January I decided to give acupuncture a try. It seemed to be working a treat, or I just wasn't having an episode, until the last week of treatment, it got bad. Acupuncture was the next day and I immediately felt relief from it. Not sure if it was a real relief or a placebo effect but I was grateful nonetheless. early February we moved house, a lot of hard work as we also moved town so I was closer to work. During all this and for a good month after I didn't have an episode. Again, I thought this was the end. Maybe the black mould was the problem after all? No My other half got whopping cough (she's getting better day by day) and decided to stay away from me and my mum, sensible thing to do, we still talk over video chat every night. This started during our house move in early February. She decided to keep isolated from me during these times even though she's almost back to normal now, in light of Covid-19 we decided it was for the best we stayed in separate houses during a lockdown. 5 nights ago, i had another episode, it woke me up so I went outside for a smoke at 3am and chilled for half hour before going back to bed. I thought it could be stress from the uncertainty of everything, and tried to brush it off. Went to bed but kept waking now and then. The following night (4 nights ago) I slept like a log, I went to bed at 9:30pm and didn't wake till 11am. The longest I'd ever slept in years. It was wonderful and the following day I energetic and got on with loads of stuff. 3 nights ago, it’s back again. Woke around 2am and 8am not as bad but still annoying. Nothing has changed in my diet and I wanted a few days off of work anyway so I isolated myself before our PM declared locked down anyway. Free time to work on some home stuff and take a break from work. Keeping an eye on my temperature just in case. It did get a little higher at one point but not feverish went back down a day later. I have smokers cough for about a month but not continuous. I doubt I have it but I'll keep monitoring anyway. 2 nights ago, it was slightly worse, waking up every couple of hours. Last night! I nearly called an ambulance again. Shakes are now constant, even as I write this in the middle of the day. Visible to everyone. Trying to get any sleep last night was like trying to find a four-leaf clover in concrete, but these shakes, we're a whole new level, which is why I'm here today. If I laid on my back the shakes came from my back, when I laid on my side they were coming from my sides. Now I normally sleep kinda on my side/front a little against a pillow that I put at the side of me lengthways. I tried this and I felt like my entire torso was on a fast spin in a powerful washing machine. I've got a little bit of a runny nose at the moment due to hay-fever, that blocked my passages that I had to sit up and breathe through my mouth for a bit while my torso was on a Hotpoint fast spin, couldn't breathe through my nose at all, I was cold, and confused. I got my breath back after a couple of minutes and laid on back to try to sleep. The tremors moved to my back slowly but when I fall asleep i fidget, (maybe restless leg syndrome) and it woke myself up on my front again. I went to bed at 11:30ish woke up at 1am,3am,4am, and 7am. At 7 i decided to just get up. I called the doctors and obviously in these days It's telephone appointment only unless it's serious enough to warrant leaving isolation. Bare-in-mind I've moved house so these are new doctors to me. I had to explain everything I could in a short amount of time as not to take up any vital work she's doing. Obviously, I didn't go into as much detail as have here but she also had my notes from previous doctors. She believes it doesn't require any further investigation as anxiety levels are high across the world at the moment and is under the impression it's just that and I should do more meditation and she wanted to prescribe me amitriptyline. I've been through the side effects of that drug and even the common side effects scare the bejesus outa me. Personally, I know they're under great pressure and need to prioritise this pandemic. So, I’ll keep my questions to the point. I'm really wanting an MRI, my gut tells me that's where the answers are but I'm also not medically trained, am I wanting too much? Could this be related to my car crash or head bang? (MANY, MANY, years ago) Am I wasting the NHS’s time? Or is my gut feeling correct and should be persistent? If i should be persistent, should the MRI be my back or head (or both) Am I being selfish in wanting a little more attention to detail? If this carries on, I'm gunna start getting anxiety over going to sleep every night. That circle of torment I do not want. (I love sleep normally) I really want to thank you for reading all the way through. And I'm sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes. I'm really tired. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I just want to tell my story in full and get advice.","My story A little bit about me, I'm 32, male, i own a small repair shop and I'm often found hunched over doing a repair of some kind, I've been asthmatic for 30 years, have hay-fever, and vitamin D deficiency. A few years back I beat depression (2017). I love theatre and gaming of all kinds. I’ve smoked for 10 years (yes I know its risks, I have no other vices as I stopped drinking alcohol a very long time ago, I do plan on quitting) I don't have great posture but when walking about I try to keep my back straight. In 2008 I had a car crash and suffered from whiplash had some deep knots/trigger points in my back from this. Between 2011-2012 I had been thrown against a concrete floor on my head (it was a genuine accident). Why am i telling you that? That will come later. Okay, to the beginning. In September 2019 i was sat in my car waiting for rehearsals as I'm part of a small local theatre group, this is my normal exercise. The temperature was a little nippy outside and it was dark so between 6:30pm and 7pm. Had a bit of a neck ache which was going up the right side of the back of my neck. Immediately followed by a twang feeling at the top of my head on the right side (where a crown hairline would be) then the aches disappeared. Didn't think much of it after then. A couple of days later while fast asleep (not sure on time) i woke to what i thought was a racing heart, i pinned this down to the dream i was having as i was running in my dream, got up had some juice and a cig and went back to bed. Two nights later i woke to the same feeling but this time i had no logical reasoning for what i thought was a very fast heartbeat, so i called 111 (I'm in the UK) at this point I strongly believed i was having a heart attack and the end was here. 111 immediately got me an ambulance. When the paramedics turned up i managed to calm down thinking i was now in the perfect hands for my situation. They did a EGC and the results was good. They stayed for a little while to make sure i was okay then off to bed i pop. The following morning i went to doctors to inform them, they suggested i had palpitations for a minute or two followed by a medical grade panic attack. Not your usual panic but full-blown medical case of the nasty stuff. Which make sense to me looking back on been calmed by the presence of some amazing hard-working paramedics. The doctors took some blood for testing just be cautious. Two nights later (noticed a pattern yet?) it happened again, except this time i was also struggling to breathe, not severely but enough to raise some concern. Took my inhaler, and dialled 111 again, they told me they had dispatched another ambulance because breathing was difficult and wanted to be there in case it got worse. The ambulance station was just down the road from my house and luckily, they weren't busy so the paramedics got there before i even ended the call with 111 (amazing response times). Again, calmed down slowly, they did ECG’s which was normal, and my inhalers kicked in for my breathing. (a bit later than usual but still concerning) They stayed with me for longer this time while they were monitoring me we got chatting about all-sorts. (one was a gamer too) they stayed that much longer they got the safety call from their office making sure they're not in danger themselves. I had an idea at this point, the ECGs I've been having have all been sat up. So i asked for another while laid down. This did produce a small result in my heart (only one extra beat) but apparently it is usual when we adjust our bodies. At this point I've stopped thinking its my heart, but what else can cause a fast pace inside your chest? I decided to change my thinking and look things logically, what did i eat that day? Have i over-exerted myself? Have i not done enough exercise? Is it shaking, vibrations, where are the originating from? So on. But then nothing. It disappeared. Got my bloods back and i went in to see the results. First doctor thought I had gout because my cholesterol was a little higher than usual. Everything else came back normal. Well, been told I'm on a fast track to gout scared the bejesus outa me. I switched to high Fibre bread and cut out all pastries, cream buns, and high sugar snacks overnight. (i did love a couple of sausage rolls a day) in the space of a week i dropped two trouser sizes, 34's to 32's and even they were a little slack. I lost weight in my face, legs, and stomach area. I looked ill. Was told by many people that was a silly thing to do and shouldn't have done it in one go. I agreed so i started with introducing a cream bun a week and some other little snacks here and there. I also cut my cigs down from 20 a day to almost 5 as my doctors said cigarettes can also contribute to high cholesterol. I started to gain a small amount of weight back, in some places and stopped looking ill. I thought that was the end of it. In early December these shakes came back. Didn't call 111 this time as in September we (Doctors and I) ruled out all the major issues. No cancer signs, not heart, not lungs, not thyroids (hyper or hypo) etc. So i didn't believe it was life threatening. So, what was happening? More blood tests, same results. Some theories were thought off. General Anxiety Disorder been one. I understand that this is a logical choice but nothing in my mind pointed to anxiety. The doctors also thought my asthma medication could be the cause so we changed it. Two weeks later there is no change. decided an appointment with a neurologist was the next logical step as the condition essential tremors was now on the table. Now in this next bit please understand it’s not a moan at our NHS as I understand they deal with MILLIONS of people. The next available appointment to me (as its not life threatening) was 3 months. End of February. I was getting impatient, not with the NHS but wanting answers. I saved up some cash and went private. The appointment waiting time was a week. Fabulous. A week later the episode had gone again. As I walked into the private hospital, I felt like I was in a 4- or 5-star hotel instead of a hospital. The appointment was on time, the car park was free, there was even carpets and free hot drinks. It was very soothing been there. I spent half hour explaining everything. The understaffed NHS can't donate that amount of time to individuals due to the sheer number of people they see on a day by day basis, I understand this and please don’t think I’m belittling the NHS, I'm not, I really do love them. So, 20 mins into my appointment my neurologist started doing some reflex checks and other basic movements. He was very throughout. Afterwards he explained that I don't have Parkinson’s, MS or essential tremors as there isn't anything to suggest so. Even though I asked about not currently having an episode at the time. (this was a man who inspired confidence, he also works on the NHS apparently which I’m told a lot do) As far he could see, all’s well and didn't want me to have an MRI. He suggested my problems was muscular and pointed to muscle tension and a possibility the trigger points/knots from my car crash are back:- yoga, light exercise and meditation was the prescription. So, I added medication back into my routine as I've not done it in nearly a year. Did the occasional yoga and light exercise when I could, maybe I didn't do it enough because I had an episode again just before Christmas. This one only lasted one night, so might be working. Just breaking the timeline for a moment. When an episode comes on, I try different things to ease it. (not all at the same time, just one) Rennies in case it's caused by acid, paracetamol, Epsom salt baths, Buscopan, and hot water bottles. When these episodes come on, they can last from half hour to a week and mostly notable during the evening/night. Sometimes during the day. The longer they last the more intense they can get to a point where there are external shakes/tremors that can be seen by others. They less noticeable when I'm really engrossed in a game/movie/etc but not gone as sometimes they snap me back to reality quickly. Another symptom has appeared which is constant but minor. I feel my pulse everywhere. Stomach, Ears, hands, feet. Sometime twitching for a few seconds too but the twitch passes as quick as it comes. Back to the timeline, I live with my mum because she has chrons disease and needs occasional help. Over the Christmas period we noticed black mould in the house and she was getting poorly too. She had a very strong case of antibiotics, that cleared it up. Early January I decided to give acupuncture a try. It seemed to be working a treat, or I just wasn't having an episode, until the last week of treatment, it got bad. Acupuncture was the next day and I immediately felt relief from it. Not sure if it was a real relief or a placebo effect but I was grateful nonetheless. early February we moved house, a lot of hard work as we also moved town so I was closer to work. During all this and for a good month after I didn't have an episode. Again, I thought this was the end. Maybe the black mould was the problem after all? No My other half got whopping cough (she's getting better day by day) and decided to stay away from me and my mum, sensible thing to do, we still talk over video chat every night. This started during our house move in early February. She decided to keep isolated from me during these times even though she's almost back to normal now, in light of Covid-19 we decided it was for the best we stayed in separate houses during a lockdown. 5 nights ago, i had another episode, it woke me up so I went outside for a smoke at 3am and chilled for half hour before going back to bed. I thought it could be stress from the uncertainty of everything, and tried to brush it off. Went to bed but kept waking now and then. The following night (4 nights ago) I slept like a log, I went to bed at 9:30pm and didn't wake till 11am. The longest I'd ever slept in years. It was wonderful and the following day I energetic and got on with loads of stuff. 3 nights ago, it’s back again. Woke around 2am and 8am not as bad but still annoying. Nothing has changed in my diet and I wanted a few days off of work anyway so I isolated myself before our PM declared locked down anyway. Free time to work on some home stuff and take a break from work. Keeping an eye on my temperature just in case. It did get a little higher at one point but not feverish went back down a day later. I have smokers cough for about a month but not continuous. I doubt I have it but I'll keep monitoring anyway. 2 nights ago, it was slightly worse, waking up every couple of hours. Last night! I nearly called an ambulance again. Shakes are now constant, even as I write this in the middle of the day. Visible to everyone. Trying to get any sleep last night was like trying to find a four-leaf clover in concrete, but these shakes, we're a whole new level, which is why I'm here today. If I laid on my back the shakes came from my back, when I laid on my side they were coming from my sides. Now I normally sleep kinda on my side/front a little against a pillow that I put at the side of me lengthways. I tried this and I felt like my entire torso was on a fast spin in a powerful washing machine. I've got a little bit of a runny nose at the moment due to hay-fever, that blocked my passages that I had to sit up and breathe through my mouth for a bit while my torso was on a Hotpoint fast spin, couldn't breathe through my nose at all, I was cold, and confused.

The temperature was a little nippy outside and it was dark so between 6:30pm and 7pm. Had a bit of a neck ache which was going up the right side of the back of my neck. Immediately followed by a twang feeling at the top of my head on the right side (where a crown hairline would be) then the aches disappeared. Didn't think much of it after then. A couple of days later while fast asleep (not sure on time) i woke to what i thought was a racing heart, i pinned this down to the dream i was having as i was running in my dream, got up had some juice and a cig and went back to bed. Two nights later i woke to the same feeling but this time i had no logical reasoning for what i thought was a very fast heartbeat, so i called 111 (I'm in the UK) at this point I strongly believed i was having a heart attack and the end was here. 111 immediately got me an ambulance. When the paramedics turned up i managed to calm down thinking i was now in the perfect hands for my situation. They did a EGC and the results was good. They stayed for a little while to make sure i was okay then off to bed i pop. The following morning i went to doctors to inform them, they suggested i had palpitations for a minute or two followed by a medical grade panic attack. Not your usual panic but full-blown medical case of the nasty stuff. Which make sense to me looking back on been calmed by the presence of some amazing hard-working paramedics. The doctors took some blood for testing just be cautious. Two nights later (noticed a pattern yet?) it happened again, except this time i was also struggling to breathe, not severely but enough to raise some concern. Took my inhaler, and dialled 111 again, they told me they had dispatched another ambulance because breathing was difficult and wanted to be there in case it got worse. The ambulance station was just down the road from my house and luckily, they weren't busy so the paramedics got there before i even ended the call with 111 (amazing response times). Again, calmed down slowly, they did ECG’s which was normal, and my inhalers kicked in for my breathing. (a bit later than usual but still concerning) They stayed with me for longer this time while they were monitoring me we got chatting about all-sorts. (one was a gamer too) they stayed that much longer they got the safety call from their office making sure they're not in danger themselves. I had an idea at this point, the ECGs I've been having have all been sat up. So i asked for another while laid down. This did produce a small result in my heart (only one extra beat) but apparently it is usual when we adjust our bodies. At this point I've stopped thinking its my heart, but what else can cause a fast pace inside your chest? I decided to change my thinking and look things logically, what did i eat that day? Have i over-exerted myself? Have i not done enough exercise? Is it shaking, vibrations, where are the originating from? So on. But then nothing. It disappeared. Got my bloods back and i went in to see the results. First doctor thought I had gout because my cholesterol was a little higher than usual. Everything else came back normal. Well, been told I'm on a fast track to gout scared the bejesus outa me. I switched to high Fibre bread and cut out all pastries, cream buns, and high sugar snacks overnight. (i did love a couple of sausage rolls a day) in the space of a week i dropped two trouser sizes, 34's to 32's and even they were a little slack. I lost weight in my face, legs, and stomach area. I looked ill. Was told by many people that was a silly thing to do and shouldn't have done it in one go. I agreed so i started with introducing a cream bun a week and some other little snacks here and there. I also cut my cigs down from 20 a day to almost 5 as my doctors said cigarettes can also contribute to high cholesterol. I started to gain a small amount of weight back, in some places and stopped looking ill. I thought that was the end of it. In early December these shakes came back. Didn't call 111 this time as in September we (Doctors and I) ruled out all the major issues. No cancer signs, not heart, not lungs, not thyroids (hyper or hypo) etc. So i didn't believe it was life threatening. So, what was happening? More blood tests, same results. Some theories were thought off. General Anxiety Disorder been one. I understand that this is a logical choice but nothing in my mind pointed to anxiety. The doctors also thought my asthma medication could be the cause so we changed it. Two weeks later there is no change. decided an appointment with a neurologist was the next logical step as the condition essential tremors was now on the table. Now in this next bit please understand it’s not a moan at our NHS as I understand they deal with MILLIONS of people. The next available appointment to me (as its not life threatening) was 3 months. End of February. I was getting impatient, not with the NHS but wanting answers. I saved up some cash and went private. The appointment waiting time was a week. Fabulous. A week later the episode had gone again. As I walked into the private hospital, I felt like I was in a 4- or 5-star hotel instead of a hospital. The appointment was on time, the car park was free, there was even carpets and free hot drinks. It was very soothing been there. I spent half hour explaining everything. The understaffed NHS can't donate that amount of time to individuals due to the sheer number of people they see on a day by day basis, I understand this and please don’t think I’m belittling the NHS, I'm not, I really do love them. So, 20 mins into my appointment my neurologist started doing some reflex checks and other basic movements. He was very throughout. Afterwards he explained that I don't have Parkinson’s, MS or essential tremors as there isn't anything to suggest so. Even though I asked about not currently having an episode at the time. (this was a man who inspired confidence, he also works on the NHS apparently which I’m told a lot do) As far he could see, all’s well and didn't want me to have an MRI. He suggested my problems was muscular and pointed to muscle tension and a possibility the trigger points/knots from my car crash are back:- yoga, light exercise and meditation was the prescription. So, I added medication back into my routine as I've not done it in nearly a year. Did the occasional yoga and light exercise when I could, maybe I didn't do it enough because I had an episode again just before Christmas. This one only lasted one night, so might be working. Just breaking the timeline for a moment. When an episode comes on, I try different things to ease it. (not all at the same time, just one) Rennies in case it's caused by acid, paracetamol, Epsom salt baths, Buscopan, and hot water bottles. When these episodes come on, they can last from half hour to a week and mostly notable during the evening/night. Sometimes during the day. The longer they last the more intense they can get to a point where there are external shakes/tremors that can be seen by others. They less noticeable when I'm really engrossed in a game/movie/etc but not gone as sometimes they snap me back to reality quickly. Another symptom has appeared which is constant but minor. I feel my pulse everywhere. Stomach, Ears, hands, feet. Sometime twitching for a few seconds too but the twitch passes as quick as it comes. Back to the timeline, I live with my mum because she has chrons disease and needs occasional help. Over the Christmas period we noticed black mould in the house and she was getting poorly too. She had a very strong case of antibiotics, that cleared it up. Early January I decided to give acupuncture a try. It seemed to be working a treat, or I just wasn't having an episode, until the last week of treatment, it got bad. Acupuncture was the next day and I immediately felt relief from it. Not sure if it was a real relief or a placebo effect but I was grateful nonetheless. early February we moved house, a lot of hard work as we also moved town so I was closer to work. During all this and for a good month after I didn't have an episode. Again, I thought this was the end. Maybe the black mould was the problem after all? No My other half got whopping cough (she's getting better day by day) and decided to stay away from me and my mum, sensible thing to do, we still talk over video chat every night. This started during our house move in early February. She decided to keep isolated from me during these times even though she's almost back to normal now, in light of Covid-19 we decided it was for the best we stayed in separate houses during a lockdown. 5 nights ago, i had another episode, it woke me up so I went outside for a smoke at 3am and chilled for half hour before going back to bed. I thought it could be stress from the uncertainty of everything, and tried to brush it off. Went to bed but kept waking now and then. The following night (4 nights ago) I slept like a log, I went to bed at 9:30pm and didn't wake till 11am. The longest I'd ever slept in years. It was wonderful and the following day I energetic and got on with loads of stuff. 3 nights ago, it’s back again. Woke around 2am and 8am not as bad but still annoying. Nothing has changed in my diet and I wanted a few days off of work anyway so I isolated myself before our PM declared locked down anyway. Free time to work on some home stuff and take a break from work. Keeping an eye on my temperature just in case. It did get a little higher at one point but not feverish went back down a day later. I have smokers cough for about a month but not continuous. I doubt I have it but I'll keep monitoring anyway. 2 nights ago, it was slightly worse, waking up every couple of hours. Last night! I nearly called an ambulance again. Shakes are now constant, even as I write this in the middle of the day. Visible to everyone. Trying to get any sleep last night was like trying to find a four-leaf clover in concrete, but these shakes, we're a whole new level, which is why I'm here today. If I laid on my back the shakes came from my back, when I laid on my side they were coming from my sides. Now I normally sleep kinda on my side/front a little against a pillow that I put at the side of me lengthways. I tried this and I felt like my entire torso was on a fast spin in a powerful washing machine. I've got a little bit of a runny nose at the moment due to hay-fever, that blocked my passages that I had to sit up and breathe through my mouth for a bit while my torso was on a Hotpoint fast spin, couldn't breathe through my nose at all, I was cold, and confused. I got my breath back after a couple of minutes and laid on back to try to sleep. The tremors moved to my back slowly but when I fall asleep i fidget, (maybe restless leg syndrome) and it woke myself up on my front again. I went to bed at 11:30ish woke up at 1am,3am,4am, and 7am. At 7 i decided to just get up. I called the doctors and obviously in these days It's telephone appointment only unless it's serious enough to warrant leaving isolation. Bare-in-mind I've moved house so these are new doctors to me. I had to explain everything I could in a short amount of time as not to take up any vital work she's doing. Obviously, I didn't go into as much detail as have here but she also had my notes from previous doctors. She believes it doesn't require any further investigation as anxiety levels are high across the world at the moment and is under the impression it's just that and I should do more meditation and she wanted to prescribe me amitriptyline. I've been through the side effects of that drug and even the common side effects scare the bejesus outa me. Personally, I know they're under great pressure and need to prioritise this pandemic. So, I’ll keep my questions to the point. I'm really wanting an MRI, my gut tells me that's where the answers are but I'm also not medically trained, am I wanting too much? Could this be related to my car crash or head bang? (MANY, MANY, years ago) Am I wasting the NHS’s time? Or is my gut feeling correct and should be persistent? If i should be persistent, should the MRI be my back or head (or both) Am I being selfish in wanting a little more attention to detail? If this carries on, I'm gunna start getting anxiety over going to sleep every night. That circle of torment I do not want. (I love sleep normally) I really want to thank you for reading all the way through. And I'm sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes. I'm really tired. 0 likes, 2 replies "

Didn't call 111 this time as in September we (Doctors and I) ruled out all the major issues. No cancer signs, not heart, not lungs, not thyroids (hyper or hypo) etc. So i didn't believe it was life threatening. So, what was happening? More blood tests, same results. Some theories were thought off. General Anxiety Disorder been one. I understand that this is a logical choice but nothing in my mind pointed to anxiety. The doctors also thought my asthma medication could be the cause so we changed it. Two weeks later there is no change. decided an appointment with a neurologist was the next logical step as the condition essential tremors was now on the table. Now in this next bit please understand it’s not a moan at our NHS as I understand they deal with MILLIONS of people. The next available appointment to me (as its not life threatening) was 3 months. End of February. I was getting impatient, not with the NHS but wanting answers. I saved up some cash and went private. The appointment waiting time was a week. Fabulous. A week later the episode had gone again. As I walked into the private hospital, I felt like I was in a 4- or 5-star hotel instead of a hospital. The appointment was on time, the car park was free, there was even carpets and free hot drinks. It was very soothing been there. I spent half hour explaining everything. The understaffed NHS can't donate that amount of time to individuals due to the sheer number of people they see on a day by day basis, I understand this and please don’t think I’m belittling the NHS, I'm not, I really do love them. So, 20 mins into my appointment my neurologist started doing some reflex checks and other basic movements. He was very throughout. Afterwards he explained that I don't have Parkinson’s, MS or essential tremors as there isn't anything to suggest so. Even though I asked about not currently having an episode at the time. (this was a man who inspired confidence, he also works on the NHS apparently which I’m told a lot do) As far he could see, all’s well and didn't want me to have an MRI. He suggested my problems was muscular and pointed to muscle tension and a possibility the trigger points/knots from my car crash are back:- yoga, light exercise and meditation was the prescription. So, I added medication back into my routine as I've not done it in nearly a year. Did the occasional yoga and light exercise when I could, maybe I didn't do it enough because I had an episode again just before Christmas. This one only lasted one night, so might be working. Just breaking the timeline for a moment. When an episode comes on, I try different things to ease it. (not all at the same time, just one) Rennies in case it's caused by acid, paracetamol, Epsom salt baths, Buscopan, and hot water bottles. When these episodes come on, they can last from half hour to a week and mostly notable during the evening/night. Sometimes during the day. The longer they last the more intense they can get to a point where there are external shakes/tremors that can be seen by others. They less noticeable when I'm really engrossed in a game/movie/etc but not gone as sometimes they snap me back to reality quickly. Another symptom has appeared which is constant but minor. I feel my pulse everywhere. Stomach, Ears, hands, feet. Sometime twitching for a few seconds too but the twitch passes as quick as it comes. Back to the timeline, I live with my mum because she has chrons disease and needs occasional help. Over the Christmas period we noticed black mould in the house and she was getting poorly too. She had a very strong case of antibiotics, that cleared it up. Early January I decided to give acupuncture a try. It seemed to be working a treat, or I just wasn't having an episode, until the last week of treatment, it got bad. Acupuncture was the next day and I immediately felt relief from it. Not sure if it was a real relief or a placebo effect but I was grateful nonetheless. early February we moved house, a lot of hard work as we also moved town so I was closer to work. During all this and for a good month after I didn't have an episode. Again, I thought this was the end. Maybe the black mould was the problem after all? No My other half got whopping cough (she's getting better day by day) and decided to stay away from me and my mum, sensible thing to do, we still talk over video chat every night. This started during our house move in early February. She decided to keep isolated from me during these times even though she's almost back to normal now, in light of Covid-19 we decided it was for the best we stayed in separate houses during a lockdown. 5 nights ago, i had another episode, it woke me up so I went outside for a smoke at 3am and chilled for half hour before going back to bed. I thought it could be stress from the uncertainty of everything, and tried to brush it off. Went to bed but kept waking now and then. The following night (4 nights ago) I slept like a log, I went to bed at 9:30pm and didn't wake till 11am. The longest I'd ever slept in years. It was wonderful and the following day I energetic and got on with loads of stuff. 3 nights ago, it’s back again. Woke around 2am and 8am not as bad but still annoying. Nothing has changed in my diet and I wanted a few days off of work anyway so I isolated myself before our PM declared locked down anyway. Free time to work on some home stuff and take a break from work. Keeping an eye on my temperature just in case. It did get a little higher at one point but not feverish went back down a day later. I have smokers cough for about a month but not continuous. I doubt I have it but I'll keep monitoring anyway. 2 nights ago, it was slightly worse, waking up every couple of hours. Last night! I nearly called an ambulance again. Shakes are now constant, even as I write this in the middle of the day. Visible to everyone. Trying to get any sleep last night was like trying to find a four-leaf clover in concrete, but these shakes, we're a whole new level, which is why I'm here today. If I laid on my back the shakes came from my back, when I laid on my side they were coming from my sides. Now I normally sleep kinda on my side/front a little against a pillow that I put at the side of me lengthways. I tried this and I felt like my entire torso was on a fast spin in a powerful washing machine. I've got a little bit of a runny nose at the moment due to hay-fever, that blocked my passages that I had to sit up and breathe through my mouth for a bit while my torso was on a Hotpoint fast spin, couldn't breathe through my nose at all, I was cold, and confused. I got my breath back after a couple of minutes and laid on back to try to sleep. The tremors moved to my back slowly but when I fall asleep i fidget, (maybe restless leg syndrome) and it woke myself up on my front again. I went to bed at 11:30ish woke up at 1am,3am,4am, and 7am. At 7 i decided to just get up. I called the doctors and obviously in these days It's telephone appointment only unless it's serious enough to warrant leaving isolation. Bare-in-mind I've moved house so these are new doctors to me. I had to explain everything I could in a short amount of time as not to take up any vital work she's doing. Obviously, I didn't go into as much detail as have here but she also had my notes from previous doctors. She believes it doesn't require any further investigation as anxiety levels are high across the world at the moment and is under the impression it's just that and I should do more meditation and she wanted to prescribe me amitriptyline. I've been through the side effects of that drug and even the common side effects scare the bejesus outa me. Personally, I know they're under great pressure and need to prioritise this pandemic. So, I’ll keep my questions to the point. I'm really wanting an MRI, my gut tells me that's where the answers are but I'm also not medically trained, am I wanting too much? Could this be related to my car crash or head bang? (MANY, MANY, years ago) Am I wasting the NHS’s time? Or is my gut feeling correct and should be persistent? If i should be persistent, should the MRI be my back or head (or both) Am I being selfish in wanting a little more attention to detail? If this carries on, I'm gunna start getting anxiety over going to sleep every night. That circle of torment I do not want. (I love sleep normally) I really want to thank you for reading all the way through. And I'm sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes. I'm really tired. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I just want to tell my story in full and get advice.","My story A little bit about me, I'm 32, male, i own a small repair shop and I'm often found hunched over doing a repair of some kind, I've been asthmatic for 30 years, have hay-fever, and vitamin D deficiency. A few years back I beat depression (2017). I love theatre and gaming of all kinds. I’ve smoked for 10 years (yes I know its risks, I have no other vices as I stopped drinking alcohol a very long time ago, I do plan on quitting) I don't have great posture but when walking about I try to keep my back straight. In 2008 I had a car crash and suffered from whiplash had some deep knots/trigger points in my back from this. Between 2011-2012 I had been thrown against a concrete floor on my head (it was a genuine accident). Why am i telling you that? That will come later. Okay, to the beginning. In September 2019 i was sat in my car waiting for rehearsals as I'm part of a small local theatre group, this is my normal exercise. The temperature was a little nippy outside and it was dark so between 6:30pm and 7pm. Had a bit of a neck ache which was going up the right side of the back of my neck. Immediately followed by a twang feeling at the top of my head on the right side (where a crown hairline would be) then the aches disappeared. Didn't think much of it after then. A couple of days later while fast asleep (not sure on time) i woke to what i thought was a racing heart, i pinned this down to the dream i was having as i was running in my dream, got up had some juice and a cig and went back to bed. Two nights later i woke to the same feeling but this time i had no logical reasoning for what i thought was a very fast heartbeat, so i called 111 (I'm in the UK) at this point I strongly believed i was having a heart attack and the end was here. 111 immediately got me an ambulance. When the paramedics turned up i managed to calm down thinking i was now in the perfect hands for my situation. They did a EGC and the results was good. They stayed for a little while to make sure i was okay then off to bed i pop. The following morning i went to doctors to inform them, they suggested i had palpitations for a minute or two followed by a medical grade panic attack. Not your usual panic but full-blown medical case of the nasty stuff. Which make sense to me looking back on been calmed by the presence of some amazing hard-working paramedics. The doctors took some blood for testing just be cautious. Two nights later (noticed a pattern yet?) it happened again, except this time i was also struggling to breathe, not severely but enough to raise some concern. Took my inhaler, and dialled 111 again, they told me they had dispatched another ambulance because breathing was difficult and wanted to be there in case it got worse. The ambulance station was just down the road from my house and luckily, they weren't busy so the paramedics got there before i even ended the call with 111 (amazing response times). Again, calmed down slowly, they did ECG’s which was normal, and my inhalers kicked in for my breathing. (a bit later than usual but still concerning) They stayed with me for longer this time while they were monitoring me we got chatting about all-sorts. (one was a gamer too) they stayed that much longer they got the safety call from their office making sure they're not in danger themselves. I had an idea at this point, the ECGs I've been having have all been sat up. So i asked for another while laid down. This did produce a small result in my heart (only one extra beat) but apparently it is usual when we adjust our bodies. At this point I've stopped thinking its my heart, but what else can cause a fast pace inside your chest? I decided to change my thinking and look things logically, what did i eat that day? Have i over-exerted myself? Have i not done enough exercise? Is it shaking, vibrations, where are the originating from? So on. But then nothing. It disappeared. Got my bloods back and i went in to see the results. First doctor thought I had gout because my cholesterol was a little higher than usual. Everything else came back normal. Well, been told I'm on a fast track to gout scared the bejesus outa me. I switched to high Fibre bread and cut out all pastries, cream buns, and high sugar snacks overnight. (i did love a couple of sausage rolls a day) in the space of a week i dropped two trouser sizes, 34's to 32's and even they were a little slack. I lost weight in my face, legs, and stomach area. I looked ill. Was told by many people that was a silly thing to do and shouldn't have done it in one go. I agreed so i started with introducing a cream bun a week and some other little snacks here and there. I also cut my cigs down from 20 a day to almost 5 as my doctors said cigarettes can also contribute to high cholesterol.

No My other half got whopping cough (she's getting better day by day) and decided to stay away from me and my mum, sensible thing to do, we still talk over video chat every night. This started during our house move in early February. She decided to keep isolated from me during these times even though she's almost back to normal now, in light of Covid-19 we decided it was for the best we stayed in separate houses during a lockdown. 5 nights ago, i had another episode, it woke me up so I went outside for a smoke at 3am and chilled for half hour before going back to bed. I thought it could be stress from the uncertainty of everything, and tried to brush it off. Went to bed but kept waking now and then. The following night (4 nights ago) I slept like a log, I went to bed at 9:30pm and didn't wake till 11am. The longest I'd ever slept in years. It was wonderful and the following day I energetic and got on with loads of stuff. 3 nights ago, it’s back again. Woke around 2am and 8am not as bad but still annoying. Nothing has changed in my diet and I wanted a few days off of work anyway so I isolated myself before our PM declared locked down anyway. Free time to work on some home stuff and take a break from work. Keeping an eye on my temperature just in case. It did get a little higher at one point but not feverish went back down a day later. I have smokers cough for about a month but not continuous. I doubt I have it but I'll keep monitoring anyway. 2 nights ago, it was slightly worse, waking up every couple of hours. Last night! I nearly called an ambulance again. Shakes are now constant, even as I write this in the middle of the day. Visible to everyone. Trying to get any sleep last night was like trying to find a four-leaf clover in concrete, but these shakes, we're a whole new level, which is why I'm here today. If I laid on my back the shakes came from my back, when I laid on my side they were coming from my sides. Now I normally sleep kinda on my side/front a little against a pillow that I put at the side of me lengthways. I tried this and I felt like my entire torso was on a fast spin in a powerful washing machine. I've got a little bit of a runny nose at the moment due to hay-fever, that blocked my passages that I had to sit up and breathe through my mouth for a bit while my torso was on a Hotpoint fast spin, couldn't breathe through my nose at all, I was cold, and confused. I got my breath back after a couple of minutes and laid on back to try to sleep. The tremors moved to my back slowly but when I fall asleep i fidget, (maybe restless leg syndrome) and it woke myself up on my front again. I went to bed at 11:30ish woke up at 1am,3am,4am, and 7am. At 7 i decided to just get up. I called the doctors and obviously in these days It's telephone appointment only unless it's serious enough to warrant leaving isolation. Bare-in-mind I've moved house so these are new doctors to me. I had to explain everything I could in a short amount of time as not to take up any vital work she's doing. Obviously, I didn't go into as much detail as have here but she also had my notes from previous doctors. She believes it doesn't require any further investigation as anxiety levels are high across the world at the moment and is under the impression it's just that and I should do more meditation and she wanted to prescribe me amitriptyline. I've been through the side effects of that drug and even the common side effects scare the bejesus outa me. Personally, I know they're under great pressure and need to prioritise this pandemic. So, I’ll keep my questions to the point. I'm really wanting an MRI, my gut tells me that's where the answers are but I'm also not medically trained, am I wanting too much? Could this be related to my car crash or head bang? (MANY, MANY, years ago) Am I wasting the NHS’s time? Or is my gut feeling correct and should be persistent? If i should be persistent, should the MRI be my back or head (or both) Am I being selfish in wanting a little more attention to detail? If this carries on, I'm gunna start getting anxiety over going to sleep every night. That circle of torment I do not want. (I love sleep normally) I really want to thank you for reading all the way through. And I'm sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes. I'm really tired. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I just want to tell my story in full and get advice.","My story A little bit about me, I'm 32, male, i own a small repair shop and I'm often found hunched over doing a repair of some kind, I've been asthmatic for 30 years, have hay-fever, and vitamin D deficiency. A few years back I beat depression (2017). I love theatre and gaming of all kinds. I’ve smoked for 10 years (yes I know its risks, I have no other vices as I stopped drinking alcohol a very long time ago, I do plan on quitting) I don't have great posture but when walking about I try to keep my back straight. In 2008 I had a car crash and suffered from whiplash had some deep knots/trigger points in my back from this. Between 2011-2012 I had been thrown against a concrete floor on my head (it was a genuine accident). Why am i telling you that? That will come later. Okay, to the beginning. In September 2019 i was sat in my car waiting for rehearsals as I'm part of a small local theatre group, this is my normal exercise. The temperature was a little nippy outside and it was dark so between 6:30pm and 7pm. Had a bit of a neck ache which was going up the right side of the back of my neck. Immediately followed by a twang feeling at the top of my head on the right side (where a crown hairline would be) then the aches disappeared. Didn't think much of it after then. A couple of days later while fast asleep (not sure on time) i woke to what i thought was a racing heart, i pinned this down to the dream i was having as i was running in my dream, got up had some juice and a cig and went back to bed. Two nights later i woke to the same feeling but this time i had no logical reasoning for what i thought was a very fast heartbeat, so i called 111 (I'm in the UK) at this point I strongly believed i was having a heart attack and the end was here. 111 immediately got me an ambulance. When the paramedics turned up i managed to calm down thinking i was now in the perfect hands for my situation. They did a EGC and the results was good. They stayed for a little while to make sure i was okay then off to bed i pop. The following morning i went to doctors to inform them, they suggested i had palpitations for a minute or two followed by a medical grade panic attack. Not your usual panic but full-blown medical case of the nasty stuff. Which make sense to me looking back on been calmed by the presence of some amazing hard-working paramedics. The doctors took some blood for testing just be cautious. Two nights later (noticed a pattern yet?) it happened again, except this time i was also struggling to breathe, not severely but enough to raise some concern. Took my inhaler, and dialled 111 again, they told me they had dispatched another ambulance because breathing was difficult and wanted to be there in case it got worse. The ambulance station was just down the road from my house and luckily, they weren't busy so the paramedics got there before i even ended the call with 111 (amazing response times). Again, calmed down slowly, they did ECG’s which was normal, and my inhalers kicked in for my breathing. (a bit later than usual but still concerning) They stayed with me for longer this time while they were monitoring me we got chatting about all-sorts. (one was a gamer too) they stayed that much longer they got the safety call from their office making sure they're not in danger themselves. I had an idea at this point, the ECGs I've been having have all been sat up. So i asked for another while laid down. This did produce a small result in my heart (only one extra beat) but apparently it is usual when we adjust our bodies. At this point I've stopped thinking its my heart, but what else can cause a fast pace inside your chest? I decided to change my thinking and look things logically, what did i eat that day? Have i over-exerted myself? Have i not done enough exercise? Is it shaking, vibrations, where are the originating from? So on. But then nothing. It disappeared. Got my bloods back and i went in to see the results. First doctor thought I had gout because my cholesterol was a little higher than usual. Everything else came back normal. Well, been told I'm on a fast track to gout scared the bejesus outa me. I switched to high Fibre bread and cut out all pastries, cream buns, and high sugar snacks overnight. (i did love a couple of sausage rolls a day) in the space of a week i dropped two trouser sizes, 34's to 32's and even they were a little slack. I lost weight in my face, legs, and stomach area. I looked ill. Was told by many people that was a silly thing to do and shouldn't have done it in one go. I agreed so i started with introducing a cream bun a week and some other little snacks here and there. I also cut my cigs down from 20 a day to almost 5 as my doctors said cigarettes can also contribute to high cholesterol. I started to gain a small amount of weight back, in some places and stopped looking ill. I thought that was the end of it. In early December these shakes came back. Didn't call 111 this time as in September we (Doctors and I) ruled out all the major issues. No cancer signs, not heart, not lungs, not thyroids (hyper or hypo) etc. So i didn't believe it was life threatening. So, what was happening? More blood tests, same results. Some theories were thought off. General Anxiety Disorder been one. I understand that this is a logical choice but nothing in my mind pointed to anxiety. The doctors also thought my asthma medication could be the cause so we changed it. Two weeks later there is no change. decided an appointment with a neurologist was the next logical step as the condition essential tremors was now on the table. Now in this next bit please understand it’s not a moan at our NHS as I understand they deal with MILLIONS of people. The next available appointment to me (as its not life threatening) was 3 months. End of February. I was getting impatient, not with the NHS but wanting answers. I saved up some cash and went private. The appointment waiting time was a week. Fabulous. A week later the episode had gone again. As I walked into the private hospital, I felt like I was in a 4- or 5-star hotel instead of a hospital. The appointment was on time, the car park was free, there was even carpets and free hot drinks. It was very soothing been there. I spent half hour explaining everything. The understaffed NHS can't donate that amount of time to individuals due to the sheer number of people they see on a day by day basis, I understand this and please don’t think I’m belittling the NHS, I'm not, I really do love them. So, 20 mins into my appointment my neurologist started doing some reflex checks and other basic movements. He was very throughout. Afterwards he explained that I don't have Parkinson’s, MS or essential tremors as there isn't anything to suggest so. Even though I asked about not currently having an episode at the time. (this was a man who inspired confidence, he also works on the NHS apparently which I’m told a lot do) As far he could see, all’s well and didn't want me to have an MRI. He suggested my problems was muscular and pointed to muscle tension and a possibility the trigger points/knots from my car crash are back:- yoga, light exercise and meditation was the prescription. So, I added medication back into my routine as I've not done it in nearly a year. Did the occasional yoga and light exercise when I could, maybe I didn't do it enough because I had an episode again just before Christmas. This one only lasted one night, so might be working. Just breaking the timeline for a moment. When an episode comes on, I try different things to ease it. (not all at the same time, just one) Rennies in case it's caused by acid, paracetamol, Epsom salt baths, Buscopan, and hot water bottles. When these episodes come on, they can last from half hour to a week and mostly notable during the evening/night. Sometimes during the day. The longer they last the more intense they can get to a point where there are external shakes/tremors that can be seen by others. They less noticeable when I'm really engrossed in a game/movie/etc but not gone as sometimes they snap me back to reality quickly. Another symptom has appeared which is constant but minor. I feel my pulse everywhere. Stomach, Ears, hands, feet. Sometime twitching for a few seconds too but the twitch passes as quick as it comes. Back to the timeline, I live with my mum because she has chrons disease and needs occasional help. Over the Christmas period we noticed black mould in the house and she was getting poorly too. She had a very strong case of antibiotics, that cleared it up. Early January I decided to give acupuncture a try. It seemed to be working a treat, or I just wasn't having an episode, until the last week of treatment, it got bad. Acupuncture was the next day and I immediately felt relief from it. Not sure if it was a real relief or a placebo effect but I was grateful nonetheless. early February we moved house, a lot of hard work as we also moved town so I was closer to work.

If i should be persistent, should the MRI be my back or head (or both) Am I being selfish in wanting a little more attention to detail? If this carries on, I'm gunna start getting anxiety over going to sleep every night. That circle of torment I do not want. (I love sleep normally) I really want to thank you for reading all the way through. And I'm sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes. I'm really tired. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I just want to tell my story in full and get advice.","My story A little bit about me, I'm 32, male, i own a small repair shop and I'm often found hunched over doing a repair of some kind, I've been asthmatic for 30 years, have hay-fever, and vitamin D deficiency. A few years back I beat depression (2017). I love theatre and gaming of all kinds. I’ve smoked for 10 years (yes I know its risks, I have no other vices as I stopped drinking alcohol a very long time ago, I do plan on quitting) I don't have great posture but when walking about I try to keep my back straight. In 2008 I had a car crash and suffered from whiplash had some deep knots/trigger points in my back from this. Between 2011-2012 I had been thrown against a concrete floor on my head (it was a genuine accident). Why am i telling you that? That will come later. Okay, to the beginning. In September 2019 i was sat in my car waiting for rehearsals as I'm part of a small local theatre group, this is my normal exercise. The temperature was a little nippy outside and it was dark so between 6:30pm and 7pm. Had a bit of a neck ache which was going up the right side of the back of my neck. Immediately followed by a twang feeling at the top of my head on the right side (where a crown hairline would be) then the aches disappeared. Didn't think much of it after then. A couple of days later while fast asleep (not sure on time) i woke to what i thought was a racing heart, i pinned this down to the dream i was having as i was running in my dream, got up had some juice and a cig and went back to bed. Two nights later i woke to the same feeling but this time i had no logical reasoning for what i thought was a very fast heartbeat, so i called 111 (I'm in the UK) at this point I strongly believed i was having a heart attack and the end was here. 111 immediately got me an ambulance. When the paramedics turned up i managed to calm down thinking i was now in the perfect hands for my situation. They did a EGC and the results was good. They stayed for a little while to make sure i was okay then off to bed i pop. The following morning i went to doctors to inform them, they suggested i had palpitations for a minute or two followed by a medical grade panic attack. Not your usual panic but full-blown medical case of the nasty stuff. Which make sense to me looking back on been calmed by the presence of some amazing hard-working paramedics. The doctors took some blood for testing just be cautious. Two nights later (noticed a pattern yet?) it happened again, except this time i was also struggling to breathe, not severely but enough to raise some concern. Took my inhaler, and dialled 111 again, they told me they had dispatched another ambulance because breathing was difficult and wanted to be there in case it got worse. The ambulance station was just down the road from my house and luckily, they weren't busy so the paramedics got there before i even ended the call with 111 (amazing response times). Again, calmed down slowly, they did ECG’s which was normal, and my inhalers kicked in for my breathing. (a bit later than usual but still concerning) They stayed with me for longer this time while they were monitoring me we got chatting about all-sorts. (one was a gamer too) they stayed that much longer they got the safety call from their office making sure they're not in danger themselves. I had an idea at this point, the ECGs I've been having have all been sat up. So i asked for another while laid down. This did produce a small result in my heart (only one extra beat) but apparently it is usual when we adjust our bodies. At this point I've stopped thinking its my heart, but what else can cause a fast pace inside your chest? I decided to change my thinking and look things logically, what did i eat that day? Have i over-exerted myself? Have i not done enough exercise? Is it shaking, vibrations, where are the originating from? So on. But then nothing. It disappeared. Got my bloods back and i went in to see the results. First doctor thought I had gout because my cholesterol was a little higher than usual. Everything else came back normal. Well, been told I'm on a fast track to gout scared the bejesus outa me. I switched to high Fibre bread and cut out all pastries, cream buns, and high sugar snacks overnight. (i did love a couple of sausage rolls a day) in the space of a week i dropped two trouser sizes, 34's to 32's and even they were a little slack. I lost weight in my face, legs, and stomach area. I looked ill. Was told by many people that was a silly thing to do and shouldn't have done it in one go. I agreed so i started with introducing a cream bun a week and some other little snacks here and there. I also cut my cigs down from 20 a day to almost 5 as my doctors said cigarettes can also contribute to high cholesterol. I started to gain a small amount of weight back, in some places and stopped looking ill. I thought that was the end of it. In early December these shakes came back. Didn't call 111 this time as in September we (Doctors and I) ruled out all the major issues. No cancer signs, not heart, not lungs, not thyroids (hyper or hypo) etc. So i didn't believe it was life threatening. So, what was happening? More blood tests, same results. Some theories were thought off. General Anxiety Disorder been one. I understand that this is a logical choice but nothing in my mind pointed to anxiety. The doctors also thought my asthma medication could be the cause so we changed it. Two weeks later there is no change. decided an appointment with a neurologist was the next logical step as the condition essential tremors was now on the table. Now in this next bit please understand it’s not a moan at our NHS as I understand they deal with MILLIONS of people. The next available appointment to me (as its not life threatening) was 3 months. End of February. I was getting impatient, not with the NHS but wanting answers. I saved up some cash and went private. The appointment waiting time was a week. Fabulous. A week later the episode had gone again. As I walked into the private hospital, I felt like I was in a 4- or 5-star hotel instead of a hospital. The appointment was on time, the car park was free, there was even carpets and free hot drinks. It was very soothing been there. I spent half hour explaining everything. The understaffed NHS can't donate that amount of time to individuals due to the sheer number of people they see on a day by day basis, I understand this and please don’t think I’m belittling the NHS, I'm not, I really do love them. So, 20 mins into my appointment my neurologist started doing some reflex checks and other basic movements. He was very throughout. Afterwards he explained that I don't have Parkinson’s, MS or essential tremors as there isn't anything to suggest so. Even though I asked about not currently having an episode at the time. (this was a man who inspired confidence, he also works on the NHS apparently which I’m told a lot do) As far he could see, all’s well and didn't want me to have an MRI. He suggested my problems was muscular and pointed to muscle tension and a possibility the trigger points/knots from my car crash are back:- yoga, light exercise and meditation was the prescription. So, I added medication back into my routine as I've not done it in nearly a year. Did the occasional yoga and light exercise when I could, maybe I didn't do it enough because I had an episode again just before Christmas. This one only lasted one night, so might be working. Just breaking the timeline for a moment. When an episode comes on, I try different things to ease it. (not all at the same time, just one) Rennies in case it's caused by acid, paracetamol, Epsom salt baths, Buscopan, and hot water bottles. When these episodes come on, they can last from half hour to a week and mostly notable during the evening/night. Sometimes during the day. The longer they last the more intense they can get to a point where there are external shakes/tremors that can be seen by others. They less noticeable when I'm really engrossed in a game/movie/etc but not gone as sometimes they snap me back to reality quickly. Another symptom has appeared which is constant but minor. I feel my pulse everywhere. Stomach, Ears, hands, feet. Sometime twitching for a few seconds too but the twitch passes as quick as it comes. Back to the timeline, I live with my mum because she has chrons disease and needs occasional help. Over the Christmas period we noticed black mould in the house and she was getting poorly too. She had a very strong case of antibiotics, that cleared it up. Early January I decided to give acupuncture a try. It seemed to be working a treat, or I just wasn't having an episode, until the last week of treatment, it got bad. Acupuncture was the next day and I immediately felt relief from it. Not sure if it was a real relief or a placebo effect but I was grateful nonetheless. early February we moved house, a lot of hard work as we also moved town so I was closer to work. During all this and for a good month after I didn't have an episode. Again, I thought this was the end. Maybe the black mould was the problem after all? No My other half got whopping cough (she's getting better day by day) and decided to stay away from me and my mum, sensible thing to do, we still talk over video chat every night. This started during our house move in early February. She decided to keep isolated from me during these times even though she's almost back to normal now, in light of Covid-19 we decided it was for the best we stayed in separate houses during a lockdown. 5 nights ago, i had another episode, it woke me up so I went outside for a smoke at 3am and chilled for half hour before going back to bed. I thought it could be stress from the uncertainty of everything, and tried to brush it off. Went to bed but kept waking now and then. The following night (4 nights ago) I slept like a log, I went to bed at 9:30pm and didn't wake till 11am. The longest I'd ever slept in years. It was wonderful and the following day I energetic and got on with loads of stuff. 3 nights ago, it’s back again. Woke around 2am and 8am not as bad but still annoying. Nothing has changed in my diet and I wanted a few days off of work anyway so I isolated myself before our PM declared locked down anyway. Free time to work on some home stuff and take a break from work. Keeping an eye on my temperature just in case. It did get a little higher at one point but not feverish went back down a day later. I have smokers cough for about a month but not continuous. I doubt I have it but I'll keep monitoring anyway. 2 nights ago, it was slightly worse, waking up every couple of hours. Last night! I nearly called an ambulance again. Shakes are now constant, even as I write this in the middle of the day. Visible to everyone. Trying to get any sleep last night was like trying to find a four-leaf clover in concrete, but these shakes, we're a whole new level, which is why I'm here today. If I laid on my back the shakes came from my back, when I laid on my side they were coming from my sides. Now I normally sleep kinda on my side/front a little against a pillow that I put at the side of me lengthways. I tried this and I felt like my entire torso was on a fast spin in a powerful washing machine. I've got a little bit of a runny nose at the moment due to hay-fever, that blocked my passages that I had to sit up and breathe through my mouth for a bit while my torso was on a Hotpoint fast spin, couldn't breathe through my nose at all, I was cold, and confused. I got my breath back after a couple of minutes and laid on back to try to sleep. The tremors moved to my back slowly but when I fall asleep i fidget, (maybe restless leg syndrome) and it woke myself up on my front again. I went to bed at 11:30ish woke up at 1am,3am,4am, and 7am. At 7 i decided to just get up. I called the doctors and obviously in these days It's telephone appointment only unless it's serious enough to warrant leaving isolation. Bare-in-mind I've moved house so these are new doctors to me. I had to explain everything I could in a short amount of time as not to take up any vital work she's doing. Obviously, I didn't go into as much detail as have here but she also had my notes from previous doctors. She believes it doesn't require any further investigation as anxiety levels are high across the world at the moment and is under the impression it's just that and I should do more meditation and she wanted to prescribe me amitriptyline. I've been through the side effects of that drug and even the common side effects scare the bejesus outa me. Personally, I know they're under great pressure and need to prioritise this pandemic. So, I’ll keep my questions to the point. I'm really wanting an MRI, my gut tells me that's where the answers are but I'm also not medically trained, am I wanting too much? Could this be related to my car crash or head bang? (MANY, MANY, years ago) Am I wasting the NHS’s time? Or is my gut feeling correct and should be persistent?

I also have very intense jerks when I try to fall asleep with the tremors nothing seems to stop the tremors. During the day my brain feels like it's not working correctly at all  feels very Spacey surreal....just to give you a background on what's been going on with me I am 46 years old I had a full   6 weeks ago within days of my hysterectomy I started getting severe headaches  I was concerned after 5 days  of having these headaches I called my doctor and they got back with me and said they forgot to tell me about my hormone patch that was sitting at a pharmacy that I don't even go to so I got on Miniville estrogen after several days in the meantime my vision was also blurry and I started feeling very surreal foggy and unusual brain tingling pains electrical zaps and a type of mental decline. Honestly it felt like I was coming down with Dementia or something. I felt like every single day my brain was either under attack with an infection or I was losing some of my cognitive abilities. I also started having trouble sleeping shortly after this.... having trouble falling asleep waking up  with tremors in my head  couple weeks ago and then last week I had a stressful week and started getting the Tremors before I fell asleep not just after I woke up I did not sleep for 4 days solid. Went to the ER because everyone was closed for Christmas they sent me home with Ambien... tried that and it did not work already tried Benadryl it did not work tried melatonin it did not work try breathing exercises it did not work. At best right now I am getting maybe an hour asleep at night usually about 45 minutes. Like I said the brain Tremors are inside my head and to be clear my head does not Shake itself just inside and I'm getting lots of jerks muscle spasms with my body that wake me up immediately...then wake up and my blood pressure goes through the roof my normal blood pressure is 110 over 60 lately my blood pressure after I wake up is 170/100. I cannot figure this out I have tried different hormones over the last couple weeks nothing is working I don't even know if it's hormone-related. I went to the doctor he ordered an MRI gave me lorazepam that's not working either  but it does make the Tremors feel softer.

I also have very intense jerks when I try to fall asleep with the tremors nothing seems to stop the tremors. During the day my brain feels like it's not working correctly at all  feels very Spacey surreal....just to give you a background on what's been going on with me I am 46 years old I had a full   6 weeks ago within days of my hysterectomy I started getting severe headaches  I was concerned after 5 days  of having these headaches I called my doctor and they got back with me and said they forgot to tell me about my hormone patch that was sitting at a pharmacy that I don't even go to so I got on Miniville estrogen after several days in the meantime my vision was also blurry and I started feeling very surreal foggy and unusual brain tingling pains electrical zaps and a type of mental decline. Honestly it felt like I was coming down with Dementia or something. I felt like every single day my brain was either under attack with an infection or I was losing some of my cognitive abilities. I also started having trouble sleeping shortly after this.... having trouble falling asleep waking up  with tremors in my head  couple weeks ago and then last week I had a stressful week and started getting the Tremors before I fell asleep not just after I woke up I did not sleep for 4 days solid. Went to the ER because everyone was closed for Christmas they sent me home with Ambien... tried that and it did not work already tried Benadryl it did not work tried melatonin it did not work try breathing exercises it did not work. At best right now I am getting maybe an hour asleep at night usually about 45 minutes. Like I said the brain Tremors are inside my head and to be clear my head does not Shake itself just inside and I'm getting lots of jerks muscle spasms with my body that wake me up immediately...then wake up and my blood pressure goes through the roof my normal blood pressure is 110 over 60 lately my blood pressure after I wake up is 170/100. I cannot figure this out I have tried different hormones over the last couple weeks nothing is working I don't even know if it's hormone-related. I went to the doctor he ordered an MRI gave me lorazepam that's not working either  but it does make the Tremors feel softer.

395,C0235394,Wasting,"C0557875, C0037317","Tired, Sleep disturbances",https://patient.info/forums/discuss/sleep-difficulty-advice--732325,Sleep difficulty; advice?,"Before I start, I am well aware that I am not the only person who struggles to sleep, and don't mean to downplay anyone's condition; I'd simply like some advice. . I'm a 19 year old male, and since I was a kid (I don't remember what age, but I was really young), I've had difficulty sleeping. I remember trying to convince people that ""I sleep with my eyes open"" and, quite a bit later, ""I don't know how to sleep"" because at the time that's what I legitimately believed. It's NOT that I absolutely cannot sleep, but I struggle to get myself to fall asleep. . When I was a kid, I couldn't fall asleep, and would lie in bed until, the mental wear I guess? was enough to make me fall asleep; like until I couldn't stay awake any longer. Well, that's how I remember it, and it definitely felt like I was up at least 4 hours a night. I understand that these are the memories of a child, and not necessarily accurate. . Anyway, for as long as I can remember it's been about the same. At some point I would occasionally check the time and note the latest time I saw the next day. This showed me to be awake for a number of hours, and it seems like the number of hours has increased as I got older. At some point during matric, I really wanted to finish as soon as possible, and my school system was effectively homeschooling, so I could work at my own pace. I started working until midnight every day, and then got up at 3 A.M. to continue before going to school. This carried on for about 3-4 weeks. Honestly don't know if this was even relevant, but to me, I can't say I felt more tired than usual, and, if anything, I'd say my sleep felt more consistent/stable. . When I was younger I didn't particularly   tired or strained. From about Grade 8 I started constantly feeling that I wasn't performing as well as I could. Currently, I always feel tired/drained. . Currently I don't work and study from home, and my pattern lately has been to go to bed at around midnight, try to fall asleep until 3-4, wake up again at 6-7, and then due to the lack of social responsibility and possibly the comfort of bed/drowsiness? I stay in bed and get broken sleep (about 30 mins every 2 hours) until after midday. The past few days my feelings have been 'Screw it, if I don't feel like I'll be able to fall asleep I won't even try' and the sleep after spending a full night after being awake is definitely easier to get into, though the broken pattern in the morning still happens, and the next day I once again don't feel like sleeping. . Honestly, I don't expect anyone to read this bloody long rant, but if anyone does, I can't say it wouldn't make me juts a bit happy. Even if you just scoff and regret the time of your life that I wasted, it's nice to listened to I guess. . On the off chance that anyone   read this, any advice would be hugely appreciated. I've searched for commercially available chloroform (and was disappointed to find the health risks), I've tried a bunch of breathing/thinking techniques, I've tried teas etc., I've tried both active (exercise) and inactive resting before going to bed, and I've tried sleeping elsewhere besides my bedroom (since I heard that sleep environment can be a factor), and haven't gotten anywhere. P.S. Anyone who made it this far, sorry. But seriously, thank you. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Following the 21st radiotherapy i suffered with a sore stomach and oesophagus which continued with each radiotherapy whilst i was in hospital. The pain in the stomach went but has remained in the oesophagus ever since and it is over 2 months on. During my stay, the pain clinic told me that the pain would be gone long by now but it hasn't even improved. I have been to the hospital and seen a doctor since then and seen three different G.P's but none of them can give me any idea how long the pain will continue for or when it will improve. I have been on all sorts of painkillers to alleviate the pain but only Oxycodone twice a day has helped in any way. I forgot to take them with me when i went out for the night recently and the pain spread all around the area. The Oxycodone has had a terrible affect on my mental state too as it has caused severe depression so i am anxious to get off it asap.

I'm getting a sort of electrical shock when trying to fall asleep.  This electrical shock seems to be described on other sites as 'jumps' or 'zaps' or 'surges of energy'.  It happens not when I'm sleeping but the moment I am about to fall asleep.  Its like a sort of butterflies feeling in the stomach and then a rush/surge of energy to the brain which gives you a 'jump' and electrical feeling in the head and sometimes upper body.  The more extreme they are sometimes produce a twitch in maybe the arm or leg.  Its not painful but I guess is quite scary when it happens.  These can happen numerous times a night. Many friends/family I have spoken to say this is normal and they are familiar with the symptoms (I understand what they mean as it can be quite similar to when you suddenly wake from a bad dream) but mine seem to be a lot more often and extreme.  I know my symptoms don't seem to be normal.   I've been having these for about 5-6 weeks now (some nights are worse than others) but generally its been more or less every night.  This has turned into a vicious cycle because when you actually close your eyes at night to go to sleep you are actually waiting for the 'shock' to happen instead of trying to sleep.  Obviously the less sleep you have, the less functional you are the next day and so on and so on.  You then get sleep deprived which I believe also may trigger this. The only other thing I can add to my symptoms is sometimes during the day I get a spaced out/empty/dizzy/cloudy feeling in the head (hard to explain).  Sometimes this can turn into a sort of brain/head sensation where you feel you need to kind of 'shake it off'.  Again, its hard to explain, something like if you have restless feet and you need to kick out of it but its in the head so you need to give yourself a shake to snap out of it. I have read quite a bit about  /stress and these symptoms may fall into this category but the issue I have with this, is that I have nothing to be anxious/stressful about!  All is OK with job, money, house, relationship etc so I'm not sure how this all started.  Could I be anxious about this illness?  Again, a vicious cycle? About me - I'm a fit and healthy 35 year old guy.  I actually exercise quite a lot (go to gym/swim 4 times a week and have run numerous marathons over the past year). Although this fitness regime has stopped since I have started having these symptoms as I am feeling quite weak/tired due to not getting much sleep due to it.  I have no major prior illnesses and I am not on any medication.  I don't want to get in the habit of taking sleep medication. I have been to the hospital and spent the night where they performed numerous  /Heart ECG/X Rays/Urine and all came back OK.  The only issue I had was slightly high blood pressure (but not high enough to be put on any medication).  I have also been for an   and EEG epilepsy test.  I will find the results with these in about 5 weeks time. Anyway, that's my symptoms and hopefully someone might feel at ease that they are going through something similar.  Reading similar posts on the internet I don't think anyone has come to the conclusion on what in fact is causing these problems, even though a lot of the people actually been for tests and seen doctors.

But let me start off when it first started which was mid November of 2017. I started having major anxiety attacks, I would get dizzy, difficult breathing and stuff like that. So I was taken to hospital and I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder. I also went 2nd time because I thought I had acid reflux because I would have syptomps like ALOTT of burping even when I have not eaten I would burp and then less than ONE second I would get another one and it would disturb me a lot and this has been for probably 3 years I have this but I would always mucous in back of my throat; it’s always there I don’t know why but I thought it could have been reflux since I would get the mucous even more when I would drink for example Gatorade or even brush my teeth(Cologate tooth paste). So they they gave some omprezale which did absolutely nothing and I went on different type of omprezale which was in little pills which I found actually did help with the burping. But the mucous part I found that it could be cattarh which I am taking nasal spray for and is working out for now. But moving further around February the anxiety attacks were terrible. I didn’t even wanna go to school I would cry to stay home and this lasted for 2 weeks and I would talk to teachers all day because I could not stay calm at all and they knew about this so yea. But after these 2 weeks I became fine and wasn’t scared to go to school or anywhere else. But what also started November was I started getting scared to eat food. Idk why or how it started but I think it was because I use to get difficulty eating when I would have panic attacks which was during dinner sometimes but other times I ate perfectly fine with no trouble but near the end of February till now I can not swallow at all, I am to scared to swallow the only things I can eat is cereal and oatmeal that’s it. I did lose about 9 pounds because of me not eating but when I went to get checked out again for weight I increased 5 more pounds which I guess is good. So now basically I have gotten stuck with the idea of having cancer in esophagus because I did have reflux for while and it is difficult for me to swallow which makes me get anxiety and I’m so scared now. I have met with nutrition team in hospital to help me eat and they also said if I want I can have a barium swallow test be done which would allow me to see how stuff goes down my throat and into esophagus which I thought it would be perfect because it  can also check for other things like cancer but I still don’t get the appointment for that and I’m still not eating proply.

I'm seeing an ENT tomorrow and a GI doctor on the 14th. Meanwhile I can't stop Googling my symptoms and thinking I'm going to die of esophageal cancer and leave three little kids. Please help! Is it normal to have a little bit of swallowing pain in your right shoulder blade.? I also have the right shoulder pain whether I swallow or not just on and off during the day and some chest pain. I don't choke on food but I do feel like sometimes I need liquids to get some down. I've had 3 indice endoscopies but not in 4 years. I had a barium swallow Test 2 years ago. As you can see I have battled GERD and such for a long time. But this is the most scared I've ever been of esophageal cancer because I've never had the shoulder thing. I also recently had an upper respiratory infection and after 12 days my voice is still hoarse so I don't know if it's from that or what. Every symptom seems to terrify me these days. Any advice would be greatly appreciated since we are supposed to go on a family vacation day after tomorrow.  Thanks ? 0 likes, 13 replies "

I'm 21 and have had gerd and acid reflux problems since I was 19. I have not been tested or treated appropriately and have had regurgitation a few times a day but rarely get heartburn. so the reason I've been having these scary assumptions is because recently I've been have chest pains and trouble getting foods down to my stomach (mainly bread and meat) I feel a pressure when ur gets to my mid chest area. I also have started to get a ridiculous amount of heartburn and indigestion. I've noticed these pains the past few days and the trouble swallowing and pressure when it gets down there for a couple weeks. I've got a doctor appointment next week and I'm very nervous. could I have it? 0 likes, 1 reply "

The problem I subsequently got in my foot, surprisingly was diagnosed as advanced arthritis but I wonder if it would have been better to investigate the underlying cause of that trip up. No-one's fault at that time. However, as the best way to improve arthritis is trying to walk on it I tried too hard to do that and my symptoms just got worse. Since last time I have been trying to unslump  into my leg by ensuring the other foot, in particular the other hip hoists me upright. It does just make me see how squashed and twisted my right leg has become. I'm trying to keep up with the pilates for core and buttock strengthening and to go for short 15-20 minutes walks, not too far so that the squashing down feeling in the right leg doesn't become too apparent. I am scared because I have had this so long even if it is evolving ( 3+ years). I am also angry that because my symptoms haven't properly ""fitted into an NHS box"" I have been dismissed and sent this way and that and I am going to, if possible calmly, say this....even though I don't feel calm, more abandoned than anything! My symptoms are pain in either right foot leg or back or all three. Since trying not to slump by utilising the outer left leg more my back symptoms have lessened. The left leg used to have more weakness than it presently does. These are clues about my beliefs mentioned above. Thank you for reading. I think I am psyching myself up for my assessment this week. Apart from mentioning my frustrations I want to ask for guidance and help in going forward with what I am presently doing with exercise and with my uncertain future and how to cope with my disabling symptoms. 0 likes, 14 replies "

Around 4 days ago, or 5, I've noticed a clicking in the area I located before. However, I do have some kind of ""twitch"" I think it is. I cannot stop it, but I put my head back with pressure (not using my hands) and that does cause pain, but it also started the same time as the clicking happened.  The clicking happens when I put my head back. If I was to bring it down to my chest and back up the clicking will start. It's one click but if I put my hand on it, it feels like multiple clicks but I can only feel one without touching it. (I think you call it the occipital bone is where it's located) I'm not wanting to go to the doctors yet, I'll wait till Monday probably, cause it's nothing serious I assume. I'm also 16.

(Is this a looming panic attack or physical - I am mystified at this one). I have woke up a few times with numb hands (no, I dont sleep on my arms/hands) Sometimes a feeling of disorientation / confusion (This may be worsened by anxiety - but I am not yet convinced its   by it). Some slight tremors of the roof of my mouth, eyes when closed and right hand. Only noticeable at certain times. PERSISTENT SYMTOMS : Dizziness Tinnitus (Mostly left) Constant trapped nerve in neck / shoulder area (mostly a while back) Random nerve pains - upper body mostly Nerve pain running up neck and around ear area(s) (occipital region). Very tight, rock-like trap muscles Sometimes some Bradycardia (Has been as low as 49bpm) and some skipped beats here and there Some anxiety and depression As far as docs opinions go, I have no infection, my CRP is fine and they say its nothing sinister (however my white cell / neutrophil count was high and lymphocytes low one night in A&E).

Well, I have noticed that every time I feel all shivery, suddenly anxious, and high stool output, I feel that warm fuzzy weird shivery vagus nerve feeling. Weird? Is it possible (long shot maybe) - that my heavy heavy lifting at work has done something to my neck, base of skull or upper back and in turn, this has caused a cascade of symptoms above?

Here are my symptoms - oh and I had an MRI 2 weeks ago on inner ears & brain and everything came back normal. SUDDEN SYMPTOMS: High stool & urine output (weird one.. undigested stool, smelly, sometimes very light yellow (?)). Sudden shivers, feeling quite cold. (Is this a looming panic attack or physical - I am mystified at this one). I have woke up a few times with numb hands (no, I dont sleep on my arms/hands) Sometimes a feeling of disorientation / confusion (This may be worsened by anxiety - but I am not yet convinced its   by it). Some slight tremors of the roof of my mouth, eyes when closed and right hand. Only noticeable at certain times. PERSISTENT SYMTOMS : Dizziness Tinnitus (Mostly left) Constant trapped nerve in neck / shoulder area (mostly a while back) Random nerve pains - upper body mostly Nerve pain running up neck and around ear area(s) (occipital region). Very tight, rock-like trap muscles Sometimes some Bradycardia (Has been as low as 49bpm) and some skipped beats here and there Some anxiety and depression As far as docs opinions go, I have no infection, my CRP is fine and they say its nothing sinister (however my white cell / neutrophil count was high and lymphocytes low one night in A&E). Now I am reading up on vagus nerve dysfunction - yknow that goosebump-like shivery feeling when you need a poop. Well, I have noticed that every time I feel all shivery, suddenly anxious, and high stool output, I feel that warm fuzzy weird shivery vagus nerve feeling. Weird? Is it possible (long shot maybe) - that my heavy heavy lifting at work has done something to my neck, base of skull or upper back and in turn, this has caused a cascade of symptoms above?

They tend to crack 'vertically' back towards the fingers, not across the nails. The added problem is the crack doesn't seem to grow out in most instances. I regularly trim the nails so that i am cutting out the crack, but it continues to stay cracked! I am assuming that my nails have got weaker and more brittle as i've got older (i'm 65) but i don't know anybody else who has the same problem. Can anybody shine some light on this for me? Thank you.

Worrying me! ,"Since I was born, I have had cracked toenails. They have always had lines going vertically to the cuticle. About a year ago, one of my toenails completely split in half right down to the cuticle and as it grew, the split never healed and I had to keep trimming the nail. Then the cuticle area started to grow a bump as if it were an overgrown cuticle and i would pull it out or cut it off and it would bleed a lot. then eventually start growing back. I've left it grow for a few months to see what happens and it has started growing tiny pieces of nail on top. I'm thinking that due to the nail splitting, it's trying to grow an entire new nail over the top. I'm slightly concerned and don't know what it is. Any help?  0 likes, 0 replies "

What should I do?,"I managed to hit my little finger pretty hard with a hammer (just like a cartoon). The nail immediately started to bleed between the nail and nail bed and was very painful for over a week. The nail went black. I expected the nail to fall off but 6 weeks later it is still here and still black.  It is still growing which suggests to me that it isn't dead. I thought that as it grows it would produce healthy nail but the nail that is growing is also come through as black. It became less painful but this last week it has been getting very sore again. It's too sore to cut and I can hardly touch it anymore due to the pain. I saw a doctor about a week after the accident and they told me to just keep an eye on it...I'm not really sure what I'm meant to be looking for. Please take a look at the images. Is this normal? What should i do? Also, it has distorted the shape or the nail too. It is much more curved than my other nail and still a bit swollen. If helpful, I'm a 26 year old man. Thanks! 0 likes, 2 replies "

What to do?,"Hi there, I’d like to start by saying thank you for reading this, it’s quite long and it’s a convoluted problem that I can’t get my head around. I don’t wish to be seen as complaining, but it’s really causing me stress and depression now. Although I’m a relatively cautious person, I have a history of drinking, smoking and nasal drug use. I’ve had patches of heavy drinking and smoking, but they were always social. I just did them because others did around me. I would never ever have found myself with a drink/drug problem and needing to do them all alone, so doing so seemed fine enough whilst I was younger. I had trouble breathing a few years ago, and found I had a deviated septum, which I think I’d had for quite a few years, I saw a doctor because I couldn't breathe (worried I had sleep apnoea). I had an operation, a septorhinplasty, it seemed ok, but the problems didn’t stop. Though I didn’t do many at the time, I’m worried that continuing to do drugs deviated the septum again, as I’ve noticed in pictures after the surgery the inside bridge became quite visible through one nostril and I don’t imagine the surgeon would have left it like that (i’m quite a laissez faire person so I’m not monitoring my appearance at every oportunity). I am very active person so do a lot of strenuous activities like running, boxing and climbing, and i'm genrally just quite ADHD,  I also notice I began to touch and pick my nose alot, and although I was doing drugs, I really I wasn’t doing many at all, however I didn’t think of this at the time, because I’ve never had a ‘problem’. People who have problems do it for years and develop habits, I know them, and I see their plight. However, looking back I realise that the nose is so much more sensitive than I realised, and I should have avoided it at all costs forever. Nobody advised me on healing time following the surgery, but it's my own fault. Though the surgeon didn’t seem to notice any change  following the first one when I had a second surgery. So, I’m just hoping it’s my own anxiety. I eventually had another operation of march last year to fix further problems of having to breathe through my mouth, and this one was very painful, for over a week I couldn’t breathe and was awake each and every night in agonising pain. Now, apart from functional problems which is my real concern, I’m getting some (hopefully irrational) anxiety about the shape of my new nose. I didn’t realise it would be so cosmetic, but the bridge is completely straightened out, which I’m extremely annoyed about and the tip seems to have a bulb at the end, I can see how he has reshaped the exterior of my nose and I don't think it works. I just wanted to breathe better, I didn’t want to look like a new person but because this surgeon was so relaxed, I worry that he didn’t lay it out to me straight or ask what I wanted. I’ve begun to be even more annoyed because although I’ve never thought about it until now, although I’m not so vain, I liked my big curved nose, it was part of my character and my family, now I’ve got a nice new straight nose, and I didn't ask for that, it’s not worrying to my health, but it's been added to the weight of this problem because it's not me. Since the operation 1 year and 6 months ago, I’ve stupidly sniffed cocaine about 4-5 nights but never in a marathon way, and the first time was 3 full months after the operation. I’d given up going out, and my life has become more introverted which I don’t mind, but the only friends I really have seem to sniff cocaine alot, it’s a real epidemic in young people in cities and universities, and I’ve said NO so many times. But I went to visit friends about 3 months after the operation at a festival. I felt out of place because I’d left my Job in music through burnout and then had had a real experience with this operation and was left jobless. When I’d got a bit drunk on the first night one friend sort of gestured quite strongly for me to have some of his stuff, I think quite innocently, as they don’t know the extent of the difficulties I’ve had with my nose, and me being drunk and agreeable I eventually gave in, after saying no for quite a while, but I think their thinking is that I’m not having having fun because I’m not joining in. I absolutely hate sheep mentality, which is another story. Now these aren’t ‘bad ‘people, they are are actually great, just young people like me who perhaps don’t understand the negative effects of cocaine, because literally everyone is doing it. I hated myself for doing it, and immediately had worry about my nose and thought I could feel it, this is why I think it might be irrational. I spent the next night of the festival in bed and left the festival early on the third day. The other times I ended up doing it on a couple of nights out when I was drunk with some old school friends who work in the city. I hate myself for it. I never really liked cocaine anyway, I don’t get it at all and think it turns people into painfully boring and embarrassing egotistical blabber boxes, and it's so expensive. But people were giving it to me, and I ended up buying some after getting a taste for it on this particular night, we were having fun I suppose. Then, last week I got worried. I’d done much less than 1 gram of it whilst on a stag do the other week, and I’d said no for the first night, but literally everyone was doing it on the second, so I bought one. And I’m usually so stern, but sometimes I get drunk, and because I have a history of doing it, it’s not out of this world like it would be to a non drug user, and I just joined in the fun. Now since then, I’ve been aware of my nose and have been a bit concerned, I've been looking at my nose, and I’m frankly paranoid now, there’s been white scabbing around the nostril for a while, but also it’s around my ears, so I hope its some form of psoriasis. I’ve been very busy and not been eating too well for the past few weeks so I’m hoping my diet is bringing this out. However, I am very aware of my nose being there too, if that makes sense, it feels heavy, and it’s almost as if someone has just put a fake nose on my face.n  There is also a slight whistle when I breathe which I understand is septal damage, it feels cold on one side when I breathe in, and there are cyst type things inside the nostil, it’s also often blocked but that is nothing new, it’s always blocked. And I’m concerned the nostril have slightly collapsed and become pricked at the tip, also when I took some pictures of my nose in harsh light it looks flattened and quite weak - fat on the bridge and bulbous at the tip, but because it’s occupied alot of my time and I suffer from ADHD and what i'd describe as feelings of depression anxiety, especially since being unemployed for the past year and trying to piece together a living as a freelancer. I’m thinking I’m just being worried, inattentive to the general changes in my appearance and paranoid, but I can’t get my mind of it, because anyone else would probably tell you it’s fine. It’s really getting to me and I want a conclusion. As I said, I’m not too vain, and I never wanted this ‘new nose’, which I worry has lost some of my character anyway, I suppose I’ll just get now with that, but I’m extremely annoyed at the surgeon, and would even consider taking him to court for doing what I now know is a septorhinoplasty, not a septoplasty which I wanted. (It was done through insurance so I didn’t pay a penny). I want to know more, or at least find someone to talk to, because I have nobody, and it’s causing me a alot of worry because it's my nose, on my face. I find doctors in the past haver mostly been unhelpful, but I’d need to sign up anyway if I wanted to see one. I’m usually so healthy and fit, but this past year my nose has been a problem, I’ve been very stressed and my hair has been thinning and falling out at an alarming rate and i've got psoriasis on my ears, and I also want to find some reassurance and find out whether all this is something I should be concerned about or not, or can deal with, or whether it’s all the sign of something else. I will 100% not be snorting drugs ever again that’s for sure, and I’m quite confident I can quite smoking, as long as I don’t drink. However I do exercise a lot, practice yoga and run, and I’m trying to overcome my mental debilitating as best as possible (very impulsive and unfocssed). My final thought is surely you have to abuse cocaine for it to damage your nose? I really have never abused it. Am I just being paranoid, but what are the white crusts around the nostril? Why the whistling? Why the uncomfortability ? has the nose changed shape since the operation ? What are these cyst type things in the nose? I can’t figure it all out. I would be so grateful to hear from someone who for some reason has the time or knowledge to help, or at least point me in the right direction. I understand health problems arise, and I’m fine getting on with it. But I would like to box this off because it’s getting too much and i'm finding it hard to breathe generally. Which was the original problem years ago. - Also, I only get concerned about it when i'm not keeping myself busy, but hopefully that shouldn't be a reason to avoid it, I just have a feeling something isn't right.  Thankyou for reading 0 likes, 1 reply "

And I’m usually so stern, but sometimes I get drunk, and because I have a history of doing it, it’s not out of this world like it would be to a non drug user, and I just joined in the fun. Now since then, I’ve been aware of my nose and have been a bit concerned, I've been looking at my nose, and I’m frankly paranoid now, there’s been white scabbing around the nostril for a while, but also it’s around my ears, so I hope its some form of psoriasis. I’ve been very busy and not been eating too well for the past few weeks so I’m hoping my diet is bringing this out. However, I am very aware of my nose being there too, if that makes sense, it feels heavy, and it’s almost as if someone has just put a fake nose on my face.n  There is also a slight whistle when I breathe which I understand is septal damage, it feels cold on one side when I breathe in, and there are cyst type things inside the nostil, it’s also often blocked but that is nothing new, it’s always blocked. And I’m concerned the nostril have slightly collapsed and become pricked at the tip, also when I took some pictures of my nose in harsh light it looks flattened and quite weak - fat on the bridge and bulbous at the tip, but because it’s occupied alot of my time and I suffer from ADHD and what i'd describe as feelings of depression anxiety, especially since being unemployed for the past year and trying to piece together a living as a freelancer. I’m thinking I’m just being worried, inattentive to the general changes in my appearance and paranoid, but I can’t get my mind of it, because anyone else would probably tell you it’s fine. It’s really getting to me and I want a conclusion. As I said, I’m not too vain, and I never wanted this ‘new nose’, which I worry has lost some of my character anyway, I suppose I’ll just get now with that, but I’m extremely annoyed at the surgeon, and would even consider taking him to court for doing what I now know is a septorhinoplasty, not a septoplasty which I wanted. (It was done through insurance so I didn’t pay a penny). I want to know more, or at least find someone to talk to, because I have nobody, and it’s causing me a alot of worry because it's my nose, on my face. I find doctors in the past haver mostly been unhelpful, but I’d need to sign up anyway if I wanted to see one. I’m usually so healthy and fit, but this past year my nose has been a problem, I’ve been very stressed and my hair has been thinning and falling out at an alarming rate and i've got psoriasis on my ears, and I also want to find some reassurance and find out whether all this is something I should be concerned about or not, or can deal with, or whether it’s all the sign of something else. I will 100% not be snorting drugs ever again that’s for sure, and I’m quite confident I can quite smoking, as long as I don’t drink. However I do exercise a lot, practice yoga and run, and I’m trying to overcome my mental debilitating as best as possible (very impulsive and unfocssed). My final thought is surely you have to abuse cocaine for it to damage your nose? I really have never abused it. Am I just being paranoid, but what are the white crusts around the nostril? Why the whistling? Why the uncomfortability ? has the nose changed shape since the operation ? What are these cyst type things in the nose? I can’t figure it all out. I would be so grateful to hear from someone who for some reason has the time or knowledge to help, or at least point me in the right direction. I understand health problems arise, and I’m fine getting on with it. But I would like to box this off because it’s getting too much and i'm finding it hard to breathe generally. Which was the original problem years ago. - Also, I only get concerned about it when i'm not keeping myself busy, but hopefully that shouldn't be a reason to avoid it, I just have a feeling something isn't right.  Thankyou for reading 0 likes, 1 reply "

What to do?,"Hi there, I’d like to start by saying thank you for reading this, it’s quite long and it’s a convoluted problem that I can’t get my head around. I don’t wish to be seen as complaining, but it’s really causing me stress and depression now. Although I’m a relatively cautious person, I have a history of drinking, smoking and nasal drug use. I’ve had patches of heavy drinking and smoking, but they were always social. I just did them because others did around me. I would never ever have found myself with a drink/drug problem and needing to do them all alone, so doing so seemed fine enough whilst I was younger. I had trouble breathing a few years ago, and found I had a deviated septum, which I think I’d had for quite a few years, I saw a doctor because I couldn't breathe (worried I had sleep apnoea). I had an operation, a septorhinplasty, it seemed ok, but the problems didn’t stop. Though I didn’t do many at the time, I’m worried that continuing to do drugs deviated the septum again, as I’ve noticed in pictures after the surgery the inside bridge became quite visible through one nostril and I don’t imagine the surgeon would have left it like that (i’m quite a laissez faire person so I’m not monitoring my appearance at every oportunity). I am very active person so do a lot of strenuous activities like running, boxing and climbing, and i'm genrally just quite ADHD,  I also notice I began to touch and pick my nose alot, and although I was doing drugs, I really I wasn’t doing many at all, however I didn’t think of this at the time, because I’ve never had a ‘problem’. People who have problems do it for years and develop habits, I know them, and I see their plight. However, looking back I realise that the nose is so much more sensitive than I realised, and I should have avoided it at all costs forever. Nobody advised me on healing time following the surgery, but it's my own fault. Though the surgeon didn’t seem to notice any change  following the first one when I had a second surgery. So, I’m just hoping it’s my own anxiety. I eventually had another operation of march last year to fix further problems of having to breathe through my mouth, and this one was very painful, for over a week I couldn’t breathe and was awake each and every night in agonising pain. Now, apart from functional problems which is my real concern, I’m getting some (hopefully irrational) anxiety about the shape of my new nose. I didn’t realise it would be so cosmetic, but the bridge is completely straightened out, which I’m extremely annoyed about and the tip seems to have a bulb at the end, I can see how he has reshaped the exterior of my nose and I don't think it works. I just wanted to breathe better, I didn’t want to look like a new person but because this surgeon was so relaxed, I worry that he didn’t lay it out to me straight or ask what I wanted. I’ve begun to be even more annoyed because although I’ve never thought about it until now, although I’m not so vain, I liked my big curved nose, it was part of my character and my family, now I’ve got a nice new straight nose, and I didn't ask for that, it’s not worrying to my health, but it's been added to the weight of this problem because it's not me. Since the operation 1 year and 6 months ago, I’ve stupidly sniffed cocaine about 4-5 nights but never in a marathon way, and the first time was 3 full months after the operation. I’d given up going out, and my life has become more introverted which I don’t mind, but the only friends I really have seem to sniff cocaine alot, it’s a real epidemic in young people in cities and universities, and I’ve said NO so many times. But I went to visit friends about 3 months after the operation at a festival. I felt out of place because I’d left my Job in music through burnout and then had had a real experience with this operation and was left jobless. When I’d got a bit drunk on the first night one friend sort of gestured quite strongly for me to have some of his stuff, I think quite innocently, as they don’t know the extent of the difficulties I’ve had with my nose, and me being drunk and agreeable I eventually gave in, after saying no for quite a while, but I think their thinking is that I’m not having having fun because I’m not joining in. I absolutely hate sheep mentality, which is another story. Now these aren’t ‘bad ‘people, they are are actually great, just young people like me who perhaps don’t understand the negative effects of cocaine, because literally everyone is doing it. I hated myself for doing it, and immediately had worry about my nose and thought I could feel it, this is why I think it might be irrational. I spent the next night of the festival in bed and left the festival early on the third day. The other times I ended up doing it on a couple of nights out when I was drunk with some old school friends who work in the city. I hate myself for it. I never really liked cocaine anyway, I don’t get it at all and think it turns people into painfully boring and embarrassing egotistical blabber boxes, and it's so expensive.

I want to know more, or at least find someone to talk to, because I have nobody, and it’s causing me a alot of worry because it's my nose, on my face. I find doctors in the past haver mostly been unhelpful, but I’d need to sign up anyway if I wanted to see one. I’m usually so healthy and fit, but this past year my nose has been a problem, I’ve been very stressed and my hair has been thinning and falling out at an alarming rate and i've got psoriasis on my ears, and I also want to find some reassurance and find out whether all this is something I should be concerned about or not, or can deal with, or whether it’s all the sign of something else. I will 100% not be snorting drugs ever again that’s for sure, and I’m quite confident I can quite smoking, as long as I don’t drink. However I do exercise a lot, practice yoga and run, and I’m trying to overcome my mental debilitating as best as possible (very impulsive and unfocssed). My final thought is surely you have to abuse cocaine for it to damage your nose? I really have never abused it. Am I just being paranoid, but what are the white crusts around the nostril? Why the whistling? Why the uncomfortability ? has the nose changed shape since the operation ? What are these cyst type things in the nose? I can’t figure it all out. I would be so grateful to hear from someone who for some reason has the time or knowledge to help, or at least point me in the right direction. I understand health problems arise, and I’m fine getting on with it. But I would like to box this off because it’s getting too much and i'm finding it hard to breathe generally. Which was the original problem years ago. - Also, I only get concerned about it when i'm not keeping myself busy, but hopefully that shouldn't be a reason to avoid it, I just have a feeling something isn't right.  Thankyou for reading 0 likes, 1 reply "

What to do?,"Hi there, I’d like to start by saying thank you for reading this, it’s quite long and it’s a convoluted problem that I can’t get my head around. I don’t wish to be seen as complaining, but it’s really causing me stress and depression now. Although I’m a relatively cautious person, I have a history of drinking, smoking and nasal drug use. I’ve had patches of heavy drinking and smoking, but they were always social. I just did them because others did around me. I would never ever have found myself with a drink/drug problem and needing to do them all alone, so doing so seemed fine enough whilst I was younger. I had trouble breathing a few years ago, and found I had a deviated septum, which I think I’d had for quite a few years, I saw a doctor because I couldn't breathe (worried I had sleep apnoea). I had an operation, a septorhinplasty, it seemed ok, but the problems didn’t stop. Though I didn’t do many at the time, I’m worried that continuing to do drugs deviated the septum again, as I’ve noticed in pictures after the surgery the inside bridge became quite visible through one nostril and I don’t imagine the surgeon would have left it like that (i’m quite a laissez faire person so I’m not monitoring my appearance at every oportunity). I am very active person so do a lot of strenuous activities like running, boxing and climbing, and i'm genrally just quite ADHD,  I also notice I began to touch and pick my nose alot, and although I was doing drugs, I really I wasn’t doing many at all, however I didn’t think of this at the time, because I’ve never had a ‘problem’. People who have problems do it for years and develop habits, I know them, and I see their plight. However, looking back I realise that the nose is so much more sensitive than I realised, and I should have avoided it at all costs forever. Nobody advised me on healing time following the surgery, but it's my own fault. Though the surgeon didn’t seem to notice any change  following the first one when I had a second surgery. So, I’m just hoping it’s my own anxiety. I eventually had another operation of march last year to fix further problems of having to breathe through my mouth, and this one was very painful, for over a week I couldn’t breathe and was awake each and every night in agonising pain. Now, apart from functional problems which is my real concern, I’m getting some (hopefully irrational) anxiety about the shape of my new nose. I didn’t realise it would be so cosmetic, but the bridge is completely straightened out, which I’m extremely annoyed about and the tip seems to have a bulb at the end, I can see how he has reshaped the exterior of my nose and I don't think it works. I just wanted to breathe better, I didn’t want to look like a new person but because this surgeon was so relaxed, I worry that he didn’t lay it out to me straight or ask what I wanted. I’ve begun to be even more annoyed because although I’ve never thought about it until now, although I’m not so vain, I liked my big curved nose, it was part of my character and my family, now I’ve got a nice new straight nose, and I didn't ask for that, it’s not worrying to my health, but it's been added to the weight of this problem because it's not me. Since the operation 1 year and 6 months ago, I’ve stupidly sniffed cocaine about 4-5 nights but never in a marathon way, and the first time was 3 full months after the operation. I’d given up going out, and my life has become more introverted which I don’t mind, but the only friends I really have seem to sniff cocaine alot, it’s a real epidemic in young people in cities and universities, and I’ve said NO so many times. But I went to visit friends about 3 months after the operation at a festival. I felt out of place because I’d left my Job in music through burnout and then had had a real experience with this operation and was left jobless. When I’d got a bit drunk on the first night one friend sort of gestured quite strongly for me to have some of his stuff, I think quite innocently, as they don’t know the extent of the difficulties I’ve had with my nose, and me being drunk and agreeable I eventually gave in, after saying no for quite a while, but I think their thinking is that I’m not having having fun because I’m not joining in. I absolutely hate sheep mentality, which is another story. Now these aren’t ‘bad ‘people, they are are actually great, just young people like me who perhaps don’t understand the negative effects of cocaine, because literally everyone is doing it. I hated myself for doing it, and immediately had worry about my nose and thought I could feel it, this is why I think it might be irrational. I spent the next night of the festival in bed and left the festival early on the third day. The other times I ended up doing it on a couple of nights out when I was drunk with some old school friends who work in the city. I hate myself for it. I never really liked cocaine anyway, I don’t get it at all and think it turns people into painfully boring and embarrassing egotistical blabber boxes, and it's so expensive. But people were giving it to me, and I ended up buying some after getting a taste for it on this particular night, we were having fun I suppose. Then, last week I got worried. I’d done much less than 1 gram of it whilst on a stag do the other week, and I’d said no for the first night, but literally everyone was doing it on the second, so I bought one. And I’m usually so stern, but sometimes I get drunk, and because I have a history of doing it, it’s not out of this world like it would be to a non drug user, and I just joined in the fun. Now since then, I’ve been aware of my nose and have been a bit concerned, I've been looking at my nose, and I’m frankly paranoid now, there’s been white scabbing around the nostril for a while, but also it’s around my ears, so I hope its some form of psoriasis. I’ve been very busy and not been eating too well for the past few weeks so I’m hoping my diet is bringing this out. However, I am very aware of my nose being there too, if that makes sense, it feels heavy, and it’s almost as if someone has just put a fake nose on my face.n  There is also a slight whistle when I breathe which I understand is septal damage, it feels cold on one side when I breathe in, and there are cyst type things inside the nostil, it’s also often blocked but that is nothing new, it’s always blocked. And I’m concerned the nostril have slightly collapsed and become pricked at the tip, also when I took some pictures of my nose in harsh light it looks flattened and quite weak - fat on the bridge and bulbous at the tip, but because it’s occupied alot of my time and I suffer from ADHD and what i'd describe as feelings of depression anxiety, especially since being unemployed for the past year and trying to piece together a living as a freelancer. I’m thinking I’m just being worried, inattentive to the general changes in my appearance and paranoid, but I can’t get my mind of it, because anyone else would probably tell you it’s fine. It’s really getting to me and I want a conclusion. As I said, I’m not too vain, and I never wanted this ‘new nose’, which I worry has lost some of my character anyway, I suppose I’ll just get now with that, but I’m extremely annoyed at the surgeon, and would even consider taking him to court for doing what I now know is a septorhinoplasty, not a septoplasty which I wanted.

This has been occurring year round, and I think it seems to be location-independent. In the past 10 years, I've lived in California, Colorado, Michigan, Texas, and spent extensive time in the UK, Italy, and China, and have not noticed any difference. I've seen the following specialist doctors: (1) Pulmonologist (2) ENTs (3) Nerve Doctor (4) Allergist I was told that the issues can be due to 3 things: (1) Rhinitis (allergic & non-allergic) (2) Acid reflux (3)  . (3) was thrown out because I took asthmamedication, which didn't help, and I didn't have any other symptoms of asthma. I also took a breathing testing in a controlled lab, which ended up being normal. I am thinking it could be a combination of allergic & non-allergic rhinitis, along with acid reflux (maybe GERD or LPR). My excessive mucus, while always there, are typically worse after eating. Pretty much after eating anything, I would feel excess mucus production. But I have tried many acid reflux medication such as omeprazole, pantoprazole, and some OTC medication that I don't recall the name. They didn't help at all. I don't have any other symptoms typical of GERD/LPR such as wheezing and heartburn. I do have seasonal allergies in the fall. The symptoms associated with my seasonal allergies are different and result in my sneezing a lot, very runny nose, watery and itchy eyes, etc... I have been tested for allergies, and I tested positive to: weed pollen, dust mites, mold, grass, dogs, cats. But allergy medication and steroids such as flonase, nasacort, ipratropium bromide, astelin, montelukast, zyrtec, claritin have not helped at all. Even though the above allergy medication didn't work, which might suggest the mucus isn't due to allergic-rhinitis, my allergist said it could be that I just don't respond to those medication, but may respond better to immunotherapy, which I decided to start this coming September. I had an endoscopy done by an ENT, and they could definitely see that the mucus is from post-nasal drip. But post-nasal drip can be caused by allergic & non-allergic rhinitis and acid reflux.

I don’t seem to have symptoms such as running nose, itchy eyes, sneezing, coughing...etc, but seems that I have the post nasal drip sensation most of the time, it’s like a lump or a mucus around my throat that I can neither swallow down nor cough out, sometimes good sometimes bad. These are my background.  Since 4 days ago, right before my period started(don’t know if they are relevent tho) all of a sudden the symptom became very severe. The “mucus thing” seems to be stuck at a very uncomfortable location(right in between of my nasal cavity and my throat) it’s like too much discomfort and you can hardly ignore it...I swallow all the time but it never really go down and even if it does it comes back right after...and my mouth and throat became extremely dry with no saliva at all. This is ruining my life and I haven’t had a proper meal for 4 days...because everytime I tried to swallow I feel the food stuck in between my back throat and my nasal cavity, along with the mucus, and it doesn’t go down smoothly, I even have a feeling that food partially went up to my nose instead of going down. I know this can’t happen and it’s against your body design, but whenever I had this feeling I couldn’t swallow anymore food even like congee. I feel I could choke or something if something stuck in there. I went to my family doc today and he just thinks it’s caused by allergy and he sees irritation in my back throat. He gave me antibiotics and saline nasal spray. I told him I have some trouble swallowing and he ended up giving me Sandoz Ondansetron ODT which is for controlling the nausea and vomiting feeling, but I don’t have those symptoms so really don’t know if that’s gonna do anything......I will go see an ENT for further test maybe using a endoscope to see what’s going on. By the way, I used Apo-mometasone and Fluticasone furoate nasal sprays in the past month and stopped using them 2 days ago. It is seriously ruining my life...I loved eating and now I feel so nervous and stressful with eating. I’m hungry but just can’t eat for 3 days. I used to love all those outdoor activities but now I’m just totally in the dark and rather go sleeping because only when I’m asleep I don’t feel anything...what’s going on? Can post nasal drip cause those feelings at all?  Please if anyone ever suffering from similar problem like I do...share it with me if you have any way to get better.

At first I thought people around me were just acting strange but then I slowly came to realize that I might actually have BO.    This happens to me every single time so can't be a coincidence right? Problem is I'm too scared to ask any of my friends if I smell bad because it'll just be awkward. It took a lot of effort to just ask my family if I do or not, but everyone in my family said I don't smell like anything. Though my brother has told me about my bad breath. Honestly I've been so paranoid of how I smell in public I'm always avoiding people or keeping a distance from my friends. Obviously I won't be able to smell my own BO but there are some smells I can smell from me.   Idk if this is normal but maybe its some sort of digestive problem. This might possibly be related to me sweating almost instantly after eating pineapples or any other sweets like starbursts and skittles. One last thing to mention is that I can smell the smell from my armpits (curry like smell) so why can't I smell other smells from my body (or maybe I don't have very serious bo?) As you can tell, i'm really paranoid about how I smell... I think i'm going insane.   I don't think my mum knows how to wash towels properly because they always have this weird musty smell or they smell too much of detergent or whatever its called. (i've also complained about not buying new towels because we've been using the same towels for 4 years (some for 6 years) Why do I think it might be the towels? Well i guess rubbing something that smells on your body could make your body smell too and my brother also told me that some of his friends told him he smells of bo and I highly doubt my whole f*****g family has bo lol. Now on to my breath... I'm actually not too concerned about my breath but there is one thing that I don't understand.   I might not be as paranoid of how my breath smells compared to my bo because I know how my breath smells but it still annoys me. 0 likes, 2 replies "

When I get a cold it gets 10x worse. The mucus builds up to the point that it feels like it moves around and blocks my nasal passages so I can’t breath. Blowing normally does nothing to help. Eventually it will get so big it will drop now my throat making me gag and want to throw up!  Recently I’ve found that if I can make myself sneeze several times (by sticking tissue up my nose at tickling my nostril) to loosen it then I can blow it out. When I do get it out it’s a big 2p size blob of thick browny yellow mucus and tissue. It’s honestly the most figuring thing I’ve seen and due to the size I get why I gag and can’t breathe.  Has anyone experienced this or have a solution to stop it? I’ve been to my doctor and they just give me beconase nasal spray which does nothing.  Thanks 0 likes, 42 replies "

Pain has been minimal, but I have completely lost my ability to smell and taste. Many medical articles I've read have reassured me that this is common after surgery, but I have no sense of smell and taste, LITERALLY 0%, I probably couldn't even smell gasoline. What's really strange though is that hours after the surgery, I could taste just fine. A nurse brought me a orange popsicle and I could taste it just fine. After getting home, I ate some chocolate ice cream and I couldn't finish eating it becasue of how rich in flavor it was. So I could taste hours after the surgery, but by the evening, as I was eating dinner with my family, I couldn't taste at all. What could this mean? Three days have passed and I have no sense of smell or taste. It's gotten worse actually becasue yesterday I could still smell my perfume and a few other scents and now I really can't smell anything. I can't taste anything, not even raw sugar or potent spices. I have no desire to eat, the inability to taste freaks me out so much. Another thing I would like to mention is that while I have no sense of taste or smell, I have this constant yucky taste lingering in my mouth. It tastes like disgusting medicine and metal. What does this mean? I think it may be related to the antibiotics, since in the past, antibiotics have given me a metallic taste in my mouth and I've also experienced a temporary 50% decrease in smell from antibiotics about a year ago. Is it really necessary to take antibiotics after surgery? They just give me such bad side effects... I know I'm probably overreacting, but it's all just really scary. I know the reason why I can't smell is probably related to swelling, inflammation, the antibiotics, and congestion, but is it really normal to have a COMPLETE loss of smell and taste after surgery? I just turned 16 recently and I can't imagine living several decades without being able to taste a single bite of food.....I'd rather not live. Pathetic, I know, but I'm so sad about this, I've been crying nonstop, I want to be able to smell, I want to be able to taste chocolate and smell coffee.  I wouldn't be so worried if I still had a partial ability to smell, but I have no sense of smell at all. I wouldn't be as worried if it improved after being able to breathe through my nose, I was so congested, I thought that was the reason I couldn't smell, but after using decongestant spray, I can breathe through my nose, but I still have zero sense of smell. What could have gone wrong? Why could I smell and taste right after surgery, but not several hours later? Could there have been any sort of nerve damage?? I remember waking up and having intense burning in my nose, did something happen? I'm doing everything my doctor told me to do, I'm rinsing my nose with saline water 3 times a day and applying an antibiotic ointment. My doctor has been performing this surgery every week for nearly 20 years, so he has lots of experience. I just don't understand what's happening...I didn't know that the last meal I ate the night before the surgery could have been the last meal I'd ever taste... For anyone who's bothered to read this to this point, thank you so much. If you have had sinus surgery before, did you lose your sense of smell and taste? How long did it take for it to come back? How did you cope in the meantime? According to my research, it can take several weeks for smell and taste to come back, sometimes months, and post-surgical swelling can exist up to a year after surgery....What are the chances that this complete loss of smell and taste is permanent??? Is it really normal to have NO sense of smell after sinus surgery?  I'm sorry this turned into one long rant, I have given more details that I probably needed to give.

Every single day, I feel extremely congested, especially, in my right nostril. I have already had 2 surgeries to reduce the size of my right inferior turbinate. I am still experiencing great difficulty breathing, and I frequently feel painful pressure in my right nostril. The pain is so bad that it causes me to miss work. I believe that my difficulty breathing is caused by an enlarged right inferior turbinate and that the pressure and pain is caused by an enlarged right middle turbinate. It is very frustrating because when I go to doctors, they say that my nose looks fine and that my turbinates don't appear enlarged. I belive that my turbinates are primarily swelling up at night and perhaps because blood is rushing to my head when I lie down. This makes it very difficult to prove to a doctor after being vertical all day. I have tried many OTC medications to try to treat this issue, and the only thing that had any noticable impact was Afrin, which I do not want to use because it causes rebound congestion and can cause septum perforations. I stopped using Afrin in April. The fact that it provided temporary (intense) relief supports the theory that my problems are caused my enlarged turbinates because Afrin shrinks the blood vessels in the turbinates and shrinks the turbinates themselves. My understanding is that rebound congestion from Afrin should not last very long so I don't think that I my nose should still be rebounding from Afrin after not using it for 3 months. I do not believe that this is an allergey issue because I bought an air purifier, thoroughly cleaned my house, and used Flonase for multiple weeks. None of this has any noticable impact on my nasal problems whatsoever. What's very odd about my issue is that it changes throughout the day. I researched the ""nasal cycle"" which states that your nose alternates blood flow form the left to the right turbinates throughout the day. Most people should not notice this, but I definitely do. When the right turbinates are big, I have the issues with extreme congestion and pain on the right side. When the turbinates on the left side get big, it restricts breathing a bit, but is not so bad. When the left turbinates are swollen, I can breathe well on the right side.  I am somewhat at my wit's end trying to figure out what to do because doctors keep reassuring me that my turbinates look fine when I talked to them in person. It has been difficult to coordinate an appointment when my right turbinates are big during their nasal cycle. So, I bought an endoscope on  to see exactly what's going on in there. I'm thinking if I show the following attached 2 pictures to a doctor, that will prove to them that my turbinates do in fact have a problem. I took these pictures when my right side felt swollen, big, painful, and my breathing felt obstruced. The first picture is of my inferior turbinate.It looks like one large pink mass against another large pink mass with a thin line between the two (less than 1mm wide). My inferior turbinate is on the left of this picture and my septum is on the right of this picture. The second picture is of my middle turbinate. The circular mass in the middle is my middle turbinate. My septum is on the right of this picture. The middle turbinate is actually touching my septum. I took another picture of the middle turbinate an hour later where I felt that I could breathe better, and I noticed that the middle turbinate was no longer touching the septum. Do my middle turbinate and inferior turbinate look enlarged? Is it normal for the middle turbinate to touch the septum?  I'm a bit afraid of showing these pictures to a doctor because they might be unhappy that I put an endoscope in my nose and tried to diagnose myself, but I have been to 6-7 ENT's regarding this issue and had 2 surgeries already over the past 4 years, and I still cannot breathe correctly. 0 likes, 22 replies "

They put metal over the already fused bone to fuse it more, then put bone shaved off my hip over it. I've seen an orthopedic surgeon, a pain clinic, my regular doctor and a chiropractor and nothing and no one seems to be able to help whatsoever. I'm a little desperate right now...) 0 likes, 0 replies "

For the last three years i have battled with what seemed like just   although the pain did bot necessarily stem from my neck-  it is my lower portion down from my neck about center to the right side of my shoulder that is a constant piercing pain that never leaves.  All of my pain comes from the right side of my body never the left. Sometimes the top of my shoulder even feels bruised to the touch. My hand goes to sleep a lot and i often lose feeling in both my pinky and ring finger. I have been under a doctors care for the last year after running extensive tests ( xrays, MRI) to be told theres some degenerative disk disease and most likely (in my opinion) a pinched nerve. They have treated me with tramadol for pain and gabapentin along with a muscle relaxer and trazadone for sleep. I have attempted every option except surgery and  epidurals.  My first pain management appointment is in JULY due to the fact my medications are no longer helping. Not sure what to expect from that... I use stretching techiniques, a chiroprator and even professional massages. My quality of life is horrible. I have three children who i want so desperately to enjoy life with but due to my pain i seen to find myself disconnected and tired all of the time. I have noticed myself slipping into some form of  . I have always been active but due to the pain i no longer desire to exercise or move much more than whats necessary. i think just hearing from other people and their experiences will help me. Chronic pain can be so lonely. Not only has it affected me but my  husband.  I want so badly to snap out of this and resolve back some kind of normalcy of life. How do you cope? What has worked for you? Im a believer and believe strongly in prayer so my faith has helped me greatly but find myself very low and hopeless in this battle.

My condition might actually be very common, but I’m certainly not getting any treatment that is helping so far… I’m 37 and working as a graphic designer so obviously I spend a lot of time sitting in front of the computer. For the past 9 years (since 2011) I’ve been having chronic pain in the neck and it’s gotten so bad that I have to take sick days more and more often. At least once a week I’m unable to sit at the desk at all. Reason I’m writing on this forum is that I’ve been dealing with doctors for the past 2 years unsuccessfully - they’ve been prescribing physiotherapies and medications that absolutely did nothing, so I’m really desperate at this point. I’ll do my best to describe everything in detail so you can have complete insight into the problem. I’ll also attach some images for illustrative purposes, as well as my MRI results. Now, let me describe everything in order and in detail: FIRST OCCURRENCE: In 2011 I was working on a design project which involved using a new software with a lot of very tiny details on my monitor, so I was spending too much time in a forward head posture (“Image 1”). After a second day I started to feel tension and pain in the back of my neck from this kind of strain, but I dismissed it thinking it’s just temporary reaction to the volume of work I’ve been doing. Unfortunately, that kind of feeling never actually went away, apart from occasional periods of stability, but those are being more rare as the years go by. DESCRIPTION OF PAIN: If you already read about the first occurrence, then you can imagine what kind of feeling it is, but I’ll try to illustrate it more accurately since it’s not exactly a “pain” in the most common sense. Have a look at the “Image 2” and imagine you’re laying on bed on your stomach, but your head is not touching the bed and you have to hold it in illustrated upright position for a couple of minutes - sort of like an endurance test. Well, you can imagine what kind of feeling you would get in the back of your neck - not exactly a pain, more like a tension and feeling of restlessness because you’re not taking any break from this uncomfortable position. If I take a different part of the body for another example - like shoulder - you would get the same feeling if you were holding a weight (like dumbbell - “Image 3”) with your arm fully extended in front of you and not being allowed to lower it - after a while your shoulder would be overloaded and you would have the same feeling of pain/tension/restlessness in the shoulder as well. Now, in both of these examples - as soon as you are “released” from the uncomfortable position you would start to feel an immediate relief, and after a couple of minutes that part of the body that was overloaded would return to normal condition. Well, in my case once that feeling appears in the neck it won’t go away no matter what I do - even laying down to rest doesn’t help, the pain is still there for hours and I usually can’t fall asleep because of it. ESCALATION OF THE SENSATION: Once it starts to appear the pain has its phases with different symptoms in different parts of the neck. It always starts in the back of the neck (somewhere between C3 and C5 vertebrae) and a little bit to the right (“Image 4 - A”). Then, the same feeling (please refer to “Description of Pain”) will extend to the right side of my neck (“Image 4 - B”). The third and final stage is when that pain extends to the front/right side of my neck, accompanied by a feeling of slight pressure - like someone is lightly pressing their fingers against my Adam’s apple (“Image 4 - C”). At this last stage the pain is so overwhelming and persistent that no kind of rest will make it go away. I usually have to sedate myself with sleeping pills if I want to fall asleep. The ONLY thing that helps a bit is to start walking and the pain will gradually (but not completely) start to subside. But, of course this is not a solution if it’s night time and I have to go to sleep. ESCALATION OF OTHER SYMPTOMS: Although the symptoms described above have been consistent for the past 9 years, there are additional symptoms which started to appear in the last year. The first one is when I’m horizontally rotating my head from left side to the right side - I get a sudden and painful feeling of something being pinched in the area between neck and shoulder on the right side (“Image 5”). When that happens I instantly and instinctively bring my head to the previous position and then repeat the rotation but much more slowly so it doesn’t happen again. The other symptom is when I’m tilting my head from left to right - there are very unpleasant and a bit painful “clicks” (like when you’re cracking the joints on your knuckles) (“Image 6”). None of these symptoms happen when I’m rotating my head in the opposite direction - from right to left, or tilting the head from right to left. WHAT I TRIED AND DIDN’T HELP: WHAT DID (AND DOES) HELP: CONCLUSION FROM DOCTORS SO FAR: MRI shows no problems with spinal cord, no pinched nerves, etc. The general consensus is that my cervical spine looks “ok” for my age. Of course, this is an opinion only from one doctor (and a very uninterested one I might add), so I’ll look for second opinion. I did an MRI last month (in December 2019) and that’s the one you can see here: [b]Link removed[/b] I was worried about the appearance of discs in the neck - they are almost black (“Image 7”), but I was told by a doctor (an orthopedist) that that’s normal for my age (?). Is this really how it should be? Also, I have to mention this - I did an MRI a year ago and the discs weren’t dark like this, and this past year is also when I started getting those “clicks” and other unpleasant grinding noises in my neck - so, could the (suspected) degeneration of discs contribute to these audible symptoms (clicks and pinches in images 5 and 6)? I’ve been prescribed a new physiotherapy and that’s my next step, but as I said - I’m just afraid it’s going to be a dead end like before. OPEN QUESTIONS: Apart from trying to get a proper diagnosis obviously, my biggest question actually is: Is this pain related to problems with muscle tissue or bone tissue (spine)? I’m constantly suspecting that it’s related to muscle tissues because I already mentioned that muscle relaxant medications actually help with the symptoms. And IF it is muscle tissue then what exactly?? - Like, is there a specific part of a specific muscle (or other soft tissue like tendons, etc.) that’s torn, sprained, or something else. How to diagnose it properly? I’m a little bit tired of being treated without a proper diagnosis and wasting time on all these appointments with doctors who are very uninterested in my case. If anyone has/had similar issues, or has an idea what to look for here specifically I would be extremely appreciated! Thanks everyone, especially for the patience in reading this post!

DESCRIPTION OF PAIN: If you already read about the first occurrence, then you can imagine what kind of feeling it is, but I’ll try to illustrate it more accurately since it’s not exactly a “pain” in the most common sense. Have a look at the “Image 2” and imagine you’re laying on bed on your stomach, but your head is not touching the bed and you have to hold it in illustrated upright position for a couple of minutes - sort of like an endurance test. Well, you can imagine what kind of feeling you would get in the back of your neck - not exactly a pain, more like a tension and feeling of restlessness because you’re not taking any break from this uncomfortable position. If I take a different part of the body for another example - like shoulder - you would get the same feeling if you were holding a weight (like dumbbell - “Image 3”) with your arm fully extended in front of you and not being allowed to lower it - after a while your shoulder would be overloaded and you would have the same feeling of pain/tension/restlessness in the shoulder as well. Now, in both of these examples - as soon as you are “released” from the uncomfortable position you would start to feel an immediate relief, and after a couple of minutes that part of the body that was overloaded would return to normal condition. Well, in my case once that feeling appears in the neck it won’t go away no matter what I do - even laying down to rest doesn’t help, the pain is still there for hours and I usually can’t fall asleep because of it. ESCALATION OF THE SENSATION: Once it starts to appear the pain has its phases with different symptoms in different parts of the neck. It always starts in the back of the neck (somewhere between C3 and C5 vertebrae) and a little bit to the right (“Image 4 - A”). Then, the same feeling (please refer to “Description of Pain”) will extend to the right side of my neck (“Image 4 - B”). The third and final stage is when that pain extends to the front/right side of my neck, accompanied by a feeling of slight pressure - like someone is lightly pressing their fingers against my Adam’s apple (“Image 4 - C”). At this last stage the pain is so overwhelming and persistent that no kind of rest will make it go away. I usually have to sedate myself with sleeping pills if I want to fall asleep. The ONLY thing that helps a bit is to start walking and the pain will gradually (but not completely) start to subside. But, of course this is not a solution if it’s night time and I have to go to sleep. ESCALATION OF OTHER SYMPTOMS: Although the symptoms described above have been consistent for the past 9 years, there are additional symptoms which started to appear in the last year. The first one is when I’m horizontally rotating my head from left side to the right side - I get a sudden and painful feeling of something being pinched in the area between neck and shoulder on the right side (“Image 5”). When that happens I instantly and instinctively bring my head to the previous position and then repeat the rotation but much more slowly so it doesn’t happen again. The other symptom is when I’m tilting my head from left to right - there are very unpleasant and a bit painful “clicks” (like when you’re cracking the joints on your knuckles) (“Image 6”). None of these symptoms happen when I’m rotating my head in the opposite direction - from right to left, or tilting the head from right to left. WHAT I TRIED AND DIDN’T HELP: WHAT DID (AND DOES) HELP: CONCLUSION FROM DOCTORS SO FAR: MRI shows no problems with spinal cord, no pinched nerves, etc. The general consensus is that my cervical spine looks “ok” for my age. Of course, this is an opinion only from one doctor (and a very uninterested one I might add), so I’ll look for second opinion. I did an MRI last month (in December 2019) and that’s the one you can see here: [b]Link removed[/b] I was worried about the appearance of discs in the neck - they are almost black (“Image 7”), but I was told by a doctor (an orthopedist) that that’s normal for my age (?). Is this really how it should be? Also, I have to mention this - I did an MRI a year ago and the discs weren’t dark like this, and this past year is also when I started getting those “clicks” and other unpleasant grinding noises in my neck - so, could the (suspected) degeneration of discs contribute to these audible symptoms (clicks and pinches in images 5 and 6)? I’ve been prescribed a new physiotherapy and that’s my next step, but as I said - I’m just afraid it’s going to be a dead end like before. OPEN QUESTIONS: Apart from trying to get a proper diagnosis obviously, my biggest question actually is: Is this pain related to problems with muscle tissue or bone tissue (spine)? I’m constantly suspecting that it’s related to muscle tissues because I already mentioned that muscle relaxant medications actually help with the symptoms. And IF it is muscle tissue then what exactly?? - Like, is there a specific part of a specific muscle (or other soft tissue like tendons, etc.) that’s torn, sprained, or something else. How to diagnose it properly? I’m a little bit tired of being treated without a proper diagnosis and wasting time on all these appointments with doctors who are very uninterested in my case. If anyone has/had similar issues, or has an idea what to look for here specifically I would be extremely appreciated! Thanks everyone, especially for the patience in reading this post!

My condition might actually be very common, but I’m certainly not getting any treatment that is helping so far… I’m 37 and working as a graphic designer so obviously I spend a lot of time sitting in front of the computer. For the past 9 years (since 2011) I’ve been having chronic pain in the neck and it’s gotten so bad that I have to take sick days more and more often. At least once a week I’m unable to sit at the desk at all. Reason I’m writing on this forum is that I’ve been dealing with doctors for the past 2 years unsuccessfully - they’ve been prescribing physiotherapies and medications that absolutely did nothing, so I’m really desperate at this point. I’ll do my best to describe everything in detail so you can have complete insight into the problem. I’ll also attach some images for illustrative purposes, as well as my MRI results. Now, let me describe everything in order and in detail: FIRST OCCURRENCE: In 2011 I was working on a design project which involved using a new software with a lot of very tiny details on my monitor, so I was spending too much time in a forward head posture (“Image 1”). After a second day I started to feel tension and pain in the back of my neck from this kind of strain, but I dismissed it thinking it’s just temporary reaction to the volume of work I’ve been doing. Unfortunately, that kind of feeling never actually went away, apart from occasional periods of stability, but those are being more rare as the years go by.

However having had an MRI, an MRA , and doppler bloodflow , there are no indications of a restriction anywhere. There are many symptoms, the main one being a long term lightheaded which has been increasing for maybe four years to the extent that it is now difficult to walk more than a few yards without the need to hold the wall, so making me housebound. I have twice visited Ear/Nose/Throat specialists who say that the problem is not in their area of expertise - and I do not have vertigo. The only time when the symptoms are reduced is when I lay down, but return with a vengeance when I get up again. I am presently attending a physiotherapist to carry out the Cawthorne Cooksey exercises, but I have my doubts that these will tackle the core problem. The lack of any provable diagnosis, and hence prognosis, is becoming very, very frustrating. Can anybody suggest a way forward ?? 0 likes, 7 replies "

It feels like whichever way I shift my body weight it feels like I’m being pulled to that side, this feeling is in my neck, upper body and legs. It has also affected my limbs, for example my arms feel very heavy now so do my wrists, my legs also feel heavy, it has also affected my speech as my speech is now very shaky. I have seen a neurologist, rheumatologist, orthopaedic Surgeon, Chiropractor and have all the necessary tests (blood tests, MRI of brain, C spine etc and they did not find anything). The one thing however that is bothering me more than anything is they shaking that has developed in what seems to be all my muscles. When I extend my legs, arms (Shoulders), wrists and neck the muscles shaky uncontrollably and I cannot for the life of me understand why this is, it has made simply speaking difficult as I can feel my voice shaking and muscles in the back of my neck shaking when I move my neck. The shaking is only ever triggered with movement, if I raise both arms in the air, my shoulders and forearms shake when my arms are extended and retracted. The most noticeable one however is in my legs, when I extend or retracted my legs, the rubber band like tendon or muscles that runs down the back of the leg and knee shakes uncontrollably making the whole leg shake and it radiates up towards my pelvis and torso, causing further shaking. It is incredibly frustrating because the only way I feel that I can see what is happening with my muscles is to have a dynamic ultrasound of the tendons and ligaments in my legs, arms and neck to really see what is triggering this shaking however no specialist wants to refer me for this, even with private insurance. If anyone here is suffering with something similar or has received any answers please let me know or if anyone has any suggests, I know there is someone out there who is suffering with the exact same thing.

I went to my doc but they put it down to my psoriasis but im 100% that its not that at all as that area isnt infected by it and i can physically feel the change in my skull which has nothing to do with the skin. i prode it easily around 60/70 times a day. its easy to put it down to anxiety but when theres physical symptoms there such as vomiting, blacking out, dizziness, hearing cracking noises in my head, when i touch it i feel nausea. so you can see why i am concerned by this and my doc putting it down to a skin condition really makes it worse for me cause it makes me feel like that was my last option. 0 likes, 0 replies "

One of my most prominent symptoms is this electric shock feeling that starts in my neck and goes down my back, occasionally radiating into my arms. I’ve noticed that I get it more often when I’m playing flute (maybe something from my posture?). In my chest, I have a squeezing feeling that is very uncomfortable, and I also have tachycardia. In my arms, I have chronic pain, numbness, tingling, cold hands, some joint pain and stiffness, and my hands are very shaky (visibly shaky). In my legs, I have chronic pain, weakness, stiffness, cold feet, and numbness. I suffer from extreme constipation (I usually go a week or so, sometimes more without a bowel movement and I take Miralax regularly). I also have a lot of bloating, some upper abdominal pain, a few occasions of pale stools and bloody stools, severe nausea, and a complete loss of appetite. I barely eat, yet I have gained nearly twenty pounds in the last three months. I have a lot of trouble beginning urination and have had a few UTIs. Mentally, I have had worsened depression, a very poor memory, extreme confusion and fogginess, and developed OCD. Other than that, I’ve also had a bloody/metallic taste in my mouth, heavy periods, clonus upon examination, trouble with coordination/movement, some back pain, night sweats, extreme fatigue to the point where my teachers have had to call home about it, and muscle spasms. I’ve also noticed that I have a fairly constant low grade fever and a red nose.  Any ideas on what this could be? 0 likes, 3 replies "

Then in late 2017 to early 2018 I had gotten numb almost completely in my chest and stomach, like as if I just couldn't feel anything there. then I started to get numb in my head and lower crotch region. Now during these few years I had so much anxiety and panic attacks almost daily for the better half of late 2017. I have been isolated and homeschooled for around 4 years and have had weight issues too. Not to mention I've been 15-18 in this timespan too. Eventually everything died down for a bit later in 2018 and 2019, then let's hop to last November. My left eye goes numb, not completely numb but just feels more numb. I see a eye doctor and he says he thinks there isnt much wrong, fast forward to about a week ago and now my tongue has gotten numb, my left side of the face too, and my head more numb. I'm at this point where I saw my doctor again on friday and now I'm having to get a brain scan in a week or two. As I'm waiting for this my anxiety has been going haywire and I have no clue what's actually numb or cause of anxiety. The sensation Ive been having can simply be described as my entire body feels detached from my head and almost like I'm about to lose control and just well, die or pass out. combine this with the actual numbness I have and I cant tell what's real or fake and its scaring the crap out of me. I feel so detached and keep having heart palpitations and more numbness. I will note again I've been isolated and alone doing homeschooling and stuff for probably 3-4 years and I have been tested about everywhere except a brain scan. I fear alot I have a tumor and dont really know what to do while I wait for this scan. I keep having my heart palpitations and detached feelings and dont know if I'm either dying or my anxiety is making me lose control. please I need some help here with this 0 likes, 3 replies "

My roommates and I got flu-like symptoms. Fever, cough, mucus etc. Eventually we got over it. Or so I thought. Fast forward to the tail end of January (27-28th). Started developing slight vertigo. It would come and go throughout the day (I mostly noticed it in closed corridors or whenever I showered). The vertigo eventually went away however after a few days. Weird. Fast forward a week later, maybe the 8th of February. I started developing ear fullness, and crackling. It was dull but constant . Eventually I got slight facial tension on my cheeks as well. No paralysis but almost like a sunburn or my face being pulled back. I spoke to my mother in law who's a nurse. She checked my ears and noticed they were swollen but no fluid. She suggested Motrin and Sudafed. Maybe it was sinus issue? I used it for one week straight. Didnt work. Eventually the vertigo came back. And now it came back even stronger. This was like the 14th of February. I started freaking out. I would get lightheaded out of nowhere and feel like passing out. My head felt so swollen. Almost as if someone wrapped a belt around my head. So I go to urgent care thinking Im dying. They checked my blood sugar. It was fine. Hemoglobin. Okay. Blood pressure? A little high due to panic attack. The urgent care doctor runs a basic neuro test on me...my finger following her finger, eyes following her finger etc. She checked my eyes and ears and her conclusion was... Migraine. Migraine...I've had migraines before. This did not feel like it. She prescribed me Sumatriptan for headaches and Zofran for nausea. It did not help so a few days later I went to the physician (17th of February). Physician ran the same test as urgent care doctor however he concluded I had middle/inner ear infection due to a virus that stuck around since January. He prescribed me ear drops, Meclizine for vertigo and Ibropufen. Now its been a few weeks since my appointment. My head still feels swollen but not as much during the day as before. Also, my facial tension has slightly diminished. Not as much vertigo. My eyes arent spinning anymore however I still have ear fullness and crackling. That being said, the odd thing is even though some symptoms are diminishing, I feel like I'm developing new symptoms. It almost feels like I am drowsy, drunk. I get tired very easily. Like I need to put my head down during the day. Also my heart rate would spike randomly. I could be resting at 60bpm then all of a sudden it can go to 90bpm as soon I start thinking about it. The best way to describe the feeling is like I have low blood sugar with high blood pressure. Secondly, I would get a throbbing sensation in hands and feet accompanied by cold sensations and pins and needles. Also, I feel like I can hear my heartbeat at times and it feels like its pumping harder. Lastly I do have some slight back pain that comes and goes.  So odd I'd like to note that all these symptoms come and go throughout the day. Some hrs are better than others but still constant every day. Doctor likes to say that its my anxiety due to panic attacks. He says it put a lot of pressure on my nerves. But I'm not sure. Its just so odd. I was perfectly fine leading up to the new year (working out 4 out of 7 days a week) then all of a sudden I'm having all these odd symptoms. Is the doctor right in saying this is an inner ear infection mixed with anxiety? Vestibular neuritis? Labyrinthitis? Its on my mind everyday. Maybe thats why I feel so fatigued? 5'7 male 29 years old 175 lbs Filipino Mexican Any advice would be amazing. Thank you so much.* 0 likes, 4 replies "

Extreme confusion/disorientation and altered mental status","Hi all, I'm a 25 year old male, 5ft9 and 76 kgs. For the past 10 weeks I've had bouts of confusion/sedation/balance problems and general cognitive decline that genuinely feel as if I've taken an incredibly large dose of valium. It all started with my usual diazepam dose (6mg daily) suddenly feeling a lot stronger (1mg nearly knocked me out). In response we tapered down the diazepam over several weeks without too many problems. The waves of sedation/confusion never left, and now 3 months after stopping they're worse than before. At times i can hardly have normal conversation, I can no longer read the subtitles on movies and just feel very out of it, barely recognize my own house etc. I feel very sedated, calm, but completely out of it. The past few weeks these symptoms seem to be a lot worse after Eating Physical activity Mental stimulation (long conversations, phonecalls, difficult tasks (trying to read, ..). The only thing noteworthy about my recent medical history is elevated liver enzymes (ALT: 200 MAX, now about 60-70 & AST: 80 MAX, now about 40), Carnitine deficiency and a noticeable but bearable pain/discomfort in my right side/abdomen for the past 8 weeks. Nitroglycerin patches seem to mildly alleviate symptoms. I'm losing everything because of this and there's no answer in sight, please, help me. Very much interested in any insights/suggestions you all might have. Thank you. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Now i constantly feel cold water all over my head. I went to the hospital on Sunday and they did a CAT scan of my head and blood test but didn't find anything. I constantly feel the liquid all over my body and now I feel it in my forehead, sometimes it feels like raindrops.  Last friday I woke up with my leg feeling swollen and for the rest of this week my leg has been feeling weak and heavy, and my arm too. It never ends and I can barely do anything because I feel these things constantly. Everytime I go to the doctors and they run tests they don't find anything but I still feel it. I'm scheduling an appointment with a neurologist tomorrow, hopefully they can help me with whatever this is. Has anybody else ever felt this before and does it go away/what was it??

I had no issues what so ever. My mental health was fine. Once I started middle school for grade 9  I remember I was in a sex education class. The teacher showed a video of a lady giving birth and I remember starting to feel really dizzy, I felt fuzzy and had a really hard time standing up. I went into the hallway and sat there feeling ill. It is hard to remember every detail. I was not grossed out by the video or scared by it at all. It just happened suddenly where I felt this wave of weirdness come on. Later on during my time at middle school I smoked weed a few times, and this one time I got so messed up from a couple bong tokes. I remember everything started to feel really weird. Like My brain was so foggy. My heart was racing and I could not stand up without feeling dizzy and needing to sit down or else fall over. I felt clammy and I could not focus on anything. I was not  sure if I was saying words or just thinking them. When I would try to talk it would be very difficult to get words out. My face felt cold and pale. I did not feel nauseous just dizzy and confused. My dad came and picked me up from my friends house that day where I was smoking the weed. He took me home and after about a day I started to feel normal again. I decided from that point on I never wanted to feel that feeling again because it was terrifying. So I stopped smoking weed all together. And honestly I only smoked weed maybe five to ten  times before that and very small amounts. I was not a heavy weed smoker at all. A weeks later that feeling came back. Without smoking any weed. I had the exact same feelings start to appear and it was really scary. This time it took about a week to go away and feel normal again, but it did go away. After that I am not sure exactly how much time had passed at this point, but one day I was sitting in my lunch room at school. I was with some friends and we were just having a conversation nothing special or anything. All of a sudden, and I mean SUDDENLY out of nowhere, that feeling came back. I felt like i went from normal reality to feeling like I was in a dream. I became so detached from reality. My brain was covered in a fog. I felt disoriented. I had a buzzing in my ears. A pressure started to form in my head. My head felt so heavy. I had a hard time focusing and concentration. My eye sight got grainy. I had a hard time walking straight and I felt dizzy. From that moment on that feeling NEVER fully went away. It has been thirteen years since I have felt this way. Some days I feel a little bit more clear then others. But some days are so bad that I am afraid to even drive. The only way I can really explain it is that I feel disconnected from reality. I feel like I am dreaming. It is so strange. Like if I rated it from one being the least intense and 5 being the most intense, normally for most days I range between a 1-2. But sometimes I have bad days where it is at a 3-4 and then some days I cannot function at all and it hits a 5. Days where I am at a five rarely happen and they are usually random. When I started high school in grade ten I remember on my first day I walked into the doors of school and a really big wave of this suddenly came across me. I felt dizzy and could not  stand properly. It was like the world was spinning around me kind of. After high school I got a couple really bad episodes. They were so bad that I would literally lose my vision. It would start with a small feeling of clamminess, then I would start to feel cold and my eyesight would start to get really grainy. Then big white and grey spots would take over until it was completely white and I could not see anything at all. I would feel sick and my head would start hurting. A pressure in my head would build up and I could hear my head pulsing. At that point I could not do much other then lay down and stop moving or doing whatever I was doing and wait for it to pass. It would take anywhere from 5-10 minutes to pass and I would go back to feeling about a 2-3 on my 1-5 chart. I have been tested for anaemia which I do not have. My iron levels are actually in the normal to high range. I eat a balanced diet for the most part. I really do not  know what could have caused this to come on so suddenly at age 13. It is scary, and sometimes I wonder if it is possible for me to go back to how I used to feel. I remember feeling so scared and hopeless. I feel into a bit of a depression because my life had so suddenly flipped upside down and I have no explanation for it. Now, After 13 years (I am 26 now), I have been able to get used to it for the most part. I actually have a hard time remembering what it felt like to feel normal because it has been so long. I have spoken with doctors, and most of them say that i have anxiety or depression. Which I do not believe. I think it is more then just anxiety or depression. I never had anxiety before this and if anything this has brought on anxiety because it is a scary feeling. I hope someone can help me get a little closer to figuring out what is wrong with me. I wonder if maybe it is something to do with my brain. Or maybe a auto immune disease. I have no idea and any doctor I talk to has no idea. Please help if you can. 0 likes, 3 replies "

It was like the world was spinning around me kind of. After high school I got a couple really bad episodes. They were so bad that I would literally lose my vision. It would start with a small feeling of clamminess, then I would start to feel cold and my eyesight would start to get really grainy. Then big white and grey spots would take over until it was completely white and I could not see anything at all. I would feel sick and my head would start hurting. A pressure in my head would build up and I could hear my head pulsing. At that point I could not do much other then lay down and stop moving or doing whatever I was doing and wait for it to pass. It would take anywhere from 5-10 minutes to pass and I would go back to feeling about a 2-3 on my 1-5 chart. I have been tested for anaemia which I do not have. My iron levels are actually in the normal to high range. I eat a balanced diet for the most part. I really do not  know what could have caused this to come on so suddenly at age 13. It is scary, and sometimes I wonder if it is possible for me to go back to how I used to feel. I remember feeling so scared and hopeless. I feel into a bit of a depression because my life had so suddenly flipped upside down and I have no explanation for it. Now, After 13 years (I am 26 now), I have been able to get used to it for the most part. I actually have a hard time remembering what it felt like to feel normal because it has been so long. I have spoken with doctors, and most of them say that i have anxiety or depression. Which I do not believe. I think it is more then just anxiety or depression. I never had anxiety before this and if anything this has brought on anxiety because it is a scary feeling. I hope someone can help me get a little closer to figuring out what is wrong with me. I wonder if maybe it is something to do with my brain. Or maybe a auto immune disease. I have no idea and any doctor I talk to has no idea. Please help if you can. 0 likes, 3 replies "

The teacher showed a video of a lady giving birth and I remember starting to feel really dizzy, I felt fuzzy and had a really hard time standing up. I went into the hallway and sat there feeling ill. It is hard to remember every detail. I was not grossed out by the video or scared by it at all. It just happened suddenly where I felt this wave of weirdness come on. Later on during my time at middle school I smoked weed a few times, and this one time I got so messed up from a couple bong tokes. I remember everything started to feel really weird. Like My brain was so foggy. My heart was racing and I could not stand up without feeling dizzy and needing to sit down or else fall over. I felt clammy and I could not focus on anything. I was not  sure if I was saying words or just thinking them. When I would try to talk it would be very difficult to get words out. My face felt cold and pale. I did not feel nauseous just dizzy and confused. My dad came and picked me up from my friends house that day where I was smoking the weed. He took me home and after about a day I started to feel normal again. I decided from that point on I never wanted to feel that feeling again because it was terrifying. So I stopped smoking weed all together. And honestly I only smoked weed maybe five to ten  times before that and very small amounts. I was not a heavy weed smoker at all. A weeks later that feeling came back. Without smoking any weed. I had the exact same feelings start to appear and it was really scary. This time it took about a week to go away and feel normal again, but it did go away. After that I am not sure exactly how much time had passed at this point, but one day I was sitting in my lunch room at school. I was with some friends and we were just having a conversation nothing special or anything. All of a sudden, and I mean SUDDENLY out of nowhere, that feeling came back. I felt like i went from normal reality to feeling like I was in a dream. I became so detached from reality. My brain was covered in a fog. I felt disoriented. I had a buzzing in my ears. A pressure started to form in my head. My head felt so heavy. I had a hard time focusing and concentration. My eye sight got grainy. I had a hard time walking straight and I felt dizzy. From that moment on that feeling NEVER fully went away. It has been thirteen years since I have felt this way. Some days I feel a little bit more clear then others. But some days are so bad that I am afraid to even drive. The only way I can really explain it is that I feel disconnected from reality. I feel like I am dreaming. It is so strange. Like if I rated it from one being the least intense and 5 being the most intense, normally for most days I range between a 1-2.

First of all about 10 years ago i started experiencing some weird symptoms in my body. I noticed a twitch in my left ear, whenever lying on my left side and applying pressure to it. Over the years i learnt to ignore this twitch as it just seems like a mild annoyance and I could avoid it by adjusting my sleeping position. However, in recent years this twitch has started to become more pronounced and occurs in more positions. It becomes worse when i apply pressure to the left side of my face or neck, and there is always a sense of pressure/tightness from the left ear all the way down to the left side of neck. It feels like this pressure is activating some reflex causes the ear to twitch. This feeling is also accompanied by red/sore left ear once in awhile. Also, when I get up from bed or bend my head down, I sometimes can hear my pulse ""swishing"", in the left ear only. In the past few days this has been affecting my sleep and i decided to seek answers. It is especially annoying because i can hear the twitching as it happens. I am afraid if it could be caused by any neurological disorder or even a tumour?

My right hand just randomly started to feel warm and itchy  internally and there's this buzzing that's kind of like pins and needles and my hands feel sticky.  it's starting to spread though out my whole body and I have diarrhea,  my stomach and head feels warm and off too, I feel nausea. My skin is cold but I feel really warm internally and it's not a comfortable feeling. Does anyone know what this could be and whether it's serious or not? This could be unrelated but a few days ago I was having vision problems. I was having symptoms of   Oscillopsia, my vision was all jiggly even though I was standing still. Maybe  I'm just making a big deal out of nothing but idk. I'm worried. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I now believe I had/ have a squashed nerve in an externally rotating leg which was for a long time functionally(as opposed to truly) shorter. Not sure how long I was rotating the leg. This was and is not visible but all the forces within muscles wanted to go that way. A physiotherapist, 3 years ago, took a video of me walking. I was astounded to see how much I was leaning into one leg and the positions of my feet were effectively on a slant down towards my right. Sadly, this appointment concluded in having orthotic insoles made for me which made for more pain in my right foot. I maintain that this was trying to change something too soon. I realise now that the only way insoles would have worked is if they had gradually tried to realign me. Sadly, also, no physio since has ever addressed the cause the same way. Most have tried to treat my foot which does have arthritis but no-one has recognised what has been going on in my back, hip and leg. I think I am a fairly flexible person, to my own detriment, and my body has been able to adapt wrongly until the nerve(s?)  became finally trapped. I have continued to try to exercise but walking is my worst thing and standing...the very things you need to live a normal  life. Other exercises can also be bad  if I don't get the (unknown) optimal amount. I try to guess at that every day. I have come to this conclusion because doing daily Pilates for 9 months, despite the effort, has given me a little strength.And as a result of that or the past 5 weeks or so I actually have been trying to hoist up that slanting body whilst walking sometimes...so applying more weight on my left outer foot and leg when I walk or stand. I don't do it all the time but sometimes feel this is what it needs. This is essentially the unaffected leg but I realise that it needs to work harder to allow my right leg to unsquash. As soon as I started doing this these are the changes I noticed: This doesn't mean I am by any means cured of my weak foot, weak leg and sometimes back pain (the latter usually if I sit too long). The worst thing is not being able to walk without my legs and foot becoming exhausted after a very short time of about 20 minutes.Standing is worse. I feel I am trying, when possible to open up a leg which has been squashed down like a concertina(exaggeration of course). ****I am writing this in the hope that someone else might provide insight into what I am experiencing and my fear about the future.

It mainly affected my wrist and hand. She thought   and recommended a wrist support which i wore at night however it didn't improve at first. I stopped using it and eventually the pins and needles stopped over several months. Since then i have had them on and off but the last few months these attacks have gotten worse and they leave my arms hurting and feeling weak and heavy for weeks afterwards. I have noticed that my legs have begun to feel weaker at times and can feel like they are made of wood whilst i'm walking (only happened about 3 times in as many months). I'm also mixing words together sometimes when i'm talking which my daughter finds hilarious. My Dr has asked me to have a neck x-ray to see if it is a trapped nerve. Anyone experienced anything like this before as it feels like it is getting worse over time. 0 likes, 13 replies "

He definitely looks like he has a headache when he asks me this. He has  spoken with a neurosurgeon who told him that they could theoretically remove the rod, because there are just clips somehow holding the rod in place, and perhaps without the rod, the headaches would improve. My dad is considering having very major surgery in hopes that he will be able to tolerate WiFi again. This just seems crazy to me. Hoping someone reading can give me some ideas Can Wifi cause migraines like this? Could nerve damage be doing this when he's around certain types of waves or signals? Thanks again! 0 likes, 2 replies "

Recently this has got worse with knee pain, slight numbness in the lower leg and feeling like i need to have my leg stretched out constantly . I have been to see a GP who gave me a sheet of paper with some excersies on which i have followed and also been seeing a physiotherapist to help massage the muscles. I have been told I have weak glutes, illoitibal band syndrome ans piriformis. Although even though i have been moving more and doing excersies to strengthen my glutes... nothing has improved. In fact the knee pain seems to have got worse as well as the spasm feeling in ny thigh also happening in the other leg. I'm concerened because I currently can't drive without feeling like my leg is going to go into spasm from being in the same position for too long. If you have any idea what this is or how i can fix it please let me know 1 like, 5 replies "

Had some food and slept. DAY1: I woke up feeling normal. No pain. I was given Calamine cream to apply at the anus. Took sitz bath, applied lidocaine ointment. No pain and no BM. I again slept from 1Pm to 3PM i guess. I woke-up with some pain. Then I took all the pain meds at once which I was avoiding.

The nurses kept reassuring me and asking me to take deep slow breaths but this did not help and eventually having been unable to cope with it anymore, the doctor agreed to stop but did take two biopsies.

I've been continuously menstruating since I started it, and the bleeding's gotten heavier in the past month. I also feel nauseous most days (usually in the morning) and feel fatigued everyday. There are other less severe symptoms too (i.e. breast pain most days, feeling cold all the time, crying more easily). I've been taking an iron supplement (65mg/ day) for about 2 months since I'm assuming some of the symptoms are coming from low iron due to constant bleeding but I'm still exhausted all the time. I also try to eat iron-rich foods and otherwise eat healthy/ light exercise. I've made an appointment to have the Nexplanon removed but would love any advice from anyone with a similar experience on how to deal with these symptoms in the coming weeks. Thank you 😃 0 likes, 3 replies "

701,C0013390,Dysmenorrhea,C0557875,Tired,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/moving-on-from-the-nexplanon--62500,Moving on from the Nexplanon.,"I had my Nexplanon implant inserted in February 2012, so I've had it for almost 2 years. At first I was fine, and I thought I'd escaped all of the horrific symptoms that people had posted online. (Before having it put in, I thought there was a chance I'd be okay as my mum never had any symptoms with it).  But over the last 6 - 12 months things have got a little unbearable. I have gained 2 stone, I was a big size 8 - small size 10 (UK) before my implant, today I bought my first outfit in size 14 (and I only moved up to a size 12 around 2 months ago!) and I feel that was the last straw. I've always been built thin (again like my mum and sister) and so to move up 3 dress sizes in such a short space of time (accompanied by some nasty stretchmarks!) isn't acceptable. People have also been pointing out how big I'm getting so quickly. My doctor insists it's not the implant, but everyone I know (except my mum!) has gotten much, much bigger, most even bigger than me, since getting the implant.  Additionally, my mood is terrible. I don't have 'mood swings' because I never swing into the positive, I'm always down, I always feel extremely tired and sluggish and I think this is all due to my implant. Also, my periods stopped completely except for 2 very long running ones, the first which was just after it was put in, which lasted 64 days. The second which has been ongoing for 8 weeks.  So, I want to have it taken out and I'm prepared to put up a fight with my doctor to get that. However, it's a very convenient and effective contraceptive which in a way makes me want to keep it, plus there is the added benefit of the possibility of going a year without a period (prior to the implant I had very heavy and painful periods).  My question is; has anyone had the Nexplanon (or Implanon) and had to move onto a different contraceptive? What did you move on to? Are there any horrible symptoms? Is the new method effective? None of the alternatives seem as convenient as the implant, but I can't keep gaining weight like this and keep going with these bad moods. I feel if I can get the implant out then I'm not going to be on a constant diet for no reason and I might actually see results.  Just a bit of information about me: I'm 20, I am 5ft 7, I weight 11 st 7 lb.  Thank you for any advice. 0 likes, 31 replies "

Mine is around my lower left ribs. For the last 18 months they have stuck out and feel like they are swollen. They would feel bruised if i pressed them quite hard. They ache around the bottom and around the side. The most swollen part is around the middle of the left lower ribs. Not around the middle of my chest, but the middle of the left ribs themselves, which is where i believe there is a costo joint. It gets more swollen as the day goes on so is much more prominent at the end of the day. And i feel the ribs on that side feel harder than the ones on the right. Thats a weird thing to say because it's bone but they do feel so hard when i press them. i have had ultrasounds, x rays, ct scans, and a nuclear bone scan which showed inflammation in the area, so i know it wont be anything more worrying, but still i worry because the symptoms are not the same as everyone else's. i OBSESS over it. i check how it feels maybe 10/20 times a day. i convince myself it's something terminal.

I can feel a pressure point in my chest, located around the junction of my 2nd rib and its cartilage. It is also slightly (not sharp at all) tender to touch. I get some other pressure points too, but not necessarily tender to touch and they are not at precise locations. My intercostal muscles also feel quite sore. Most of the time the pain is widespread : I get pain behind my flank under the armpit, dull ache around my clavicle, stabbing pain in my lower ribs or upper ribs from time to time that are increased while breathing deeply, and most importantly fairly important shoulder aches : it feels like my trapeze muscle is constantly sore (often hard and tender to touch) ; some milder upper back pain comes along. Important to notice that usually these pains dont happen all at once : they kind of ""rotate"" several times a day if i may say. When pressing on my lower back i can locate a few tender points, just at the back of my lower right ribs. Occasionally, i get tingles and slight pain in my arms and fingers but it might be completely unrelated. Symptoms are increased when i sit for long period of times, and decrease when im in bed. Every couple week the pain noticeably subsides, only to come back a few days later. I visited my GP in january who told me that it was pain caused by cramped muscles because of excessive anxiety, and that it would come back to normal shortly. But it didnt. The pain is never unbearable. Could this be signs of some kind of costochondritis ? Even though i read that the main flag for costo is sharp pain when pressing on sternum, which I dont have. Like most people who get pain that lasts over time, I'm worried I might have cancer, in this case lung cancer given the location (despite being a 21 years old who never smoke and with no other symptom than pain). What do you think ? It really is in my mind all the time at the moment, I rarely even think about something else which of course only make pain worse. 0 likes, 1 reply "

This presented itself as mid back pain, which was made worse by sitting in a office type chair for long periods or by walking for a long time. What I thought was  'indigestion' was chest pains as opposed to the traditional heartburn, but I did feel I was burping a bit more than normal and the odd thing was the pain in the back felt worse after I had eaten, which the Dr dismissed I have been through a huge amount of tests (MRI, Bloods, H Pylori etc.) & treatment (PPI's and Physio) and even had my gallbladder removed as it had a large stone in it - yet I am still in pain. The pain seems to move around between my mid back, chest, in between shoulder blades, shoulder (mainly left) occasionally my arm. In my chest it seems to be left sided most of the time and there are specific areas which when I press down it hurts but the areas move around (on the front, under my arm at the sides, sometimes collarbone) and it really hurts if I twist my upper body. It's now progressed to the point where I am in 'ache' like pain from the minute I wake up. Through all of this I still feel that sometimes (not all the time) it hurts more once I have eaten something for a few hours as if it could be reflux related, but PPI's have no effect and the Doctors have all said that the area of the pain is not where it would be if this were a stomach issue. I am currently seeing a rheumatologist who has mentioned Costo as a possible culprit but has sent me for a bone scan and more blood tests. Does this seem like Costo? - I would be confident of this if it wasn't for the odd connection with eating which no-one seems to mention when discussing Costo and the fact that the sore spots on my ribs are often not in the middle of my chest and seem to move about day by day! 0 likes, 10 replies "

Chest pains, numb and tingling sensations, trapped nerve, costochondritis. And remedies? ","Spoiler: This may be a long post. Hello. I just wanted to start by saying my doctor told me to check out this site- first to read up on Costo and after lots of reading, I am way more informed on what it is, so thanks to anyone out there who has posted or shared their experiences as it has helped me out a lot.  My experience seems totally similar which is reassuring but I thought I'd post, outline it all to keep up to date on any solotions or remedies. I'm 27, male and have been having these weird symptoms since about April this year. I, like most, have been under a lot of stress. In the past 12 months about 6 hugely traumatic things have happened in quick succession within my family ( , divorce, 3 huge deaths in the space of 3 months) after which, the symptoms kicked in. At work, in April, my left foot went numb, not fully numb, but felt like pins and needles or that my left shoe was tied too tight. My foot has been in varying degrees of this since then. I also experience tingly sensation in my left arm, hand,neck and side of my face. Like many people with costo, I thought ""well, that'll be a heart attack then."" I had some tests done, all fine. Potential calcium deficiency so took vitamins. In about July I hurt my rib and the aching feeling transferred to my chest and in my mind, my heart. I basically spent August trying different variations of heat packs, cold packs, vitamins, indegestion tablets, paracetamol, cocodomol and ibuprofen while intermittently seeing doctors or phoning HNS 24 thinking I was going to die. Nothing in day to day life feels comfortable. It felt like someone was sitting on the left side of my chest, and that there was an itch i just couldnt scratch deep inside my chest, like I need a back scratcher for my ribcage just to unclog whatever it feels is in there. The doctors all past this off as stress and   which annoyed me, ironically adding to the stress.  All of this has been ongoing since then and since August I have had bloods, ecg and 24 hour blood pressure monitor. All fine. I was told   given Pregabalin tablets- first 25mg twice a day, then 50mg twice a day, now on 75mg twice a day. I'm going to ring the doctor tomorrow to reassess as I don't think they are working, not consistently anyway but then again Costo is such a weird one as the symptoms and feelings seems to range dramatically.

In the last 2 weeks I have developed a medium-sized, painless lump on the front/side of my left leg - near where the muscle meets the shin, facing the inner leg. To be honest, I do not care to go to doctors that often. Which is why I am seeking rudimentary advice here first. Something to note: I got some potassium supplements yesterday and took my first one last night.  Obviously it hasn't had time to effect anything yet. Also, today my left calf has had a continuous twitch near the lump; no pain, just annoying. Any one has similar experiences? Anyone see a physician due to something similar; what was the outcome? 0 likes, 5 replies "

The doctor's dismiss it as   but this is the thing that is causing me to be anxious so I am not sure. After doing anything strenuous my legs start getting restless, then they tighten up and start twitching and then they will remain like that and ache for a long time, days in fact. If I have a warm bath to help soothe the muscles it makes things worse and my legs becoming heavy and really achey and restless and it will make all my veins bulge out too. I'm a 32 yo male. Yesterday I felt fine and was quite buoyant as I told myself it must all be anxiety if I feel okay now - I did a bit of walking that day and felt really good then later on that night it all started again, restless legs turning to achey twitching legs etc etc it sounds like it could be cramping fasciculation syndrome from what I've read.

I had the colonoscopy about 2 months later which then showed mild inflammation and biopsies showed no evidence of Crohn's. still not given any medication.  I then repeated the calprotectin a few weeks later which came bk normal.  I was then referred to the gastroentoligist in about march 2017.  He said unlikely Crohn's as it only lasted about 10 days and put it down to infection.  Sent me for small bowel MRI and came bk normal.  He didn't give me anything for infection. Said it had cleared up as my calprotectin was normal. I decided to see a nutritionist about 4 months after my consultant appt and calprotectin was 219 went bk to consultant told it was ""a blip"" and could be many things 95% certain not Crohn's.  Told this by 2 consultants.  Had some stomach cramps since but nothing much.  The nutritionist also checked my Elastase-1 which is to with my pancreas it came bk at 170 which is slightly low.

The only reason I repeated it was because I saw my results and not because of my symptoms.  And does this mean my pancreas is damaged?  and does it sound like Crohn's. and also my immunoglobulin iga and igm is high which i think is to do with infection which i think thats wat i have.  why dont they give antibiotics for infection?  even my dog got metronidazole for colitis ha ha. 0 likes, 0 replies "

A few weeks ago my poor boy was in so much pain he couldnt walk so i checked him and found a massive lump near his anus. At the hospital they took him down to surgery where they found a large abscess and a fistula... they cleaned and drained the abscess and fitted a seton with a view to operate in a few months. They took bloods and biopsies and mentioned chrones to us... although they were not worried as he is so young. 3 weeks later i call for biopsy results and the surgeon still hasnt looked at them. The biopsies were inconclusive but showed 'chronic inflammation' The consultant still has not contacted me about this. His bloods were pretty normal apart from mild anemia and inflammation markers were up (due to abscess?) Would an abscess or fistula show as chronic inflammation? Or is there something else going on? It seems highly probable to me that he has this but docs seem unconcerned due to his age. Its so rare apparently. Im out of my mind, its been 3 weeks plus the 2 years on top of chasing. I just want to know whats up with my boy. Sorry for rambling lol x 0 likes, 4 replies "

I have been having digestive issues for a couple of years now, that were initially believed to be IBS. I have central abdominal discomfort mainly around my belly button area, bloating, burping, flatulence, and stomach and bowel churning and gurgling, plus a general sense of feeling unwell, very tired and drained. It seems that diet plays an major role in the severity of my symptoms. Plain, bland, low fat and low sugar foods cause my symptoms to ease, yet rich, spicy, fatty, sweet foods seem to aggravate my condition. My symptoms can also come and go in a matter of hours, one minute feeling unwell experiencing most or all the symptoms I have mentioned, then a few hours later they will totally go away and I feel relatively fine again. My bowel movements remain pretty constant, although I have always had a problem with producing red blood every now and again, and we're talking a lot longer than I've been having digestive problems. As a result of this I was referred for a colonoscopy with biopsies just under a year ago now. The results of the colonoscopy were good, apparently my colon, rectum and terminal ileum looked very healthy, and the biopsies revealed no sign of inflammation going on, past or present. It was noted that I do have internal hemorrhoids though, which the hospital consultant said was the probable cause of the red blood produced every now and again. My doctor also requested some faecal calprotectin tests to be done over the course of a 6 month period. All of these tests came back positive with results around the 250 to 300 mark. My doctor seems to think that there still is a chance that I could be suffering with Crohns Disease. However my consultant has said that with the pleasing colonoscopy results, the fact that I am not feeling a lot worse than I do when I'm at my worst, and that my symptoms and general health feeling can change in a matter of hours, then he very much doubts that Crohns is the cause, especially since this has been going on for over 4 years now. When I questioned the calprotectin results the consultant said that the test is very non specific and can be affected by numerous other influences, plus he said people who take PPI medication, of which I have been taking Omeprazole for a couple of years now, are more inclined to have raised calprotectin levels anyway, and the fact my calprotectin results have remained constant, seems to fit in line with the dosage of Omeprazole I take daily. I'm now at a loss as to what to do next, the doctor has accepted the consultants diagnosis, although he does have his doubts, and the consultant is as sure as he can be that I don't have Crohns. This isn't ideal as it leaves me feeling like I'm in  state of limbo and feeling generally unwell, and just waiting for symptoms to worsen due to leaving possible Crohns untreated, which may never happen as I could well not have it!!

My heart rate stays up past 100. I get stomachaches sometimes. When i use the restroom, when i wipe, it's yellow. i feel weak and shaky. Can't sleep right. I'm on a bland diet, have been for 7 months. A few months ago, my GI did bloodwork and everything came back normal. i've also have had CT Scans, Upper Endoscopy. Those came back normal. I had a MRI, and it showed mild inflamation in my colon, but my GI wasn't worried. I'm depressed because of all of this. i've been dealing with this for 7 months. The nausea is the worse.

Having some interesting things going on lately and just looking for support at this point (I know none of you can give me definitive answers). About 5 weeks ago at this point, I had some strange symptoms arise. Had some lower right abdominal discomfort/side - won't call it pain - and bloating. Took Gas X which helped the bloat, but it came back. The discomfort has ranged from feeling like its on the inside to feeling like its on my skin - best way I can describe it is mild burning. Seems to be mostly OK with standing/laying flat and when I compress the area (sitting, curling up in bed, driving) I can feel it (alien inside?!?!). Also had sour stomach (which isn't outside of the realm of normal for me) and diarrhea. Went to my GP, she palpated my stomach and there was no pain and no fever. The diarrhea and bloating led her to believe GI (she also considered shingles due to the burning and a few bumps on my stomach - also not out of the norm) so she put me on Omeprazole for 14 days and a strict diet - no lactose, fried foods, fatty foods, caffeine, carbonated beverages, alcohol, chocolate, spicy foods, etc (NO FUN! I don't do most of that anyways 😃 ). So basically, lean meat, rice, potatoes, vegetables, fruit was what I ate with lactose free milk. Omeprazole took away my sour stomach, bloating and made my bowels much more regular - not 100% but much better. I specifically remember one day picking at one of the bumps and having my skin burn like crazy - random, but I obviously noticed! About day 10 I had diarrhea all day long - I had to take 3 Imodium pills to make it stop and I had high anxiety that night from backing down what seemed like a good path I was on. I apparently was acting like a baby then and stopped taking the Omeprazole. 2 days later I started waking up nauseous every morning and completely lost my appetite. I would get hungry but had to force food down my throat because I knew I needed some sort of calories in my body. This was a Thursday, called my GP and they couldn't see me until Monday so I suffered through the weekend. Some days being better than others with the nausea, but I pretty much laid in bed and watched everything I could on Netflix. Some days had diarrhea, some days had more normal movements. Discomfort being there every day, no fever - some aches and a bit tired but not fatigued. Think I was more nervous and miserable about everything. Come Monday (earlier this week) when I could get into my GP. She again palpated my abdomen - no pain. She told me to go back on Omeprazole, call my GI and scheduled some blood work and an Ultrasound. BTW - took a test, not pregnant. Went to get the blood work right away. Had the Ultrasound on Tuesday. CBC showed increase platelets (468; normal being 150-400) and my ALT on my Metabolic Panel was elevated (43; 1-33 normal). Ultrasound revealed nothing. My GP's office called and said that they believe it's inflammation. Seeing my GI tomorrow morning. At this point I've probably lost 15-20 pounds for lack of eating (not mad.. I could use it.. but not the healthy way). Omeprazole has seemingly made morning nausea go away which is helpful because at least I can eat without wanting to throw up, but still quite a lack of appetite. I'm hoping it's just that I'm scared to eat because I don't want to make things worse. Bowels have gotten better again too but who knows for how long. But this discomfort will NOT budge... Can't make it worse, can't make it better so I'm assuming it has nothing to do with what I'm eating or when I'm evacuating my bowels. Obviously haven't been diagnosed with anything but with my anxious internet searches, Crohn's is my assumption at the moment. I have had a past gallbladder removal 3 years ago and I know I have some sort of IBS - some food messes with me, I cramp, I have explosive diarrhea and then I'm fine. Could be a myriad of things at this point. Just looking to vent somewhere and drop the anxiety and maybe help someone in a similar situation down the line!!

The diarrhea and bloating led her to believe GI (she also considered shingles due to the burning and a few bumps on my stomach - also not out of the norm) so she put me on Omeprazole for 14 days and a strict diet - no lactose, fried foods, fatty foods, caffeine, carbonated beverages, alcohol, chocolate, spicy foods, etc (NO FUN! I don't do most of that anyways 😃 ). So basically, lean meat, rice, potatoes, vegetables, fruit was what I ate with lactose free milk. Omeprazole took away my sour stomach, bloating and made my bowels much more regular - not 100% but much better. I specifically remember one day picking at one of the bumps and having my skin burn like crazy - random, but I obviously noticed! About day 10 I had diarrhea all day long - I had to take 3 Imodium pills to make it stop and I had high anxiety that night from backing down what seemed like a good path I was on. I apparently was acting like a baby then and stopped taking the Omeprazole. 2 days later I started waking up nauseous every morning and completely lost my appetite. I would get hungry but had to force food down my throat because I knew I needed some sort of calories in my body. This was a Thursday, called my GP and they couldn't see me until Monday so I suffered through the weekend. Some days being better than others with the nausea, but I pretty much laid in bed and watched everything I could on Netflix. Some days had diarrhea, some days had more normal movements. Discomfort being there every day, no fever - some aches and a bit tired but not fatigued. Think I was more nervous and miserable about everything. Come Monday (earlier this week) when I could get into my GP. She again palpated my abdomen - no pain. She told me to go back on Omeprazole, call my GI and scheduled some blood work and an Ultrasound. BTW - took a test, not pregnant. Went to get the blood work right away. Had the Ultrasound on Tuesday. CBC showed increase platelets (468; normal being 150-400) and my ALT on my Metabolic Panel was elevated (43; 1-33 normal). Ultrasound revealed nothing. My GP's office called and said that they believe it's inflammation. Seeing my GI tomorrow morning. At this point I've probably lost 15-20 pounds for lack of eating (not mad.. I could use it.. but not the healthy way). Omeprazole has seemingly made morning nausea go away which is helpful because at least I can eat without wanting to throw up, but still quite a lack of appetite. I'm hoping it's just that I'm scared to eat because I don't want to make things worse. Bowels have gotten better again too but who knows for how long. But this discomfort will NOT budge... Can't make it worse, can't make it better so I'm assuming it has nothing to do with what I'm eating or when I'm evacuating my bowels. Obviously haven't been diagnosed with anything but with my anxious internet searches, Crohn's is my assumption at the moment. I have had a past gallbladder removal 3 years ago and I know I have some sort of IBS - some food messes with me, I cramp, I have explosive diarrhea and then I'm fine. Could be a myriad of things at this point. Just looking to vent somewhere and drop the anxiety and maybe help someone in a similar situation down the line!!

I've been generally unwell for a few years now and diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Anxiety and IBS. Recently however, my doctor wanted to check calprotectin levels, and repeat tests after that have given results in the 300 range, hence why my doctor now suspects CD, and wants to proceed with further investigations. I have had two colonoscopies in the last few years, the first with polyps removed which were benign, and the latter with biopsies taken which came back showing no problems at all, in fact there were comments as to how healthy my colon, rectum and terminal ileum looked, the only issue found were hemorrhoids. Now usually my bowel movements are formed as they should be, but only happen every 3 to 4 days, I only ever need to pass stools once when I go, and there is no blood present. However, last night I went to bed feeling a bit more worse than normal, quite groggy in the lower abdominal area and a bit nauseous.       When I woke there was an almost immediate need to have a bowel movement, and I have to say it was quite 'explosive'. It was loose with lots of wind being produced. About an hour after this I had to go again and this time it was very watery. I have just been a third time now and it was watery again, but this time there looked to be a small amount of red blood present with it. On top of that I have felt generally unwell and very slightly faint and weird all morning. After each bowel movement the abdominal cramps ease a lot, but still feel discomfort in that area. All my vitals are fine, temperature, heart rate, etc. I've had tonnes of other tests done in recent months with nothing out of the ordinary showing up. Now I know I'm in the process of investigation for CD, but I was wondering if there is anything in particular I should look out for that might warrant immediate medical attention whilst waiting for my first Gastroenterology appointment? Also, if this is a CD flare up that I am experiencing, is there any way I can ease it to make me more comfortable and help it pass quicker? I'm quite worried as even though I have experienced the odd episode in the past like this, I have never had so many bowel movements in such a short space of time or felt as unwell as I do at present. To be honest the symptoms I'm experiencing at the moment aren't actually too bad, I'm just a complete wet blanket when it comes to feeling ill and handling pain. The pain and general unwell feeling I can handle, I just don't like the faint and weird feelings at all. Any thoughts, views and advice would be really appreciated. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Now usually my bowel movements are formed as they should be, but only happen every 3 to 4 days, I only ever need to pass stools once when I go, and there is no blood present. However, last night I went to bed feeling a bit more worse than normal, quite groggy in the lower abdominal area and a bit nauseous.       When I woke there was an almost immediate need to have a bowel movement, and I have to say it was quite 'explosive'. It was loose with lots of wind being produced. About an hour after this I had to go again and this time it was very watery. I have just been a third time now and it was watery again, but this time there looked to be a small amount of red blood present with it. On top of that I have felt generally unwell and very slightly faint and weird all morning. After each bowel movement the abdominal cramps ease a lot, but still feel discomfort in that area. All my vitals are fine, temperature, heart rate, etc. I've had tonnes of other tests done in recent months with nothing out of the ordinary showing up. Now I know I'm in the process of investigation for CD, but I was wondering if there is anything in particular I should look out for that might warrant immediate medical attention whilst waiting for my first Gastroenterology appointment? Also, if this is a CD flare up that I am experiencing, is there any way I can ease it to make me more comfortable and help it pass quicker? I'm quite worried as even though I have experienced the odd episode in the past like this, I have never had so many bowel movements in such a short space of time or felt as unwell as I do at present. To be honest the symptoms I'm experiencing at the moment aren't actually too bad, I'm just a complete wet blanket when it comes to feeling ill and handling pain. The pain and general unwell feeling I can handle, I just don't like the faint and weird feelings at all. Any thoughts, views and advice would be really appreciated. 0 likes, 1 reply "

My doctor took a stool sample and im clear of bacteria etc (no blood tested for in stool) i did mrntion sometimes my movements were dark but he said only truly pitch black and oily are worrysome for blood. So then he ran blood work. all my bloods were normal except for minorly low B12, which then caused him to test for the celiac gene which came back negative ruling that out almost certainly. He tested my liver function which was normal, he tested me for inflammation markers which were very low (in a good way) and everything came back normal. In the end he said it sounded like IBS. he said it doesnt warrant a colonoscopy unless it got worse or i started losing weight etc. to him the biggest reasons for this were that I feel almost entirely better after a blowout or passing alot of gas, according to him Chron's the cramps continue and the pain doesnt come and go with the movements themselves. He also said inflammatory bowel conditions typically always present with high inflammatory markers in bloodwork if causing symptoms and mine were very low in the healthy range. Also my guy eould make a rushing water sound which i guess is a sign of Ibs. anyway ive recover some. now its been more once every two months or three months I will get a blowout although crampy pains are a bit more common. this all started during a very stressful period where we moved, got engaged and changed work etc so the stress factor was certainly there. 0 likes, 7 replies "

I've been diagnosed Bi'polar last week. I was wrongly diagnosed with depression and 8wks ago was put on venlafaxine (Currently on 150mg). Saw a new psychiatrist who diagnosed Bi-polar 2 and started me on 100mg quetiapine MR to be taken for a week then up to 200mg for week and finally to 300mg.  He then wants to reduce the venlafaxine.  I've never been so ill. At one point I wanted to die as I have no proper feelings towards my beautiful daughter (12) or the rest of my family. I don't even feel like me.  I'm usually a very caring and compassionate person and feel totally lost and pretty scared most of the time.  My head is a scrambled mess, can't concentrate and don't enjoy anything and I even feel weird and mildly aggressive towards people that I love.  Memories from the past are coming up and I feel like I am reliving them as if they are happening now.  Wanted to know if this is normal with Bipolar 2. Have had overwhelming fear for weeks  and I'm so scared I will never feel like me again.  I feel disconnected from everyone and don't know how long I can cope. Would the antidepressant make my anxiety worse? I was put on it after what I know now was a hypomanic episode which was followed by the anxiety/fear. So sorry for the long post but I'm at my wits end. 0 likes, 9 replies "

I'm a 22 year old female, taking 200mg Lamictal, 100mg Wellbutrin HCL SR, Concerta ER 36mg, Zoloft 50mg, in the morning. 150 Lamictal, 50mg Zoloft, 400mg Seroquel 1mg Lunesta and 10mg Melatonin.

Mental Disorders are Asperger's Syndrome, PTSD, ADD, OCD, BiPolar, Social Phobia, Panic Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, Chronic Depression, and I believe a few others, but I can't remember them. I've been on Seroquel for 4 years now and my doctor and I have decided to take me off of it. I'm was on 500mg at night. I was on it for insomnia and my doctor decided on Lunesta since the Seroquel quit working. And because it makes my libido non-existent. My boyfriend has been great at not being angry at it, but now it's startling to strain. We have sex maybe once a month. I don't like it either, I love being intimate with him. I don't want to wait months to go off of it, I want off it now. I know that's super bad. I've dropped medicine before and it made me go into Psychosis.

Basically that day he woke with severe pain in both his ankles, both knees, and his groin, to the point where he could not move any of his joints at all, not only that but you couldn't even touch the joints without him screaming out... So we got the ambulance to take him in hospital, thinking maybe his arthritis had started up again.  Once at hospital the arthritis was ruled out and the consultant diagnosed him with crps... But unfortunately the doctors at Lincoln hospital have never dealt with this before, so they are in the dark how to deal with it. Numerous phone calls to Leicester, Sheffield and great ormand Street paediatric pain clinics ensued, for advice. Physio, counselling, pain management medication & desensitisation programs was what they were told.  Unfortunately Lincoln hospital can only give him physio, as the other services are not available there... Lincoln were advised to try my son on ametrypoline, but this gave him vivid nightmares so he was taken off it, they then tried gavapentin, which also gave him vivid night terrors, so that too had to be stopped.... But they haven't started him on anything else as they are not sure how to deal with it. Leicester, Sheffield and Great ormand Street only do paediatric outpatient appointments to their pain clinic, and the earliest any of them can offer is 7 months away!! !. My son needs inpatient transfer to a paediatric hospital that deals with this not as an outpatient as clearly with my son not able to bend his legs, or even walk on them this is impossible.,but as an inpatient. So my question is. Does anyone in the UK know any paediatric hospital that deals with children's pain as an inpatient, so he could be transferred from Lincoln to somewhere that knows how to deal with crps, that is all under one roof.

I really don't think it is necessary as he has asked me to have it due to mild abdominal pain alternating on left and right side and a deep ache in the mid-right section of my pelvis which I have had for nearly a year now (this seems to be related to my urinary tract as it causes urinary frequency but doctor said he wants to rule out if its to do with my intestines) I have also had intense aching/pressure in my rectal area but no bleeding or changes to my bowel movements and medication he has prescribed has helped with the aching. Stool test also came back fine but he still wants me to go ahead and have it 😦 I have been sent the Moviprep and I would like to know people's experiences of this? My appointment is at 9.45am and I have been advised to start taking it at 5pm the day before??? This seems way too late in the day and because I have severe anxiety about this I have googled 'Moviprep experiences' (stupid I know 😦) and there are so many horror stories. Several people said they had not been able to leave the toilet when their appointment was due so they have had to cancel? Others say they were still running to the toilet in the waiting room when their appointment was due? I have also read that some people have had this procedure done as a routine (not due to bowel symptoms) and suffered diarrhoea/incontinence/pain for weeks and months after. I do not want anymore symptoms on top of what I already have 😦. I am planning on just eating plain toast/crackers etc for the next couple of days and then eating very little on the Thursday (my appointment is on Saturday). I was also planning on taking the Moviprep at around 2pm on the Friday so it gives me a few extra hours just in case the diarrhoea lasts for longer than expected. I am also going to opt for the conscious sedation (I am in the UK) as I don't think I can handle being fully awake. Can anyone advise on how long the diarrhoea is likely to last? The box says it lasts for 2 hours but the reviews I have read say much longer than this. I have recently lost my grandad and we are saying our goodbyes next Thursday (5 days after the procedure). I am so scared that I won't be able to go if I'm not recovered in time. On top of that I have a full time job and I have had to tell them I am having this done but I don't know how it will effect me so to expect me to call in sick for a few days. I don't want this procedure to trigger worse symptoms or cause further irritation as surely it isn't healthy to drink two litres of laxative and then have a camera inserted in your colon 😦. I wish I was braver. I am mainly worried about having permanent/long lasting diarrhoea/changes in bowel movements/pain after this procedure.

I'm sure stuff like this gets posted all the time, so I hope you don't mind me asking. When I was a teenager I had bad IBS, rashes and ulcers. I had the Coeliac blood test, but it came back negative because I had already removed gluten from my diet after seeing positive changes in my symptoms. I am now 24 and decided to get tested again; I have my blood test next week and have been eating gluten for about 2 months. Surprisingly, I have had few IBS like symptoms, only occasional mouth ulcers and this weird rash. The rash is on my face and feet, it looks a bit like ringworm but doesn't respond to antifungals. At first it was just red, then after a few weeks it started itching and I couldn't stop scratching. Now it's really stinging and sometimes it feels like something is seeping from the broken skin. However, it doesn't look anything like DH pictures I've seen online. It covers my nose, cheeks and chin and is red. Before I added gluten back to my diet, I had clear skin. I also sometimes get this rash when I accidentally gluten myself. For example, I once ate a gluten free poppadom that had been fried in a fryer used for food items containing gluten, and the rash showed up on my face and hands. Has anybody else experienced this rash? It's the worst symptom I have. I suppose I'm also wondering what it could be if my blood test returns negative. I'm going to bring it up with my GP anyway when she tells me my blood test results. Many thanks in advance! 0 likes, 7 replies "

I'm sure stuff like this gets posted all the time, so I hope you don't mind me asking. When I was a teenager I had bad IBS, rashes and ulcers. I had the Coeliac blood test, but it came back negative because I had already removed gluten from my diet after seeing positive changes in my symptoms. I am now 24 and decided to get tested again; I have my blood test next week and have been eating gluten for about 2 months. Surprisingly, I have had few IBS like symptoms, only occasional mouth ulcers and this weird rash. The rash is on my face and feet, it looks a bit like ringworm but doesn't respond to antifungals. At first it was just red, then after a few weeks it started itching and I couldn't stop scratching. Now it's really stinging and sometimes it feels like something is seeping from the broken skin. However, it doesn't look anything like DH pictures I've seen online. It covers my nose, cheeks and chin and is red. Before I added gluten back to my diet, I had clear skin. I also sometimes get this rash when I accidentally gluten myself. For example, I once ate a gluten free poppadom that had been fried in a fryer used for food items containing gluten, and the rash showed up on my face and hands. Has anybody else experienced this rash? It's the worst symptom I have. I suppose I'm also wondering what it could be if my blood test returns negative.

Total honesty - I was given 30/500 cocodamol by my mum when I got my period, my cramps were debilitating. Fast forward 2 years, she died, and I started taking (2 tabs) when I wasn't in pain as I liked the warm fuzzy feeling. If I had have known that now at 25 I am a full addict to OTC 8/500 obviously I would not have. Hindsight eh? Every day I take at least 8 tabs at a time, before breakfast and before lunch. Sometimes more. Today, like many many days before, I swear it is my last day. I had 12 tabs before breakfast, and 12 before lunch. I truely truely hate myself for needing to have them, I am fully aware of the damage I am doing to myself. The side effects are horrendous: increased IBS, back pain, headaches, lethargy etc. I am so determined that today will be the last time I ever touch these again. After tomorrow I am busy with work for 5 days in which I will have no access to a pharmacy. I know I'll get withdrawals that will be awful.

It has coincided with me suffering a very heavy flu like cold which had started before i stopped the pills. however after 4 days in and whilst i am feeling relatively drained i feel as though i just have  a heavy cold and so far i have had no real desire to collapse back onto the drugs. my current symptoms are. Lethargy, a bit loose on the toilet, feeling fluey but not too bad. a bit emotional thinking about my children and grandson  (but this actually helps as i keep telling myself that i will be able to be a far better granddad to my 2 y/o grandson who idolises me and me him.)  a bit insomnia waking up about 5 but lying awake till morning.  other than this i dont feel to bad at all and what is strange is that in the past when i have just gone one day without the drug the withdrawals were awful and far worse. i am unsure why this time i feel relatively OK and from what i understand at this point after 4 days things should start getting better day by day. luckily my appetite has not suffered at all so i am eating well, juicing healthy fruits and eating veg, taking vitamins etc so i can see the benefits of ridding my self of this drug. I just wonder when the lethargy will start to ease as to me this is what has dominated my life for so long. i long for the morning when i wake up full of energy and step outside at 7 am breath the beautiful air and know that i am truly over this addiction. a little bit of inspiration that has helped me was reading a book called ""recovery Freedom from our addictions)"" by Russell Brand. theres lots of little wise comments in there when the cravings hit such as thinking about where you would be in one hour after giving in and taking the pills. Basically meaning in as little as an hour your buzz would be over and you'd be back to square one again. One other bit of personal advice i would like to give anybody who is currently going through what i am is to remove the problem from the equation, if like me you cannot fully bring yourself to get rid of the  vile toxic pills. then remove them to somewhere that makes it more difficult to get to them. I have an allotment which is around 1 mile away from my home. i have stored the pills there. it has worked well for me as i know they are there if i should need them but as my routine was a night taker there is no way i would be able to go and get them when i would need them, subsequently knowing i cannot get to them helps curb the craving as if they are downstairs in my cupboard its simply a 30 sec trip down the stairs to collapse!! may not work for everyone but if this helps at least one person then thats great.

The movements were pretty fast and almost pure water after the first one, but I had little to no pain with the prep process, I fount it easier to switch between a glug of the prep and a swig of strawberry mineral water and some lucozade sport for the electrolytes and hydration. I experienced extreme cold, shivers and some headaches, but nothing too concerning. When it came to the gastroscopy, the staff were lovely, they gave me some banana flavoured anaesthetic throat spray in addition to the sedative they administered into a canula on my arm by syringe. They didn't tell me which or how much, but they were aware that I was worried about the pain, they put a mouth guard in place, I remember them talking, me ""mhm""ing and feeling a little claustrophobic with a lot of hands around my face, the next thing I know, I'm being woken up to say it's time for the colonoscopy, please turn onto your side and hug your arm around yourself tightly. I felt some pain almost immediately, so they administered more sedative, at which point I breathed deeply and tried to block out the pain, I believe I blacked out from pain during the process on several occasions, and then would be breathing quickly, feeling extreme searing pain, but due to the anaesthetic or sedative, I couldn't scream, it was like the pain had taken the ability away, I could only let out an AAGH but it didn't stop them continuing for a good few minutes each time. When they did pause, they dragged the endoscope out and pushed it all the way in again. They couldn't complete it in the end, they got around 3/4 of the way done until I had to   them to stop whilst crying floods of tears. **I'm not writing this to scare anyone, I'm writing it so people are more informed than I was. I expected **MILD DISCOMFORT ** around the bends of my intestine. I did not expect to feel as though my intestine was being twisted, stabbed in 5 places and ripped apart from the inside. **I should also add that I am no stranger to pain. I have several piercings, many tattoos and have broken bones and had many injuries in my lifetime. **This was truly the worst pain I've ever endured, I'm still in shock if I'm honest. The doctor who carried out the procedure has asked to see me again in 3 weeks, presumably to find a way to check the remainder of my intestine. There's not a chance in hell that I'll be getting a colonoscopy again for many years without general anaesthetic. **I understand that many people have this procedure with little or no pain with and without the sedative, I just thought I'd share my experience to see if anyone has had anything similar? ** 0 likes, 0 replies "

Taking Moviprep tomorrow ,"Hiya, Sorry I know this is my third post on here within the last week or so, I am just feeling so isolated and scared right now. I wish I was stronger. So my colonoscopy is on Saturday morning at 9.45AM and I have been instructed to take the dreaded Moviprep tomorrow at 5pm and the second dose between 8pm-9pm. The last couple of days I have tried to stick to a reasonably low fibre diet. Today I have eaten, three slices of white bread, some white pasta and some Rich Tea biscuits. Nothing else..I was planning on eating less than this but hunger got the better of me. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle tomorrow? I am so terrified. Biggest worry is the diarrhoea prior to the colonoscopy and still having it on my journey to/when I arrive to my appointment! It's only a 10 minute car journey but I have this phobia of having an accident on the way there/while I'm there as I've heard the motions are explosive/super urgent:( Does anyone know if its okay to take the Moviprep at 3pm instead, and then the second dose at around 6? Just so I can reduce the likelihood of this happening. How long are the bowel movements likely to last? I feel so sick don't think I'll be sleeping tonight 😦 The reason for my referral is because I have had a deep pelvic ache  on my right side that I've had on and off for 8 months, and alternating mild abdominal pain on left and right side. I think the pelvic pain is related to my bladder as it seems to make me pee more frequently/urgently, but doctor wants to check its nothing to do with my intestines apparently as I have had intense aching/pressure in my rectal area also which is unrelated to bowel movements....feel like this is all so drastic and is just going to make me feel worse. Don't know why I'm going through with this. I feel like I have no one to turn to for support 😦 Thanks for reading, Charlotte 0 likes, 13 replies "

The movements were pretty fast and almost pure water after the first one, but I had little to no pain with the prep process, I fount it easier to switch between a glug of the prep and a swig of strawberry mineral water and some lucozade sport for the electrolytes and hydration. I experienced extreme cold, shivers and some headaches, but nothing too concerning. When it came to the gastroscopy, the staff were lovely, they gave me some banana flavoured anaesthetic throat spray in addition to the sedative they administered into a canula on my arm by syringe. They didn't tell me which or how much, but they were aware that I was worried about the pain, they put a mouth guard in place, I remember them talking, me ""mhm""ing and feeling a little claustrophobic with a lot of hands around my face, the next thing I know, I'm being woken up to say it's time for the colonoscopy, please turn onto your side and hug your arm around yourself tightly. I felt some pain almost immediately, so they administered more sedative, at which point I breathed deeply and tried to block out the pain, I believe I blacked out from pain during the process on several occasions, and then would be breathing quickly, feeling extreme searing pain, but due to the anaesthetic or sedative, I couldn't scream, it was like the pain had taken the ability away, I could only let out an AAGH but it didn't stop them continuing for a good few minutes each time. When they did pause, they dragged the endoscope out and pushed it all the way in again. They couldn't complete it in the end, they got around 3/4 of the way done until I had to   them to stop whilst crying floods of tears. **I'm not writing this to scare anyone, I'm writing it so people are more informed than I was. I expected **MILD DISCOMFORT ** around the bends of my intestine. I did not expect to feel as though my intestine was being twisted, stabbed in 5 places and ripped apart from the inside. **I should also add that I am no stranger to pain. I have several piercings, many tattoos and have broken bones and had many injuries in my lifetime. **This was truly the worst pain I've ever endured, I'm still in shock if I'm honest. The doctor who carried out the procedure has asked to see me again in 3 weeks, presumably to find a way to check the remainder of my intestine. There's not a chance in hell that I'll be getting a colonoscopy again for many years without general anaesthetic. **I understand that many people have this procedure with little or no pain with and without the sedative, I just thought I'd share my experience to see if anyone has had anything similar? ** 0 likes, 3 replies "

It has been suggested by a colorectal consultant that I have a colonoscopy just to double check that everything is okay. I saw him a couple of months a go as I had been experiencing intense aching/pressure in my rectal area which would last for hours at a time which was unrelated to needing the toilet(my bowel movements were normal, no blood, dirrahoea, constipation etc.) He diagnosed me with a condition called proctalgia fugix with possible levator ani syndrome and prescribed me some medication to help me with the pain. I had also been experiencing bladder symptoms for a long time (around a year) where I had been getting frequency on and off and a deep, throbbing ache in the mid-lower right region of my pelvis whenever I drank anything (it would feel like I could feel my bladder filling up). I did mention this to him and he said if it carries on I might need a colonoscopy. Although, for me the pain doesn't feel related to my digestive system it feels like it's too low down and related to my bladder especially with the urinary symptoms I had been having? I started taking the notriptyline and after a couple of weeks I started passing excessive wind and feeling like I needed to go to the toilet quite a lot (worst was about 5 times a day) but when I would go I would pass very little stool and still feel like I wasn't empty.  I would also get mild abdominal pain alternating on my left and right side. My appetite was fine and I didn't feel feverish or anything. This would be a different type of pain and higher up than the pelvic pain. This happened on 8 separate occasions over a month. The intense aching (proctalgia fugix/levator ani pain) continued during this time. I saw him again and mentioned that I had been having some new symptoms. He suggested I try some new medication for the aching which so far has been working really well. He ordered a stool sample test to check for inflammation which came back normal, and when he examined me at his surgery everything looked normal. However, even though the test has come back normal he still wants me to have the colonoscopy. I still have the pelvic pain/urinary symptoms and I have been referred to a urologist for this. My bowel/rectal symptoms have been a lot better the past few weeks (I have had one day where the bad wind/trips to the toilet returned) and I really don't want to have this colonoscopy as it scares me so much. I have heard so many horror stories where people have experienced extreme pain and had long term side effects like diarrhoea, tummy pain that lasted for months afterwards which hadn't happened before the colonoscopy. I am always terrified about the bowl prep (I have been sent Moviprep). For me, it all just seems too much. I am under 30 and as much as I appreciate that the doctor wants to rule out anything sinister I am terrified and I don't want to put myself through this unnecessarily if it's going to cause me more problems down the line. Does anyone have any advice on how to approach this or what their experiences of colonoscopy was like?  I am close to cancelling it because I am so anxious.

I am a woman in my mid thirties and have had a colonoscopy today without sedation and although offered, did not need the gas and air in the end either. The whole bowel was scoped. I would best describe, the additional air, being put into the bowel to iron out the creases, as the scope goes round...as a discomfort type of pain that rises in intensity then lowers, that passed after about 10 seconds of beginning (I think that's how long gas and air takes to work). This discomfort/pain happened two or three times throughout. I had two polyps removed. It was possible to watch on the 'tv' screen but I didn't opt for that.  (The NHS Endoscopist and the Nurse which I conversed with about the procedure itself and many other things throughout the procedure were fantastic).   13 likes, 113 replies "

Leading up to the procedure I was absolutely terrified and spent hours looking for information from people who'd had it done so I thought I would share it for others who may have to have both or either of these investigations.   I am a 45 year old female. I was diagnosed with iron deficiency anaemia about a month ago and because of that my GP wanted me to go for a colonoscopy.  Not until my appointment came through did I realise I was also having the upper endoscopy done at the same time.  Both of these procedures were terrifying to me and it was hard to work out which I was most nervous about; something going down my throat or something where the sun don't shine!   I was sent some industrial strength laxatives with instructions on how to use them.  Two days before I had to eat a low residue diet.  In fact all I ate was white bread toasted.  On the morning of the day before I was allowed some breakfast then only clear fluids (juice, water, black coffee/tea) from then onwards.  At 2pm I had to take 10 senokot tablets.  Nothing happened.  At 4pm I had to mix one sachet of a powder (can't remember the name) with 8oz of hot water and wait half an hour before drinking it.  Tasted very citrusy and ok at first but after a few mouthfulls it didn't taste too good but not as bad as some people describe.  Nothing happened until about an hour or so later when I got quite severe stomach cramps and 'runs' to the loo!  That was it from then; regular need to visit the loo with very little warning other than rumblings in the lower abdomen.  I had to take a further sachet at 7pm.  Apart from the first  bout of severe cramps I had no pain; just exhausting regular visits to the loo until about midnight and a couple when I got up early in the morning of the day of the procedure.  The day of my appointment I cried all the way to the hospital (my partner came with me).  I cried the whole time I was in the waiting room and when they were booking me in (check bp etc).  I hadn't signed the consent form (which they'd sent with the appointment information) because I wanted to make sure that the Dr knew how terrified I was.  He came to see me before I was taken to the procedure room (which was a sort of operating theatre) and promised me he would make sure I was well sedated (asleep!) before he started. The nurse had put a canula for IV meds into the back of my hand.  I walked into the procedure room ( still crying  :roll: ).  Before the sedation was given and because I was having the upper endoscopy aswell, the Dr sprayed my throat with a local anaesthetic (tastes like vodka mixed with banana), they had to give me this mouth piece which is there to protect your teeth from the scope; they also put a little sponge attached to a tube in your nostril which gives you oxygen while you're sedated.  The Dr started putting in the IV sedation which was midazolam and a narcotic pain relief called fentanyl.  I told him it wasn't working and he assured me it was; he was right as I have no memory or knowledge of the upper endoscopy; I have a very vague recollection of waking up during the colonoscopy; I was aware it was very uncomfortable but felt disasociated from the pain and more interested in the image on the television screen from the camera!  They must've given me more meds because the next thing I know I was waking up in recovery feeling euphoric with relief  because they were telling me it was all over  :P  I was then allowed to sleep for an hour when they woke me up offering tea and biscuits.  They asked me to try walking to the loo and back to make sure I wasn't going to keel over then took me (with my partner) in to a private room to give me the test results.  They like you to have someone with you for this part because the midazolam makes you forget things.  For about 2 days afterwards I was very very tired and forgetful but am fine now (3 days later) and have been to work today no problems.  I'm sorry this is such a long posting, but it's so hard to find detailed descriptions of these things and for most people these sort of investigations are very fearful prospects and I wanted to share a relatively postive experience in the hope it might help someone else feel less anxious leading up to their appointment.  I hope never to have it done again; but if I do I will not be anywhere near as scared or worried as I was before this first one.  I swear I was so scared I was awake most nights leading up to it worrying and googling it (you'll find plenty of horror stories which is why I thought I'd attempt to redress the balance with a positive one).  If you are scare and/or, like me, you have a low pain threshold, then don't be affraid to tell the staff and ask them to make sure you are well sedated. The staff in the endoscopy unit were lovely and very very compassionate and supportive. 25 likes, 139 replies "

I hadn't signed the consent form (which they'd sent with the appointment information) because I wanted to make sure that the Dr knew how terrified I was.  He came to see me before I was taken to the procedure room (which was a sort of operating theatre) and promised me he would make sure I was well sedated (asleep!) before he started. The nurse had put a canula for IV meds into the back of my hand.  I walked into the procedure room ( still crying  :roll: ).  Before the sedation was given and because I was having the upper endoscopy aswell, the Dr sprayed my throat with a local anaesthetic (tastes like vodka mixed with banana), they had to give me this mouth piece which is there to protect your teeth from the scope; they also put a little sponge attached to a tube in your nostril which gives you oxygen while you're sedated.  The Dr started putting in the IV sedation which was midazolam and a narcotic pain relief called fentanyl.  I told him it wasn't working and he assured me it was; he was right as I have no memory or knowledge of the upper endoscopy; I have a very vague recollection of waking up during the colonoscopy; I was aware it was very uncomfortable but felt disasociated from the pain and more interested in the image on the television screen from the camera!  They must've given me more meds because the next thing I know I was waking up in recovery feeling euphoric with relief  because they were telling me it was all over  :P  I was then allowed to sleep for an hour when they woke me up offering tea and biscuits.  They asked me to try walking to the loo and back to make sure I wasn't going to keel over then took me (with my partner) in to a private room to give me the test results.  They like you to have someone with you for this part because the midazolam makes you forget things.  For about 2 days afterwards I was very very tired and forgetful but am fine now (3 days later) and have been to work today no problems.  I'm sorry this is such a long posting, but it's so hard to find detailed descriptions of these things and for most people these sort of investigations are very fearful prospects and I wanted to share a relatively postive experience in the hope it might help someone else feel less anxious leading up to their appointment.  I hope never to have it done again; but if I do I will not be anywhere near as scared or worried as I was before this first one.  I swear I was so scared I was awake most nights leading up to it worrying and googling it (you'll find plenty of horror stories which is why I thought I'd attempt to redress the balance with a positive one).  If you are scare and/or, like me, you have a low pain threshold, then don't be affraid to tell the staff and ask them to make sure you are well sedated. The staff in the endoscopy unit were lovely and very very compassionate and supportive. 25 likes, 139 replies "

Leading up to the procedure I was absolutely terrified and spent hours looking for information from people who'd had it done so I thought I would share it for others who may have to have both or either of these investigations.   I am a 45 year old female. I was diagnosed with iron deficiency anaemia about a month ago and because of that my GP wanted me to go for a colonoscopy.  Not until my appointment came through did I realise I was also having the upper endoscopy done at the same time.  Both of these procedures were terrifying to me and it was hard to work out which I was most nervous about; something going down my throat or something where the sun don't shine!   I was sent some industrial strength laxatives with instructions on how to use them.  Two days before I had to eat a low residue diet.  In fact all I ate was white bread toasted.  On the morning of the day before I was allowed some breakfast then only clear fluids (juice, water, black coffee/tea) from then onwards.  At 2pm I had to take 10 senokot tablets.  Nothing happened.  At 4pm I had to mix one sachet of a powder (can't remember the name) with 8oz of hot water and wait half an hour before drinking it.  Tasted very citrusy and ok at first but after a few mouthfulls it didn't taste too good but not as bad as some people describe.  Nothing happened until about an hour or so later when I got quite severe stomach cramps and 'runs' to the loo!  That was it from then; regular need to visit the loo with very little warning other than rumblings in the lower abdomen.  I had to take a further sachet at 7pm.

I went to work while doing the bowel prep, wasnt advised not to and the hospital was suprised when they found out I had gone to work. The procedure itself was nothing short of horrific, I was screaming in pain and begging them to stop and I heard the Dr ask 'as she calmed down yet' this is not what I wanted to hear, he could of asked if I was ok. Anyway nothing was found except 3 internal haemorrhoids which were banded.  The pain after was excruciating, I was sick and rolling around the bed in agony, not offered any pain relief.  I kept saying how ill I felt and how much pain I was in and it fell on deaf ears.  I was sent home with no   or aftercare advice, I wasnt told what painkillers to take and advised to take a day off work due to the sedation and not the procedure. Every painkiller I took didnt get anywhere near the pain, warm baths are the only thing that helped a little.  I couldnt make work for 3 days as I say I was on a scale of 10 for pain and here I am a week later still in pain.  I have chronic leg pain, stomach pain and painful bum, my skin feels tender and bruised,  I just dont feel right and have chronic   and nausea.  I have to go to work today and feel so ill and tired. I am thinking of complaining about the procedure and aftercare but dont think it will solve anything.  How have others found the banding procedure???? 3 likes, 49 replies "

I’m feeling at my wit’s end and don’t quite know what to do, so any thoughts at all would be very much appreciated. I’ll try to keep it brief, but basically I have had constipation for about 6 ½ years now. It started very suddenly (potentially after being on iron supplements) and since then I have been taking Dulcolax daily. I have been back and forth to the GP and then a GI specialist at the hospital constantly. Until I moved to a new town (about 3 yrs ago) I was just getting fobbed off, told it’s all in my head, I’m too young to have anything wrong with me, it’s my fault, or simply eat some kiwis (I kid you not!). I’m now 26, going on 27, and the past year or two I’ve had a few answers. Not one GP or specialist has made any suggestions of what’s wrong or offered to send me for tests I need, however. I have had to research, tell them what I think’s wrong and push to get tests or treatment. So, in a nutshell: -   Constipation for 6 ½ years, sudden onset. Then sudden weight lost (down to 4.5 stone), unexplained. Quick decline in energy. I’ve since put weight on and am now 7 ½ stone. No improvement in any symptoms. Feel full, uncomfortable, pain. No bowl movement at all if no laxative. Dulcolax works but others, including newer ones like Prucalopride, don’t seem to work.  On Dulcolax it can be unpredictable at times, very much liquid form usually, mucus (sorry for the grim details).. I’ve tried all dietary changes, spent a fortune on supplements and treatments, but nothing has helped. -   Frequent urination. There’s almost constant pressure on my bladder and I can wee every half an hour. Sometimes I can’t go properly, so I stand up and a minute later I need to go. Incredibly frustrating! -   Pernicious Anaemia – injection every 3 months for just over 2 years now. I also have iron deficiency anaemia but have only recently started on supplements again once a week due to my experience last time.  I also have folic deficiency. -   Amenorrhea – no periods since all of this started. I’ve had periods when on the pill but no periods at all when not on it (ie. I’ve been off the pill the last 2 years and no period). GP said I was a ‘conundrum’ and left it at that. After pushing, I’ve managed to get a gynae appointment for April. -   Hypothyroidism – I had to push for the tests, then argue them, then push for treatment. Now on Levothyroxine 50mg, upped to 75 every other day. No noticeable improvement in energy though the tingling, such as in my hands, seems to have stopped, and I’m not crying in exhaustion after work every day (though I still feel like that!) Recent tests over the last couple of months are more interesting. I did say I thought I had a prolapse all those years ago and was told ‘you’re fine, stop trying to find problems where there aren’t any’… -    Sitzmarker transit study – Did not go to the loo for the whole duration so all marks still there. Markers mixed up but most are all down the left side of the colon. Suggests possible slow transit (perhaps from all the years of laxatives? Or perhaps because I was full before the study started so they had no where to go?). -   Defacating Proctogram – I had to ask several times for this. They told me on the day in Oxford JR I had a rectocele and full rectal prolapse, but would have to look at it further to tell me any more. He said it wasn’t surprising I was constipated, in pain or having such issues with weeing. My GI specialist saw me yesterday for the results. He said it was a rectocele (I think he mentioned 2.5 something…?), rectal prolapse and intussusception grade 5. I was caught off guard yesterday as I wasn’t expecting the latter about intussusception, nor the Sitzmarker results. When he emailed me about the Sitzmarker results he had told me all of the markers were right down the bottom of the colon, which they were not! He had suggested biofeedback, which I said no to and asked for the proctogram because I thought I had a prolapse, so I’m glad I stuck to my guns on that one. He is referring me to ‘his colorectal surgeon’. I had wanted to ask to be referred to the Oxford Pelvic Floor Clinic as I’ve lost all faith in this GI and my GP but I wasn’t expecting the results I got, and not knowing much about intussusception I didn’t know what to say. GI tried numerous times to ‘sell’ me some of the latest laxatives and suppositories I could be a guinea pig for and I was nearly in tears trying to get him to understand the prolapse/rectoele etc need to be dealt with and that I don’t want any more darned pills that don’t work. I don’t know what I’m looking for. I guess I’ve spent so long trying to keep all to myself and it’s cost me a lot. I have no friends, social life, I left my relationship, and now I’m really struggling in my job (I’m an advice and support worker). I’m getting impatient. It’s been long enough but now it will be more weeks or months to see the GI’s surgeon, probably be referred to someone else as he doesn’t know anything, and so on…  I guess I’m wondering whether anyone has been to Oxford Pelvic Floor Clinic, how long you waited, or whether going private may be an option (potentially a very expensive one?). I want to think this could all be explained by the rectocele, prolapse and intussusception, and that a laparoscopic ventral rectopexy could solve the issues, followed by months of retraining my bowel due to having spent years on laxatives. Or perhaps that’s wishful thinking? I’m just so fed up, disheartened, shattered and now at a loss for where to go from here. Sorry for the long rant. If anyone manages to read it all, then I apologise. Thanks in advance if anyone does have any thoughts as they would be very much appreciated. Caz  0 likes, 19 replies "

It started very suddenly (potentially after being on iron supplements) and since then I have been taking Dulcolax daily. I have been back and forth to the GP and then a GI specialist at the hospital constantly. Until I moved to a new town (about 3 yrs ago) I was just getting fobbed off, told it’s all in my head, I’m too young to have anything wrong with me, it’s my fault, or simply eat some kiwis (I kid you not!). I’m now 26, going on 27, and the past year or two I’ve had a few answers. Not one GP or specialist has made any suggestions of what’s wrong or offered to send me for tests I need, however. I have had to research, tell them what I think’s wrong and push to get tests or treatment. So, in a nutshell: -   Constipation for 6 ½ years, sudden onset. Then sudden weight lost (down to 4.5 stone), unexplained. Quick decline in energy. I’ve since put weight on and am now 7 ½ stone. No improvement in any symptoms. Feel full, uncomfortable, pain. No bowl movement at all if no laxative. Dulcolax works but others, including newer ones like Prucalopride, don’t seem to work.  On Dulcolax it can be unpredictable at times, very much liquid form usually, mucus (sorry for the grim details).. I’ve tried all dietary changes, spent a fortune on supplements and treatments, but nothing has helped. -   Frequent urination. There’s almost constant pressure on my bladder and I can wee every half an hour. Sometimes I can’t go properly, so I stand up and a minute later I need to go. Incredibly frustrating! -   Pernicious Anaemia – injection every 3 months for just over 2 years now. I also have iron deficiency anaemia but have only recently started on supplements again once a week due to my experience last time.  I also have folic deficiency. -   Amenorrhea – no periods since all of this started. I’ve had periods when on the pill but no periods at all when not on it (ie. I’ve been off the pill the last 2 years and no period). GP said I was a ‘conundrum’ and left it at that. After pushing, I’ve managed to get a gynae appointment for April. -   Hypothyroidism – I had to push for the tests, then argue them, then push for treatment. Now on Levothyroxine 50mg, upped to 75 every other day. No noticeable improvement in energy though the tingling, such as in my hands, seems to have stopped, and I’m not crying in exhaustion after work every day (though I still feel like that!) Recent tests over the last couple of months are more interesting. I did say I thought I had a prolapse all those years ago and was told ‘you’re fine, stop trying to find problems where there aren’t any’… -    Sitzmarker transit study – Did not go to the loo for the whole duration so all marks still there. Markers mixed up but most are all down the left side of the colon. Suggests possible slow transit (perhaps from all the years of laxatives? Or perhaps because I was full before the study started so they had no where to go?). -   Defacating Proctogram – I had to ask several times for this. They told me on the day in Oxford JR I had a rectocele and full rectal prolapse, but would have to look at it further to tell me any more. He said it wasn’t surprising I was constipated, in pain or having such issues with weeing. My GI specialist saw me yesterday for the results. He said it was a rectocele (I think he mentioned 2.5 something…?), rectal prolapse and intussusception grade 5. I was caught off guard yesterday as I wasn’t expecting the latter about intussusception, nor the Sitzmarker results. When he emailed me about the Sitzmarker results he had told me all of the markers were right down the bottom of the colon, which they were not! He had suggested biofeedback, which I said no to and asked for the proctogram because I thought I had a prolapse, so I’m glad I stuck to my guns on that one. He is referring me to ‘his colorectal surgeon’. I had wanted to ask to be referred to the Oxford Pelvic Floor Clinic as I’ve lost all faith in this GI and my GP but I wasn’t expecting the results I got, and not knowing much about intussusception I didn’t know what to say. GI tried numerous times to ‘sell’ me some of the latest laxatives and suppositories I could be a guinea pig for and I was nearly in tears trying to get him to understand the prolapse/rectoele etc need to be dealt with and that I don’t want any more darned pills that don’t work. I don’t know what I’m looking for. I guess I’ve spent so long trying to keep all to myself and it’s cost me a lot. I have no friends, social life, I left my relationship, and now I’m really struggling in my job (I’m an advice and support worker). I’m getting impatient. It’s been long enough but now it will be more weeks or months to see the GI’s surgeon, probably be referred to someone else as he doesn’t know anything, and so on…  I guess I’m wondering whether anyone has been to Oxford Pelvic Floor Clinic, how long you waited, or whether going private may be an option (potentially a very expensive one?). I want to think this could all be explained by the rectocele, prolapse and intussusception, and that a laparoscopic ventral rectopexy could solve the issues, followed by months of retraining my bowel due to having spent years on laxatives. Or perhaps that’s wishful thinking? I’m just so fed up, disheartened, shattered and now at a loss for where to go from here. Sorry for the long rant. If anyone manages to read it all, then I apologise. Thanks in advance if anyone does have any thoughts as they would be very much appreciated. Caz  0 likes, 19 replies "

I’m feeling at my wit’s end and don’t quite know what to do, so any thoughts at all would be very much appreciated. I’ll try to keep it brief, but basically I have had constipation for about 6 ½ years now. It started very suddenly (potentially after being on iron supplements) and since then I have been taking Dulcolax daily. I have been back and forth to the GP and then a GI specialist at the hospital constantly. Until I moved to a new town (about 3 yrs ago) I was just getting fobbed off, told it’s all in my head, I’m too young to have anything wrong with me, it’s my fault, or simply eat some kiwis (I kid you not!). I’m now 26, going on 27, and the past year or two I’ve had a few answers. Not one GP or specialist has made any suggestions of what’s wrong or offered to send me for tests I need, however. I have had to research, tell them what I think’s wrong and push to get tests or treatment. So, in a nutshell: -   Constipation for 6 ½ years, sudden onset. Then sudden weight lost (down to 4.5 stone), unexplained. Quick decline in energy. I’ve since put weight on and am now 7 ½ stone. No improvement in any symptoms. Feel full, uncomfortable, pain. No bowl movement at all if no laxative. Dulcolax works but others, including newer ones like Prucalopride, don’t seem to work.  On Dulcolax it can be unpredictable at times, very much liquid form usually, mucus (sorry for the grim details).. I’ve tried all dietary changes, spent a fortune on supplements and treatments, but nothing has helped. -   Frequent urination. There’s almost constant pressure on my bladder and I can wee every half an hour. Sometimes I can’t go properly, so I stand up and a minute later I need to go. Incredibly frustrating! -   Pernicious Anaemia – injection every 3 months for just over 2 years now. I also have iron deficiency anaemia but have only recently started on supplements again once a week due to my experience last time.  I also have folic deficiency. -   Amenorrhea – no periods since all of this started. I’ve had periods when on the pill but no periods at all when not on it (ie. I’ve been off the pill the last 2 years and no period). GP said I was a ‘conundrum’ and left it at that. After pushing, I’ve managed to get a gynae appointment for April. -   Hypothyroidism – I had to push for the tests, then argue them, then push for treatment. Now on Levothyroxine 50mg, upped to 75 every other day. No noticeable improvement in energy though the tingling, such as in my hands, seems to have stopped, and I’m not crying in exhaustion after work every day (though I still feel like that!) Recent tests over the last couple of months are more interesting. I did say I thought I had a prolapse all those years ago and was told ‘you’re fine, stop trying to find problems where there aren’t any’… -    Sitzmarker transit study – Did not go to the loo for the whole duration so all marks still there. Markers mixed up but most are all down the left side of the colon. Suggests possible slow transit (perhaps from all the years of laxatives? Or perhaps because I was full before the study started so they had no where to go?). -   Defacating Proctogram – I had to ask several times for this. They told me on the day in Oxford JR I had a rectocele and full rectal prolapse, but would have to look at it further to tell me any more. He said it wasn’t surprising I was constipated, in pain or having such issues with weeing. My GI specialist saw me yesterday for the results. He said it was a rectocele (I think he mentioned 2.5 something…?), rectal prolapse and intussusception grade 5. I was caught off guard yesterday as I wasn’t expecting the latter about intussusception, nor the Sitzmarker results. When he emailed me about the Sitzmarker results he had told me all of the markers were right down the bottom of the colon, which they were not! He had suggested biofeedback, which I said no to and asked for the proctogram because I thought I had a prolapse, so I’m glad I stuck to my guns on that one. He is referring me to ‘his colorectal surgeon’. I had wanted to ask to be referred to the Oxford Pelvic Floor Clinic as I’ve lost all faith in this GI and my GP but I wasn’t expecting the results I got, and not knowing much about intussusception I didn’t know what to say. GI tried numerous times to ‘sell’ me some of the latest laxatives and suppositories I could be a guinea pig for and I was nearly in tears trying to get him to understand the prolapse/rectoele etc need to be dealt with and that I don’t want any more darned pills that don’t work. I don’t know what I’m looking for. I guess I’ve spent so long trying to keep all to myself and it’s cost me a lot. I have no friends, social life, I left my relationship, and now I’m really struggling in my job (I’m an advice and support worker). I’m getting impatient. It’s been long enough but now it will be more weeks or months to see the GI’s surgeon, probably be referred to someone else as he doesn’t know anything, and so on…  I guess I’m wondering whether anyone has been to Oxford Pelvic Floor Clinic, how long you waited, or whether going private may be an option (potentially a very expensive one?). I want to think this could all be explained by the rectocele, prolapse and intussusception, and that a laparoscopic ventral rectopexy could solve the issues, followed by months of retraining my bowel due to having spent years on laxatives. Or perhaps that’s wishful thinking? I’m just so fed up, disheartened, shattered and now at a loss for where to go from here. Sorry for the long rant. If anyone manages to read it all, then I apologise. Thanks in advance if anyone does have any thoughts as they would be very much appreciated. Caz  0 likes, 19 replies "

If anyone manages to read it all, then I apologise. Thanks in advance if anyone does have any thoughts as they would be very much appreciated. Caz  0 likes, 19 replies "

Well, about a month or so ago I Haden horrible horrible reflux. The meds the doc gave me did not work at all. Me, being who I am lol revenged the Internet for a natural solution. I found quite a few things for acid reflux, to treat it naturally. One of those things I found was Slippery Elm. I read it protects the stomach and intestines from the acid reflux. I was worried about the damage that may be caused from the acid so I decided to order Slippery Elm and try it (after reading a ton of info on it first, which you should do too I found you choose to try it) always verify for yourself before tryin go anything natural. Funny enough, the slippery elm did not help my acid reflux AT ALL! The thing that did heal my acid reflux was fresh cabbage juice (yes, yuck! But tolerable if you ad a few oranges to the juice and a lemon. If it’s still too hard to drink, add a small spoon of honey) FYI;only the juice worked,  tried the soup with cabbage, it didn’t help. Ok so I was taking Slippery Elm which didn’t help at all for my acid reflux but do you know, by my surprise, what it did help? Omg yes, it was giving me the best bowel movements ever!  I couldn’t believe it, no more straining, the bm slipped out as if it was coated in slime (yes, I know, gross but for someone who has been constipated for years, it makes you want to get up and dance! Celebrate!!!) The science behind it is simple, Slippery Elm when wet turns into a very sticky, slimy, slippery dough like substance (if you eat a spoon of the powder, you will notice your mouth in some places is completely coated in it and I think feels so very slippery to your tongue but sticks like glue almost! You have to use something to scrape it off the sides of your teeth lol) it must do the same in your bowels, once mixed in your food, and stuck to the sides of your bowels, it creates a slip n slide for your BM! Your BM basically slips right out! It works, isn’t too expensive, can be found online and probably at any herb store, and is super easy to take! I take it with every meal. You could try at your own pace, take a half teaspoon before breakfast, and beforehand dinner. I read you can take up to 2 teaspoons safely and can imagine you could take more, it’s harmless from what I read.

My bowel movements are really weird. Sometimes I have a sensation of going to the washroom then it stops a few minutes later. Other times, I would have to wait a while to have a bowel movement. Most of the times I feel there is still feces stuck in my rectum but no matter how much I push, it's still there. I had a colonoscopy, the result is normal. As for difficulty swallowing, I always feel food get stuck on the way down. It would come down eventually. I burp a lot then I would feel some of the food got moved. Sometimes I burp,  a few pieces of food would come back up. I went for barrium swallow, and motility test, which all showed normal. Does anyone out there have the same problems?

Have not gone in almost 5 days.,"[background info] - (can skip to problem if you like) Hi, I'm 15 yrs/o and have been constantly constipated since I was (maybe 10/11 yrs/o). I have up to 2 BMs per week. It took me until this year to finally realize I need to eat healthier, however I realized this a tad too late and now it's like no matter what I do I can't get normal BMs again and it does get me really down. I've only gone to the doc twice and that was back when I was 12ish. I find it EXTREMELY difficult to tell my mom, (emphasis on EXTREMELY). My mom has seriously no patience and is usually busy and forgets about things i tell her and I'd much rather avoid telling her about the constipation(also very embarrassing). I'm super reluctant to ask for help until it gets really bad. Which is, very bad and I'm super aware of it. This is really stressing me out.  Extra info: I don't hold in my poop anymore (I did when i was younger due to extreme anxiety with using public/school bathrooms and sometimes even at home) but now I can't help but 'hold it in' as i get barely any urge to go(hence i can only go up to 2 times a week). I typically get the urge twice or less per week where I'd have a bowel movement. I also always have to strain whiile going (maybe not with almost liquidy stools) it's not full on straining but im definately pushing a fair bit to get it out. [actual problem] Stool is wayyy too large to pass (i managed to squeeze a small bit out, however i didn't strain too much because im terrified of anal prolapse). I feel very backed up. Wondering if there's anything i can do now? What would a doctor say/give me?? And about my problem with not getting an urge- will they want me to get a colonoscopy??(do not want under any circumstances) Was also wondering if the stool will still be hard to pass and if I'll still have to strain if i use an enema?( not that i even have one  ( ). How do enemas feel? Please describe in detail? Sorry for all the questions and messy explanation, this is just stressing me out and idk i get real emotional and depressed due to it. Regardless, thank you for reading and i hope i can get some help!  2 likes, 27 replies "

Seeking some advise as my wife struggles to clear her bowels unless taking medication. She has been diagnosed with slow transit constipation but it seems there are no answers to it. Im really worried about her. She is always bloated, always in pain with it and always exhausted no matter how much she sleeps. She has a reasonably healthy diet and not overweight but she can go weeks without passing her bowels and is forced to use   (more than recommended dose) to get anything moving. Just after your own experiences? We are going to make some diet changes etc and see if anything will help. I'm convinces the tiredness is due to bad stuff in her body constantly. I've red about dairy free, no red meat, enemas, magnesium supplements and a few others. What we really want to achieve is something that is a permanent change and enable her to get back to some kind of normal life! It's painful for me watching it I can't imagine going through it! 0 likes, 10 replies "

I rarely have any issues or abnormalities with bowel movements so this whole situation is rather odd. So over the last 10 days, I have been relatively regular, going every day or every other day. But the stools have been very difficult to pass and have required quite a bit of straining and are larger than normal and hard. It is almost like passing meatballs, if that makes any sense. During this time, I have experienced some pain and tearing near the opening of the anus that has lead to some minor bleeding. This shows itself as streaks of bright red blood on the stool and the paper. I have been treating it with Prep. H and it has been improving significantly. However tonight, when I used the bathroom, I passed two pieces of stool that were seemingly covered in certain parts with bloody mucus. I have never seen anything like this before. The mucus is separate from the stool, slimy, and unquestionably red. The color is a brighter red I would say, rather than dark or maroon. And even though it seemed to be on the stool ... it was not really ""mixed"" with the stool. Some time ago, my GI doctor suggested that I may have IBS and treated me with IBGard. Last month I experienced a few weeks of lower abdominal cramping and discomfort even though stools were normal. This has relatively stopped but has been replaced by this bout of constipation. I eat plenty of fiber and drink water constantly. And I saw my primary care physician just yesterday and he prescribed the antibiotic Doxycicline for a separate issue that he believes may be due to a bacterial infection not related at all to my digestive tract. Apparently a serious side effect of Doxy is bloody stools but I have only taken two doses and really doubt it is the cause. I will call my doctor's office tomorrow and see what he wants to do. So my question, for those who have experienced constipation ... can constipation and straining possibly lead to bloody mucus on/in stool? I have pictures as well. My apologies for the graphic nature of the pictures. And also my sincere thanks to anyone and everyone who takes the time to read/see all this. Cheers all! 0 likes, 9 replies "

I have some swelling now on the other leg with some of that funny discoloration but no pain so I wasn't thinking that my CRPS was really spreading. However, my old bladder issues are suddenly coming back to life. A year ago I had to undergo 6 months of pelvic floor physical therapy to get rid of massive pelvic floor muscular over-tension. Those muscles had themselves so worked up into a state of constant tension that my whole abdomen felt like it was on fire all day long. It was awful. They told me at the time that is happens to chronic pain patients, those type of semi-involuntary muscles just stress out when your body is subjected to constant pain and stress. I am now thinking it was CRPS starting up. In any case, I am feeling it again and am petrified of having to go through all that again. Has anyone here been diagnosed with bonafide CRPS of the bladder or just the abdomen?  What does that feel like?  I am hopeful that the intrathecal pain pump will alleviate this pain too, but just in case, I have started the ball rolling to get an appointment at the pelvic floor PT place.  0 likes, 0 replies "

The surgery went well and my knee is looking and feeling great! I had a femoral nerve block which they believe may not have worked as I was in a large amount of pain after surgery and I spent a few hours longer than I was supposed to in recovery. About a week after the surgery (just as I started trying to walk without a crutch), I started having a sharp pain that came from the inside of my ankle. I ignored it at first, but it starting getting worse. After a few days, I started having electric shock pains radiating up my leg from my ankle and the area became very sensitive and felt like it was burning. Around this time my shin just below my knee also had similar symptoms (burning and sensitivity to light touch) and recently I've also had electric shock pains radiating from it. Both are sensitive to having blankets on them or going into water. It's painful but I wouldn't say it was excruciating. The burning and sensitivity to light touch happen when I'm sitting down and the electric shock pains only really happen when I straighten my leg and the first few steps when I start walking. A few days after that I started having tingling and burning in my two outside toes of my operated leg and that had now spread to the soles of   of my feet. All these pains get better when I start walking around for a couple of minutes. The longer I walk around and do my physio exercises the better they get. I can touch all these spots and the pain usually subsides for a second as well. Hard pressure seems to be much better than soft pressure. My doctor put me on Lyrica (100mg in the morning and 100mg at night). This seems to have worked quite well. I'm not pain free, but it's much less noticeable - although the tingling in the soles of my feet isn't really affected by the Lyrica. It only started when I upped my dosage of Lyrica - so I'm not sure if it's just a side effect. My surgeon believes I may have CRPS, as he was adamant he didn't go near any nerves, but every doctor and physio I've seen doubts that's true. I don't have any skin discoloration, swelling or temperature changes. From what I've read CRPS is not something you'd want to have. Can anyone who is familiar with the condition comment on weather they think my symptoms are related to CRPS? It's really starting to worry me that I might have it.

A lot of swelling and bruising but I assume that was normal for post OP.  But oh lord the pain!  I had been given 20 tablets of 5 mg oxycodone  for post OP.   Normally one would knock me out.  I took one, didnt touch it.  So a half hour later I took another.... I was desperate. I also took a phenergan as it was making me nauseous.  It literally did not even touch the pain. I was still in tears.  I went to see the surgeon. She mentioned the area that was bruised and that I was having the burning pain in follows the saphenous nerve.

Overall I left feeling like I was being a baby and that this must be normal post OP pain and if others can deal with it, I would too. The bruising continued. It oddly was in two very straight lines, like someone took a ruler and drew them on, down my shin and my ankle.  My knee itself was healing beautifully.   I continue to have this burning pain.  The upper shin pain remained an intense pain like none I have ever had (and I've had natural childbirth lol).  The area down my shin and into my ankle feels sunburnt. VERY sensitive to light touch (even clothes).  It occasionally feels like pinpricks shooting at the best.  And like fire ants are stinging all down my leg at its worst. I went to another appt the following week but since I assumed this was all normalize, I didn't mention that it still remained. My husband did tell the surgeon but she kind of ignored him and I didnt want to feel like a ""weenie"" so I didn't push it. Now, 2 weeks later, and a month post OP, the weird symptoms continue. Only now the pain in my foot is terrible. I feel like I could walk ok on my knee, but my foot hurts too much and that makes me limp.  I had forced myself to push through physical therapy regardless of the pain bc I assumed it was normal and again I was being a weenie.
