I had sex tonight and my vagina felt so loose and big and the bulges are still there just the same as before, maybe worse. A regular gynecologist/obgyn did my repairs. He said if  I really think it has failed for me to come in and he will refer me to a urogynocoly doctor for a repeat surgery. I am only 23. I am devastated!! I have never had a vaginal birth, I have had 4 C-Sections. I am just really so depressed and ready to give up. All this has made me hate myself. I have lost myself completely. I have been through so much and nothing seems to go right and I'm just so tired...I just want to know how soon I will be able to have a 2nd repair with a SPECIALIST that will do my surgery THE RIGHT WAY!

I don't think that has really affected my health and I thought nothing of it until recently; I'd always been assured that Gilbert's showed no real symptoms to speak of. I'm a 42 y.o. m, soft but not overweight, I've never smoked but I did drink regularly throughout my late 20s and 30s. Maybe for a number of years, I drank more than I really should have and I started cutting back on drinking last year; in February I pretty much stopped drinking altogether because.... I started generally feeling sickly. Most concerning, I was feeling aching/bruising feelings around my right and left lower rib-cage and morning nausea in addition to uncomfortable bowel movements sometimes (either too hard or too soft) and fatigue in the afternoon. I thought if I stopped drinking, I would feel better. Aaaaand I went through some light/moderate withdrawal symptoms (including some really bad anxiety) which made me think that I had been drinking too often for too long. Soon after, I had blood-work done, general check-ups and an ultrasound of my abdomen and the doctor told me that she wasn't worried about my health and that the withdrawal-related feelings would fade over time. Well, the bruising sensations around my lower-left ribs didn't go away. I had a general checkup in September, including blood-work and swallowing a radioactive barium milkshake to look at my stomach (everything seemed normal). I had an endoscope put down my throat to take pictures of my stomach (everything looked normal). I also had a CT scan to look at my abdomen, especially at my pancreas because I began to think it was early alcohol-pancreatitis. Nothing life-threatening was found on the CT; my doctor says he doesn't think it's my pancreas (though he cannot definitely say no). So basically all of my tests keep coming-back normal. So since all of my tests look fine, I started to wonder: could this have to do with Glibert's? I really don't know. Now: I've been getting some really bad fatigue, some brain fog, some stomach-cramping and nausea (especially when I wake up). When I drink some alcohol, I either get a really uncomfortable stomach (cramping/twisting feelings) for a day or two after or odd bruising sensations mainly on my left side, just around the bottom of my ribs. My stools have been mixed (sometimes hard, sometimes soft).  I'm still concerned about this being early pancreatitis but I just don't know. I haven't had anything to drink for the past 4 weeks and I'm too scared to try drinking anything again. I'm not sure what to think at this point.

When the bad stomach passed I would be able to eat normally and I would eat everything. I could never identify a specific food causing the problem, but I could have an attack and be sat on the loo, until it passed. Rest was always a big healer and the only way my stomach could sort itself out. I was a nervous child and most people would say I was nervous, but this would happen suddenly sometimes and I knew in myself that my stomach didn't work properly. At the time my gran who was a nurse almost guessed that there was something going on with my Liver, as I looked mildly yellow. As I got older my stomach problems expanded due to the stress of going to work. At 17 years old the episodes of stomach trouble were then diagnosed as IBS. The fatigue and shear exhaustion kicked in, as working made you tired and the rest was not available as it was when you were a young child. So I battled on with these episodes that would occasionally make me have time off work or I would suffer at work, just thinking that I have IBS and this is the way I am. I never really ever felt well. The attacks stopped my career as a qualified Spatial Designer and stopped my confidence to move away from my family to London where the work was, as I knew that I would have days that confined me to lie down and rest. How reliable would I be in a fast paced career like that. So by know I take an office job in my 20's where I knew I will could sit down on those bad days and struggle on with out being noticing I was ill. As the years went on, I had two boys 12 months apart. One birth was very demanding and stressful on my body as he was very large and the other was so large that a C section was performed. After the births, both being difficult, I looked so yellow. The photos of me show how my body and my Liver must of been coping. And off course at the time, I felt ill. This period of time was a blurr. Obviously with the care of 2 babies, the exhaustion of two years of being pregnant, followed by two heavy babies to lift, no sleep, breast feeding and of course my very bad stomach. I felt terrible. So I ended up at the doctors feeling so sick and ill.......I ended up on anti sickness drugs to cope. Then the doctor did a blood test and continued to tell me that I had IBS and was tired. Then the Gilberts Syndrome was found on the results and I was told that this wouldn't be causing me the symptoms. So like you do, you look on the internet and everyone is saying about the symptoms that I had. Goodness, a revelation........but no medication or acknowledgement of these symptoms! I have explained to many doctors that people report symptoms but they almost don't want to hear that. Are they trained to believe only what they have been told. If lots of people have stomach pain, exhaustion etc, why are they not open to this? So at this time I am about 34 years old. As my two boys grew up my pain then progressed and with my pain over the years some other factors have come to light that I am convinced may be related or are linked by the Liver's difficulties. I have several allergies now as I've aged.... Hayfever from age 17 years, Allergy to Mould, Rosin (Sap of Pine Trees), Sodium Metabisulfite (preservative in Food medicines), very sick on aneasthetics. My body and my immune system is under stress and can not process these.  All of these allergies have been confirmed by the hospital and often my stomach will be bad when there allergies flare up. Also I was diagnosed with Endometriosis and after years of so called IBS the Endometriosis was also on my bowel and was causing bowel problems.  Endometriosis is an autoimmune condition and I always think if my immune system is suppressed, surely the vital role of the Liver and the high levels of Bilirubin must be a factor in the ability for my body to cope. I had my Ovaries removed at 41 years old and I was so lucky that I had two children, as the Endometriosis had not stopped me reproducing, like so many women.   So I am now 45 years old and experiencing days of terrible pain in my stomach, odd episodes of needing the loo and lots of tiredness. I have brain fog alot and can not concentrate. Some of this pain in my stomach might be scar tissue from the Endometriosis and I fear bowel problems/function problems. But after having  breath tests,  3x Endoscopies, 2x CT scans, 1x MRI last year to look at my stomach in detail and lots of blood tests over the years, everything single one has come back NORMAL. Everytime the result is normal it is such a relief, but you almost wish they could find something wrong with you, to fix it and then stop the stomach pain. I know get pain under my right rib cage which is new this year, so possibly in the Liver area. My Doctor says it could be Fibremyelgia. Another autoimmune condition!! Is there a link here? I think it is my liver or Gallbladder, but I am so tired of guessing and just have to keep remembering that all my results are NORMAL and I am well!!!!!! Really!! I feel a lot of pressure in my stomach now and I have back pain aswell. I lead a very busy life style and I'm sure that really you have to be completely lazy and rest to control this. When and if I feel a bit better, I will write on here again, to remind you that there are good days. If only there was help. I wish doctors and scientists would get on with helping us. Please can more research go into this condition!! So today I am sat here 14th September in lots of pain in my stomach, this episode started mildly at first in June/July. Whilst on holiday in July, probably after eating lots of lovely food (full of fat and cream) that was there in the restaurant, having some alcohol of which I can't usually tolerate at all and after the stress of getting everything done to go on holiday, I had a terrible night sat on the loo feeling sick and a day in bed exhausted unable to move. The following days I sat by the pool and went onto a basic diet and started the detox, that I forget I should be on permanently to stop the pain. All Summer I have been in pain and find it hard to sleep. When I sleep at night my stomach can actually wake me up with the pain. It almost hurts more when I am lying down. I get pelvic pain a lot and a deep pain in the same area of my stomach all the time. The weird thing is that when the pain lifts, it goes suddenly! And I almost forget how bad it gets. But to be honest it never really leaves me for long. I hope this doesn't make people feel worse, as I have definitely had a journey. I live in fear of something being seriously wrong with my stomach and they are missing it, but this is because the pain for me is so specific to one area in the middle of my stomach. I take Easomepresol tablet for the acid and belching that comes with it for me. And I have Meloxicam for the pain. But I find that I can take them for several days initially to calm down a bad episode then the tablets make me feel ill, probably the Liver not liking the drugs as it has to process them as well as being compromised by Gilberts Syndrome.   0 likes, 2 replies "

So like you do, you look on the internet and everyone is saying about the symptoms that I had. Goodness, a revelation........but no medication or acknowledgement of these symptoms! I have explained to many doctors that people report symptoms but they almost don't want to hear that. Are they trained to believe only what they have been told. If lots of people have stomach pain, exhaustion etc, why are they not open to this? So at this time I am about 34 years old. As my two boys grew up my pain then progressed and with my pain over the years some other factors have come to light that I am convinced may be related or are linked by the Liver's difficulties. I have several allergies now as I've aged.... Hayfever from age 17 years, Allergy to Mould, Rosin (Sap of Pine Trees), Sodium Metabisulfite (preservative in Food medicines), very sick on aneasthetics. My body and my immune system is under stress and can not process these.  All of these allergies have been confirmed by the hospital and often my stomach will be bad when there allergies flare up. Also I was diagnosed with Endometriosis and after years of so called IBS the Endometriosis was also on my bowel and was causing bowel problems.  Endometriosis is an autoimmune condition and I always think if my immune system is suppressed, surely the vital role of the Liver and the high levels of Bilirubin must be a factor in the ability for my body to cope. I had my Ovaries removed at 41 years old and I was so lucky that I had two children, as the Endometriosis had not stopped me reproducing, like so many women.   So I am now 45 years old and experiencing days of terrible pain in my stomach, odd episodes of needing the loo and lots of tiredness. I have brain fog alot and can not concentrate. Some of this pain in my stomach might be scar tissue from the Endometriosis and I fear bowel problems/function problems. But after having  breath tests,  3x Endoscopies, 2x CT scans, 1x MRI last year to look at my stomach in detail and lots of blood tests over the years, everything single one has come back NORMAL. Everytime the result is normal it is such a relief, but you almost wish they could find something wrong with you, to fix it and then stop the stomach pain. I know get pain under my right rib cage which is new this year, so possibly in the Liver area. My Doctor says it could be Fibremyelgia. Another autoimmune condition!! Is there a link here? I think it is my liver or Gallbladder, but I am so tired of guessing and just have to keep remembering that all my results are NORMAL and I am well!!!!!! Really!! I feel a lot of pressure in my stomach now and I have back pain aswell. I lead a very busy life style and I'm sure that really you have to be completely lazy and rest to control this. When and if I feel a bit better, I will write on here again, to remind you that there are good days. If only there was help. I wish doctors and scientists would get on with helping us. Please can more research go into this condition!! So today I am sat here 14th September in lots of pain in my stomach, this episode started mildly at first in June/July. Whilst on holiday in July, probably after eating lots of lovely food (full of fat and cream) that was there in the restaurant, having some alcohol of which I can't usually tolerate at all and after the stress of getting everything done to go on holiday, I had a terrible night sat on the loo feeling sick and a day in bed exhausted unable to move. The following days I sat by the pool and went onto a basic diet and started the detox, that I forget I should be on permanently to stop the pain. All Summer I have been in pain and find it hard to sleep. When I sleep at night my stomach can actually wake me up with the pain. It almost hurts more when I am lying down. I get pelvic pain a lot and a deep pain in the same area of my stomach all the time. The weird thing is that when the pain lifts, it goes suddenly! And I almost forget how bad it gets. But to be honest it never really leaves me for long. I hope this doesn't make people feel worse, as I have definitely had a journey. I live in fear of something being seriously wrong with my stomach and they are missing it, but this is because the pain for me is so specific to one area in the middle of my stomach. I take Easomepresol tablet for the acid and belching that comes with it for me. And I have Meloxicam for the pain. But I find that I can take them for several days initially to calm down a bad episode then the tablets make me feel ill, probably the Liver not liking the drugs as it has to process them as well as being compromised by Gilberts Syndrome.   0 likes, 2 replies "

When the bad stomach passed I would be able to eat normally and I would eat everything. I could never identify a specific food causing the problem, but I could have an attack and be sat on the loo, until it passed. Rest was always a big healer and the only way my stomach could sort itself out. I was a nervous child and most people would say I was nervous, but this would happen suddenly sometimes and I knew in myself that my stomach didn't work properly. At the time my gran who was a nurse almost guessed that there was something going on with my Liver, as I looked mildly yellow. As I got older my stomach problems expanded due to the stress of going to work. At 17 years old the episodes of stomach trouble were then diagnosed as IBS. The fatigue and shear exhaustion kicked in, as working made you tired and the rest was not available as it was when you were a young child. So I battled on with these episodes that would occasionally make me have time off work or I would suffer at work, just thinking that I have IBS and this is the way I am. I never really ever felt well. The attacks stopped my career as a qualified Spatial Designer and stopped my confidence to move away from my family to London where the work was, as I knew that I would have days that confined me to lie down and rest. How reliable would I be in a fast paced career like that. So by know I take an office job in my 20's where I knew I will could sit down on those bad days and struggle on with out being noticing I was ill. As the years went on, I had two boys 12 months apart. One birth was very demanding and stressful on my body as he was very large and the other was so large that a C section was performed. After the births, both being difficult, I looked so yellow. The photos of me show how my body and my Liver must of been coping. And off course at the time, I felt ill. This period of time was a blurr. Obviously with the care of 2 babies, the exhaustion of two years of being pregnant, followed by two heavy babies to lift, no sleep, breast feeding and of course my very bad stomach. I felt terrible.

Also I was diagnosed with Endometriosis and after years of so called IBS the Endometriosis was also on my bowel and was causing bowel problems.  Endometriosis is an autoimmune condition and I always think if my immune system is suppressed, surely the vital role of the Liver and the high levels of Bilirubin must be a factor in the ability for my body to cope. I had my Ovaries removed at 41 years old and I was so lucky that I had two children, as the Endometriosis had not stopped me reproducing, like so many women.   So I am now 45 years old and experiencing days of terrible pain in my stomach, odd episodes of needing the loo and lots of tiredness. I have brain fog alot and can not concentrate. Some of this pain in my stomach might be scar tissue from the Endometriosis and I fear bowel problems/function problems. But after having  breath tests,  3x Endoscopies, 2x CT scans, 1x MRI last year to look at my stomach in detail and lots of blood tests over the years, everything single one has come back NORMAL. Everytime the result is normal it is such a relief, but you almost wish they could find something wrong with you, to fix it and then stop the stomach pain. I know get pain under my right rib cage which is new this year, so possibly in the Liver area. My Doctor says it could be Fibremyelgia. Another autoimmune condition!! Is there a link here? I think it is my liver or Gallbladder, but I am so tired of guessing and just have to keep remembering that all my results are NORMAL and I am well!!!!!! Really!! I feel a lot of pressure in my stomach now and I have back pain aswell. I lead a very busy life style and I'm sure that really you have to be completely lazy and rest to control this. When and if I feel a bit better, I will write on here again, to remind you that there are good days. If only there was help. I wish doctors and scientists would get on with helping us. Please can more research go into this condition!! So today I am sat here 14th September in lots of pain in my stomach, this episode started mildly at first in June/July. Whilst on holiday in July, probably after eating lots of lovely food (full of fat and cream) that was there in the restaurant, having some alcohol of which I can't usually tolerate at all and after the stress of getting everything done to go on holiday, I had a terrible night sat on the loo feeling sick and a day in bed exhausted unable to move. The following days I sat by the pool and went onto a basic diet and started the detox, that I forget I should be on permanently to stop the pain. All Summer I have been in pain and find it hard to sleep. When I sleep at night my stomach can actually wake me up with the pain. It almost hurts more when I am lying down. I get pelvic pain a lot and a deep pain in the same area of my stomach all the time. The weird thing is that when the pain lifts, it goes suddenly! And I almost forget how bad it gets. But to be honest it never really leaves me for long. I hope this doesn't make people feel worse, as I have definitely had a journey. I live in fear of something being seriously wrong with my stomach and they are missing it, but this is because the pain for me is so specific to one area in the middle of my stomach. I take Easomepresol tablet for the acid and belching that comes with it for me. And I have Meloxicam for the pain. But I find that I can take them for several days initially to calm down a bad episode then the tablets make me feel ill, probably the Liver not liking the drugs as it has to process them as well as being compromised by Gilberts Syndrome.   0 likes, 2 replies "

When the bad stomach passed I would be able to eat normally and I would eat everything. I could never identify a specific food causing the problem, but I could have an attack and be sat on the loo, until it passed. Rest was always a big healer and the only way my stomach could sort itself out. I was a nervous child and most people would say I was nervous, but this would happen suddenly sometimes and I knew in myself that my stomach didn't work properly. At the time my gran who was a nurse almost guessed that there was something going on with my Liver, as I looked mildly yellow. As I got older my stomach problems expanded due to the stress of going to work. At 17 years old the episodes of stomach trouble were then diagnosed as IBS. The fatigue and shear exhaustion kicked in, as working made you tired and the rest was not available as it was when you were a young child. So I battled on with these episodes that would occasionally make me have time off work or I would suffer at work, just thinking that I have IBS and this is the way I am. I never really ever felt well. The attacks stopped my career as a qualified Spatial Designer and stopped my confidence to move away from my family to London where the work was, as I knew that I would have days that confined me to lie down and rest. How reliable would I be in a fast paced career like that. So by know I take an office job in my 20's where I knew I will could sit down on those bad days and struggle on with out being noticing I was ill. As the years went on, I had two boys 12 months apart. One birth was very demanding and stressful on my body as he was very large and the other was so large that a C section was performed. After the births, both being difficult, I looked so yellow. The photos of me show how my body and my Liver must of been coping. And off course at the time, I felt ill. This period of time was a blurr. Obviously with the care of 2 babies, the exhaustion of two years of being pregnant, followed by two heavy babies to lift, no sleep, breast feeding and of course my very bad stomach. I felt terrible. So I ended up at the doctors feeling so sick and ill.......I ended up on anti sickness drugs to cope. Then the doctor did a blood test and continued to tell me that I had IBS and was tired. Then the Gilberts Syndrome was found on the results and I was told that this wouldn't be causing me the symptoms. So like you do, you look on the internet and everyone is saying about the symptoms that I had. Goodness, a revelation........but no medication or acknowledgement of these symptoms! I have explained to many doctors that people report symptoms but they almost don't want to hear that. Are they trained to believe only what they have been told. If lots of people have stomach pain, exhaustion etc, why are they not open to this? So at this time I am about 34 years old. As my two boys grew up my pain then progressed and with my pain over the years some other factors have come to light that I am convinced may be related or are linked by the Liver's difficulties. I have several allergies now as I've aged....

I’ve done a little research & come across things like special diets etc.. I eat pretty healthy, I’ve binged in my time tbh but only once a week twice at a push. Started drinking young. Yes I do smoke which I know is bad. I did pack up for a month But started  again after this health anxiety business, which I know doesn’t makes sense  cuz I do worry about the affects etc... but couldn’t cope with the withdrawal symptoms aswell as the anxiety symptoms.

Blood tests after i'd visited the docs complaining of severe fatigue. Like with many others the Doctor basically shrugged it off, told me to rest well, eat well and all would be fine. Numerous visits later and I'm stuck in a rut. Wake up every day feeling exhausted, I genuinely can't remember a day when my fatigue hasnt been the first thought on my mind when i wake up and the last at night. All day inbetween worrying that its cancer or some other horrible thing. Can't go on being so tired. NOTHING seems to help me. Tried various supplements and I do eat well.  Limited alcohol also to no avail. Tearing my hair out but so glad I found this site. It helps hearing I'm not alone. 0 likes, 14 replies "

In fact, albumin plays a vital role in the disposition of bilirubin in the body by keeping the compound in solution and transporting it from its sites of production (primarily bone marrow and spleen) to its site of excretion which is the liver."" Albumin levels in GS patients are normal, but I'm wondering if there is no symptom improvement by supplementing it, or any similar protein. I read that whey may help or screw the liver so that's a pass to me, but would like to read some insight on people who supplement proteins. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Because this was greater than 70% (it was around 77% of the total bilirubin) he stated confidently that he believes I have Gilberts Sysndrome. What tests have others had to diagnose this?

I have pretty severe anxiety, (namely, health anxiety) so I'm kinda freaking out. I took a blood test 4 1/2 years ago that showed bilirubin levels of 2.0 when the normal range was up to 1.2. All other tests came back normal. I ended up getting an ultrasound which showed nothing abnormal, and my doctor at the time said my ""levels are just naturally high"", and she didn't seem overly concerned . I was 26 then. A few weeks ago I went to a new doctor for something unrelated and we did a routine blood test. Everything was completely normal except my total bilirubin again, this time at 2.5 although their normal range now is anything under 2.0. This time, he suggested another blood test to differentiate indirect vs direct bilirubin. He wasn't even concerned about it until I messaged him later asking if there is anything I should be concerned about and he offered to order that test. We had talked about it in his office previously and he wasn't really concerned at all. That was Friday and I just received the results. Direct bilirubin is 0.7 - normal is 0.5 or less. Total bilirubin dropped to 2.1 - normal is 2.0 or less. So at this point in freaking out because he had mentioned Gilbert's and we already kinda figured that's what was causing this, but then I saw the increased direct levels. Not long after, my doctor messaged me saying that since my bilirubin is mostly unconjugated, it's most likely Gilbert's like he had suggested. He said the next step would be a liver biopsy to figure out exactly what it is, but because all my other liver tests were normal, he's not concerned and doesn't think that's necessary if I'm asymptomatic. Now I'm confused. From what I've read, Gilbert's would raise indirect bilirubin, not direct bilirubin. My doctor doesn't seem to be concerned with the slightly elevated levels, but if my direct levels were normal, I'd be well within the normal range for total bilirubin to begin with. I found several of those ""ask a doctor websites"" with people asking similar questions, even with very similar test results, and none of the doctors seem concerned if the other tests are normal.  This is leading me to believe a slightly elevated level isn't really indicative of anything.  From what I've read, they're looking for like 50% or more of your total bilirubin to be direct if there was a problem.  Mine is 33%. Also, if I just took the normal total bilirubin test today, it would hardly be considered abnormal. Like I said, I have severe health anxiety so I'm trying to stay calm. My rational brain is telling me it's been elevated for over 4 1/2 years, if it was something serious I'd probably know by know, haha. I'm  hoping others can reassure me. Has anyone here had slightly elevated direct bilirubin before? Thanks for taking the time to read this. EDIT: After looking into it more, it seems like a slightly elevated direct bilirubin isn't too concerning. I guess they're looking for like 2.0 levels of direct bilirubin is what would be concerning. 0 likes, 5 replies "

Initially I had no idea what was wrong, especially since my whole life Ive been very healthy.   One day  when I was about 21 or 22 I began experiencing severe abdominal pain that would send cold chills across my body, as well as diarrhea  7-10x a day, Fatigue and Anxiety for  about 3 years straight.  I work and go to school so just leaving the house used to terrify me because I knew how much pain I was going to suffer during my commute and time at work.  I let this go on for almost two years before I sought help because my anxiety had grown so out of control becuase of the symptoms that I was experiencing that I became extrmely depressed and constantly in fear that I had something serously wrong with me; but didnt have the courage to face any sort of bad news.  Instead I silently suffered while being dependent on otc anti diarrheal's as well as expereincing significant weight loss because of my fear of eating due to the pain and diarrhea.  Finally one night after a long hard day of work, all day pain, diarrhea and extreme depression I finally broke. As I was sitting on the cough I had the worst panic attack of my life.  Ultimately ending up in the ER and coming clean about eveything to the ER doc.  They gave me some xanax and told me to see a GI doc about it.  I went to my primary care the next day determined to get answers and stop living in constant fear and pain.  After having labs drawn, EVERYTHING CAME BACK NORMAL!!!  Except my total bilirubin which was 2.4 I believe. Significant elevation per my primary care. He referred me to GI where I underwent more blood work and abdominal CT as well as test to rule out Celiac disease and things like that. Days later all results came back NEGATIVE. Except this time he has done a ""fractionalized bilirubin"" test that showed conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin. The only abnormality  in my lab work was the unconjugated bilirubin.  That finding confirmed that it was Gilberts Syndrome. The GI doc explained to me thay Gilberts is very misunderstood thus treatment options are not plentiful.  He recommended a few things that changed my life: 1) Metamucil 2-3x a day 2) Alprazolam 0.5 as needed 3) Reassurance that Im a healthy person that just has a slight genetic abnormality that does not affect life span.  4) No greasy foods (or at least try) 5) No Caffeine 6) Avoid spicy and dairy when possible.  7) Tomato & Radishes (they lower unconjugated bilirubin.) The next few days I took his advice and began taking Metamucil, Eating non greasy foods like sandwiches and chicken w/ rice, started taking Alprazolam for anxiety as needed, stopped googling symptoms and watched out for trigger foods.  The metmamucil bulked up my stools and got rid of the diarrhea and abdominal pain by day 3 or 4.  The Alprazolam allowed me to breathe, relax, sleep, feel like a normal non anxious human being and the diet changes helped me to avoid flare ups.  I keep loperamide with me every day just in case I may get diarrhea of abdominal pain once in a blue moon but rarely use it.  The last two years since making those changes my life has been back to normal!!!!! I dont have daily diarrhea, abdominal pain, hemorrhoids, anxiety or depression.  I suffered for years out of fear and emabressment. Gilberts Syndrome is very poorly understood but dont give up!  I cried myself to sleep for almost two years, lost friends, isolated myself  and got to the lowest point I have ever been all becaus of this stupid condition.  Dont give up. You wil find your regimen eventually and get your life back!!!!! Ive had labs drawn a few times since then and my unconjugated bili has been down to almost normal for about 2 years.  Also dont forget to eat before you get any labs drawn for bilirubin levels.  Those with Gilbert's will have increased bili when fasting. Good luck everyone! I promise it will all be ok and you can always ask me any questions you like.  1 like, 7 replies "

First, I've found a lot of the posts here very helpful. Thankful for those of you who have shared your stories. So within the last few months my bilirubin count has been rising. My first test showed the count at 2.4. I went back last week because my eyes had a yellow tinge to them. At that point, my count was at 3.1. The doctor still believes this is Gilbert's, but wants me to see a GI now because I'm experiencing some pain below my right run, and nausea after eating. Needless to say, I'M FREAKING OUT!! I have four kids and I'm thinking they're going to be fatherless by the end of the year. The doctors seem completely clueless to my questions and just seem to write this off as it's no big deal. To me and my health anxiety/panic, it's a huge deal. All of my other liver functions are said to be normal. My blood work is great and all my other functions are good. The only thing is the elevated bilirubin, the jaundice (which has subsided), and the pain with nausea. I'm 38 years old and I'm convinced this is the end. I'm already planning my liver transplant. I've stressed so much, I'm down 30lbs. I know it's kind of funny, but I'm truly losing my head. Anyone experience these things and should I be concerned?  0 likes, 12 replies "

It all started out 2 months back when I swallowed a large piece of food without chewing properly, so I basically starve myself the next day as I'm afraid to eat. That's when I started having acid reflux. When food get stuck in my throat, I'll remind myself that I still can breath and talk therefore I'm not choking. I still can swallow liquid therefore nothing is stuck. Yet, I don't get why I'm always having this issues of as if something is stuck in my throat feeling. Might be acid reflux or anxiety or maybe both but I just don't know. I'm so tired of living like this.

However I otherwise feel fine and have just been dry coughing occasionally due to the irritation. To tell you how it started and in the interest of being completely honest it originally developed after a time when I smoked a joint with extremely dry tobacco which was essentially dust, which I ended up breathing in a some of. After this I coughed a LOT and after was the first experienced the globus sensation, it wasn't that bad however and seemed to get slowly better over a couple of days. Well it suddenly seemed to take a turn today as after a day where it was particularly irritating (the worst it had been) it suddenly changed and as I said previously became a weird feeling when I swallow on one side of my throat and a slightly swollen lymph node.

It all started a few months ago where I occasionally maybe once a week had a gagging sensation after a meal. It would go away after an hour or so and I would be fine. The past two weeks has been HELL for me. It began one day after I had a quesidilla and iced tea. Within 20 mins the gagging feeling came back only this time it did NOT go away. I went home and layed down thinking it would pass but it did not. It occured for 3 days and finally on the the 3rd day I threw up and it went away. However shortly after that i had a feeling of something stuck in my throat and numbness for a good week or so. I went to the DR once for gagging and he gave me naseua medication (forget the name) I also was prescribed Amoxcicillan CLAV 500mg i believe. None of this helped so I went back to him 2 days later and he said I should try nexium. I did and it didnt work. They did blood work and everything came back normal.  I tried to tell myself i would get better but nothing was working. A day later it kept feeling like something was stuck in my throat but I felt like I couldnt breathe. I went to urgent care and the lady said my throat was irritated and prescribed me oral predisone. Took that for two days and guess what? IT DIDNT WORK. Two days later I find myself in the EMERGENCY ROOM. They ran tests like a cat scan & XRAY and they found nothing. They injected me with a steroid which helped for about a day or so and then this is where things went downhill. NOW CURRENTLY for the past week my chest has been tight and I have been in severe pain. And the past 3 days I got this gagging  feeling back in my throat as well as tightness. its seriously affecting me and I CANT TAKE IT anymore. I ALSO have bad anxiety but if this was anxiety related I feel like It would have gotten better already. I went back to the DR and he told me i could have acid reflux which i already figured. He suggested I get a scope done. my only concern is they will find nothing and i will have no hope. I also tried a different form of prilosec for my reflux and it did NOTHING for me. The past week I have not eaten anything and ive been so sick. IF anyone knows whats going on with me please help. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I've been getting this feeling like something is stuck in my throat and it's really irritating. I don't know what it is. I can swallow properly and my body feels good but i've been gettin' that feeling where i feel like something is stuck in ther and i'm really scared i don't know if it's cancer or something else serious but i'm really worried and i'm 17 with alot of anxiety from it. I don't know what caused this i was recently sick but i feel great now and it's just this throat irritation. I've looked up alot about it on the internet and alot of people say it's caused by gerd (acid reflux) i don't know if that's the case though but lately i've been getting stomach aches and i really think it is caused by this gerd thing. I'm scared cause i don't know what it really is i just need answers on it so i can stop panicing about it cause everytime i panic about it i get anxeity attacks and it's really not healty for the body to be in panic all the time. I also was losing sleep cause of it but not that much no more i have gotten a good sleep last night which is a good sign. If anyone can talk me through this it would be great cause i'm young and i get scared quickly when my body doesn't feel right, i just don't want this to affect me no more cause i have been missing alot of school cause of it and it's starting to worry me more and more everyday.

Firstly I feel like I need to confess... I suffer from health anxiety and this is just one of many symptoms that have come my way over the past couple of years. This is a feeling of something stuck at the back of my throat. Like a popcorn husk or an oat. It's to the left side only, right at the back of my throat. I've had it for 4 weeks so far. I can eat and drink normally, in fact eating temporarily relieves it. Also I can be without the sensation for the 1st hour of the day and then once it comes it stays all day. It doesn't hurt to swallow, although I have recently developed a   in the last 3 days. My GP was less than helpful and thought perhaps it was tonsil stones but I've poked and prodded until I've nearly been sick and I can't see or feel anything there. I've gargled and coughed and tried gaviscon and piriton and nothing has helped. Has anyone else experienced this? Especially with it being one sided?? 0 likes, 3 replies "

My GP is useless. I've been back twice now with this feeling of something small like an oat or popcorn husk at the back of my mouth /throat but he can't see anything just by looking in my mouth. It's been 5 weeks now. Last week I had a sore throat that lasted for about 10 days, it's improving now but I've been left with a very dry, tickly throat and cough and a hoarse voice but only in the evening. My globus if that's what it is, doesn't present itself until a good few hours into my day but then lasts all day. No tight feeling in throat and no trouble eating, just this horrible sensation and an awful dry throat at the back. I'm wondering if I have post nasal drip or silent reflux but GP just won't have it and has told me to go and join a mindfulness course to help my anxiety. Why will no-one listen! 😔 0 likes, 1 reply "

I am a woman and only 19 years old. I have never had health problems. My parents haven't either, neither did my grandparents. I have been smoking for the past few years tho, but stopped since I started experience these weird feelings. About a week ago, after a big meal I started feeling like I had something in my throat. I got really panicked and tried coughing it, my friends tried calming me but nothing worked. I went to bed that night really afraid that I might have something bad, because it also made it hard for me to breath.  After that experience, every time I ate something I got the same feeling of a lump in my throat. It got really hard for me to swallow, I feel like the food isn't going down my throat and it scares me that I might choke, so for a few days I only drank liquids. Then, because I was not eating, I started having a burning sensation starting from the middle of my chest up to my mouth that I believe to be acid reflux because I sometimes do experience heartburn due to it.  I went to the doctor and she told me my throat is a bit red and that I have some mucus built up there, but that she cannot tell me anything more due to my lack of symptoms. I tried treating it with teas, gargles, humidifiers and even mucinex, I feel like the mucus started getting better but I still have the globus sensation after eating. The worst thing is that it makes me really afraid that I might have something really bad, everybody here knows that this sensation could be the symptom of some worse things.. Also I currently moved away for University and am an Ocean away from my family, which does not make it better. But in 3 weeks I finish my semester and am going back for summer so I am looking forward to that. Please, if anybody has some tips to make this better, I will appreciate anything. The last week has been a nightmare for me, eating stresses me out and I have been crying so much because I am scared and confused. I do not know if I should go take some other tests just to make sure that I do not have anything else. What do you say? 0 likes, 11 replies "

A week later i was eating a salad and what seemed to have been a piece of fennel got caught down my esophagus.. I tried to calm myself down and drink warm water but nope, the feeling of a wedged and sharp piece of raw fennel never went away.. I immediately panicked and called 911 and i was brought to er and 10 HOURS later scoped again to see if anything was actually stuff..

All the posts on here were a great comfort to me when I was experiencing this awful condition. It all happened about 8 weeks ago. I was in the theatre and just sat down to begin the show when I ate a sweet normally, took a sip of water normally and afterwards felt like I was having difficulty swallowing. My mouth went super dry and I felt like a had a lump in my throat and my tongue was enlarged (it wasn't). I thought perhaps I was having a reaction to something so before the interval I had to leave and get out of there. I felt complete terror and danger and thought I was going to die. My husband was worried and took me to A&E. I couldnt breathe properly but was not wheezing. I felt like someone was strangling me, standing on my neck and I was in a complete panic that came out of nowhere. Apparently I had a panic attack or severe anxiety episode. Well, I didnt believe this diagnosis because I had over the years suffered from anxiety on and off and bouts of low mood but even when I have faced the most difficult times in my life, never have I had a panic attack so wondered why on such a happy day I would develop this. Anyway the initial attack was only the start of my problems, I was told the symptoms of my choking sensation would go away within a few hours. It didnt. This made it worse and I was not so easily going to put this down to stress as most things seem to be these days. I went to my GP who said I did seem to have some swelling in my neck and ordered me an ultrasound. As I couldn't wait 3 weeks for the paperwork to come through I saw an ENT consultant privately who put a camera up my nose and down my throat and said everyhing looked perfect and likely to be globus sensation which is common when experiencing panic attacks and anxiety. This only gave me some comfort because I was still feeling these awful symptoms. After the 4th week I had scan and this showed nothing. My thyroid was perfect, which I suspected may be the issue due to my high thyroid antibodies, although I knew I had normal thyroid function. This was also some comfort. I was suffering, and it was really really getting me down. Having to get up every day and go to work was so hard and I was so anxious I was not sleeping or eating well. I thought I would have it forever. After a while I started to think, well this isn't going to kill me as time has proven, its not getting worse or better so I need to start trying things to see if anything helps. I also had a strange crawling sensation in my neck not on top of my skin but underneath - hard to explain. Also when I put chin to chest I felt like the part between my neck and chin was swollen. I tried breathing exercises, hot water bottles, hot baths, drinking red wine, taking NSAI's, drinking loads of water, trying to eat better, sleep better, watching funny films but nothing worked. I then found a couple of websites online suggesting a very simple neck exercise to do many times throughout the day and specifically for globus sufferers. I started to do this and over a week the symptoms started to ease and has got better and better to the point that its only 5% there. The most important part is to make sure your shoulders are always down and pushed back as far as you can. No hunched shoulders or it won't work. Then carefully, with mouth closed, ease your neck back as far as it can go, all the time looking up to the ceiling. You should be able to feel yourself stretching your neck. It may make you cough a little. Then roll your head a little to left and right and centre. It probably won't work the first go. you have to do it many times a day over a week or so.  My GP said that panic attacks can cause a lot of problems in the neck, real tension and muscles, and other structures and a horrid sensation of a lump in your neck. I have to understand now that this is the cause. Apologies for the long post but it's a long story. I hope it helps someone. Good luck to you all and take care of yourselves. x   29 likes, 1092 replies "

I saw a number of GP's and got referred to a ENT specialist who checked my throat via a small nasal camera - all clear. Despite my Dad having this for a while and reassuring me that it does get better I focussed on the symptom and expected it to arrive every day (which it did!) Gradually it wasn't there one day then would come back - then it may disappear for a few days and then come back - it is a gradual process but once you stop obsessing about it , it will improve. I promise. My GP treated it as a symptom of anxiety and prescribed prozac - which had no effect. Much as I hate to admit it - my fiancee was right to keep telling me to stop obsessing and try and focus on other things - it is the only way to beat this. Somedays it still makes an appearance (infact thinking about it now I can bring on the sensation!) but you can make it go - focus on yuor good days and know that there will be gradually be more good than bad - it will go I PROMISE! 2 likes, 54 replies "

Researchers in London found that turmeric eye drops might be able to slow the progression of vision loss in people with glaucoma. A group of diseases, glaucoma causes damage to the eye’s optic nerve and can lead to blindness. In a paper published on Monday in Scientific Reports, researchers found that the future of treatment could be found inside the root plant, also known as golden saffron. A trial in rats with similar eye conditions found that the drops slowed the progression of disease. If the researchers are able to replicate these results in humans, this could have huge ramifications for the more than 60 million people worldwide who live with deteriorating vision. “We believe our findings could make a major contribution at helping the lives of people affected by these devastating diseases,” the study’s lead author, Francesca Cordeiro, said in a statement. Glaucoma mainly involves the loss of retinal ganglion cells, a type of neuron located near the surface of the retina. Researchers have been trying to figure out how to stop the loss of these cells, which could slow the progression of vision loss. When the team of researchers from UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, Western Eye Hospital and Imperial College London set out to make the turmeric eye drops, they already knew of research that had shown that the chemical curcumin, derived from turmeric, could help with vision loss. In fact, this plant has been used medicinally for centuries in South Asia. Western medicine is just starting to recognize that is might help with treating a range of conditions. Earlier this month, University of California San Diego School of Medicine researchers mapped how this spice could impair the growth of cancer. Another study found that turmeric could be an effective treatment for burns. A study that came out in March found that the plant could help prevent Parkinson’s disease. A problem that continues to surface is that curcumin does not easily get absorbed into the bloodstream. In order to see results, people would have to consume large amounts of the plant, and they might still not see any benefits. The researchers in London thought that an eye drop could solve this issue, providing a more effective and easier way to administer treatment for glaucoma. After twice-daily use of eye drops in the rats for three weeks, the researchers noticed a significant slow in deterioration of the cells in the retina.

Researchers in London found that turmeric eye drops might be able to slow the progression of vision loss in people with glaucoma. A group of diseases, glaucoma causes damage to the eye’s optic nerve and can lead to blindness.

Glaucoma mainly involves the loss of retinal ganglion cells, a type of neuron located near the surface of the retina. Researchers have been trying to figure out how to stop the loss of these cells, which could slow the progression of vision loss.

I am a female age 71 and have mild glaucoma in the left eye.  During the last 10 years or so I have add 2 cataract surgeries, laser treatment the the glaucoma eye which did not bring down the pressure or at least not enough.  I am on Adopt twice a day in the just the left eye.  I have also had pvd  in both eyes one after cataract removal and the other 2 years after.  All this time I lived in Greater London and was under the care of well known eye hospital (not sure if I can mention the name). At each checkup I had the usual pressure checks eye examination together with photograph of back of eye and dilated exam and field tests every 6- 12 months.  I moved house 3 years ago and now attend local hospitals eye clinic.  It is really busy and appointments are often not available at the time the doctor says to come back.  I should have been seen in January but am only just going tomorrow.  At the clinic they do eye pressures and the doctor examines your eyes and field tests but not dilated exams or photos.  I do have a photo taken every 2 years at the opticians when I go for new reading glasses and at the last one 2 months ago was told the photo was ok.  My question is are glaucoma patients supposed to have dilated exams and photos or has something changed .  I am concerned about not having these checks but don't want to complain.  I certainly can't afford to go private.   I was intending to ask tomorrow if there was a reason why these tests are not done.  I realise the eye clinic of general hospital may not be so sophisticated as an eye hospital.  I am also going to ask about what medications I should not take.  I know steroids are a problem as I found out that nasal steroids for rhinitis caused a rise in pressure which came back down when I stopped.  With arthritis and other health problems which might require medications I would like to know what I should and should not take.  I can't take nsaids and also wondered about amitryptiline (sorry wrong spelling) which I have been offered for pain and has a glaucoma warning.

First of all, it is on my Genitalia. (I'm a guy, nothing weird just so happens to be where it started) I've noticed it for what seems like years and have even had two ex's actually question about it. Although the discoloration never bothered me back when i discovered i had areas to where it was brighter and even silver/white pubic hairs, it had just came to my attention and i started to look into it. I heard there is multiple kinds of this like some dont spread,others in certian areas and alot of the time all over the body.  This is the only place i've really seen any out of place colors that ive noticed, not that i actually went looking. Is there anyway to identify which it is? Or what's the average growth rate that you'd see other spots forming if they do does anyone know? I'm only 16 and ive seen that spot for years although im positive it wasnt always there ive just became used to it. Any tips or anything?

Also, this basically just turned into my Wolff-Parkinsons-White Syndrome (or WPW for short) story. All the way from the start, up until now. I knew it was bad when I woke up feeling like I was going to die everyday. It wasnt always like that though. In highschool, I first started having symptoms. All of a sudden, in my sophomore year gym class when we were playing basket ball on a hot dehydrating day. My heart started speeding at what I would guess was about 145bpm or more. I have a pretty good judge of where my heartrate is at nowdays. Almost to a tee without checking. Anyways, it freaked me out but I didnt experience any symptoms after that and I forgot about it. A few months later I broke a bone, when I went to the hospital they said that I will need a surgery, and that I will need to be put under anesthesia. So, in that case test were done to make sure it was safe. I went to cardiology. They noticed something was wrong. I got a ultra sound. The lady confirmed it was WPW. I was put under and had the surgery for my broken bone then, sent home with Vicodin. I went on to live with WPW for almost five years after that. For the first three or so years symptoms would come and go. From time to time they would be a little bit worse then others but not bad. But, in the last two years, the episodes would come more often and heavier. Until every single morning I would wake up super dehydrated and feeling like I was literally going to die. Thats when i knew i had to go in for the ablation. At this time, my Mom happened to have gotten a promotion at the hospital she worked at. Surprisingly, her promotion was to  Lead Nurse in the Cardiologist Department. Apparently, the doctor in her department is very talented at WPW ablations. So, my Mom schedules me in and a week later she drives me to his main office about 30 miles away. I go in super anxious and shaking. They shot me up with something good. The nurses played the best song for me off their Jambox, Peter Tosh - Reggae Mylitis. I was still shaking so they shot me up with something better. Then it subsided they made sure all those patches they put on were proper and that my body was in a comfortable position then I passed out. When I finally come around I immediately notice a difference. The nurse makes sure I don't sit up at all. Then, I recover somewhat and still messed up my blessed mom takes me around town and she buys me food. Then, I go home try to sleep the pain of basically just the incision sights and some heart pain (They said that a little pain was normal). I recover after 11 or so days and I'm back at work. Hard work. Commercial fishing, long hours and strenuous activity. I didnt feel as dehydrated anymore. Also, had absolutely no symptoms of Wolff Parkinson's White Syndrome. Anyways a year later which is about now. I have had some   lately and also I may have experienced some episodes of the elevated heart rate I've associated with WPW. I'm going to make an appointment as soon as i can and see how things go. This is my story so far. Still feel like I may die young but, I'll try to look past everything bad that's happened to me and move on. Live my life with vigor. And strife. SO, originally I said I'm curious about something. Im curious if anybody else that has been diagnosed with Wolff Parkinsons White Syndrome, has a lot of  ? Particularly curious if anybody has noticed less anxiety after their ablation?

He still has palpations at various times, but it seems to have become more frequent over the past few months (he is now 28). He has also started becoming more and more worried about dying, and thinks every little pain in his body, or heart flutter, or chest pain is trying to kill him. (We've talked about the possibility of him being a hypochondriac.)  This anxiety and stress over dying coupled with WPW is a horrible combination. I've been trying to get him to see a counselor or therapist but, for the time being, I was wondering if anyone had any tips so I can help him when he gets these anxiety attacks over dying? Also, what is the best approach to get him to seek some help regarding this? Edit: He is currently on a 21 day heart monitor to see if he may need another ablation or if there is another, undiagnosed condition.  Thank you all in advance! 0 likes, 3 replies "

I was having chest pain, ne  and hypertension. My family has a history of hypertension. The gave me a stress test, MRI and X-rays and my heart was functioning normal and looked well. I was put on  a 25mg Metoprolol but the med was too strong for me, and my doctor switched me over to a 2.5mg dose of Bisoprolol. Up until February the dosage had me feeling normal and it kept my blood pressure low. I started getting a lot of chest pain in my middle left chest and along my back chest and arm. I had a lot of anxiety, which I never get, but I felt devestated to the point where it was dibilitating. I started getting stomach aches and I could not eat much, my bowl movements were a dark brown/black. I went to my primary and they increased my bisoprolol to 5mg and said I should take a probiotic. I increased the dose but held off on the probiotic because I didn't feel well enough to take it. I ended up going the the ER again and they decided to put me on 25mg Metoprolol twice a day, Amlodipine 5mg to help with my angina, and a small aspirin. It took my body a whole week to get use to the meds, they made me really weak and tired. Now I've been seeing a cardiologist who has had me retested for a echocardiogram, on a monitor for two weeks, and I'm going in for another stress test soon (the hospital stress test was negative.). He also referred me to an electrophysiologist that I will be seeing in two weeks to see where I'm at and discuss an ablation. Some days are good and some are hard. My chest still feels sore most days, and if I'm positioned certain ways it's uncomfortable. Does anyone else have symptoms like this? My blood pressure only seems to be staying normal because of my medicine, because right before it's time to take my dose again, it's usually over 140/80, but on the meds it does a good job of staying under 120/80. That's what's confusing me, should I still be feeling uncomfortable some days on these meds? Will the ablation help with my chest pain? I'm worried I might have more issues then they know but I'm trying to stay positive and hope that all I need is an ablation and I will feel normal and be able to be on a regular blood pressure medicine with no beta blockers.

He had post vasectomy pain, which has improved greatly over the year but he is still dealing with (seeing a pain specialist).  At 10 weeks, he had a negative seman sample, doctor said they saw no sperm.  Was supposed to go back at 3 months but didnt.  I got pregnant in October 2018.  He has yet to return to doctor bc was such a terrible experience. But my obgyn looked at a sample today (April 2018) and saw no semen.  I cant figure out what is going on, and my husband is reluctant to see urologist bc of past experiences.  How am I pregnant?  Anyone else experience this? 0 likes, 1 reply "

","Hello everyone, I had my no scalpel vasectomy about 23 days ago. I wasn’t one of the lucky ones who recovered in a few days, but lucky enough to not have excruciating pain. By day 14, I was told I have two sperm granulomas as well as congestion in my Epididymis (seems to be mostly on left side). The pain isn’t bad (1-2), mostly just annoying and the feeling of regret is overwhelming once I realized what I put myself at risk for. I want to get ahead of my congestion to avoid damage to my Epididymis. I began taking papaya seed powder about 3 days ago. For those of you who have used this, did it completely resolve your congestive problems? Did you continue taking it (or was a few months enough)? I know I’m still very early in the process, but I want to make sure I do as much as I can to resolve the issue before more problems come up. 0 likes, 2 replies "

Will spider veins stay forever? I've never had them before and I can hardly imagine them still being there when I'm 50 or 60 years old...? (I'm 20 now). Are there things I can do to make it better or go away? Are there medical procedures that are risk-free or worth the risk? Especially in such an awkward place?

There is no bruise there (visibly anyway), there is a noticeable vein there but it does not look swollen just close to the skin surface. Could this be a problem with the vein seeing as it feels bruised when pressed? I am otherwise a healthy 24 year old, don't smoke and rarely drink alcohol. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

I haven't noticed any obvious varicose-like veins, but I don't know what else could be causing what I'm about to explain to happen. The numbness when I was younger seemed to be nerve-related, or so I thought. It was always the same, aching shooting pain, until summer 2016 I started to notice it being aggravated by cold weather in my job. I would occasionally get shooting electric-like pains from my elbow down, but I just figured it might be cold damage from working outside. Last year though, I noticed something else was starting to happen. I started experiencing a significant increase in the numbness in my arms to the point where it began to happen at night and wake me up. I don't think it's caused by positions as this never happened before in my life and then it became almost nightly, and often/usually effects both arms at once. This bothered me, but again, I was not too concerned, I just thought it was weird that it seemed that sleeping itself would trigger the numbness opposed to positions. This was mostly confirmed when I took a plane ride last November and fell asleep in a comfortable sitting position, only to wake up with my whole left arm more numb than I've ever felt in my life. It was very painful and was enough to make me panic. In the days after I experienced more numbness than normal. Over Christmas, I began to also notice this effecting my legs occasionally sometimes, especially if sitting. The same painful numbness. It's been hard to tell that this seems to be happening on account for me standing all day at my job, and having chronic pain on top of it. But I learned over the winter that sitting too long, crossing legs too long, or kneeling too long will cause my legs to go painfully numb. In February, I had my   removed, and while healing I got super sick. A lot of things happened, but one was that I noticed that sensation changes started happening in my limbs. When I'd shower, the soles of my feet would burn even though I was warm. Things like metal, water, or air felt ""different"" against my skin. Often I felt a sensation almost like cold water running through my veins. Most notably, I started getting extreme mottling in my hands to the point where they were turning blue. The doctors said that this is Reynaud's, so I let it be for some time. But it's been months, and nothing has improved and after researching Reynaud's and comparing my experience, I don't feel like it fits. I've never had patchiness of color, only significant mottling. The mottling is constant and only goes away when I raise my hands. If my hands are by my sides for any amount of time, the veins swell, the fingers turn red and mottled and feel full of blood. Even if it's 30 degrees Celcius out! My arms are almost constantly ""off"", even lying down, the sensation of temperature is permanently disturbed and the numbness and pain usually there. It still gets significantly worse while sleeping in both sides and wakes me up. I drank alcohol on the weekend, and I think I will avoid this altogether from now on, because the numbness while sleeping was so bad that I could feel upon regaining consciousness the blood return to my arms in a rush and the subsequent rush of intense pins and needles was awful! I think that's about it. Has anyone ever experienced this? It seems like a blood pooling or circulation issue to me, judging by the mottling and numbness combined and temperature changes. The best thing I can think of to explain it would be valve issues in veins. I wonder if it's worth me going back to the doctor about it, given that it seems to be worsening - they had told me not to worry about it and that I was mostly just experiencing   when I was sick, but it's been months and I'm not anxious at all, and yet the mottling is always evident, and it can't be anxiety when the numbness is waking me up at night, can it?? 0 likes, 8 replies "

Seen my internist a few times and 2 separate urologists. blood work and urine tests normal. Also a normal CT.  VERY hard to describe. So hard that the first month or so, I thought it might just be All in my mind.  Mainly concentrated to just a dull, throbbing, sometimes pulling/sticking pains, but more discomfort in my groin, right in area above base of penis and inguinal areas.  Had a vasectomy sept 2016, zero problems. Then in late Jan 2017, started feeling twinges and dull aching in groin. It FELT like it was like after you get hit in the nads but all dr visits completely rule out vasectomy related issues and quite honestly, my testicles, epididymus, etc. feel absolutely fine. Its in my lower abdomen and even feels like it's inside. (I cannot reproduce the pain by touching/feeling/pressing on anything. My testicles feel fine.)  (Tet I still constantly ""check"" them out of paranoia.  Even twinges and slight ""shocks on my inner thighs and under my scrotum in the cracks of my legs.  None of this is near excruciating but it IS excruciatingly nerve wracking and uncomfortable. Some days worse than others and I'm becoming more and more frustrated.  Sorry this is long but want to give as much info as possible. Ive now got a referral from urologist to see a musculoskeletal specialist. (Again, vasectomy in sept of 2016, but then I started exercising pretty hard and lifting from oct-dec...started feeling twinges about late January.) Urologist referred me to this new doc thinking it could be something torn or a ligamental strain, etc. Just hard to accept that this would last 4 months and get worse, rather than improve if an exercise related injury.  I'm really confident it's not vasectomy related but now I'm just p*ssed no one else can find anything else.  Summary: ever present, dull, achy, lower abdomen/groin area. I'm always guarded with kids jumping on me. Zero testicular pain. Zero problems with sex or ejaculation. Also bilateral and just ""all over and feels like IN my inner groin.  ANY related experiences/suggestions are greatly appreciated. Please follow up if anyone needs any more detailed info that might help with usurful suggestions.  I really appreciate it.  1 like, 10 replies "

From the very start I was in a lot of pain, excruciating pain. It eased up a bit after about a month. I started a new job August 7th where I am doing a ton of walking and bending over, its just part of the job and nothing I can do about it. But I have noticed the pain is still there (its there even when im not doing any walking or bending over) it started in my left testicle and sometimes I can feel the pain all the way up to my stomach and the last 3 days the pain is in my left AND now my right testicle. I called my Urologist who did the surgery and he said that I just needed to wear more support so I started wearing my jock strap with tight breifs but no relief. I went in a few weeks after my surgery and he said I had no issues but prescribed me some inflamation medicine. Im just worried that I still have this pain over 3 months after my vasectomy. Does anyone have any suggestions on relieving this pain. I am considering going to a new urologist and getting another opinion. 0 likes, 3 replies "

Since I am type 2 diabetic my GP said it may be related and will send me to a neurologist if it worsens. He was surprised as my hba1c and glucose levels are well under control with diet. 4 months later I went back to my GP and said I think they are getting worse. Not painful, just a disconcerting numbness. He had no hesitation referring me to a neurologist. The neurologist was booked up and I had to wait a month to see him. He ordered a lot of blood tests and made an appointment to see him one month later for a nerve conduction study and go over the blood test results. The nerve conduction study didn't show any major damage and probably only confined to the tiny nerve ends. He too thought also that diabetes may be the reason. He explained that although the sugar is well controlled the damage may have begun prior to diagnosis. He asked me to come and see him again in November and wanted a follow up blood test. He was concerned that my kidney function test was a bit elevated. I informed him that I've been taking Voltaren every day for my sore knee. He told me to stop as this may be the cause of the kidney reading. I waited two weeks and got the follow up tests done. He phoned me and told me that kidney function has returned to normal and that all other tests look ok except for maybe one odd reading with an antibody. He called me the next day and said that he wanted me to see an immunologist for an opinion on my c-anca and PR3 readings. These were 20 and 5.1 respectively. I asked him what were they looking for and he told me he just wants to test for possible GPA or sclerosing cholangitis. I can't get into to see the immunologist until end of november. I looked up the two diseases and naturally by bum cheeks clenched up a bit. I would just like to ask anyone here if the think that these two readings are high, low, borderline or even if it is possible to have the antibodies and have nothing wrong with me. The waiting is doing my head in. Thank you and I wish everyone here good luck with what looks to be an awful thing to manage.   0 likes, 4 replies "

Information.,"Hi Everybody, I haven't been diagnosed yet as the medical guys are still running tests on me. At the beginning of this year I started feeling numbness in my toes and fingers. Since I am type 2 diabetic my GP said it may be related and will send me to a neurologist if it worsens. He was surprised as my hba1c and glucose levels are well under control with diet. 4 months later I went back to my GP and said I think they are getting worse. Not painful, just a disconcerting numbness. He had no hesitation referring me to a neurologist. The neurologist was booked up and I had to wait a month to see him. He ordered a lot of blood tests and made an appointment to see him one month later for a nerve conduction study and go over the blood test results. The nerve conduction study didn't show any major damage and probably only confined to the tiny nerve ends. He too thought also that diabetes may be the reason. He explained that although the sugar is well controlled the damage may have begun prior to diagnosis. He asked me to come and see him again in November and wanted a follow up blood test. He was concerned that my kidney function test was a bit elevated. I informed him that I've been taking Voltaren every day for my sore knee. He told me to stop as this may be the cause of the kidney reading. I waited two weeks and got the follow up tests done. He phoned me and told me that kidney function has returned to normal and that all other tests look ok except for maybe one odd reading with an antibody. He called me the next day and said that he wanted me to see an immunologist for an opinion on my c-anca and PR3 readings. These were 20 and 5.1 respectively.

He had his first relapse in 2013 and they started him on rituxian and methotrexate. He has weaned himself off both and has been doing well, despite the full hip replacement 2014 due to all the steroids... fast forward to just the other day, he was at work and noticed blood coming from his penis. It was in his stream and when he wiped it was on the toilet paper. I told him to go to the ER and I met him there. I kind knew they weren't going to know what to do bc of his disease...they discharged us and told us to watch it and follow up with his specialist, which we are but can't get in till November, even after explaining the situation...I'm nervous and scared at what this could be, is it the wegeners or worse is it cancer?  Has anyone had this experience?  Nov is such a long wait to see his rheumatologist and then we will most likely have to see the urologist, make another appointment and wait!! Any insight on this would be helpful! 0 likes, 10 replies "

Then, again, in February I got positive results from two different laboratories, with one of them showing 40 and the other one 70. Now, today, the laboratory which gave me the 70 results has been giving me a 92 outcome. As an idea, where I live, for a negative interpretation, the laboratories have taken a minimum or equal to 5 limit. How can this be possible? I was thinking that either one of the laboratories makes the blood analysis in the wrong way or c-anca jumps from value to value in just a week or two. I am taking prednisone and cyclophosphamide since November last year after I was considered to be healthy exactly one year ago - and all of this due to a positive c-anca result from November. If there really is a fluctuation, I am thinking about a conspiracy theory against me as my creatinine level is normal and, overall, the rest of the blood test are pretty good (except for proteins which I understood that will never be in the ok limits since the kidneys are affected)  What do you folks think? Am I losing my mind here or this happened to any of you?  Thank you! 0 likes, 4 replies "

My SOD had two pain styles.  My daily pain is very successfully managed (99% pain free days) using 30mg amitriptyline each night and 10mg Buscopan 3xdaily.  Before drugs my daily pain was so bad that I was hardly eating - not a long term strategy. I also get (used to get) episodic severe night time pain attacks.  The upper gastric / chest area pain is extreme (as you'll know if you have SOD) and I used to take 20mg oxycodone.  Each morning after an attack I woke with migraine, vomiting and general weakness, needed a day in bed.  These night time attacks became worse and more frequent until I started acupuncture. A GP friend taught me to do acupuncture to myself, the most useful points are GB34 and LR3.  I do electro-acupunture weekly as a preventative measure, since March 2012.  My night time attacks are now infrequent, very mild indeed, and I can stop them by using manual needling in GB34 only. I don't even have to get out of bed, go straight back to sleep and can get up and go to work as usual in the morning.   This has transformed my experience of this horrible condition.

So I have been having a couple of issues after my gallbladder removal on August 5th. My stomach seems to feel very full now. This happened maybe 3-4 days after my surgery. I also started getting nauseous. But what bothers me the most is this bloated feeling. It's very uncomfortable and I can't eat much because I feel so stuffed and the nausea makes it worse. If I do try to eat my stomach literally feels like it's about to burst and it makes it hard to breathe. I've been walking here and there maybe 20 blocks each time as I was told walking will make the gas leave. But I feel so bad I'm not sure if anyone has experienced bloating this long? A friend of mine said her bloating and has left in a week. Is it possible to take ginger ale to help me burp, maybe gas x, anything? I just want to feel good again and I honestly feel sick. Don't think I'm constipated and I've been having bouts of diarreah and soft stool. 0 likes, 178 replies "

I felt fine after but then felt a little sick later in the evening. Like nauseous and got some chills like I was getting a cold? Has this happened to anyone with digestive enzymes or probiotics? I took one this morning as well and feel a little sick again. I won't take these anymore actually as I think this is what's causing me to feel ill.

Antacids and the zofran don't help. I eat pretty well already - low fat, lean protein, whole grains, minimal dairy - but I've cut any ""occasional"" fats, desserts, etc. out in the meantime. I'm trying to keep with light exercise too, though it's not easy. Warm compresses, baths don't seem to help. Any suggestions while I wait?

Also my chronic headaches were oddly worse, and had been in the days before the attack.

Everything went well, home the same day - took a good 4 weeks to feel totally better after the op but eating was ok and I don't seem to be affected by bowel issues like some people. Only problem is I have dull ache in exactly the same place I used to get the gallbladder pain.  It's not intense pain but it's in the front RUQ under my ribs and moves round the side and to my back.   It doesn't seem to appear after anything in particular and most of the time it's there constantly.  Suppose it's more of an annoyance than anything else because I'm always aware of this ache.  I'm quite reluctant to go to my GP because after spending about 7 months constantly in the surgery last year updating painkillers and nausea pills I don't want them to think I'm addicted to medical attention. Just wondered if anyone had anything similar or if it's just a by-product of surgery that I'll have to get on with? Thanks 32 likes, 1286 replies "

So please do not let a couple of hundred negative posts on the internet scare you away from doing something that could change your life for the better! People who have a positive outcome do not post their results, they are too busy enjoying their life now that they feel better! For 10 years I suffered and I finally hit my breaking point. The Gallbladder surgery was the first surgery I ever had so just like many of you, I was on these websites every chance I got searching for a reason to believe this was my answer and that I was doing the right thing. Unfortunately, all I found were all these horror stories and people with complications.   My CT scan, Ultrasound, Labs etc all came back fine. I had no gallstones. My Hida scan was 33%, which as many of you know, can be a tricky number when it comes to a Doctor believing that the gallbladder is the problem. Especially in my case where symptoms were not typical gallbladder symptoms. Pain was not always on the right side, it was mostly in the center above my ribs, my pain was not always after a fatty meal, it was with  meal. I did not have a ton of heartburn. IBS medications, both prescription and over the counter, natural supplements, food/ingredient elimination…it helped, but only temporarily.  But I know my body, and their answers weren’t good enough for me. I finally decided to see a surgeon for a second opinion, and then the option was up to me. It took me 2 months to decide that I was going for it. I read every single article online that you can find that relates to gallbladder removal, and every single post on these forum websites, both good and bad. I am now just about 3 months post op and I feel amazing. Of course you have to watch what you eat now and avoid certain foods, but to be honest, it’s all stuff you’re used to by now if you’ve suffered stomach issues before getting your gallbladder out. My gallbladder was covered in scar tissue when they removed it, with some cholesterolosis. One thing I noticed after the surgery is that the dull horrible pain that I had  felt in my stomach is now gone.  When you feel that way for  long, it almost feels weird  to feel like that anymore. But I felt so relieved. I still do. Don’t get me wrong, I still have days where I feel a bit bloated and I’m still learning what I’m sensitive to, but it’s a different kind of bloat, and the blah feeling I sometimes get now would not even come close to what I felt before the surgery.   I’m all for the questions, so please ask.

When these happen I’m insufferable to be around and I get so angry at the sheer fact that I feel that way at all that I shut down. It’s not constant, maybe once or twice a week. Not looking to add any extra full time meds, I asked my psych if there was anything I could simply take on a case by case basis and not every day. Just when the agitation sets in so I can find some relief from the feeling and not be a burden on those around me. He prescribed 100mg of gabapentin to take up to 3x in a day if I feel that way. With this regiment in mind of possibly only needing to take it once or twice a week, possibly only 100mg, am I likely to experience the weight gain side effect?

After a year, I realized this wasn't a co-incidence and hypothesized that the gab's effect on my brain and CNS was creating the pain. Yes, it was real pain, but no, it wasn't from the PHN. I wasn't sure if this was accurate until a few weeks ago. I was down to only 300 mg (100 3X a day) and I realized my pain was gone. Yes, my pain was GONE! That lasted several days, then I'd have VERY mild discomfort and then pain-free again. My theory was correct. The pain was drug induced. I realized that there may be times I'll feel twinges, but more likely, I'll be done with PHN.

367,C0028754,Obesity,C0013604,Edema,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/gabapentin-fluid-retention-and-inaccurate-medical-records-726911,Gabapentin Fluid Retention and Inaccurate Medical Records,"Hello, everyone! I wanted to bring up a topic that has been haunting my medical records for years.  My physician put me on gabapentin in the mid-1990's and I took it continuously until July 2016. Over the years I had what is medically called +4 edema.  My legs and feet were very swollen, but after questioning my physician several times, he stated repeatedly, ""You are just fat"".  Since I am an RN, I knew he was incorrect and I was probably right on target. At one point my gabapentin was reduced from 3600 mg total each day to 1800 mg.  I immediately dropped 10 pounds, but as a ""fat"" patient I thought it was a fluke.  In July 2016 I decided I had enough and insisted my physician give me a weaning schedule.  His instructions were to discontinue all gabapentin after a six day wean. On day six I took my last dose early in the day.  I apologize for TMI, but within hours I was up to the bathroom to urinate every 30 minutes.  I lost 30 pounds of fluid in 30 days.  I did not change diet or activity level. I recently noticed on all of my medical documentation, that I am listed as having a long history of ""obesity"".  Obesity is considered when you are 20% more than your ideal weight.  I am a 64 year old female, not of Asian decent (genetically smaller frame is considered when calculating BMI), weigh 112 pounds at 5'1"".  My BMI is actually 21, which makes me normal weight. My reason for bringing this up, is once you are labeled in your medical records, it seems impossible to get anyone to correct THEIR mistake and I am now having problems due to this error.  I will not bore you with the details. I wanted to give everyone a heads up, and suggest you watch all of your medical documentation closely for inaccurate information pointed at you, (as the patient), concerning side-effects of this drug.  I strongly believe physicians do not want to correct their medical records because they look inadequate ignoring serious side-effects. I am pretty angry about this, because medical/nursing staff have a professional obligation to document accurately, but all they want to do is cover their own backsides. 0 likes, 6 replies "

I was put on 900 mg of Gabapentin a day (300mg x3) in November.  Because it makes me feel groggy.  I started tapering about a month and a half ago following the vague recommendations of my doctor.  I first cut out the evening dose for a few weeks, then the morning dose, and finally I have reduced the night does to 200mg.   I now realize that that is not at all to do it, and I think I am experiencing withdrawal symptoms.  Specifically, I have significant tingling in my feet and legs.  My feet get red and hot.  My left leg and foot have become weak to the point where I sometimes limp and both ankles feel like jelly.  Sometimes when I'm walking on the sidewalk I get a little unbalanced.   I also have slightly blurry vision. I don't know what course of action give me the best chance of resolving my symptoms.  Since I'm all the way down to 200mg a night, do I stay here and slowly taper the rest?  Should I reinstate a higher does to see if the weakness goes away?  Can anyone who has been through this chime in.  I know I tapered way too fast, but I don't know what to do now that I am here.  I appreciate any perspective you can offer. 0 likes, 10 replies "

My plan was to write about my extremely painful and unexpected withdrawal experience after I felt better, but it has been FIFTEEN months. I was on 1800-3600 mg /day for 20 years.  My physician put me on a six day weaning schedule.  The day I took my last dose my pain skyrocketed, but the pain has changed from low back to toes pain, to pain mostly to my anterior legs below my knees.  Unfortunately, it is a very slow process.  The internal nerve shaking that accompanies the pain is beyond annoying. I often read patients on forums stating they have no problem with gabapentin.  I did not think my problems were that terrible before I went off the drug.  They all come with cautions and potential problems.  I wish I had known of how difficult this drug was to discontinue before I had ever taken the first pill.  I wish someone had warned me. Good luck to everyone trying to discontinue gabapentin.  I hope your experience is easier than mine. 17 likes, 926 replies "

In the past i took Remeron, Ativan, and sometimes Depakote for anger issues. I recently went back to my dr. cause of a traumatic event that occurred and brought back all my depression, anxiety, and I haven’t been sleeping because reoccurring dreams which caused headaches.  I told him i don’t need Depakote my anger issues are stable and have been. The dr. suggested the new drug Topamax, because it can actually treat all three of my problems. In reality in the past I can take Ativan and Remeron before I go to be bed and wah la! The next day I would be fine no anxiety no depression and guess what no headaches from lack of sleep. But Topamax sounds like a great new wonder drug when the dr. explains it with no hesitation for prescribing it. Which makes me wonder is Topamax the next new   drug like the Prozac craze that swept the nation and fattened the wallets of everyone but the patients whom it negatively affected? My curiosity got the best of me, and with some poking around and some amateur research this is what I recovered. Most of it came from inserts from health magazines and dr. articles as well as FDA reports and patients personals experiences.  So before its patent expired in 2009, the seizure drug Topamax made Johnson & Johnson a billion a year and it still made $538 million a year after its patent expiration. Topamax was such a favorite for pain conditions in the military it was given the nickname “stupamax” for the way it slowed reaction times and impaired motor skills, attention and memory, not too great for combat.    Topamax is an anticonvulsant drug approved for the treatment of seizures (epilepsy) in adults and children. It can be used alone, or in combination with other anticonvulsants. It is also approved for use in preventing migraine headaches in adults.  While not approved by the FDA for other illnesses, Topamax has been tried and studied in the treatment of tremors, nerve pain, cluster headaches, eating disorders, alcohol dependence, and bipolar disorder (also known as manic-depression).    Topamax/PDF.  Does Topamax really treat so many disparate conditions that doctors prescribe it for everything, even when it is not FDA approved for these conditions? I must add that Topamax is one of the most dangerous drugs in the prescription market today. ... Evidence is also accumulating that Topamax can cause brain damage!   /  My question is do you treat people with depression with meds that can cause depression and is it like treating someone with a flu vaccine cause your treating it with a live virus? Topamax was prescribed for me for depression, anxiety, and headaches. Whenever I start a new Pharmacia drug that I know nothing about I often write down my side effects. But with Topamax it went a lot deeper than I attended to. Here are some of the side effects from their website: Abdominal or stomach pain fever, chills, or sore throat lessening of sensations or perception loss of appetite mood or mental changes, including aggression, agitation, apathy, irritability, and mental depression red, irritated, or bleeding gums weight loss  Back to the amount of money made from Topamax and why it is so ready for prescription. Even though being approved by the FDA only for seizures (epilepsy) and preventing migraine headaches in adults and may have been approved for weight loss.There are dangerous side effects caused by prescribing Topamax for other ailments.  Why would you take an epilepsy seizure drug for pain? The same reason you'll take an antipsychotic for the blues and an antidepressant for knee pain: good consumer marketing. -- But it is still the darling of military and civilian doctors for unapproved pain and migraine. Topamax also has the distinction of looting $51 million from Medicaid last year despite a generic existing.  All seizure drugs increase the risk of   thoughts and behaviors according to their mandated labels. An April article in JAMA found seizure drugs linked to 26  s, 801 attempted  s, and 41 violent deaths in just five years. But yet I was prescribed one of them. Also to add to it seizure drugs can make you lose your memory and your hair, say posters on the drug rating site   And yet there is so much money to be made off the suffering of patients, my next question is how the dr. will react to my side effects and wanting to discontinue use? Will he say that’s a normal reaction and it will go away with time and continue treatment. I can see why he would suggest that cause after the two week mark I’m supposed to take 4 pills an hour before bed. Increase of dose is an increase in prescription equals increase in the wallets. But I have a hard time taking something that has not been approved by the FDA and especially because it’s been on the list of top15 dangerous prescription drugs. My notable side effects from Topamax:          Numbness and tingled fingertips which prevent me to sleep, this was one the worse withdrawals symptoms I went through when i went cold turkey off of suboxone.          Agitated and irritable and sometime short fused          Watery eyes          Foggy head, problems with memory;  1985 i was given Ritalin and continued  all through college          Dry mouth and feeling dehydrated and somewhat lethargic           My so called migraine moved to behind my left temple. I never had a problem with migraines it was caused by the lack of sleep recently. I took Depakote in the past for anger not for migraines.          Food and drinks taste weird          Lack of appetite          Abdominal discomfort                      These are the side effects so far after day one on Topamax will continue tomorrow and as the day progressed some got added.  Again a reminder the only reason why I’m writing this is to keep my fingertips busy to avoid trying to chew them off. But my research only dove into the treating people with depression with Topamax and the adverse effects. I didn’t get into the dangers it has affected most in females especially pregnant females. But from my research consensus is that Topamax does help with migraines but on the other hand at times does nothing or even of reports of worsen.  Oct 24/17 I took 50mg of Topamax at around 12am I was supposed to take 100mg but again I have problem taking something I know nothing about. I did fall asleep but not for long only for a few hours as I woke up with numbness and tingly fingertips which in the pass was one of my worse symptoms that prevented me from sleeping after going cold turkey from suboxone after 7yrs of taking. It usual takes at least 4-5 hours for that restless feeling to go away in my fingertips to finally fall back asleep but if you think about it I just wasted my day.  I thought it was over around 10:45pm my entire body started over heating despite having a fan on me. I couldn’t get comfortable as I’m stripping down to my boxers. I also had immense pressure behind both eyes and that’s when the sharp abdominal pains started and lasted for some time. So what am I to do? I wanted this to end! As I lay in bed trying to get comfortable I look over as that bottle of Topamax stares at me. So I took 50mg hoping to get some relief even if it only for a few hours, but I have a feeling that my body is going to reject it like it did the night before. After taking it and 2 hours later with no effect, I took another 50mg in actuality what I am prescribed. Within a restless hour I fell asleep, but only to wake up again feeling some very familiar symptoms. I felt like I was going through some of the horrors of opiate withdrawal. My back felt like it was sunburnt and tingly, my body ached, and to add on the side effects from earlier. Again after a few restless hours it subsided and I was able to fall asleep but I wasted my day. I have so much pressure behind my eyes and basically my whole head which is making me miserable. This is only from two days of taking this wonder drug and supposedly in two weeks an increase of dosage like a person whom is tolerant to their pain meds.  So is this drug being treated like a person who is prescribed or addicted to painkillers? People on painkillers and most opiate addicts achieve a tolerance where it has no more effect on them and have to up they’re intake. I personally spending much of my life in the restaurant business and witnessing firsthand the cycle of drug’s especially painkillers and its high-end price tag. Topamax is very similar to opiate painkillers when dealing with dopamine to which they both affect GABA, what is GABA?   says states; GABA is a neurotransmitter that blocks impulses between nerve cells in the brain. Low levels of GABA may be linked to: Anxiety or mood disorders. Epilepsy. Chronic pain.  My question is why dr.’s increase the dosage of Topamax as weeks goes on as if we build a tolerance to the drug and the healthy price tag that comes with Topamax. It’s not easy finding that answer, but what I’m finding is the misuse for the drug. This justifies my beliefs on the concern about the money made and not the sanity of the patients prescribed.   I’ve only just started!!!! 2 likes, 2 replies "

Will he say that’s a normal reaction and it will go away with time and continue treatment. I can see why he would suggest that cause after the two week mark I’m supposed to take 4 pills an hour before bed. Increase of dose is an increase in prescription equals increase in the wallets. But I have a hard time taking something that has not been approved by the FDA and especially because it’s been on the list of top15 dangerous prescription drugs. My notable side effects from Topamax:          Numbness and tingled fingertips which prevent me to sleep, this was one the worse withdrawals symptoms I went through when i went cold turkey off of suboxone.          Agitated and irritable and sometime short fused          Watery eyes          Foggy head, problems with memory;  1985 i was given Ritalin and continued  all through college          Dry mouth and feeling dehydrated and somewhat lethargic           My so called migraine moved to behind my left temple. I never had a problem with migraines it was caused by the lack of sleep recently. I took Depakote in the past for anger not for migraines.          Food and drinks taste weird          Lack of appetite          Abdominal discomfort                      These are the side effects so far after day one on Topamax will continue tomorrow and as the day progressed some got added.  Again a reminder the only reason why I’m writing this is to keep my fingertips busy to avoid trying to chew them off. But my research only dove into the treating people with depression with Topamax and the adverse effects. I didn’t get into the dangers it has affected most in females especially pregnant females. But from my research consensus is that Topamax does help with migraines but on the other hand at times does nothing or even of reports of worsen.  Oct 24/17 I took 50mg of Topamax at around 12am I was supposed to take 100mg but again I have problem taking something I know nothing about. I did fall asleep but not for long only for a few hours as I woke up with numbness and tingly fingertips which in the pass was one of my worse symptoms that prevented me from sleeping after going cold turkey from suboxone after 7yrs of taking. It usual takes at least 4-5 hours for that restless feeling to go away in my fingertips to finally fall back asleep but if you think about it I just wasted my day.  I thought it was over around 10:45pm my entire body started over heating despite having a fan on me. I couldn’t get comfortable as I’m stripping down to my boxers. I also had immense pressure behind both eyes and that’s when the sharp abdominal pains started and lasted for some time. So what am I to do? I wanted this to end! As I lay in bed trying to get comfortable I look over as that bottle of Topamax stares at me. So I took 50mg hoping to get some relief even if it only for a few hours, but I have a feeling that my body is going to reject it like it did the night before. After taking it and 2 hours later with no effect, I took another 50mg in actuality what I am prescribed. Within a restless hour I fell asleep, but only to wake up again feeling some very familiar symptoms. I felt like I was going through some of the horrors of opiate withdrawal. My back felt like it was sunburnt and tingly, my body ached, and to add on the side effects from earlier. Again after a few restless hours it subsided and I was able to fall asleep but I wasted my day. I have so much pressure behind my eyes and basically my whole head which is making me miserable. This is only from two days of taking this wonder drug and supposedly in two weeks an increase of dosage like a person whom is tolerant to their pain meds.  So is this drug being treated like a person who is prescribed or addicted to painkillers? People on painkillers and most opiate addicts achieve a tolerance where it has no more effect on them and have to up they’re intake. I personally spending much of my life in the restaurant business and witnessing firsthand the cycle of drug’s especially painkillers and its high-end price tag. Topamax is very similar to opiate painkillers when dealing with dopamine to which they both affect GABA, what is GABA?   says states; GABA is a neurotransmitter that blocks impulses between nerve cells in the brain.

Topamax was prescribed for me for depression, anxiety, and headaches. Whenever I start a new Pharmacia drug that I know nothing about I often write down my side effects. But with Topamax it went a lot deeper than I attended to.

Also to add to it seizure drugs can make you lose your memory and your hair, say posters on the drug rating site   And yet there is so much money to be made off the suffering of patients, my next question is how the dr. will react to my side effects and wanting to discontinue use? Will he say that’s a normal reaction and it will go away with time and continue treatment. I can see why he would suggest that cause after the two week mark I’m supposed to take 4 pills an hour before bed. Increase of dose is an increase in prescription equals increase in the wallets. But I have a hard time taking something that has not been approved by the FDA and especially because it’s been on the list of top15 dangerous prescription drugs. My notable side effects from Topamax:          Numbness and tingled fingertips which prevent me to sleep, this was one the worse withdrawals symptoms I went through when i went cold turkey off of suboxone.          Agitated and irritable and sometime short fused          Watery eyes          Foggy head, problems with memory;  1985 i was given Ritalin and continued  all through college          Dry mouth and feeling dehydrated and somewhat lethargic           My so called migraine moved to behind my left temple. I never had a problem with migraines it was caused by the lack of sleep recently. I took Depakote in the past for anger not for migraines.          Food and drinks taste weird          Lack of appetite          Abdominal discomfort                      These are the side effects so far after day one on Topamax will continue tomorrow and as the day progressed some got added.  Again a reminder the only reason why I’m writing this is to keep my fingertips busy to avoid trying to chew them off. But my research only dove into the treating people with depression with Topamax and the adverse effects. I didn’t get into the dangers it has affected most in females especially pregnant females. But from my research consensus is that Topamax does help with migraines but on the other hand at times does nothing or even of reports of worsen.  Oct 24/17 I took 50mg of Topamax at around 12am I was supposed to take 100mg but again I have problem taking something I know nothing about. I did fall asleep but not for long only for a few hours as I woke up with numbness and tingly fingertips which in the pass was one of my worse symptoms that prevented me from sleeping after going cold turkey from suboxone after 7yrs of taking. It usual takes at least 4-5 hours for that restless feeling to go away in my fingertips to finally fall back asleep but if you think about it I just wasted my day.  I thought it was over around 10:45pm my entire body started over heating despite having a fan on me. I couldn’t get comfortable as I’m stripping down to my boxers. I also had immense pressure behind both eyes and that’s when the sharp abdominal pains started and lasted for some time. So what am I to do? I wanted this to end! As I lay in bed trying to get comfortable I look over as that bottle of Topamax stares at me. So I took 50mg hoping to get some relief even if it only for a few hours, but I have a feeling that my body is going to reject it like it did the night before. After taking it and 2 hours later with no effect, I took another 50mg in actuality what I am prescribed. Within a restless hour I fell asleep, but only to wake up again feeling some very familiar symptoms. I felt like I was going through some of the horrors of opiate withdrawal. My back felt like it was sunburnt and tingly, my body ached, and to add on the side effects from earlier. Again after a few restless hours it subsided and I was able to fall asleep but I wasted my day. I have so much pressure behind my eyes and basically my whole head which is making me miserable. This is only from two days of taking this wonder drug and supposedly in two weeks an increase of dosage like a person whom is tolerant to their pain meds.  So is this drug being treated like a person who is prescribed or addicted to painkillers? People on painkillers and most opiate addicts achieve a tolerance where it has no more effect on them and have to up they’re intake. I personally spending much of my life in the restaurant business and witnessing firsthand the cycle of drug’s especially painkillers and its high-end price tag. Topamax is very similar to opiate painkillers when dealing with dopamine to which they both affect GABA, what is GABA?   says states; GABA is a neurotransmitter that blocks impulses between nerve cells in the brain. Low levels of GABA may be linked to: Anxiety or mood disorders. Epilepsy. Chronic pain.  My question is why dr.’s increase the dosage of Topamax as weeks goes on as if we build a tolerance to the drug and the healthy price tag that comes with Topamax. It’s not easy finding that answer, but what I’m finding is the misuse for the drug. This justifies my beliefs on the concern about the money made and not the sanity of the patients prescribed.   I’ve only just started!!!! 2 likes, 2 replies "

THE MOST RECENT EXPERIENCE WAS AWFUL............  it makes me well up with tears because it was so bad. I'm not sure but I have had a pretty stressful sad couple of month's and maybe this made the side effects worse but about a month into taking 150mg I started feeling depressed. Sad.  Tired. Anxious I couldn't stop thinking that I was going to die all of a sudden.  Then in one day I had 5 debilitating panic attacks which at the time I didn't know wat was happening to me I called them death dreams.  I put it down to my life factors and continued taking the pills. Then another month passed I had another really bad attack and I actually told my husband this was it I was dying.  The attack was so bad I was unresponsive In a semi unconscious state.

I just thought the quicker I stopped the better it would be. I continued having anxiety felt like I was detached from my body.  I felt different depressed got really agitated easily. Felt like I wanted to cry all the time.  I tried to shrug it off but the constant anxiety about dying made me go to the doc. She instantly put me on fluoxitine / prozac. Of course at the time I didn't realize to tell her I had quit my topamax cold turkey. Because I was still unaware what the withdrawal symptoms were. So for the past week I have been on forums. typing my symptoms into the symptom checker and then it was like a light bulb went on when I typed in topamax withdrawals I pretty much had every symptom that was listed.  Relief! !! Kind of. Now I have the awful exaggerated symptoms from starting prozac. Which has made me feel worse. My only hope is to start to feel better   so I have called the nurse today to pass the message on to my doc  about stopping cold turkey. .. 2 likes, 10 replies "

I just thought the quicker I stopped the better it would be. I continued having anxiety felt like I was detached from my body.  I felt different depressed got really agitated easily. Felt like I wanted to cry all the time.  I tried to shrug it off but the constant anxiety about dying made me go to the doc. She instantly put me on fluoxitine / prozac. Of course at the time I didn't realize to tell her I had quit my topamax cold turkey. Because I was still unaware what the withdrawal symptoms were. So for the past week I have been on forums. typing my symptoms into the symptom checker and then it was like a light bulb went on when I typed in topamax withdrawals I pretty much had every symptom that was listed.  Relief! !! Kind of. Now I have the awful exaggerated symptoms from starting prozac. Which has made me feel worse. My only hope is to start to feel better   so I have called the nurse today to pass the message on to my doc  about stopping cold turkey. .. 2 likes, 10 replies "

Originally, I was taking topirimate for migrainea and what my neurologist beleives are absent seizures. The absent seizures have mainly faded (went from 20-30 a day to 0-5 a day) but since reaching 75 mg all the side effects have gotten worse! I now have these convulsions and interrupted sleep. When I was taking smaller doses of the meds, I would sleep perfectly through the night (previously I would be jarred awake every 2-3 hours, possibly seizures during my sleep). Has anyone else had these sort of issues with increased doses? Wondering if these issues are because I am taking 100mg at nighttime rather than the two seperate doses like most who use it for antiseizure purposes. I am feeling so horrible on these meds I am going to start tapering myself off while my neurologist is away on vacation...  0 likes, 1 reply "

(English isn’t my first language, so excuse me if some more technical terms are a bit odd.) I probably have a very early stage of TN. In short: it began with tooth pain, 3 dental visits and no damage found really explaining the pain. Before my third dental visit, the pain (still localized to the teeth root area-ish) would start to be triggered by certain movement of and/or touching the gum, upper lip and nose. Then I had a short episode of two or three full-blown bursts of electric, fiery pain from my nose area, via the cheek up to the eye. Right now, I'm back to just having the initial tooth sensitivity (sudden pain), nose area is  back to normal (no sensitivity) and no more bursts of face pain. I’ve read enough about TN to know that tooth pain is a very common first sign, but more specific information is hard to come by. A lot of people (some, at least) have done multiple root canals or pulled multiple teeth, and additionally the dental work rarely (never?) seemed to help. Is this because the pain is/was hard to localize, or did   teeth start to hurt after the initial tooth was ""taken care of""? The reason I’m asking, is that my pain originates from a specific tooth – there’s no question about it. The pain is to some extent triggered by sweet and sour, but especially any form av vibration, be it an electrical tooth brush or if it comes into contact with another tooth when I speak, hum or cough. I can only bite into soft things; anything hard or crisp triggers pain. I have sensitive teeth in general (corrosion to the enamel and exposed tooth necks), so the sensitivity in itself isn’t weird, and generally my tooth paste for sensitive teeth takes care of that. Not with this tooth. I’ve read that in some rare cases, a tooth can itself be a trigger zone, and I’m wondering if this could be the case for me.

GP and Neurologist has confirmed I have Atypical TN, bilateral.  For the past few months, it's been bubbling away in the background, enough for me to be aware of it but the pain has been bearable and I did get the odd respite day where I felt almost human again. However the past 3 - 4 weeks it has ramped up and it's now pretty awful.  Burning, aching, electric shocks in both sides of my face and all over my head.  I'm on anticonvulsants but I wondered if anyone could advise of any coping mechanisms to keep me positive through all this! I've been going to Yoga class but unfortunately I think I will have to give this up.  The pressure in my face is horrendous when I do various moves eg downward dog and cats pose.  It's too painful to do those and I wonder if I'm making the pain worse by doing those stretches?  So, has anyone got any tips to try, which helps mentally as well as physically? My GP is actually doing her best to help me but I guess you have to live with it to understand just how awful this disease really is. Thank you in advance everyone X 0 likes, 6 replies "

I am 26 years old. I was diagnosed with SVT a year ago. I had been having episodes of what I believe now was SVT since I was 19 years old, but I just kept brushing it off... until one day I was not able to get out of it. I ended up going to the hospital here in Dallas with a heart rate of 240bpm. Anyways, long story short I ended up having a 6 hour cardiac ablation surgery a few weeks later. Electrophysiologist said there was an extra pathway in my heart that he was able to burn away. He did confirm that some of the pathway was too close to one of the nodes so he wouldn't be able to fully burn it without having to put in a pacemaker. Things have been okay since then. Although, I did notice I was getting short of breath with activities that would not regularly cause this. I figured this may be side effects of the ablation surgery and moved on with my everyday life. Fast forward, Dec 18th was a year post surgery. I am having episodes of what I think are palpations but also feel different from my normal experience with palpations. I used to get palpations before my ablation surgery frequently. I describe these as now more frequent, lasting around 30 seconds at a time, and shortness of breath comes on strong with these. It's very inconvenient and somewhat scary. It's probably happened over 50 times today. I cant tell if I'm going into an irregular heart beat or I'm just having palpations. It just doesnt make sense, I'm in shape, I used to run half marathons and now I'm unable to mop the kitchen floor without struggling to breathe. I'm sorry about the rant, yall... but anyone else ever experienced this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  - SARA 0 likes, 6 replies "

Last week I felt an anxious pressure in my chest that took me to svt. Now I'm trying a combination of Leonurus Cardiaca and Onopordon as fitoterapiya and pressure is gone.

I am 56 years old and have experienced episodes of SVT since I was 13 years old.  In the beginning,  I would go very long periods of time without an episode, sometimes once or twice a year.  I was able to stop them using vagal maneuvers in a fairly short time.  When I was in my 30's I was having longer episodes, so my cardiologist put me on 25 mg. of atenolol daily.  Because I had pretty low blood pressure,  that was the maximum dosage I could take.  About 5 years ago, the episodes became more frequent.  My cardiologist then switched my medication to metoprolol to see if that worked better.  The episodes still came, but I was able to control them with the maneuvers.  Starting about a year and a half ago, my episodes started to come very frequently.  I was having episodes weekly or every other week.  They lasted longer and were definitely more difficult to stop.  In the past 6 months I have gotten 3 really bad attacks that put me in the E.R.  One of them happened while I was driving.  I get a weird tingling sensation in my arms and legs, and feel as if I am going to pass out.  I travel quite often for work and would not take any flight that was longer than 1.5 hours because of the svt.  I realized that it was really taking control of my life and happiness.  I made an appointment to see an electrophysiologist and spoke to him about an ablation.  I scheduled the procedure for February of 2020.  A few days after that visit, I had an svt that lasted 90 minutes, and had to be taken by ambulance to the E.R.  None of the maneuvers worked, so they had to give me adenosine.  I am sure some of you know how awful that drug is!  Because of that, I moved my date for my ablation up.  I had my procedure yesterday.  I was frightened, panic stricken and just a nervous wreck.  Of course you think the worst is going to happen.  The team at the hospital was amazing, and my electrophysiologist is the best!  I am lucky to live in Boston with some of the best hospitals in the world.  I had my procedure at Brigham and Women's Hospital with Dr. David Martin.  I can't say enough about what a positive experience it was.  My SVT was very cooperative and they were able to start it almost immediately.  They ablated in two areas.  When they finish, they race your heart again to see if it will go into svt.  Nothing!  They got it!!  I asked for minimal sedation (I know you all probably think I am crazy, but I like to be awake and know what's going on!)  I remember everything, but was very relaxed.  The team told me everything that was happening so there were no surprises.  My procedure took under 2 hours, and I went home about 4 hours later.

I am 56 years old and have experienced episodes of SVT since I was 13 years old.  In the beginning,  I would go very long periods of time without an episode, sometimes once or twice a year.  I was able to stop them using vagal maneuvers in a fairly short time.  When I was in my 30's I was having longer episodes, so my cardiologist put me on 25 mg. of atenolol daily.  Because I had pretty low blood pressure,  that was the maximum dosage I could take.  About 5 years ago, the episodes became more frequent.  My cardiologist then switched my medication to metoprolol to see if that worked better.  The episodes still came, but I was able to control them with the maneuvers.  Starting about a year and a half ago, my episodes started to come very frequently.  I was having episodes weekly or every other week.  They lasted longer and were definitely more difficult to stop.  In the past 6 months I have gotten 3 really bad attacks that put me in the E.R.  One of them happened while I was driving.  I get a weird tingling sensation in my arms and legs, and feel as if I am going to pass out.  I travel quite often for work and would not take any flight that was longer than 1.5 hours because of the svt.  I realized that it was really taking control of my life and happiness.  I made an appointment to see an electrophysiologist and spoke to him about an ablation.  I scheduled the procedure for February of 2020.  A few days after that visit, I had an svt that lasted 90 minutes, and had to be taken by ambulance to the E.R.  None of the maneuvers worked, so they had to give me adenosine.  I am sure some of you know how awful that drug is!  Because of that, I moved my date for my ablation up.  I had my procedure yesterday.  I was frightened, panic stricken and just a nervous wreck.  Of course you think the worst is going to happen.  The team at the hospital was amazing, and my electrophysiologist is the best!  I am lucky to live in Boston with some of the best hospitals in the world.  I had my procedure at Brigham and Women's Hospital with Dr. David Martin.  I can't say enough about what a positive experience it was.  My SVT was very cooperative and they were able to start it almost immediately.  They ablated in two areas.  When they finish, they race your heart again to see if it will go into svt.  Nothing!  They got it!!  I asked for minimal sedation (I know you all probably think I am crazy, but I like to be awake and know what's going on!)  I remember everything, but was very relaxed.  The team told me everything that was happening so there were no surprises.  My procedure took under 2 hours, and I went home about 4 hours later.  Last night I slept like a baby and woke up feeling great!  I do have minimal discomfort in my groin where the catheters were, but I can't even call it pain.  If you are on the fence, DO IT!

Prior to this treatment and diagnostic testing my long standing sinus issues went on for some years. But around 20 months ago I decided to see an ENT, in fact I went to two as I wanted a second opinion on the suggested sinus surgery. I presented with a problematic throat and hoarseness, post nasal drip, facial pains and congested nasal airways. Some ear pain and muffled hearing was always present. Manly the right ear, but would also include the left. what would follow would be two lots of FESS (Sinus surgery) which seems to have be largely successful in dealing with my sinus issues, so far. Both maxillary, ethmoid and frontal sinuses were operated on. I will always need to irrigate daily. My LPR is being managed through diet and lifestyle choices mainly after diagnostics and tests from a Gastro specialists. In the background was always my ear pain, muffled type hearing and perhaps the odd buzz or two. But that had to stay on the back burner due to other pressing issues. Once the sinus issues seemed more under control, about three months now post op from the second surgery, the ear situation needed to be addressed. It seemed with the clearing up of lots of mucous my muffled hearing seemed to have improved. The pain, which could be quite bad at times, has largely gone. BUT..... I'm left with tinnitus in both (predominately on the right) ears which at times, when I focus or in quiet surroundings, drives me a little crazy. It is a high pitched constant tone, no deviation. Just varying degrees of how loud that it can be. Just occasionally it can stop and, when I notice that its stopped its like ""Wow that is what silence is like""....!  Of course that doesn't seem to last for long. If I press my fingers in my ears and shake them around that sometimes makes it quieter, for a short while. I have had a CT scan and that is fine. I have had an hearing test (which includes a pressure test) and apart from some slight age related type loss that also is fine. I am arranging for a MRI scan as well.  Each  time that I've seen my ENT (although we were in the midst of sinus surgery or LPR diagnostics etc) he has checked my ears and after all the mucous has gone they now seem fine. A curve ball could be the beta blockers that I'm taking for my blood pressure, bisoprolol. According to one doctors list of ototoxic drugs they are number 5 at causing tinnitus in a list of beta blockers known to do so, and are even associated with hearing loss. I don't think that the six weeks or so of taking a long course of antibiotics between surgery on my sinuses helped. So what I've posted could explain why I am where I am, maybe. I do NOT want to spend time on Google at all - it is never my friend when it comes to searching for medical related questions.

I was 28 at the time. I was in a minor car accident at that time. I was under higher amounts of stress. I was taking antidepressants. I was also smoking cannabis frequently. My doctor initially treated it as a sinus infection although I didnt have any symptoms of an infection. We did two rounds of antibiotics with no change. I kept coming back with the same complaints of this roaring tinnitus which seemed to have mild and extreme variation. I also communicated that I was having head and neck spasms and shoulder pain. Eventually we came to the agreement that repetitive motion and forward head posture were causing these issues. It never went away but there are good days and bad days. I really focus on the physical therapy for posture as well as resting my neck in the correct position to help restore the natural curve. This seems to be the key for me. Smoking cannabis wasnt an option as it always created an unbearable flare up to the point where all i could do was lay down until the roaring stopped. In my case limiting inflammation related to bad posture, tendinitis and bursitis seems to lesson the flare ups and bring the noise level down to a tolerable level.

I was shuffling a stack of papers at work and noticed this crackling sound in my right ear with a feeling of slight fullness. Since these symptoms all started, I have also noticed crackling when I swallow hard which I can't remember if I had before or not because I never paid much attention to my ears prior to all of this. I tried not to think much of the crackling at the time and just assumed it was a weird thing that would quickly pass. This crackling sound happens any time I hear certain noises, which includes tapping, clicking, clapping, noises with a higher pitch or frequency I guess. It also includes my own voice and other people's voices at certain volumes or when I clear my throat or cough. Initially, I think I only really noticed the sound from outside noises, not my own voice up until more recently but I can't remember when it was. I tried not to worry too much about it at first and hoped it was something easy like maybe having water in my ear but sometime in early July I went to see an ENT (I had not gone to a primary doctor first). I explained to him the symptoms I was having and he looked into my ears and said everything looked great but noticed that my top and bottom jaw are pretty misaligned (I've had a fairly significant overbite since I was a teen) and he asked if my jaw gave me any problems, and I said yes, but not currently. Knock on wood, I haven't dealt with the TMJ issues that I had suffered for about 11 or 12 years up until about 3 years ago. Every couple of months I would go through periods of time lasting for only a couple of days to a month or two at times where I could barely open my mouth and when I would I would have a ton of pain. So basically this first ENT I went to told me everything basically looked fine, aside from my jaw so I told him maybe I would try making a fresh night guard because the one I was using at the time was kind of worn out (I've worn one at night for a long time to protect my teeth from clenching and grinding) my thought process behind that was that maybe because my night guard was worn out, somehow too much pressure was being applied to the structures in my ear causing my symptoms. After making a new nightguard and still experiencing the same symptoms, I decided to seek out another ENT since the first one I had seen didn't seem to really care about getting down to the bottom of anything. I made an appointment with a new ENT who is very well-liked at the end of July and explained to him the same symptoms I had explained to the previous doctor and he said that he couldn't say for sure what was going on but told me to start using a nasal decongestant daily and also take allergy medicine for about a month which I did but had no reduction in symptoms.  He also had me take a hearing test from which my doctor concluded that I have perfect hearing, in fact better than average which provided a small amount of relief. I anxiously waited for my follow-up appointment with him again in early September, during this visit,  I told him that my symptoms were the same even after doing what he told me to do. During this visit, he also explained some of the more complex conditions that could be causing my symptoms, one of them being a perilymphatic fistula or semi circular canal dehiscence. He placed a tuning fork on my ankle and asked if I could hear the vibration in my ear(s) and I told him that I actually could hear the vibration in the affected ear. That's when he told me more about semi circular canal dehiscence and I dreaded the possibility of having such a condition as the symptoms sounded absolutely dreadful and surgery is typically reserved for people who's symptoms are much mores evere than what mine are. At the end of that visit, he ordered a temporal CT scan to better asses my situation. I got the CT scan done a week or two after my follow-up visit and he called me a few days later to let me know the results which felt devastating, he told me that I have semi circular canal dehiscence on both sides and that during my next visit with him he would further discuss everything and if I ever decided to go through with surgery he would refer me to someone else because he doesn't do many of these surgeries and that the risks are not to be taken lightly. I felt absolutely crushed and became extremely upset and wondered why all of a sudden something I've probably had my whole life is now causing these frustrating symptoms. While on the phone with my doctor, I posed a potential trigger for my symptoms. I explained that around the time my symptoms I had started taking orthotricyclen (I think sometime in May) and spironolactone for my skin and asked him if he thought the combination of these two medications could have anything to do with the onset of my symptoms and he said maybe and said to try not taking them for a few weeks and see if it made a difference. At the same time, he mentioned a different diuretic than the one I was taking called acetazolamide (500mg capsules) which I intially declined trying but a few days later I called his office and asked for him to send the prescription to my pharmacy to try, so I started taking it once in the morning and once before bed but very quickly noticed that it made my lips, face and hands randomly tingle which I did not like and didn't notice any difference in my symptoms so stopped taking the medicine after about a week. Toward the end of taking the acetazolamide, I went on a week long trip to Colorado to visit family and worried for months prior if my symptoms would get worse due to the difference in elevation but my doctor said I should be fine and suggested taking sudafed before my flights which I did, and I did not notice any worsening of symptoms until we traveled to an area on a Saturday night that was 7,500 ft elevation versus the 5,000 feet near Denver. After coming back to my family's house that night from the higher elevation town, I experienced pain and fullness in my left ear, the opposite one from which I have the crackling problem which completely freaked me out. For the next several days the pain and fullness didn't improve much but then it started to feel better by Thursday, I felt relieved and the next day on Friday, I went to the gym and worked out as I like to do at least 2-3 times per week and on this seemed to trigger the symptoms in my left ear again and the pain and fullness didn't subside until this past Saturday or Sunday so I haven't worked out since then fearing that it will come back again. In desparation, shortly after returning from Colorado I went to see a doctor at one of the local urgent care places and he helped put me at ease (a little). The left ear pain and fullness has been intermittent since starting over a week ago. The urgent care doctor was very nice and explained that he thought it seemed like a blocked Eustachian tube and said he thought that the crackling I have been experiencing for months could also be caused by Eustachian tube dysfunction. He tried to re-assure me that these symptoms would probably go away eventually and to continue taking sudafed and try steaming my face over hot water to help loosen everything up which I did a few times but my symptoms are still the same,  with the exception of the constant pain and fullness I first experienced in Colorado which has gotten better but hasn't fully resolved. Over the course of just the last few days, I have noticed new symptoms which includes random minor pains in my left ear that come and go and short bouts of ringing in my left ear on top of the same extremely frustrating crackling in my right ear which has remained a constant throughout this whole ordeal. Ever since this all started, and especially after my diagnosis, this has basically been all I can think about. My symptoms are really only noticeable when I'm in a quiet environment by myself, I don't notice it if there is background noise which offers some reief. Sometime last week I called my doctor's office again to see if there is any way that I can see him before my next follow-up appointment on Nov 12th which I don't think is going to happen because his schedule is always very busy, but I was able to get the message through to him what had happened in Colorado and one of the staff members must have talked to him because they told me that I could try prednisone and that he would send over the prescription to my pharmacy but I haven't called to see if it's there because I have heard bad things about taking it and I don't want any more adverse effects from taking a medication. I even went to Rite Aid and purchased this device called Eustachi which you put up to your nostril while plugging  your other nostril and it puts a puff of air up your nose to help clear the Eustachian tubes and I didn't notice a difference after using that either, I also bought some ear drops that I haven't tried yet. So that is where I'm currently at, anxiously awaiting and dreading my next appointment to see him. I'm kind of hoping that what happened with my left ear will point more to a Eustachian tube problem and not something directly related to the fact that apparently I have semi circular canal dehiscence and that hopefully eventually these symptoms will just go away.  I know this is probably pretty far fetched, and I'm probably being neurotic but I'm honestly worried that one day I'm going to just wake up and not be able to hear anymore. I just want it all to stop 😦 0 likes, 1 reply "

The fear this condition causes in me is indescribable at times but I have never had an episode of svt last longer than an hour.  Some folks on here must be superhuman considering tales of 6 or 9 hour events!  I wanted to ask anyone willing if they could relate to my episode tonight.  Tonight's event started with ringing in ears/feeling like I might faint briefly-then heart started racing.  I have never experienced this (feeling like I would faint) before or alongside an svt event.  Amidst all the anxiety this normally causes, it is hard not to fear some sort of escalation.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Or worse?   I guess I am just hoping to feel better about this most recent episode and reading other stories has helped so far...thanks. 0 likes, 6 replies "

I have had episodes spanning over 10+ years (35 now) and my last episode yesterday. It brings me into a deep sense of panic everytime and actually makes me psychologically depressed during the episode and afterwards. It's the aftermath that is equally difficult for me because after SVT or even the body fighting against the Bisoprolol and attempting bring on an episode unsuccessfully , can leave my chest uncomfortable, aching and feeling bruised, aching back muscles as well as chest, tiredness, further attempts of SVT grabbing my breath. im walking like an old man with a mixture of   and after effects of SVT and my business, which is only office based is failing!

However, i had one today completely out the blue and it started a bit irregular then went into an svt episode, i sat down and just chilled out and my heart rate stayed at about 165 but i could still feel it was ""stuck"" in that cycle. My question: is the svt heart rate fundamentally determined by the physcial location of the extra pathway in your heart and then whenever it goes faster than the base rate (in my case 165 bpm ish) it usually caused by external factors such as adrenaline, exercise or stimulants etc? i would like to add i can terminate my episodes within about 5-10 seconds by lying in fetal position on my right side. just wanted to hear peoples views on this. thank you, Matt 0 likes, 19 replies "

I started having the itchy bottom symptoms around September 2011 and booked in an appointment with my doctor.  The doctor said it was nothing serious and told me to take Anusol cream for the itch.  There is no doubt that the Anusol cream did relieve the itching symptoms for a few hours but I was constantly waking up throughout the night with a horrible urge to itch. It got so bad that I was getting constant baths every few hours just to provide some sort of relief.  I was very tired and irritable the next day in work and started feeling depressed and even started losing weight as my appetite had gone. At the time I was single (30 year old man) with no kids and so thought threadworm would be unlikely the cause and perhaps it was piles.  The itching just seemed to get worse and worse even during the day so I started researching the internet for hours and hours and decided it must be threadworms.  I also confirmed the presence of threadworm by excreting into a large piece of tinfoil around the toilet seat and the small white thread like worms were visible although not in great numbers. I took the Ovex (mebendazole) tablet and after 2 or 3 days the itching decreased and finally stopped.  I was so thankful that this ordeal was over, then to my horror the symptoms started to appear again after about a week.  I immediately took another Ovex and followed a very strict hygiene routine of changing my sheets every day and washing the bath / shower etc with bleach.  All carpets were vacuumed and door handles wiped down. Again I was given several days where the itching stopped but it wasn’t long before the dreading wriggling sensation returned as soon as I got into bed at nights and I was back to square one.  I remember feeling so down, I had to cancel a date and just sat in the house depressed and looking up websites about threadworm for hours and hours.  It finally got to the point where I was so depressed that I wondered if life was worth living any more.  I read many posts online about people who have had this condition for 20+ years which didn’t help my situation. I remember one night while sitting in the bath at about 2am having being woken up by the itch, I said to myself I am going to beat this problem once and for all.  I decided to research herbal remedies and read pages of useful information on how to beat the worms once and for all.  I must say that a lot of the useful tips came from this website which is why I have decided to post my experience here in the hope it helps others out. Materials Needed The first thing to do is order the following 3 products from Organic nutrition: 50ml Black Walnut Hull Extract (extra strength tincture) 120 Clove Capsules 120 Wormwood Capsules         Full instructions Total cost = £36.75 1 x Dust Mask which can be bought in a DIY store 1 x Nail Brush 1 x packet of Ovex 1 x Packet of pumpkin seeds from a health store 1 x packet of odourless garlic capsules 4 x packets of chopped up pineapple chunks Once all the materials and capsules have arrived, you need to do the follow: Take 1 ovex tablet with water and while wearing the dusk mask you need to vacuum every inch of carpet especially in your bedroom.  (The eggs can easily spread during this method so to prevent you from getting re-infected it is advised to wear a dust mask which covers your mouth and nose).  After vacuuming, you need to change your bed sheets and wipe down all door handles, tap handles etc.  Place the bed sheets and any towels in the wash at 90 degrees and iron once dry.  This is the only way to be sure the eggs are killed. The process must be repeated everyday for at least 10 days, I know it is a pain but believe me the end result is worth the hassle. You should also start taking your Black Walnut, clove and wormwood capsules as per the instructions that come with them.  Also try and eat a few handfuls of the pumpkin seeds throughout the day and take a portion of pineapple chunks daily.  These are all well know anti-parasitic remedies that actually work.  Follow this routine for 2 weeks. Finally and very importantly, the eggs that may still be in your house can survive up to 2 weeks in normal conditions.  If these are re-inhaled again then you are back to square one.  I read in many forums that if the house is warmed up to 50 degrees then the eggs can only survive for 2 hours. Every morning when I went to work, I left the heat on full blast for 9 hours at the highest temperature and opened the curtains in every room as the eggs are also sensitive to sunlight.  Vacuumed every night with my dust mask on and tried not to eat fast foods but stuck to things like brown rice and vegetables. I am happy to say that so far 2 months have past and the wriggling feeling has not returned and my life has got back to normal and I am now in a relationship again.  I never found out how I originally got infected with threadworm but hopefully I have got rid of these horrible parasites once and for all. I hope this helps some of you to rid these parasites and should you have any questions then please feel free to ask. 7 likes, 139 replies "

Again I was given several days where the itching stopped but it wasn’t long before the dreading wriggling sensation returned as soon as I got into bed at nights and I was back to square one.  I remember feeling so down, I had to cancel a date and just sat in the house depressed and looking up websites about threadworm for hours and hours.  It finally got to the point where I was so depressed that I wondered if life was worth living any more.  I read many posts online about people who have had this condition for 20+ years which didn’t help my situation. I remember one night while sitting in the bath at about 2am having being woken up by the itch, I said to myself I am going to beat this problem once and for all.  I decided to research herbal remedies and read pages of useful information on how to beat the worms once and for all.  I must say that a lot of the useful tips came from this website which is why I have decided to post my experience here in the hope it helps others out. Materials Needed The first thing to do is order the following 3 products from Organic nutrition: 50ml Black Walnut Hull Extract (extra strength tincture) 120 Clove Capsules 120 Wormwood Capsules         Full instructions Total cost = £36.75 1 x Dust Mask which can be bought in a DIY store 1 x Nail Brush 1 x packet of Ovex 1 x Packet of pumpkin seeds from a health store 1 x packet of odourless garlic capsules 4 x packets of chopped up pineapple chunks Once all the materials and capsules have arrived, you need to do the follow: Take 1 ovex tablet with water and while wearing the dusk mask you need to vacuum every inch of carpet especially in your bedroom.  (The eggs can easily spread during this method so to prevent you from getting re-infected it is advised to wear a dust mask which covers your mouth and nose).  After vacuuming, you need to change your bed sheets and wipe down all door handles, tap handles etc.  Place the bed sheets and any towels in the wash at 90 degrees and iron once dry.  This is the only way to be sure the eggs are killed. The process must be repeated everyday for at least 10 days, I know it is a pain but believe me the end result is worth the hassle. You should also start taking your Black Walnut, clove and wormwood capsules as per the instructions that come with them.  Also try and eat a few handfuls of the pumpkin seeds throughout the day and take a portion of pineapple chunks daily.  These are all well know anti-parasitic remedies that actually work.  Follow this routine for 2 weeks. Finally and very importantly, the eggs that may still be in your house can survive up to 2 weeks in normal conditions.  If these are re-inhaled again then you are back to square one.  I read in many forums that if the house is warmed up to 50 degrees then the eggs can only survive for 2 hours. Every morning when I went to work, I left the heat on full blast for 9 hours at the highest temperature and opened the curtains in every room as the eggs are also sensitive to sunlight.  Vacuumed every night with my dust mask on and tried not to eat fast foods but stuck to things like brown rice and vegetables. I am happy to say that so far 2 months have past and the wriggling feeling has not returned and my life has got back to normal and I am now in a relationship again.  I never found out how I originally got infected with threadworm but hopefully I have got rid of these horrible parasites once and for all. I hope this helps some of you to rid these parasites and should you have any questions then please feel free to ask. 7 likes, 139 replies "

I started having the itchy bottom symptoms around September 2011 and booked in an appointment with my doctor.  The doctor said it was nothing serious and told me to take Anusol cream for the itch.  There is no doubt that the Anusol cream did relieve the itching symptoms for a few hours but I was constantly waking up throughout the night with a horrible urge to itch. It got so bad that I was getting constant baths every few hours just to provide some sort of relief.  I was very tired and irritable the next day in work and started feeling depressed and even started losing weight as my appetite had gone. At the time I was single (30 year old man) with no kids and so thought threadworm would be unlikely the cause and perhaps it was piles.  The itching just seemed to get worse and worse even during the day so I started researching the internet for hours and hours and decided it must be threadworms.  I also confirmed the presence of threadworm by excreting into a large piece of tinfoil around the toilet seat and the small white thread like worms were visible although not in great numbers. I took the Ovex (mebendazole) tablet and after 2 or 3 days the itching decreased and finally stopped.  I was so thankful that this ordeal was over, then to my horror the symptoms started to appear again after about a week.  I immediately took another Ovex and followed a very strict hygiene routine of changing my sheets every day and washing the bath / shower etc with bleach.  All carpets were vacuumed and door handles wiped down. Again I was given several days where the itching stopped but it wasn’t long before the dreading wriggling sensation returned as soon as I got into bed at nights and I was back to square one.

Here are some things I learned that I think are worth sharing, so hopefully other people don't go through the same thing I did. Signs you might not have threadworms: 1) You feel them crawling during the day and not just at night. 2) Other people in your family don't catch them or don't feel them. 3) You have repeatedly taken the medication and been through the hygiene measures and it seems to have little or no effect. 4) You have not actually seen a definitive living threadworm, and you have tried doing tape tests, for example even right after you feel them crawling. In my case, the cause of the crawling feeling was actually overwashing. I expect this is common problem in association with threadworms. See, I did originally have a threadworm infection (a year and a half earlier), and that made me become obsessive about washing my bottom. After reading the horror stories here, I wanted to make sure I completely got rid of them. I would spend at least a couple of minutes just washing around my anus to make sure no threadworm eggs got left behind. It turns out that washing so thoroughly, with soap, makes the skin in this area super-sensitive, and it starts tickling occasionally for no reason. And that tickling feels EXACTLY like threadworms. I swear it is indistinguishable. A conversation I had with my mum, when I still thought I had threadworms and she suggested that it might just an itch. I responded with: ""It's not an itch, I can feel it crawling out and across my skin. I KNOW what threadworms feel like. I first found out I had them BECAUSE I could feel them, it was only afterwards that I saw one. I've never had that feeling before then, ever in my life. So I know this is them again, because there's nothing else that would cause a sensation like that."" Turns out I was wrong! It honestly can feel like they are crawling 'out and across your skin' even when they are not. Other thoughts: * All the scientific studies say that threadworms come out only at night, e.g. after 9 pm. I believe this is correct. * A few people have asked how quickly mebendazole works, and how effective it is. I don't know for definite, but I personally believe it kills worms quickly (within 5 days), and is probably close to 100% effective. This is because my own feelings of having worms changed from nighttime-only to daytime within a few days, and so I think it is quite common for the over-sensitive skin thing to kick in quickly once you start washing to get rid of the threadworms. What I would do if I ever thought I had threadworms again: 1) take the mebendazole once a week for a few weeks (6 at maximum) 2) make sure I don't wash too thoroughly after the first few weeks, and get an emollient-based soap-substitute (available from a pharmacist, usually used for eczema). 3) go and see a doctor if it didn't go away. My problem went away within a couple of days after I stopped over-washing. I hope this helps other people, and if it does, please, PLEASE come back and post to say so. Or if it doesn't work, or you disagree with me, or you don't believe me, you're welcome to post that too. I feel like this forum has become over-run with scare stories and unhelpful advice, and nobody seems aware of other possible causes for threadworm-like symptoms. 2 likes, 52 replies "

But it wasn't so itchy that I felt a huge need to do anything about it, so I just ignored it for a few months. Now that I'm living by myself I finally made myself go to the doctors and admit my problem even though I felt embarassed. I was prescribed something called Vermox which I believe is Mebendazole. After reading lots of information on this forum I'm very worried that it's not going to work and I'll be stuck with this problem as people have said that Mebendazole doesn't work, however I'm going to try it. I feel like the problem has gotten worse lately, I've definitely been getting the 'tickle' in my nose and ears that others have described, I have been sick with a cold too so I wonder if they have gotten worse due to a weakened immune system. I'm going to take the liquid form of Mebendazole I was given, wash all my bedding, underwear and pajamas daily in hot water for a week, clean the bathroom/floors etc and vacuum daily, then take it again one week later. I have a lot of questions though, which I forgot to ask my doctor. These are my questions: - Can you catch them from animals? I know there's many ways you can get them, but I was just wondering if it's possible to get them from pets. My mum thinks I got them off a public toilet seat but who knows. I'm a very clean person and have always washed my hands many times a day. - I live by myself in a self-contained part of the house, but share my landlady's washing machine, and it doesn't seem to work when you put it on the hot setting, only warm. So my doctor suggested I boil up a few jugs of hot water and put them into the washing machine each time I need to wash things and then put it on a warm wash, will this be enough? - My doctor told me that washing all bedding/underwear etc daily for the first week should be enough in terms of washing bedding/clothes, is this true? I'm worried about using too much water/using the washing machine too much as it might upset my landlady since my rent includes power/water but only a 'fair' usage. How often would I need to wash things after the first week? - Would it be neccessary to get my parents and sister to take a course of Mebendazole too now that I'm not living with them but I still visit them weekly? None of them have had symptoms but apparently they could have been affected without having any symptoms so if I went back to visit them could I end up reinfecting myself? - I was looking forward to having a close friend over to visit next week but now I'm so worried that I could infect him if he came over to stay with me even for one night while I'm in the middle of trying to get rid of this problem, so I've told him not to come. But I'm too embarassed to say why, so he is upset, as he lives in another city and had been planning on coming to visit me for a while.  Is this a good idea, not having him come to stay even for one night? Could he potentionally reinfect me if he came to stay, didn't get any symptoms but then came back to see me a few weeks later? Would there be any time when it would be safe for him to stay with me, such as just after taking a second dose? Sorry for the long post. I would really appreciate any replies, I've become really worried about this. 0 likes, 6 replies "

I discovered I had these after seeing them in my faeces at about age 9.  (Although in reality they are rarely seen in your poo once it has hit the water!) Until seeing them I had not realised that the sore itchy bottom that I suffered from on occasion was due to worms!  After realising what you have the itch becomes excruciating - in your mind as much as your bottom! I was treated but the symptomatic itch returned a few months later.  The whole family was then treated but again the worms returned.   Over the next few years both myself and my family were treated on many occasions whilst my mother paid scrupulous attention to cleaning of clothes and linen and regularly damp dusted the entire house to try to eliminate them - she could not have tried harder!   Over the years I continued to be reinfected - I began to recognise the particular irritation and knew each time reinfection occurred - even when not seeing any live worms!  Eventually at the age of about 18 I gave up even trying to combat the worms - the embarrassement became too much. I even gave up telling my mother!   As a result I have experienced guilt about 'carrying' worms and what I can only describe as an ongoing emotional battle/termoil.  I know I have infected others - friends and family - I recognise the symptoms, but I feel there is little I can do without a public and widespread treatment. How do you tell everyone you know or anyone who has visited your home that they need treatment!?   Most of the time I have simply tried to put the whole thing out of my head - not always easy! Recently I have had a family of my own - and of course recently they became infected.  At first the symptoms were the sore irritation of the bottom/vagina.  I knew what this meant but was afraid to act.   When I finally saw a live worm on my childs bottom it gave me the impetus to act. I showed my partner (I needed reinforcement that it wasnt just in my head) and went to the chemist for treatment - 2 doses, 2 weeks apart.  I cleaned like I have never cleaned before - and yet again they have recurred.  Again my partner saw one - so I know I'm not going mad. Since then I have read as much as possible about them and continue the battle.  I have also found one other person who has suffered in the same way for many years - I thought I was the only one! I have come to realise a number of things about this parasite: 1.  Many people have them - but are largely too embarrassed to tell you.  I believe incidence is even higher than current research suggests, though studies are few and I do not have evidence to support this. 2.  Many people do not have or do not recognise symptoms.  I have seen from experience that if worms are present from an early age the irritation becomes 'normal' and the brain fails to attend to it. 3.  Even if you eliminate infection from your household, you are likely to be re-infected by someone you know who has them.  Sods law! 4.  If you have kids, it is practically impossible to stop children from putting hands/toys in mouth or to ensure that they scrub before every hand to mouth contact.  Worms are therefore likely to recurr again and again. 5.  The eggs are very difficult to get rid of - they can be anywhere - in dust, clothes, furniture, door handles - in fact anywhere that is touched in your home... think about it!  Eggs can be killed easily - but getting them all is practically impossible. 6.  The only real way to combat them is through taking another dose (Pripsen tablets are easy and fairly effective) every time the symptoms occur - dont give up and dont get too embarrassed - keep going back to the chemist every time or even give your family a regular dose eg every 6 months.   7.  Throw away the guilt - you are not dirty or scum - just normal.  You are not alone - even if you think you are! Because of shame and embarrassement I have not even been able to give a real name or email address but I hope that these experiences can be of some help to others in the same situation.

I discovered I had these after seeing them in my faeces at about age 9.  (Although in reality they are rarely seen in your poo once it has hit the water!) Until seeing them I had not realised that the sore itchy bottom that I suffered from on occasion was due to worms!  After realising what you have the itch becomes excruciating - in your mind as much as your bottom! I was treated but the symptomatic itch returned a few months later.  The whole family was then treated but again the worms returned.   Over the next few years both myself and my family were treated on many occasions whilst my mother paid scrupulous attention to cleaning of clothes and linen and regularly damp dusted the entire house to try to eliminate them - she could not have tried harder!   Over the years I continued to be reinfected - I began to recognise the particular irritation and knew each time reinfection occurred - even when not seeing any live worms!  Eventually at the age of about 18 I gave up even trying to combat the worms - the embarrassement became too much. I even gave up telling my mother!   As a result I have experienced guilt about 'carrying' worms and what I can only describe as an ongoing emotional battle/termoil.  I know I have infected others - friends and family - I recognise the symptoms, but I feel there is little I can do without a public and widespread treatment. How do you tell everyone you know or anyone who has visited your home that they need treatment!?   Most of the time I have simply tried to put the whole thing out of my head - not always easy! Recently I have had a family of my own - and of course recently they became infected.  At first the symptoms were the sore irritation of the bottom/vagina.  I knew what this meant but was afraid to act.   When I finally saw a live worm on my childs bottom it gave me the impetus to act. I showed my partner (I needed reinforcement that it wasnt just in my head) and went to the chemist for treatment - 2 doses, 2 weeks apart.  I cleaned like I have never cleaned before - and yet again they have recurred.  Again my partner saw one - so I know I'm not going mad. Since then I have read as much as possible about them and continue the battle.  I have also found one other person who has suffered in the same way for many years - I thought I was the only one! I have come to realise a number of things about this parasite: 1.  Many people have them - but are largely too embarrassed to tell you.  I believe incidence is even higher than current research suggests, though studies are few and I do not have evidence to support this. 2.  Many people do not have or do not recognise symptoms.

You can get a stronger drug from your doctor (prescription only) called Albendazole - it's actually one of the ingredients in many animal worming tablets and Mebendazole is derived from it (so it works in a similar way - starving the little critters of glucose) - and the sad thing is your doctor probably hasn't even heard of it! - he keeps giving out the same old 100mg of Mebendazole (in the form of Ovex for example) which is simply just not   strong enough to kill all the live worms in a single dose.  I have been reading lots of academic journals on threadworms to try and get through to the truth about them and get past all the urban myths! and I can tell you now THERE ARE NO KNOWN INCIDENTS OF THREADWORMS BECOMING RESISTANT TO MEBENDAZOLE! It's just that in laboratory testing 100mg Mebendazole works... and in practical trials it SEEMED to work because the worms went.  Maybe over time with good hygiene the numbers of worms can be whittled down and eradicated... but the problem is they often migrate... Let me tell you my own experience... A couple of months ago I had a very bad infestation ...I had them up my nose, in my ears (I found them dead on the end of cotton buds), lungs (I coughed a live one up whilst running), and even experienced a very painful one in my eye at night (which laid eggs which I had to remove the next morning) - places really that I never knew they could go. I took Mebendazole instantly, and then again 14 days later, I blitzed my home as advised, washed bed sheets, damp dusted and cleaned everything on the first day of medication. All my symptoms went. Just over a week ago however, I felt I had them back again... slight itching around the anus and a wriggling sensation on and off at night. I bought a family pack of Ovex (4 x tablets of 100mg Mebendazole) I took one tablet, but on the 3rd night I was still getting wriggling sensations and the sticky substance around that area in the morning, eventually on the 4th night I got no more symptoms. On the 7th day I got a wriggling sensation right at the top of my nose, and my tummy didn't feel good either so I took another dose of Mebendazole, later that afternoon I sneezed out an adult dead female worm! (recognizable  as longer than the males). Mebendazole is supposed to act all over the body yet this was an adult worm - if the Mebendazole had worked properly 7 days ago surely this would have come out long ago. Threadworms are very delicate and decompose very quickly, this worm had not decomposed and was very much still in tact; implying it had died recently - most likely within hours. This confirmed to me that the single dose of Mebendazole I'd had 7 nights before just hadn't been strong enough to kill this one. I then read somewhere on this forum that one guy suggested taking 2x Mebendazole tablets every day for 3 days - and even suggested taking dog worming tablets as they were alot stronger. I now go along with this advice! I'm on my second day of taking 2x daily Mebendazole tablets (so have just taken my 4th ) and I have found I am getting streams of dead worms coming out; some I'm 'hocking up' from the lungs (Just FYI worms in the lungs is a very common but often unnoticed symptom after egg inhalation - the worms after hatching, climb to the top of the lungs and enter the throat to restart the cycle), others are coming out from my nose with mucus and yet since that 3rd day I've had no symptoms of worms 'down below'. In fact without taking the medication and seeing these dead worms, I'd have no idea I had them at all! Many of the websites say that people can have them without symptoms - How many people must have them who don't know they have them I dread to think!   I read an article published in a journal called GUT by a G.C.Cook, it was published in 1994 so might be considered old now... but it still contains some invaluable information.   This should interest and hopefully calm the people frantically going round cleaning everywhere thinking they are reinfecting themselves...           He says that the eggs prefer a moist and cool (body temperature) environment; if the environment is warm and dry, most of the eggs will become infertile in 1-2 days: \""In warm dry conditions infectivity declines after 1-2 days\"" (p1159). He also states \""Household detergents exert little impact on the viability of eggs; cleaning a bathroom using a damp cloth moistened with an anti-bacterial agent or bleach merely spreads viable eggs. Simple laundering of clothes and linen disinfects them; shaking disseminates infective eggs\"" (p1161) - So using cleaning fluids won't penetrate the eggs but will just move them around but the good news is that just the movement of the washing machine will deactivate the eggs in your laundry.    If vibrations alone can 'disseminate infective eggs' then that dispels the idea that fruit could have infective eggs on it (as suggested might be the case somewhere on this forum) ..to be quite honest the idea that we could catch worms from any other human exchange is a very scary thought! - we would have to wash our post, our cash, credit cards, and tins and packets on the shelves at your local supermarket constantly... and it's just not true we can catch worms easily that way.   In my opinion you should just do a thorough clean on the first day of medication (or as soon as you realize you have an infestation) and then let things settle - don't clean anything more until after two weeks. Leave the eggs to become infertile over time (the max amount of which is 2 weeks as we keep being told by the websites - but according to this article - 2 days is more probable).   So long as you are following the advice of wearing the tight underwear at night, washing 'down there' in the morning and washing your hands and and nails (especially if you're scratching) thoroughly afterwards and before meals, then there is an extremely low chance of reinfection. The only danger left then is 'autoinfection' within the body. The advice on most packets of Mebendazole state to take first a tablet, then another, 14 days later... but I'm not convinced... Cook states that if the environment is right, the eggs will hatch and become worms within 6 hours. This is particularly pertinent for those eggs within the body as they will be in the most ideal environment. I also read on the NHS site:     that \""After two weeks, the worms reach adult size and begin to reproduce, starting the cycle again.\"" - so remind me again? ....why are we waiting 14 days before taking the next tablet??        If reinfection is as unlikely as it seems, then the horrible reality is that the medicine G.Ps are giving out are realistically not effective enough to get rid of all the worms in a single dose. The answer is to either take a stronger medicine (like Albendazole) with the doctor's consent, or take matters into your own hands with more frequent-than-recommended doses of Mebendazole (or take Animal worming tablets - not investigated this yet! ...but might make myself a human guinea pig soon!) Think about it - if Mebendazole is ok for children of the age of 2, it makes sense that adults with much stronger digestive constitutions (and bigger and longer large intestines) should need something stronger. It would seem to me that recurring incidents of worms are to do with autoinfection within the body rather than reinfection from outside the body. The Mebendazole in its present recommended dosage is just not strong enough to do the job. Mebendazole may be safe - but in my opinion it's too safe for the worms aswell... 3 likes, 34 replies "

So long as you are following the advice of wearing the tight underwear at night, washing 'down there' in the morning and washing your hands and and nails (especially if you're scratching) thoroughly afterwards and before meals, then there is an extremely low chance of reinfection. The only danger left then is 'autoinfection' within the body. The advice on most packets of Mebendazole state to take first a tablet, then another, 14 days later... but I'm not convinced... Cook states that if the environment is right, the eggs will hatch and become worms within 6 hours. This is particularly pertinent for those eggs within the body as they will be in the most ideal environment. I also read on the NHS site:     that \""After two weeks, the worms reach adult size and begin to reproduce, starting the cycle again.\"" - so remind me again? ....why are we waiting 14 days before taking the next tablet??        If reinfection is as unlikely as it seems, then the horrible reality is that the medicine G.Ps are giving out are realistically not effective enough to get rid of all the worms in a single dose. The answer is to either take a stronger medicine (like Albendazole) with the doctor's consent, or take matters into your own hands with more frequent-than-recommended doses of Mebendazole (or take Animal worming tablets - not investigated this yet! ...but might make myself a human guinea pig soon!) Think about it - if Mebendazole is ok for children of the age of 2, it makes sense that adults with much stronger digestive constitutions (and bigger and longer large intestines) should need something stronger. It would seem to me that recurring incidents of worms are to do with autoinfection within the body rather than reinfection from outside the body. The Mebendazole in its present recommended dosage is just not strong enough to do the job. Mebendazole may be safe - but in my opinion it's too safe for the worms aswell... 3 likes, 34 replies "

A couple of months ago I had a very bad infestation ...I had them up my nose, in my ears (I found them dead on the end of cotton buds), lungs (I coughed a live one up whilst running), and even experienced a very painful one in my eye at night (which laid eggs which I had to remove the next morning) - places really that I never knew they could go. I took Mebendazole instantly, and then again 14 days later, I blitzed my home as advised, washed bed sheets, damp dusted and cleaned everything on the first day of medication. All my symptoms went. Just over a week ago however, I felt I had them back again... slight itching around the anus and a wriggling sensation on and off at night. I bought a family pack of Ovex (4 x tablets of 100mg Mebendazole) I took one tablet, but on the 3rd night I was still getting wriggling sensations and the sticky substance around that area in the morning, eventually on the 4th night I got no more symptoms. On the 7th day I got a wriggling sensation right at the top of my nose, and my tummy didn't feel good either so I took another dose of Mebendazole, later that afternoon I sneezed out an adult dead female worm! (recognizable  as longer than the males). Mebendazole is supposed to act all over the body yet this was an adult worm - if the Mebendazole had worked properly 7 days ago surely this would have come out long ago. Threadworms are very delicate and decompose very quickly, this worm had not decomposed and was very much still in tact; implying it had died recently - most likely within hours. This confirmed to me that the single dose of Mebendazole I'd had 7 nights before just hadn't been strong enough to kill this one. I then read somewhere on this forum that one guy suggested taking 2x Mebendazole tablets every day for 3 days - and even suggested taking dog worming tablets as they were alot stronger. I now go along with this advice! I'm on my second day of taking 2x daily Mebendazole tablets (so have just taken my 4th ) and I have found I am getting streams of dead worms coming out; some I'm 'hocking up' from the lungs (Just FYI worms in the lungs is a very common but often unnoticed symptom after egg inhalation - the worms after hatching, climb to the top of the lungs and enter the throat to restart the cycle), others are coming out from my nose with mucus and yet since that 3rd day I've had no symptoms of worms 'down below'. In fact without taking the medication and seeing these dead worms, I'd have no idea I had them at all! Many of the websites say that people can have them without symptoms - How many people must have them who don't know they have them I dread to think!   I read an article published in a journal called GUT by a G.C.Cook, it was published in 1994 so might be considered old now... but it still contains some invaluable information.   This should interest and hopefully calm the people frantically going round cleaning everywhere thinking they are reinfecting themselves...           He says that the eggs prefer a moist and cool (body temperature) environment; if the environment is warm and dry, most of the eggs will become infertile in 1-2 days: \""In warm dry conditions infectivity declines after 1-2 days\"" (p1159). He also states \""Household detergents exert little impact on the viability of eggs; cleaning a bathroom using a damp cloth moistened with an anti-bacterial agent or bleach merely spreads viable eggs. Simple laundering of clothes and linen disinfects them; shaking disseminates infective eggs\"" (p1161) - So using cleaning fluids won't penetrate the eggs but will just move them around but the good news is that just the movement of the washing machine will deactivate the eggs in your laundry.    If vibrations alone can 'disseminate infective eggs' then that dispels the idea that fruit could have infective eggs on it (as suggested might be the case somewhere on this forum) ..to be quite honest the idea that we could catch worms from any other human exchange is a very scary thought! - we would have to wash our post, our cash, credit cards, and tins and packets on the shelves at your local supermarket constantly... and it's just not true we can catch worms easily that way.

It has caused me intermittent, unexplained diarrhoea attacks and obviously itchiness. I had put the latter down to thrush as I obviously had them in my vagina. I also had unbearable itching at the top of my bottom (near the small of my back). This has been so distressing, and the information I have found on the internet has been frustratingly simplistic and unhelpful, occasionally alarmist and contradictory.

Here is my experience, which I hope adds information that is genuinely helpful and also new to the war against threadworms. I did all the right things - Ovex, cleaning, children trained not to scratch, scrub nails and wash bottoms in the morning. It would clear up in the children then come back and I treated them a few times over a couple of months. I would say that now they are free of infestation. BUT, despite spending the best part of £100 on Ovex (Ha! That's why the drug companies don't find a permanent solution!!), I personally just could not shift them. I was absolutely scrupulous in NEVER touching my bare bum, keeping up the cleaning regime, etc. The Ovex just DID NOT WORK. I still found worms in the days following treatment and there was no let up. I took Ovex daily for 5 days, with no effect. I also could not understand why I felt itchy and saw small worms on my anus during the day. I was showering 4 to 5 times a day and it was really distressing. My research told me that the female worms come out at night to lay eggs, only after they have reached maturity, at which point they are upwards of 1cm in size.

My childrens' bottoms are positively smooth and flat compared to mine which is ravaged by childbirth and the odd haemorrhoid. This would explain why I have been itching and seeing worms in the daytime. The eggs that have been laid at night are hatching during the daytime, then crawling back up into my intestine.

What can I do?,"Hi, I don't know whether I should be posting this here.  I have no idea if I could have possibly strained my spleen, or ruptured it.  Was diagnosed with Mono/Glandular fever in October. Of course, my spleen was enlarged and tender. I could even feel pain in that area when I was walking.  Last week, I did some heavy lifting at work. (Lifting paper waste bags and dragging them).  The next day, my stools were black. (Sorry, TMI). I went to a doctor, who didn't seem to be bothered what I was telling him. He did give me a check over. He ended up prescribing me more anti-sickess tablets and gastro-resistant medication. I asked if the medication could be causing black stools, and he said no. I looked on the ingrediants, and there is no bismth in it. I also haven't been eating black foods, or taking supplements. At that time, I didn't have much pain there, more like a twinge in the upper left abdomen.  Last night, I felt a painful twinge in the same area. The pain was there when I breathed in, and even bent down. But, I brushed it off. My stools have now gone back to normal, but I feel pain there as I'm writing this. I feel pressure in my lower abdomen, and it's tender when I press down on the area just under my left breast. The pain is also radiating to my upper back. Sometimes going to the left side of my back.  Should I go to the A&E/ER department? I don't want to waste their time.    0 likes, 3 replies "

I also do sinus irrigations with compounding medications 4  times a day. My current ENT is at a loss for words. She has referred me to another doctor who might be able to better assist me.

If so, how soon can the procedure be performed after the first one? This is really affecting my life. I am a teacher and need to be the best for my students.

My Neuro thinks I could have a narrowing of the spinal column (and I get lower back and leg pain that jumps around )or it could be my Sjogren's or something else. All I know is when I stand or walk from anywhere between instantaniously to 30 minutes my legs want to cave and the numbness is profound! I do have some neuropathy and unexplained electric like shock sensations a lot. It's actually scary and causes me to panic at times though I am getting better dealing with it. On rare occasions I get some numbness while lying or sitting but it is rare. I just started 25mg of Lyrica and am due to double it in a few days. It isn't helping at all so at times I take my hydro also. I just don't know what I should do in the meantime??? Honestly, I can't do much and it is so frustrating! ANy suggestions what could be causing this (started last Jan and progressively worse) and what I should do? I feel terrible laying in bed or a chair most of the days. Thanks so much! p.s.

Also, my nose started to get very dry around May and, until now, it has never been not-dry; it hurts, it doesn't let me sleep, I usually get wounds which take their time to close and the worst part is that if I don't swallow saliva usually, the part of the nasal tract that connects to the pharynx get really really dry and eating becomes hard. I don't seem to have any problems with saliva production though. The only thing remarkable about my mouth is that I have always had dry lips, I don't remember a time in my life when I didn't have them. Some extra stuff that I don't know if they are important are that I got a very bad flu in March, and after I recover the same month, I started to notice this symptoms. Since then I haven't been sick, which is weird because in my country we're already in spring, I mean, I survived fall and winter with a dry nose, and that's really weird on me . Also, in August I noticed a small lump on my jaw, below the right ear but it disappeared after 1 week. In September my eyes seemed to get better, so I stopped using my artificial tears but the last few days they got dry again and today I noticed another lump in the same area but on the left side of my face.

Also, my nose started to get very dry around May and, until now, it has never been not-dry; it hurts, it doesn't let me sleep, I usually get wounds which take their time to close and the worst part is that if I don't swallow saliva usually, the part of the nasal tract that connects to the pharynx get really really dry and eating becomes hard. I don't seem to have any problems with saliva production though. The only thing remarkable about my mouth is that I have always had dry lips, I don't remember a time in my life when I didn't have them. Some extra stuff that I don't know if they are important are that I got a very bad flu in March, and after I recover the same month, I started to notice this symptoms. Since then I haven't been sick, which is weird because in my country we're already in spring, I mean, I survived fall and winter with a dry nose, and that's really weird on me . Also, in August I noticed a small lump on my jaw, below the right ear but it disappeared after 1 week. In September my eyes seemed to get better, so I stopped using my artificial tears but the last few days they got dry again and today I noticed another lump in the same area but on the left side of my face.

Burning nasal passages etc. Also noticed my skin is getting a bit flakey near my eyebrow. I had a question about Pilocarpine- Salagen. Im taking 5mg x 4 per day. On my 3rd week. Cant say i have felt anything yet. But has anyone experienced fatigue on this stuff? I did not have this kind of fatigue thats for sure before i started taking this stuff. I think it is listed as a side effect. If you had fatigue, did it ever pass? So is it something you get used to? Oh boy if im this tired on this stuff then I don't know. My leg muscles and arm muscles also very tired. Hard to say if thats from the pilocarpine or then just unconditioning, fibromyalgia stuff. Love to hear your experiences. Thank you!

So had the SS A&B tests and the results were very low. So basically negative. Lip biopsy the same. Im a 44 yr old male. Right now having very bad dry mouth. At times the dry mouth pain is just unbareable. Feels like nerve pain and causes a bad headache. Im also having burning feelings now and again, also very painful in the tips of my nasal passages. I never had any form of paratoid swelling or pain. Had a long bout of stress. Then became more stressed when this happend. Has anyone experience or heard that stress could bring something like this on? Like that it can relate to psychological issues? Can a person not get this diagnosis ( not that i want it) but still feel all this pain and symptoms? I would have thought something would have come back on my results. Very clearly though i can feel i have much less saliva. Hurts when i speak. Top of my palette gets sore and also my tongue. I have been on salagen now for over 2 weeks. No help from that yet. Guess that can take a while to kick in. Side effects of that have made me very tired. Just have had some weird side effects. Feeling hot and flushed and weakness. Im hoping these are side effects your body gets used to. Anyhow ill stop here but look forward to comments. Thank you all and nice weekend. 0 likes, 8 replies "

But as i have fibro, which does not bug me too much i know all too well about flares. So they come and go. Now with dry mouth. Is this something that also comes and goes so is it a bit like a flare symptom? Or is it something that generally once it comes, stays?

Help!,"I found out I had sjogrens last summer. One night, about two years ago a partner asked if I'd brushed my teeth. I told him, ""Yes. Does my breath stink or something?"" I had never had problems before and was surprised. It was one of many indicators (aside from swollen feet, feeling like needles were poking in my eyes and a tiredness, among other things). It was hell.  It still is.  Overnight, I went from having a fairly normal life to feeling like my face is plastic, drinking an ocean of water I can't feel on my tongue, dry nostrils, swollen feet, swollen eyes LOOKING older than I am. which had been a symptom my entire life, and the cherry on top? Bad breath, causing embarrassing moments at work, depression, and bouts of tears and social avoidances.  Ive tried every over-the-counter product you can name. All of the Biotene products, sugar free gum, Chlorophyll pills, Odorol pills, tea, alcohol-free mouthwash,  , I can go on forever.  Nothing is working.  Live gotten to the point where I even take a toothbrush and mouthwash to work. Doesn't work.  Im at my wit's end and find myself explaining sjogrens (which people just look at me like I'm crazy and are not receptive enough to research this illness to have empathy). I'm have SO many embarrassing moments, since that night and I have no idea what to do about it. It's disrupting my life as a teacher. i avoid meeting s with faculty and other social events.  I have an interview coming up on the 22nd and I'm tempted to cancel it; because, I don't want my breath to turn people off.  This is is SO new for me. I call it a social experiment. Some people still treat me the same. Others avoid me, even grip their noses when they see me.  I would like ANY advice you have for this.  Ive seen a podiatrist, dentist, ENT, gastroenterologist, you name it and I'm at my wit's end.  I would appreciate your advice.  Thank you- 0 likes, 97 replies "

My doctor seems to be a good man but he doesn't listen to a whole lot of details that I give him so I thought I would ask people who have been there and done that so to speak. I thought maybe asking a few questions would be helpful for me to communicate, if there's a better way please let me know. Around the beginning of November (2019) began having a few bouts of fatigue. To best describe, it's that kind of feeling you have if your blood sugar is low, where you feel weird in your arms and legs and feel weak and shaky light-headed etc. It would come in spurts and then just go away. I made an appointment with my doctor, did blood work, everything seemed to be fine with results, with the exception of low vitamin D and creatinine levels that were a little high but he was not concerned about it so he would check that in 6 months. At the time it was usually accompanied with a stomacache and so he gave me a prescription acid reducers. Well, over the Thanksgiving holiday I had a small blister on my back about the size of fifty cent piece, right at that same time I noticed the front of my body was sore like I pulled a muscle, my wife at had shingles so she thought maybe it look like that but seem to not be concerned. The next day I had a small rash of little blisters on my front. The Monday after Thanksgiving I went to my doctor and he said that shingles and gave me 10 day supply of the antiviral to take. Please excuse the long history there but I wanted to be thorough so if anyone were gracious enough to answer my questions they would have information! Not ever having shingles before and comparing it to my wife's outbreak I considered my case a very mild one, never got any more blisters and had some pain but not over the top. So my questions are as follows: 1. Could my feelings of fatigue be traced to the shingles even though it took a couple weeks for rash to appear? 2. Is it still possible to have feelings of this fatigue come on me from time to time even though it's been a little over a month since outbreak? 3. The area on my back where I had shingles had nerve pain, and then while working I pulled a muscle in that same area, could that be related or just a coincidence? I had one of these episodes of fatigue this morning after I worked a couple hours outside physically, but they have seemed to have lessened since I originally went to my doctor about it. Thank you for anyone willing to share your thoughts I really do appreciate it! Dan 0 likes, 13 replies "

About 6 hours ago, I noticed a sharp, stabbing pain in my left knee area. I didn't think anything of it, until I noticed that there is pain if something gently touches the skin. It is hard to describe but the pain is more surface level, but does shoot inward. I would say it is from my upper calf, through the knee, to about 2 inches above the knee. As I started to research Dr. Google, I came across the term Allodynia, which describes it to a T. Then, I looked at the dermatomes and it is practically identical to the L4 location. I am a 49 year old female. No rash other than one small bump on the front of my kneecap. Of course, with the COVID-19 situation, I don't want to race to the doctor, but would love to start the anti-virals if necessary. Does this sound like Shingles? If so, when would the rash appear?

The sore has healed but there is a hard lump where the blister was and it still really hurts! I'm not sure what to do.

I spent 4K on allergy programme for dust that didnt work, though I dont sneeze as much each day but if im near dust its bad! have special covers for my bed etc. I now  believe I also have non allergic rhinitis because even with daily antihistamines, my nose runs CONTINUELY all day, all night Im always clearing my throat.

I let her know I have been experiencing a slight off balance feeling throughout the summer. Almost like I was on a boat. Just a very very slight feeling of that when I was standing still. Not so much when I am moving, unless I really get my head moving around. Not dizzy or spinning, just a slight feeling the floor is moving ever so slightly. This has been pretty consistent since around early June. I have also had this off and on over I would estimate the past five years or so. She said I have some fluid built up in my right ear. Also, my right nostril is semi-clogged with a white/yellow mucus each morning when I wake up. As such she has me doing a nasal irrigation (Neil Med) every morning before my shower and has me taking Nasacort in the morning as well. I feel slightly better than a week a go, however still a little off balance throughout the day. Is it possible for sinusitis/allergies to do this to you? Also, how long should I give these meds to work, before I request something a little stronger? What treatments/medicines do you suggest? Thank You! Josh 0 likes, 4 replies "

I also generally feel 'foggy' headed all the time, my ears feel like they are blocked a lot too. I feel my sense of smell isn't as good as it used to either. I've been having these problems for 3-4 years now, I'm 24. When I first went to the doctor I was given Antibiotics, after several re-visits I was given nose drops, sprays and even a course of Amitriptyline. To no avail I was eventually sent to the ENT specialist, who checked with a camera, thought he seen something that made him think there was an infection, prescribed me more antibiotics.  Of course I was back complaining of the same problems as soon as my course was finished. CT Scan was next, results were completely normal, ENT specialist then told me I'd need to go and see a Neurologist next, this is so frustrating, can anyone relate??  I have found various posts on the internet describing the very same issues and it seems there are a lot of people without a diagnosis!  0 likes, 43 replies "

At the top of my nose near both eyes I've had this random pressure feeling. Barely any pain but every now and then a slight pulse of tiny pain in my sinuses, sometimes left eye or right or above eye etc but only a hand full of times a day. What happens is the first two hours after I wake up symptoms are best and feel great but as day progresses pressure happens on the bridge of my nose and gets worse until I sleep. I have had doctor prescribe antihistamines which don't work, tried ibuprofen which also doesn't work. This is so weird it only annoyes me but doesn't really hurt at all. Pressure just seems to go away after I sleep but return about 2 hrs after I wake up. No other symptoms and am healthy in every other way only thing stopping me going to doc again is the fact it doesn't hurt and no congestion no headache no nothing other than pressure there. What could this be? I noticed that when I wear glasses the bridge of my nose feels this same pressure but would go away from constant use of glasses and went away as soon as taken off but now it's just there about 70 percent of the day. Intensity alternates throughout day but majority of time it's worse just before I sleep. Wtf is this I would go to doc but feels like this is just something that will go away. Everytime I go wow this is annoying and bad I think ok time to see doc but then maybe 15Min later dies down a bit and I'm like hmm maybe it will go away been like this a few weeks any ideas? 0 likes, 20 replies "

At the top of my nose near both eyes I've had this random pressure feeling. Barely any pain but every now and then a slight pulse of tiny pain in my sinuses, sometimes left eye or right or above eye etc but only a hand full of times a day. What happens is the first two hours after I wake up symptoms are best and feel great but as day progresses pressure happens on the bridge of my nose and gets worse until I sleep. I have had doctor prescribe antihistamines which don't work, tried ibuprofen which also doesn't work. This is so weird it only annoyes me but doesn't really hurt at all. Pressure just seems to go away after I sleep but return about 2 hrs after I wake up. No other symptoms and am healthy in every other way only thing stopping me going to doc again is the fact it doesn't hurt and no congestion no headache no nothing other than pressure there.

Some nights I have to sleep with a bandage covering my right nasal passage or the pain during the night will wake me up. I mostly take Noproxen for the pain but have stronger Vicodin that I use for a bulging disc in my back but try not to use that much. I have tried all the home remedies and lots of different types of medicines recommended by my pharmacist but it always comes back after a day or so. I might go two days pain free and then suffer for 5 straight days. Lately I have been trying cutting out different things from my normal food diet, first was Chocolate as I read that can cause problems and at first it seemed to help for a few days but then the pain and pressure came back even with no chocolate in my diet.

Please read through.  Thank you so much So I got flu-like symptoms in January.  Cough.  Fever.  Diarrhea.  All of the above. As I was getting over it, I developed slight vertigo. For the next three weeks, the vertigo would come and go.  Some days hardly noticeable (although I was starting to get tired quickly...odd). In February however, I eventually developed ear pressure! Like crackling and air feeling trapped.  Also, I started to get facial tension.  Sunburnt feeling on cheek. A week passes by and that’s when my vertigo came back stronger! Especially out of my right eye.  I felt drunk, swaying from a boat. It caused me to feel lightheaded.  I go to urgent care.  Doctor says it’s a migraine...no way does it feel like a migraine. A few days pass. The vertigo is starting to diminish! Hooray...except not. The vertigo has now turned into heavy heavy head pressure.  Like swollen feeling.  Like an orange being squeezed or a balloon filled with air.  Not sharp pains, but pain when being squeezed.  This also got me lightheaded. I go to see my PCP.  He thinks it’s a middle/inner ear infection. I get prescribed nasal spray, 500 mg Amoxicillin, antihistamines, Meclizine (left me paranoid), ear drops and Ibropufen. Use it for a week or so.  Doesn’t work. Instead, I get more symptoms. Burning burning feet.  Trigger finger.  Cold hands in the morning especially my right hand.  Gimpy legs.  Burning sensations in chest and back! There seems to be some nerve/neuropathy taking place here but why? I then take a comprehensive blood panel.  Everything turns out normal.  I’m stumped. Eventually, the neuropathy gets worse.  I’m feeling aches and pains, burning sensations everywhere.  My chest has dull aches on my right chest.  My heart is loud! Random palpitations.  Increase of blood pressure at various times. It feels like my blood doesn’t know where or when to flow.  I’m malfunctioning. Lastly, I developed digestive issues.  Like I can barely eat now without feeling full, including water.  My body is bloated and it takes forever to digest my food.  That’s the last symptom I developed. Altogether 2 and a half months of crap, just from getting flu-like symptoms in January. Now, I am scheduled for a CT scan of my head in two weeks.  Doctor just wants to do his due diligence. That being said, I spoke to another trusted doctor, and he mentions that this could be a bad case of Sinusitis sprinkled in with anxiety and stress levels causing neurological symptoms.  He said that Amoxicillin on its own is not good enough at times.  It needs to be stronger.  Also a few days course of Prednisone for any inflammation. On top of that my stress and anxiety, has created a whirlpool of damage to my body.  But controlling the head pressure and ear pressure is the first step for all the other nerves.

It feels like my blood doesn’t know where or when to flow.  I’m malfunctioning. Lastly, I developed digestive issues.  Like I can barely eat now without feeling full, including water.  My body is bloated and it takes forever to digest my food.  That’s the last symptom I developed. Altogether 2 and a half months of crap, just from getting flu-like symptoms in January. Now, I am scheduled for a CT scan of my head in two weeks.  Doctor just wants to do his due diligence. That being said, I spoke to another trusted doctor, and he mentions that this could be a bad case of Sinusitis sprinkled in with anxiety and stress levels causing neurological symptoms.  He said that Amoxicillin on its own is not good enough at times.  It needs to be stronger.  Also a few days course of Prednisone for any inflammation. On top of that my stress and anxiety, has created a whirlpool of damage to my body.  But controlling the head pressure and ear pressure is the first step for all the other nerves. What do you guys think? I was healthy leading up to the new year, going to the gym 4 times a week.  Now I’m ill. 5’7 29 years old Male 173 lbs Any advice would be amazing! 0 likes, 2 replies "

I've been sick for going on 4 months now. I've recently found out I need sinus surgery. I have gone through every syptoms and emotion possible. What my question is, is recently I've had panic attacks. Going on about two weeks now. Feel very  irritable, angry and tired. Sometimes (and I'm guessing from the panic attacks) I will feel like I'm in a dream state and my eye sight seems extremely clear. I'm wondering if anyone else has  experienced  these syptoms with a chronic sinus infection! I'm hoping it goes away with surgery. Fingers crossed  Thanks Sara.  0 likes, 16 replies "

I simply smoke half a cigarette (or less) at a time and after about 4/6 weeks, you will find it easy to stop.  Its similar because you are ingesting a smaller dose of nicotine to combat withdrawal symptoms.  There is a reason why cigarettes are as long as they are - reason being to keep you hooked.  If you don't live in England, you can get prescriptions free in the rest of the UK so you will find it even cheaper, compared to smoking part cigarettes, to get a prescription to help you stop smoking. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I am female, 5ft 3 and 30year's old. I've been a smoker for a long time. Full time smoker since I was 14, I've been smoking for the entirety of my adult life. I am now 30.  I smoke 20 a day. I quit 3 years ago using a vape but only lasted 4 months! I've quit again, using patches. It's been 3 days. I have been having chest pain on and off for over a year but since January has been constant. Have been to the gp multiple times and hospital and had acute chest pain investigations several times (blood test/ecg/chest X ray). The pain was in the centre of my chest on the left side, every day until the beginning of this week, it had moved to my back and side, mid back on the left side. No change on breathing in or out. I went back to the gp, a different one to who I usually see - not by request, just the way it worked out. She listened to my chest and I had an expiratory wheeze on the left side. I did peak flow and scored 350 which is bellow what it's should be for me. I have to go back for spirometry. This worries me as no doctors have considered my chest pain to be respiratory before. She had given me a blue ventolin inhaler to see if this helps. My oxygen level on the finger probe was okay. 98%. I am also worried because until this point I did not notice that I was particularly short of breath but I am now! I have noticed that I am unable to take a very deep breath and constantly want to. I don't know how long it has been this way but maybe a while, I've not really thought about it. I am wondering if I have done some serious damage having been smoking for so long? I don't want to do anymore googling... I've pretty much convinced myself I have lung cancer now. I too never considered I may have a lung problem. I do not have a cough. At all, I have been more aware of this since my appointment on Thursday and I have coughed once. I do not have any chest tightness. Though it has only been 3 days not smoking my chest pain is much improved, still there but intemitently not constant. So now I'm pretty sure the fags are source of my problem, are my lungs going to recover from this? I have also notice mucous, feels stuck behind my nose/upper throat. struggling to loosen it and am constantly throat clearing. I don't have a sore throat but did have a single tonsil stone yesterday... gross I know. I sound a bit like I have a sore throat but I dont. Don't know whether these things are just from not smoking. Wondering if anyone else has had these symptoms and what can do to improve things. Any advice or insight would be greatly accepted. Many thanks and sorry for the long post. Mel 0 likes, 3 replies "

The smoke comes in round the clock, with breaks if I keep all windows open. Otherwise the smell can linger till they light a new cig. It has now been over a week. The odour is not strong enough to 'hit you in the face' but envelops you 'gently' (if I can say so) and won't go till a wind ow is open (which sometimes seems to only make it worse. My baby is crankier than usual when the smoke comes, she also makes a strange sound when drawing in her breath (not all the time but when awake and quite often). She also seems to try to blow her nose when she wakes up. And she seems to have been constipated for the last 3 days, though wind coming, and she is entirely breastfed. Myself, before her birth, I had to deal with a bit of a stress which I believe made my child be born 37 weeks officially and 35 weeks since I can tell for sure. After her birth I had to endure 2 courses of   while breastfeeding since they could not treat UTI in one go due to a very strange choice of antibiotics the 1st time around, and not caring enough to prevent it in the very first place. Then I was found to be anaemic. They diagnosed thrash recently and found some blood inurine dample. And since I smoked for a year 9 years ago due to stress and strong psychological dependence, I hated every later draw at every cig and that year a huge impact on my overall health, so when 'neighbours are smoking' comes from me, it is not a grumble but a real concern since I know what it costs me. I used to be able to put up with occasional puff from soeone in the street but now it has been over 4 years since exposure to smoke turned to be a torture.  The symptoms I developed over the past 4 days are: - severe   (first above eyes, now above neck on the left side, occasionally temples) - vomiting (luckily stopped) / off food (1 day) - back pain (lower, then between shoulder blades) - high temperature over 38 C (1 day) - palpitation (i had only occasional thuds like this when pregnant; now it is really worrying) They could not locate infection. I have been on pain killers for over 3 days now, went for a short walk today, feeling slightly better. I also had a few nervous tick flitches in my left eye (on top of everything) and am really grateful you went through this with me now.

I felt so ill, i stop vaping and started an healthy diet, walked everyday and lost excess weight. I've replaced vaping with filtered cigarettes holder and was getting much better... somehow,  strong again 😃. I don't take any medication, not even a pain killer. Everything was going back the ways it was and the only thing left for me is to stop smoking completely. February 2019. I lost my dad... I was devastated and still grieving today. For some reason, since the funeral, I cannot smoke cigarettes. It's like the trauma of losing my dad created a psychological rejection of cigarettes. I couldn't stand the smell and taste anymore. But... I was still craving for nicotine and decided to buy the latest vaping kit , 80%VG e-liquid and 3mg nicotine. Now I'm on 1.5mg and trying to vape as less as possible. I've realised since I'am vaping again, the sickness is back and contributes to a weaker immune system. Also, since I've stopped cigarettes, I feel awful, depressed, anxious and can't breathe very well. Short of Breath Anxiety Panic Strange heart beats High Blood pressure Silent Reflux Going toilet too often Teeth problems Gum disease Depression Feeling weird and out of place Lack of concentration Memory problem Never had these symptoms for 40 years on 40 cigs per day.... Yes! I 've done all tests and Doctors assume it's anxiety or in my head! Is Vaping more dangerous than cigarettes? I wonder... 😕 Why did I started vaping in the first place . Maybe I should of carried on smoking my cigarettes.... More research need to be done with doctors regarding vaping. People who vape should be monitored on regular basis. Please ignore my english, I wasn't bothered correcting the grammar 😉 0 likes, 2 replies "

I had a very rare thing happen.  A month ago my spleen ruptured with no known trauma or infectious disease; I went to bed with tremendous pain in my left shoulder and upper abdomen, and thought it was gall bladder.  I passed out during the night, became delirious and was found by a friend in the morning who called 911.  Turned out I had internal bleeding from a ruptured spleen, spent days in the ICU and had a procedure to stop the bleeding and blood transfusions.  Anyone know of a situation like this?  I'm seriously uncomfortable with the thought that this can happen for no know reason 0 likes, 2 replies "

(Spleen larger side of normal),"24F. 5”3. 122lbs. I had a scan 3 weeks ago, spleen size was 9.3cm on ultrasound. All ok. Had one at public hospital by doctor referral on thursday and they said it is slightly enlarged or ‘larger end of normal’ and a bit ‘bulky’ but wouldnt say the size. I had a private scan yesterday and it was 9.7cm. Does this mean its grown? Or does it just vary? Is it because I’ve been complaining about back pain? My appetite has been so up and down, as well as my weight, back pain and early satiety. I’ve been so anxious. I know I have a problem but I am going to therapy for this soon. I am just concerned that I have been told my spleen is enlarged and have been referred to a haematologist. My doctor felt my lymphs and my  , liver, thyroid, FBC and pancreas markers were normal. I also wanted to know.. My back where it hurts is harder/a bit more swollen than the right side. Could this be a lymph node or my organs being pushed by my enlarged spleen on my back? Or just muscular. Could my appetite and weight loss be sinister? I have gone from around 9 stone to 8 stone 7lbs in a month. I am so scared of lymphoma or   now. I just want to live a normal life and now this has thrown me and scared me. Maybe my doctor referred me because I’ve been so anxious and they want to be sure and cover themselves too? I dont know how this works. Please share your advice. Again, I know this is frustrating and I have  . I’m seeking help for it but I am just so worried for my health. I was getting better until this came up. My original worry was   like PC due to yellow stools, weight loss and back pain and  . My stools arent yellow now, but have had a lot of soft stools, a bit diarrhoealike but thick. My weights stayed around 8 st 8 for 2 weeks, fluctuating up and down. My ribs also pop on the left side when I’m laying in a certain position. Also could my partner massaging my back have cause it to swell? 0 likes, 0 replies "

I have done some research on the internet and found a link with episcleritis and Sweets Syndrome ( a bit like elephant man syndrome) a virus i contracted in York which put me in hospital for a week unale to walk and the on steroids for 6 months.  I was told at the time that this virus might stay in my body for life and I am wondering if anyone else has had Sweets Syndrome?? and was very interested in the comments by someone saying its a result of a damaged immune system. Any suggestions remedies research gratefully received. 0 likes, 5 replies "

Any way i have been under the hospital for 4 years always back and fourth. I have various types of treatments (Steroids oral and aziathropine and more) The only thing that kind of helped patch it over, was a steroid injection in the cheek and eye lid. In a result over the course of time, i had over 10 injections and put on 4 stone from being on steroids. I then had to have an operation to remove the fat which had stored from these injections. I have reoccuring attacks which can ladt weeks at a time My eye is never white, I have also lost most of my sight in my right eye. I have never had problems with my left eye, up untill Dec 2008. What makes it soo much harder is its now in both eye's and when its up it's so painfull, I am really struggling i can't leave the house and my job is getting harder and harder to maintain now. I feel their is not enough awarness for patient's any type of scleritis. I know when some makes a comment on my eye's or ask what it is. When you tell them they have no idea. 0 likes, 8 replies "

There was no obvious event that triggered the onset of the pain. Over the course of the two month period, I have tried avoiding sitting too much, I have kept active with lots of walking, I have stretched and strengthened the piriformis, hips, thighs, hamstrings and pelvis. I have good days and sometimes up to four good days with minimal pain but then I can have a bad day where I can barely walk and getting in and out bed gives me a sharp, almost dirty, pinching pain. It's excruciating and if I had to imagine the cause, I'd say it was tendons being crunched. If I had to pinpoint the areas exactly, it would be a spot deep in my right buttock about a third of the way down and the right side of my tailbone which is tender to the touch. Stretching hasn't helped and may indeed make it worse. Walking can be therapeutic when I'm able to do it. One thing that felt good was doing handstands in a swimming pool. This felt like a trunk strengthening, therapeutic activity. One confusing characteristic is that after playing football one evening (on the advice of an osteopath), it felt much better the next day and almost non-existent. However the day after, it was at it's very worse. This makes me wonder if tightening muscles are having a big effect on the amount of pressure on the nerve. I'm posting this because I'm unable to make sense of the ailment and what I need to do to treat it. It seems like treatments are having no easily discernible benefits and I'm not sure what I should continue to do. It has occurred to me that I should avoid all stretching until all pain has subsided but most advice is contrary to this. If anyone recognises these symptoms and can perhaps share guidance or ideas on ways forward, I'd appreciate it very much. 0 likes, 2 replies "

Mostly I suffer from a dry cough randomly throughout the day and when I have days of “flare up” I have more of an urge to “clear a constricted airway” and have a quick-non-productive cough.  CT scan states....multiple slightly spiculated nodular opacities in lungs bilaterally which favor inflammatory or infectious causes. Atypical mycobacterium and hypersensitivity pneumonitis should also considered. There is a small left apical scar. There are no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Airways are unremarkable.

In hindsight I have clearly had it for years but had a major flare in the last 6 months, leading to further investigations and diagnosis. I am now waiting for a referral to a respiritory consultant. Can anyone recommend a sarcoidosis specialist in Scotland? There seems to be a Dr Owen Dempsey in Aberdeen and a Dr John Hunter in Glasgow. Does anyone have experience with them or suggest anyone else? Thanks 0 likes, 7 replies "

The biopsy result came back with - inflammatory granuloma tissue and the lab report  mentioned sarcoidosis. My father had this for years before he died. I have a weird rash and lumps on front of lower legs. Lumps under skin in various places. So GP thinks everything I’ve got just now could be signs and symptoms of Sarcoidosis. Is the biopsy result a positive enough diagnosis to say it is sarcoidosis. GP wants me to have chest X-ray,  see a dermatologist and respiritory as well. GP also said to google it and research it as much as possible. I get the impression they already know especially telling me research it. What do you all think.

Sometimes it’s a tickle in my throat that causes the cough most of the time i cough once or twice at random- this is ongoing thoughout the day.  Some times the cough gives me the feeling that I’m trying/straining to clear out my bronchial tubes/center airway. Had a sputum test done Friday- results pending  I sleep OK most of my lack of sleep is from anxietyand fear of the unknown.  I can walk at length, go up steps, Chase my 3 year old and  am not winded.

Oh the stress!!! ,"Hi! I posted before. Had a nasty cough in February that would not Go away- tickle in my throat,dry cough, no fever, hard to catch my breath,felt like I was straining to get mucus out of my lungs but there was none- nonproductive cough. It was terrible.  Abnormal CT scan showed multiple pulmonary nodules indicating infection/inflammation. 2nd CT scan in April showed no change favoring infection/inflammation. All bloodwork labs are normal, no allergies, have reoccurring post nasal drip- CT scan of sinuses are normal.  3 radiologists reviewed my CT scan and all stated it favors infection/inflammation largest nodule is 1.5inches. Ground glass opacity, lymph nodes are subcentimeter and not enlarged.  Lesions are in my upper lobes (3 measured in right lung and 2 measured in left lung) there is a small scar on my lung-mentioned in CT scan Lung specialist mentioned sarcoidosis. Had a lung function test- pulmonologist said my results were good.  Had bloodwork done to rule out tuberculosis (very unlikely) and ACE to see if it would be elevated (results are pending)  Pulmonologist said she believes it’s sarcoidosis.

The high calcium cause some permanent kidney damage and i have been trying to get my calcium and creatinine levels stable for over 10 months now. I have been on prednisone and weened down a few times to see my numbers climb back up. I recently started taking azathioprine in order to ween off of prednisone but i felt terrible and just stopped the aza. I was extremely fatigued, passing out and nauseous. Two questions: 1. what is the best place in the country for secondary opinions/treatment courses and 2. Has anyone experienced this type of flare up?

Meanwhile ... a 46 year old scar on my forehead has become lumpy and red, my eyes are redder and I feel out of breath and like my chest is compessed as well as my lower legs hurting.  I did a little internet search and scar sarcoidosis popped up.  I'm certainly not self diagnosing myself but I see plaquenil is a drug used to treat both conditions so I can't help but wonder what you all think. Do your old scars become inflammed? Are you out of breath feeling but do not have a cough?  The chest thing makes me wonder if I need to make an appointment with my gp .. it's uncomfortable but not painful so I'm kinda waiting it out.

The lack of support for people suffering from sarcoidosis is dreadful but the truth is that not enough is known about the disease and especially amongst UK doctors. American doctors are more on the ball but then they have the money for research etc in the US. I spend my entire time fighting and arguing with health people, trying to get appropriate treatment for my various symptoms. Luckily I have an excellent  respiratory specialist but that is all he is a respiratory specialist so when it comes to all the other problems I have due to sarcoidosis such as skin, eyes and nerves I have to fight to get tests and treatment as either no one believes me or they think it is up to my respiratory specialist to deal with it. He in turn kicks it back to my GP (rightly so) and at the end of the day nothing gets done as no one will take responsibility for the symptoms! It's a ridiculous situation but it boils down to money as all these MRIs and tests are very expensive and neither party wants to foot the bill. The over powering fatigue is dreadful and I can literally fall asleep in mid conversation. Also the depression that comes from constantly feeling unwell and the frustration of fighting for proper care also takes it's toll. The sweating I spoke about earlier, can not only hit at night either as I find that expending a little energy just hoovering a carpet can cause sweat to literally drop off me. At the moment I have severe pain and severe pins and needles in both arms and hands and it has taken me 6 months to finally talk my GP into allowing me to see a neurologist. I will see her tomorrow but my respiratory specialist told me not to hold out too much hope of being believed! So you see even the doctors who understand Sarcoidosis know the taboo within the health sector so what chance do we have? I was originally on high doses of steroids but unfortunately they caused me to have a psychotic break so I had to be taken off them so I am now on an inhaler and mucosal thinner to try to combat the extremely thick, sticky sputum I cough up.In one sense I suppose I am luck as I am already in a wheelchair due to nerve damaged feet (hospital screw up!) but I had to change to an electric wheelchair because with being so breathless and having nerve problems in both arms I couldn't propel myself around in my manual one. I say I'm lucky to be in a wheelchair only because without it I wouldn't be able to get around at all because of the sarcoidosis. I sometimes wonder if UK doctors have a bad attitude towards sarcoid sufferers because they think everyone only has the acute sarcoidosis and it would probably resolve itself  or even come and go undetected in it's own time. I really don't know but what I do know is that they need to become better informed about this disease and be more caring when treating their patients. It's not a deadly disease but it certainly takes its toll on the sufferer and the symptoms need correct and fast treatment before they become a real problem. Keep your chin up fellow sufferers and don't be scared to be pushy with your GP. He has a comittment to treat his patients whether he thinks its serious or not. You have a right to demand to see a specialist or to get a second opinion but do remember that not everything is linked to your sarcoidosis so if you develop a new problem make sure you get it checked out properly and don't be fobbed off with your GP saying it's just a symptom of your sarcoid because it could be a different health issue altogether. 21 likes, 1046 replies "

First of all I was shocked to read that one of the forum members had been told by his specialist that night sweats are not a symptom of sacoidosis. Nonsense! night sweats and indeed profuse sweating during the day are symptoms of Sarcoidosis. The lack of support for people suffering from sarcoidosis is dreadful but the truth is that not enough is known about the disease and especially amongst UK doctors. American doctors are more on the ball but then they have the money for research etc in the US. I spend my entire time fighting and arguing with health people, trying to get appropriate treatment for my various symptoms. Luckily I have an excellent  respiratory specialist but that is all he is a respiratory specialist so when it comes to all the other problems I have due to sarcoidosis such as skin, eyes and nerves I have to fight to get tests and treatment as either no one believes me or they think it is up to my respiratory specialist to deal with it. He in turn kicks it back to my GP (rightly so) and at the end of the day nothing gets done as no one will take responsibility for the symptoms! It's a ridiculous situation but it boils down to money as all these MRIs and tests are very expensive and neither party wants to foot the bill. The over powering fatigue is dreadful and I can literally fall asleep in mid conversation. Also the depression that comes from constantly feeling unwell and the frustration of fighting for proper care also takes it's toll. The sweating I spoke about earlier, can not only hit at night either as I find that expending a little energy just hoovering a carpet can cause sweat to literally drop off me. At the moment I have severe pain and severe pins and needles in both arms and hands and it has taken me 6 months to finally talk my GP into allowing me to see a neurologist. I will see her tomorrow but my respiratory specialist told me not to hold out too much hope of being believed! So you see even the doctors who understand Sarcoidosis know the taboo within the health sector so what chance do we have? I was originally on high doses of steroids but unfortunately they caused me to have a psychotic break so I had to be taken off them so I am now on an inhaler and mucosal thinner to try to combat the extremely thick, sticky sputum I cough up.In one sense I suppose I am luck as I am already in a wheelchair due to nerve damaged feet (hospital screw up!) but I had to change to an electric wheelchair because with being so breathless and having nerve problems in both arms I couldn't propel myself around in my manual one. I say I'm lucky to be in a wheelchair only because without it I wouldn't be able to get around at all because of the sarcoidosis. I sometimes wonder if UK doctors have a bad attitude towards sarcoid sufferers because they think everyone only has the acute sarcoidosis and it would probably resolve itself  or even come and go undetected in it's own time. I really don't know but what I do know is that they need to become better informed about this disease and be more caring when treating their patients. It's not a deadly disease but it certainly takes its toll on the sufferer and the symptoms need correct and fast treatment before they become a real problem. Keep your chin up fellow sufferers and don't be scared to be pushy with your GP. He has a comittment to treat his patients whether he thinks its serious or not. You have a right to demand to see a specialist or to get a second opinion but do remember that not everything is linked to your sarcoidosis so if you develop a new problem make sure you get it checked out properly and don't be fobbed off with your GP saying it's just a symptom of your sarcoid because it could be a different health issue altogether. 21 likes, 1046 replies "

I went into the office for my first visit and told him i was having trouble breathing. he said there is nothing he could give me and shrugged it off. About 3 hours later I'm in the ER  struggling to breath. After getting torridol? i was able to breath again. he quickly called me and ordered the steroids and today i woke up struggling to breathe again. once i take the steroids should that provide immediate relief? 0 likes, 2 replies "

I am 32 years old. I am Caucasian and a male. Ex smoker of nine years. I quit five years ago. I am going through steps on getting a diagnosis. Brief history on what's going on.  I am a Pharmacy Technician in a hospital and while I was working back in June 2018, I started getting really sharp pain underneath left shoulder blade that eventually got extremely painful and went to my chest, especially when inhaling/exhaling. I ended up in the emergency room. They immediately suspected pleurisy. They took blood and a chest X-ray. Chest X-Ray showed was completely abnormal. Showing Bilateral filling in hilar as well as enlarged lymph nodes in mediastinum. As well as a airspace opacity in my upper left lobe. After they did A Chest CT with contrast that confirmed bilateral lung infiltrates with ground glass opacity, lymph node enlargement in the hilar, mediastinum, and one in the gastrohepatic area. Specific nodes noted was, right paratracheal, subcarinal. The largest one measured 2.5 CM. They suspected pneumonia but said other things couldn't be ruled out (HIV, Tuberculosis, Lupus, Lymphoma and Sarcoidosis). I started a 10 day course of Doxcycycline After a follow up they decided to do another CT with Contrast in 5 weeks to see if there is an improvement. Blood was ran to rule TB and HIV which both were negative. ACE was done which was 41 which is considered in normal range. LDH was 210 which was also in normal according to the labs. A day later I started bringing up mucus with blood in it. After finishing the antibiotic both the mucus/blood and pain went completely went away and has not come back which made me think I actually did have an infection. The 5 week repeat showed improvement in the main infiltrate in the upper left lobe and mild improvement in the other infiltrate in the other lobe. Some of the lymph nodes shrank 2-3 MM. The one that measured 2.5cm was now 1.9 cm. This scan showed some borderline spleen enlargement though. My GP was done with it even though resolution was completely there.  I decided to get a second opinion with a pulmonologist. He decided to do another CT in another 5 weeks. This scan, according to the radiologist showed no change however the lymph node noted was 2mm less compared to the previous. My pulmonologist confirmed that there was very slight improvement but my spleen has increased in size by 2 CM. He is thinking Lymphoma or Sarcoidosis at this point but spleen leans more towards lymphoma. I had a PET-CT done a few days ago that showed some uptake supraclavicular area although that area isn't enlarged. enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes with the hottest uptake at 15.3 in the mediastinal. Retroperitoneal lymph nodes with uptake measurement of 12.2. Spleen enlargement was again noted and findings were concerning for a process such as Lymphoma.  After a follow up with my pulmonologist, they now want to do a biopsy with bronchoscopy-EBUS or mediastinalscopy. I chose bronch first, then the other if the broncho fails. My Dr. is still leaning more towards sarcoid and said that sarcoid can make a PET light up. I'm just not convinced since there was some really hot areas but I don't know. Anyway, very anxious about this. I just want some opinions about this. As of now I have no symptoms related to lungs. Never had shortness of breath. The symptoms that I did have have went away after antibiotics. I understand the most if not any of you are doctors and I am not looking to get a diagnosis on the internet. I'm just curious if any of you have had an enlarged spleen at diagnosis and had uptake on your petscans. Thank you in advance for the help. 0 likes, 4 replies "

I'm just not convinced since there was some really hot areas but I don't know. Anyway, very anxious about this. I just want some opinions about this. As of now I have no symptoms related to lungs.

I am 32 years old. I am Caucasian and a male. Ex smoker of nine years. I quit five years ago. I am going through steps on getting a diagnosis. Brief history on what's going on.  I am a Pharmacy Technician in a hospital and while I was working back in June 2018, I started getting really sharp pain underneath left shoulder blade that eventually got extremely painful and went to my chest, especially when inhaling/exhaling. I ended up in the emergency room. They immediately suspected pleurisy. They took blood and a chest X-ray. Chest X-Ray showed was completely abnormal. Showing Bilateral filling in hilar as well as enlarged lymph nodes in mediastinum. As well as a airspace opacity in my upper left lobe. After they did A Chest CT with contrast that confirmed bilateral lung infiltrates with ground glass opacity, lymph node enlargement in the hilar, mediastinum, and one in the gastrohepatic area. Specific nodes noted was, right paratracheal, subcarinal. The largest one measured 2.5 CM. They suspected pneumonia but said other things couldn't be ruled out (HIV, Tuberculosis, Lupus, Lymphoma and Sarcoidosis). I started a 10 day course of Doxcycycline After a follow up they decided to do another CT with Contrast in 5 weeks to see if there is an improvement. Blood was ran to rule TB and HIV which both were negative. ACE was done which was 41 which is considered in normal range. LDH was 210 which was also in normal according to the labs. A day later I started bringing up mucus with blood in it. After finishing the antibiotic both the mucus/blood and pain went completely went away and has not come back which made me think I actually did have an infection. The 5 week repeat showed improvement in the main infiltrate in the upper left lobe and mild improvement in the other infiltrate in the other lobe. Some of the lymph nodes shrank 2-3 MM. The one that measured 2.5cm was now 1.9 cm. This scan showed some borderline spleen enlargement though. My GP was done with it even though resolution was completely there.  I decided to get a second opinion with a pulmonologist. He decided to do another CT in another 5 weeks. This scan, according to the radiologist showed no change however the lymph node noted was 2mm less compared to the previous. My pulmonologist confirmed that there was very slight improvement but my spleen has increased in size by 2 CM. He is thinking Lymphoma or Sarcoidosis at this point but spleen leans more towards lymphoma. I had a PET-CT done a few days ago that showed some uptake supraclavicular area although that area isn't enlarged. enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes with the hottest uptake at 15.3 in the mediastinal. Retroperitoneal lymph nodes with uptake measurement of 12.2. Spleen enlargement was again noted and findings were concerning for a process such as Lymphoma.  After a follow up with my pulmonologist, they now want to do a biopsy with bronchoscopy-EBUS or mediastinalscopy. I chose bronch first, then the other if the broncho fails. My Dr. is still leaning more towards sarcoid and said that sarcoid can make a PET light up.

Since May, they have gotten worse. I have zero exercise tolerance, palpitations that worsen if I bend over, shortness of breath, tachycardia, lightheadedness, etc. I have calcified granulomas on my lungs but they say they are fine. My ekgs show sinus arrythmia but nothing else yet. my echo was pretty normal and my calcium score showed a score of zero. Cardios say sarc would be in lungs, not isolated to heart and that my tests would be abnormal. No diagnoses has been given in all this time and this is my last avenue based off a friend who has cardiac sarc with the same symptoms. they have not done mri or pet and do not seem determined to do them.

I ATTRACTED scabies about 3 months ago and only realized a little over a week that it was scabies i had. ive done two permetherin treatments a week apart and i really dont know if they has worked. I SPEND ALL DAY DOING natural treatments like dead sea salt baths for a hour or two a day with neem or tea tree and oilive oil oin them sometimes usually at a very hot temp, i rub  coconut oil all over my body  twice a day  mixed with either neem oil or Teatree oil or both, i put olive  Oil all over my body twice a day for an hour and 30 minutes and when I do this I see if you look really close with your phone flashlight the mites on my body I take hours to pick each and everyone of them off my body with tweezers. FOr home remedies  I have been washing my sheets and pillowcases twice a day I vacuum twice a day and clean the bathroom every time I  treat myself in it.  I have three sets of clothing which I wash after I wear them once and change my clothes twice a day, once in the morning after my first set of treatments and the second before I go to bed after my second round of treatments.  I clean with all natural ingredients no bleach nothing.  I live with my sister which is  extremely against any harmful chemicals. I just started using cloves oil in my treatment routine  and I sometimes wash my clothes with a few drops of Teatree neem or or eucalyptus.  if anyone has any secret way to cure scabies please let me know .  after my second round of permethrin treatment I started to itch more than I have in the past week it could be from all the dead mites and  their poop but I am very paranoid .  I also always wear rubber gloves with anything that I do and change them at least three or four times a day.  I always wear socks everywhere i go and only wear one pair of shoes.  I think if you never have any part of your body exposed you will not get reinfected  so I tryd to wear long sleeves long socks long pants and gloves at all times except for when I’m doing treatments.  The rashes on my body are pretty bad and almost everywhere on my body.  it’s scary to see your body looks so vulnerable.  I had a breakdown today but I’m just trying to think into the future and be positive. My sister has not been infected yet but we think it’s because of her really high immune system So I started taking probiotics and vitamin C gels every day.  I suggest anyone that’s reading this try the olive oil and look with your flashlight and look for any black red tiny tiny dots on your body,  you’ll look  through your whole body and find a bunch and then you’ll go back to another section that you’ve already looked at and new one will appear  this is the only reason why I knew that they were actually the mites coming out of my body .  I don’t know if I should be taking anything more lnternally or putting plastic on my mattress or my pillows .  if anyone has any questions or any help they wanna give me I’d really appreciate it I’ve been going through hell the past months and have seen some really crazy horror stories about these f*****g mites . hope everyone isnt going to mad.

I got a ring like patch on my right leg in april that was itchy so i treated it with an antifungal cream that made it subside but was still visible.  Then in late may i started to get a few small itchy bumps on my arms and legs that seemed to spread over time, i thought it was another fungal infection so i used sulphur soap and antifungal cream spot application for a week, when the bumps didnt go away i started to become really paranoid and looked up everything on the internet. I thought i had hiv or std and got myself tested all of which came out as negative Thank God!  I was able to see a dermatologist last july13 and she said it was just an irritation and asked me to use a mild collagen soap from her clinic and prescribed citerizine (anti-histamine) 1x a day and to put betamethasone cream on the bumps. 2 weeks into this the rash spread like wildfire and it was red and very itchy, it spread all through out my body except for my neck, shoulders, upper back  and face. When i went back to the dermatologist last july 27 she said it could be scabies and asked me to apply 1 part 5%permethrin 1 part hydrodex lotion from the neck down twice a day without taking a bath for 2 days then stop and bathe for another 2 days then repeat the 2x a day for 2 days application of the creams which i did. My 5yo son who sleeps beside me every night did not get any rashes though so i had a doubt that it was scabies although i continued with the treatment she reccomended.  I threw away my mattress, washed all my pillows, beddings, clothes. I sanitized all surfaces and changed to fresh towels and beddings every day. I was already taking the anti histamine tabs twice a day.  i also started using sulfur soap since july 30 because i read somewhere that it helps. But the rash was still there and its getting worse. I decided to apply only the permethrin 5% last sunday august 4 which would have been my fifth application and took a shower the next day. I asked my mom and son to apply the perm just in case. Monday and tues a take a bath twice a day with the sulfur soap. And just tonight i noticed that the rash on my legs looks dried up and scaly, my thighs and arms still had the bumps. my palms are getting scaly and is flaking off. All of which are still very itchy that sometimes i want to peel my skin off especially at bedtime. I have red that it usually takes about 2 weeks before it all clears up. But now i have these red rashes on my neck and shoulders and new ones on my stomach that i didnt have before. I have been sufferring with this for almost 2 mos now. I no longer go out of the house or even my room because i look like a monster and i dont want anyone else to get infected. I think that this disease is taking a toll on me emotionally, physically and even mentally. I sometimes want to set my skin on fire.  I dont know what else to do and im really scared that even my face and scalp will get rashes.  Please help me.  Please. 2 likes, 88 replies "

I felt better for some days (3 maybe) and pouf I can start feeling the crawling mites and last night was hororful in bed. Not just itchy but biting sensations. I know it is scabies. I dont doubt this but I feel it doesnt make sense with the atching cycle I read. Am I just permetrin resistant? or too much in my environment? I clean tough/  My partner have been having symptoms at first but not as much at all. Not anymore.  Dr friend said I may be more resistant because of immune system at off with pregnancy. Maby also I do not do things right.  My questions are; Is that ok to do a third treatment after 6 days instead of 7? More helpful or no?  What do you guys think of the fact I have symptoms (new bumps and tunnels) after a treatment?  I use   vinegar as well on my itchy spot after 3-4 days permetrine as it helps and I must do smtg.  I cry inside that baby gets it or that it hold my natural tendency to hold her, and I wish she comes late a bit so I can do an other treatment.  I think it is totally chaotic and am not sure what I seek but advices and answer about the permetrin after 6 days.  Does any of you have experience something similar (baby related)  Thanks PS, I know permetrin is strong for pregnancy but I considered it less worst then pass this heck to my newborn I love more then  anything/. <3  0 likes, 3 replies "

I am not completely sure how I got it or if I ever really had it.  I did what some people might have also done, self diagnosed.  If I could go back I would have definitely went to a dermatologist and demanded a skin scrape test, which would hopefully determine what exact skin condition I had.  But I was convinced and still believe I had scabies.   It all started with a small patch of bumps that were on my right forearm.  It was about 2 weeks before Christmas.  I noticed the bumps after they started to itch a little, but didn’t think much of it.  Then it seemed to appear on the other forearm.  Not ever having something like this or even understanding the many possibilities, I just thought it was a simple rash.  About 3 days later while sleeping, I woke up with a severe itchiness on the inside of both my thighs, then during the day it was like it disappeared.  It happened the next day but seemed more severe,  and the only thing that seemed to help was taking a hot bath and letting the water run over my thighs.  Again in the morning it went away.  After that night of basically no sleep and in the bath, I went on webMD and typed in all my symptoms and it came up with scabies as one of the possibilities, especially with the itching and scratching at night.  At this point I was not sure what I should do.  The next night was the same as the two previous nights but seeming to get more intense.  But in the morning I woke up and noticed that it had spread all over my body.  It was all over my arms, but not really on the hands.  It was all over my back, on my chest and stomach, and all over my legs and on my feet.  The weird thing about my lower legs like from the knee down, it that around each hair follicle it seem to have a red circle.  At this point I went to a community urgent care.  When I went they asked what I was there for, I told them a rash and that I thought I might be scabies.  Of course me not knowing the nightmare of a condition it can be, I told them, and of course the treated me as if I had the plague or something.  Knowing what I know now I can not really blame them.  Needless to say they were very unhelpful, one of the nurses told me that simple lice shampoo would take care of the problem.  So I took her advice and went to Rite Aid and bought some and put in all over my body.  Of course as you all probably know, it takes a lot more than simple hair lice product to kill them.  So after a couple days and a couple applications of Rid the head lice treatment with no results I decided to go to a real urgent care affiliated with a hospital.  When I went in and told them what I thought I had, they didn’t treat much different from other patients in the waiting room.  Even the doctor was pretty at ease with sitting in the room and talking with me, or at least it seemed as if he was.  Anyway, he prescribed permitherin.  I put it all over except my face.  The next morning it actually seemed to help a lot. Also washed all my blankets pillows and all dirty clothes in hot water.  And I grabbed my bike and went out for a ride, with scratch scars on my arms and legs, but I was cured.  So I thought.  It only took a couple days to realize that permitherin helped but did not kill or cure all.  I found myself refilling my perscription 7 days later and reapplying it because even the package says it may need second dosage 7 days later.  The second dose still didn’t kill or cure all. I then found myself searching the web and reading and learning as much as I can about this.  At this point I was convinced I had scabies because I even talked to a doctor and he told me if the scabicide worked even a little it only works on parasites and not skin conditions such as follicleitis and others that are commonly confused with scabies.  As the saying goes IGNORANCE IS DEFINITELY BLISS!  The more I read, the more I was horrified.  Ever story of struggle with hardly and happy endings, was discouraging.  I can not tell you how many posts and forum pages I read.  I was determined to beat this. This is what I bought; I bought a plastic drop “cloth” from the dollar store to cover my mattress with.  I would spray and wipe this down every morning with Lysol or some type of disinfectant spray because believe me Lysol gets very expensive after a little while.  I believe I replaced this once a week or so, but only a dollar so not too bad. I bought plastic pillow cover from Wal-Mart I think.  Actually slept without pillow throughout most of this.  I also sprayed and wiped down every morning. I bought plastic gloves from dollar store that I wore almost all day.  Probably was a riot to a lot of people while driving in the streets, but I wanted to make sure I wasn’t letting myself come into contact with any new ones that might be on objects in my car or in my house.  I made sure that to throw these away every time I touched something I thought could possibly have been contaminated.  So needless to say I went through a lot of plastic golves. Always had plastic bags for my laundry, trash(mostly napkins and plastic gloves). I tried to confine myself to my room so I ate out I would say 99.99% of this time.  I would mostly go to McDonalds and get a cheeseburger and a dollar salad. And buy like two of three of these for the day. This was my regimen for many many months; I limited my clothes I wore to 3 sets, and washed clothes every 3 to 4 days. I also limited what I used as blankets at night, 1 sheet.   This is what remedies I have tried; Permitherin about 5 or 6 times.  I took 1 dose that seems to help a lot but not all the way.  Went back a week later and did it one more time.  After that didn’t work I believe I tried it 3 times in a row, which still did not kill all.  I also read online somewhere that they are getting more and more resistant to permitherin.  And if you think about it, it make sense that they are suvivors, they have been around for a long long time. After permitherin didn’t work, I tried vinegar After vinegar didn’t work I tried Neem.  I used the Neem lotion from Henry’s , now Sprout’s. After neem didn’t work, I ordered some pure neem oil from eBay, along with coconut and olive oil. After that didn’t work I decided I was going to try Ivermectin. Ivermectin worked for me.  Luckily I live close to Tijuana, Mexico so I was able to take a trip down there and purchase Ivermectin, or Ivermectina in Spanish.  I bought enough to take 3 weeks in a row.  I did this and was cured, it was not instant, I had a lot of bumps and residuals still poping up from time to time, but this time I knew something was different.  It took a month or two to really stop seeing new bumps form, but I heard it could take a while for all the scabies that died due to ivermectin to come out of skin, and while they are there still they show symptoms of iratation, i.e. rash. Even to this day I get small little bumps pop up, but I pretty sure by taking the permitherin and ivermectin I probably picked up a small case of dermatitis or follicleitis. Please ask any questions, I will try to help as much as possible, Please hang in there and remember things can and will get better! 8 likes, 116 replies "

I also sprayed and wiped down every morning. I bought plastic gloves from dollar store that I wore almost all day.  Probably was a riot to a lot of people while driving in the streets, but I wanted to make sure I wasn’t letting myself come into contact with any new ones that might be on objects in my car or in my house.  I made sure that to throw these away every time I touched something I thought could possibly have been contaminated.  So needless to say I went through a lot of plastic golves. Always had plastic bags for my laundry, trash(mostly napkins and plastic gloves). I tried to confine myself to my room so I ate out I would say 99.99% of this time.  I would mostly go to McDonalds and get a cheeseburger and a dollar salad. And buy like two of three of these for the day. This was my regimen for many many months; I limited my clothes I wore to 3 sets, and washed clothes every 3 to 4 days. I also limited what I used as blankets at night, 1 sheet.   This is what remedies I have tried; Permitherin about 5 or 6 times.  I took 1 dose that seems to help a lot but not all the way.  Went back a week later and did it one more time.  After that didn’t work I believe I tried it 3 times in a row, which still did not kill all.  I also read online somewhere that they are getting more and more resistant to permitherin.  And if you think about it, it make sense that they are suvivors, they have been around for a long long time. After permitherin didn’t work, I tried vinegar After vinegar didn’t work I tried Neem.  I used the Neem lotion from Henry’s , now Sprout’s. After neem didn’t work, I ordered some pure neem oil from eBay, along with coconut and olive oil. After that didn’t work I decided I was going to try Ivermectin. Ivermectin worked for me.  Luckily I live close to Tijuana, Mexico so I was able to take a trip down there and purchase Ivermectin, or Ivermectina in Spanish.  I bought enough to take 3 weeks in a row.  I did this and was cured, it was not instant, I had a lot of bumps and residuals still poping up from time to time, but this time I knew something was different.  It took a month or two to really stop seeing new bumps form, but I heard it could take a while for all the scabies that died due to ivermectin to come out of skin, and while they are there still they show symptoms of iratation, i.e. rash. Even to this day I get small little bumps pop up, but I pretty sure by taking the permitherin and ivermectin I probably picked up a small case of dermatitis or follicleitis. Please ask any questions, I will try to help as much as possible, Please hang in there and remember things can and will get better! 8 likes, 116 replies "

I am not completely sure how I got it or if I ever really had it.  I did what some people might have also done, self diagnosed.  If I could go back I would have definitely went to a dermatologist and demanded a skin scrape test, which would hopefully determine what exact skin condition I had.  But I was convinced and still believe I had scabies.   It all started with a small patch of bumps that were on my right forearm.  It was about 2 weeks before Christmas.  I noticed the bumps after they started to itch a little, but didn’t think much of it.  Then it seemed to appear on the other forearm.  Not ever having something like this or even understanding the many possibilities, I just thought it was a simple rash.  About 3 days later while sleeping, I woke up with a severe itchiness on the inside of both my thighs, then during the day it was like it disappeared.  It happened the next day but seemed more severe,  and the only thing that seemed to help was taking a hot bath and letting the water run over my thighs.  Again in the morning it went away.  After that night of basically no sleep and in the bath, I went on webMD and typed in all my symptoms and it came up with scabies as one of the possibilities, especially with the itching and scratching at night.  At this point I was not sure what I should do.  The next night was the same as the two previous nights but seeming to get more intense.  But in the morning I woke up and noticed that it had spread all over my body.  It was all over my arms, but not really on the hands.  It was all over my back, on my chest and stomach, and all over my legs and on my feet.  The weird thing about my lower legs like from the knee down, it that around each hair follicle it seem to have a red circle.  At this point I went to a community urgent care.  When I went they asked what I was there for, I told them a rash and that I thought I might be scabies.  Of course me not knowing the nightmare of a condition it can be, I told them, and of course the treated me as if I had the plague or something.  Knowing what I know now I can not really blame them.  Needless to say they were very unhelpful, one of the nurses told me that simple lice shampoo would take care of the problem.  So I took her advice and went to Rite Aid and bought some and put in all over my body.  Of course as you all probably know, it takes a lot more than simple hair lice product to kill them.  So after a couple days and a couple applications of Rid the head lice treatment with no results I decided to go to a real urgent care affiliated with a hospital.  When I went in and told them what I thought I had, they didn’t treat much different from other patients in the waiting room.  Even the doctor was pretty at ease with sitting in the room and talking with me, or at least it seemed as if he was.  Anyway, he prescribed permitherin.  I put it all over except my face.  The next morning it actually seemed to help a lot. Also washed all my blankets pillows and all dirty clothes in hot water.  And I grabbed my bike and went out for a ride, with scratch scars on my arms and legs, but I was cured.  So I thought.  It only took a couple days to realize that permitherin helped but did not kill or cure all.  I found myself refilling my perscription 7 days later and reapplying it because even the package says it may need second dosage 7 days later.  The second dose still didn’t kill or cure all. I then found myself searching the web and reading and learning as much as I can about this.  At this point I was convinced I had scabies because I even talked to a doctor and he told me if the scabicide worked even a little it only works on parasites and not skin conditions such as follicleitis and others that are commonly confused with scabies.  As the saying goes IGNORANCE IS DEFINITELY BLISS!  The more I read, the more I was horrified.  Ever story of struggle with hardly and happy endings, was discouraging.  I can not tell you how many posts and forum pages I read.  I was determined to beat this. This is what I bought; I bought a plastic drop “cloth” from the dollar store to cover my mattress with.  I would spray and wipe this down every morning with Lysol or some type of disinfectant spray because believe me Lysol gets very expensive after a little while.

It took a month or two to really stop seeing new bumps form, but I heard it could take a while for all the scabies that died due to ivermectin to come out of skin, and while they are there still they show symptoms of iratation, i.e. rash. Even to this day I get small little bumps pop up, but I pretty sure by taking the permitherin and ivermectin I probably picked up a small case of dermatitis or follicleitis. Please ask any questions, I will try to help as much as possible, Please hang in there and remember things can and will get better! 8 likes, 116 replies "

I am not completely sure how I got it or if I ever really had it.  I did what some people might have also done, self diagnosed.  If I could go back I would have definitely went to a dermatologist and demanded a skin scrape test, which would hopefully determine what exact skin condition I had.  But I was convinced and still believe I had scabies.   It all started with a small patch of bumps that were on my right forearm.  It was about 2 weeks before Christmas.  I noticed the bumps after they started to itch a little, but didn’t think much of it.  Then it seemed to appear on the other forearm.  Not ever having something like this or even understanding the many possibilities, I just thought it was a simple rash.  About 3 days later while sleeping, I woke up with a severe itchiness on the inside of both my thighs, then during the day it was like it disappeared.  It happened the next day but seemed more severe,  and the only thing that seemed to help was taking a hot bath and letting the water run over my thighs.  Again in the morning it went away.  After that night of basically no sleep and in the bath, I went on webMD and typed in all my symptoms and it came up with scabies as one of the possibilities, especially with the itching and scratching at night.  At this point I was not sure what I should do.  The next night was the same as the two previous nights but seeming to get more intense.  But in the morning I woke up and noticed that it had spread all over my body.  It was all over my arms, but not really on the hands.  It was all over my back, on my chest and stomach, and all over my legs and on my feet.  The weird thing about my lower legs like from the knee down, it that around each hair follicle it seem to have a red circle.  At this point I went to a community urgent care.  When I went they asked what I was there for, I told them a rash and that I thought I might be scabies.  Of course me not knowing the nightmare of a condition it can be, I told them, and of course the treated me as if I had the plague or something.  Knowing what I know now I can not really blame them.  Needless to say they were very unhelpful, one of the nurses told me that simple lice shampoo would take care of the problem.  So I took her advice and went to Rite Aid and bought some and put in all over my body.  Of course as you all probably know, it takes a lot more than simple hair lice product to kill them.  So after a couple days and a couple applications of Rid the head lice treatment with no results I decided to go to a real urgent care affiliated with a hospital.  When I went in and told them what I thought I had, they didn’t treat much different from other patients in the waiting room.  Even the doctor was pretty at ease with sitting in the room and talking with me, or at least it seemed as if he was.  Anyway, he prescribed permitherin.  I put it all over except my face.  The next morning it actually seemed to help a lot. Also washed all my blankets pillows and all dirty clothes in hot water.  And I grabbed my bike and went out for a ride, with scratch scars on my arms and legs, but I was cured.  So I thought.  It only took a couple days to realize that permitherin helped but did not kill or cure all.  I found myself refilling my perscription 7 days later and reapplying it because even the package says it may need second dosage 7 days later.  The second dose still didn’t kill or cure all. I then found myself searching the web and reading and learning as much as I can about this.  At this point I was convinced I had scabies because I even talked to a doctor and he told me if the scabicide worked even a little it only works on parasites and not skin conditions such as follicleitis and others that are commonly confused with scabies.  As the saying goes IGNORANCE IS DEFINITELY BLISS!  The more I read, the more I was horrified.  Ever story of struggle with hardly and happy endings, was discouraging.  I can not tell you how many posts and forum pages I read.  I was determined to beat this. This is what I bought; I bought a plastic drop “cloth” from the dollar store to cover my mattress with.  I would spray and wipe this down every morning with Lysol or some type of disinfectant spray because believe me Lysol gets very expensive after a little while.  I believe I replaced this once a week or so, but only a dollar so not too bad. I bought plastic pillow cover from Wal-Mart I think.  Actually slept without pillow throughout most of this.  I also sprayed and wiped down every morning. I bought plastic gloves from dollar store that I wore almost all day.  Probably was a riot to a lot of people while driving in the streets, but I wanted to make sure I wasn’t letting myself come into contact with any new ones that might be on objects in my car or in my house.  I made sure that to throw these away every time I touched something I thought could possibly have been contaminated.  So needless to say I went through a lot of plastic golves. Always had plastic bags for my laundry, trash(mostly napkins and plastic gloves). I tried to confine myself to my room so I ate out I would say 99.99% of this time.  I would mostly go to McDonalds and get a cheeseburger and a dollar salad. And buy like two of three of these for the day. This was my regimen for many many months; I limited my clothes I wore to 3 sets, and washed clothes every 3 to 4 days. I also limited what I used as blankets at night, 1 sheet.   This is what remedies I have tried; Permitherin about 5 or 6 times.  I took 1 dose that seems to help a lot but not all the way.  Went back a week later and did it one more time.  After that didn’t work I believe I tried it 3 times in a row, which still did not kill all.  I also read online somewhere that they are getting more and more resistant to permitherin.  And if you think about it, it make sense that they are suvivors, they have been around for a long long time. After permitherin didn’t work, I tried vinegar After vinegar didn’t work I tried Neem.  I used the Neem lotion from Henry’s , now Sprout’s. After neem didn’t work, I ordered some pure neem oil from eBay, along with coconut and olive oil. After that didn’t work I decided I was going to try Ivermectin. Ivermectin worked for me.  Luckily I live close to Tijuana, Mexico so I was able to take a trip down there and purchase Ivermectin, or Ivermectina in Spanish.  I bought enough to take 3 weeks in a row.  I did this and was cured, it was not instant, I had a lot of bumps and residuals still poping up from time to time, but this time I knew something was different.

I have itched my legs so much that I've caused them to bleed. I visited the Dr's and he prescribed Derbac M to try (although he wasn't sure it was   due to lack of rash). This helped for a week but it started again, Dr was reluctant to try further scabies treatment and said that if it was scabies that would have sorted it. I was meant to have an appointment with dermatologist but this was cancelled due to current climate. Photos of myself and sons marks attached. 0 likes, 4 replies "

So what I am being told is basically pain killers for pain management at this time is my only choice, however its been getting so bad that today I almost wet to bed because I couldn't get out of it, as every time I tried to do the hospital bed roll off / lift of I would get a SHOCKING pain from my lower spine down to the shin below my right knee cap. The huge issue is this started out as a strong pinch in my lower spine, the pain traveled down to my right leg where its just been a VERY sensitive and painful hip / knee pain if I move on it wrong at all, and now I am experimenting with sleeping in a recliner with ortho pillows for lumbar support to avoid needing to do a dramatic situp that triggers that nerve pain which makes me unable to walk, but this is now starting to bring the pain back into my lower spine again and still very present in my right leg as well. I am getting worried because I feel like all this inaction can lead to it getting worse to possibly a point beyond repair once my surgery is healed, I am still walking very short distances (that seem to be getting shorter as to what I can tolerate), and wondering if I should just do minimal walking around the house and cozy up to 24/7 pain killers for the next few weeks? I'm going to go take a walk outside now just to see how things are getting along after sleeping on my recliner for a few hours, just not being able to sleep AT ALL from the pain is making me feel sick constantly, and I am starting to really worry which twist is going to be the one that paralyzes me 😦 Any input appreciated, I am feeling down very big time right now, I should be celebrating a good recovery from the colostomy reversal surgery but this sciatic issue is just crazy pain 24/7.

I am new to this forum, but not to the sciatica ordeal. I had my first bout of sciatica when I was 31 years old.  It was a horrendous experience, when every time I moved my fingers I would feel a shooting pain in my butt and leg. I had to sleep on the wooden dining table extension. To get off the bed, I had to crawl out of the bed on my knees and my husband would pick me up from the floor and take me to the bathroom. I couldn't sit, couldn't sleep, couldn't walk. Couldn't function, period. The neurologist gave me Rx for Tylenol/Codeine (Tylenol 3) and a muscle relaxer. Don't remember how long it took for the pain to go away, but it did. Fast forward. I am 71  years young now. Over the years, I had a few flare-ups. Fortunately,  nothing to compare to the first one. I always kept my Tylenol 3 with me and, as soon as I felt that the another episode is coming on (for me it's ALWAYS nagging pain on the side of my leg, from hip to ankle), I'd  take my magic pill, add muscle relaxer and in less than a week or so I would be up and running. Ten years ago my husband and I moved from NYC to Kiev (Ukraine), my home town. Our son still lives in the States. We visit US every year and my friend would get me fresh prescription for Tylenol 3. About two weeks ago, on the plain from Spain, I felt, ever so familiar, nagging pain. When I reached for my pills, I realized that the last time I refilled prescription was 3(!) years ago. Stupid me! Of course, as soon as I got home, I had full blown sciatica flare-up episode. Pain was horrendous. Walking was a torture. In the supermarket I had to hold on to shopping cart to be able to walk. Because I can't get prescription for codeine containing medication here, I started to look for OTC pain relievers and muscle relaxers. Fortunately for many-many people, the are lots of them here. Unfortunately for me, they all shoot my blood pressure through the roof. I started to use Traumeel C gel which helped tremendously. I can walk now. It's painful, but, at least, I don't have to hold on the walls or furniture while moving from room to room. Some days are better, some days are worse. But I feel, at least, about 70% better than I felt when it started two weeks ago. I know that using gel alone, will take me loooong time to get rid of the pain. This is the reason I decided to join discussion on this forum. Maybe somebody, among the  fellow sufferers, knows  about pain relievers and/or muscle relaxers that don't raise blood pressure. Sorry for the long post and thanks for listening. Be well. Adele 0 likes, 20 replies "

In my experience, this disease, is not only painfully debilitating, it is emotionally exhausting. The advice and experiences within bring hope where hope is often hard to find! One year and two months ago, I went to get contacts. Within a month, my eyes were beet red and I was in the pain we all know too well. Six months later, my diagnoses was anterior and posterior scleritis. Like all of us, it has been a long journey. I finally found an eye specialist in my area who could properly diagnose me. He believes it is scleritis rooted in RA. What he then did was form a team. He found a retinal specialist for me at Duke University and made an appointment with a rheumatologist who could prescribe and monitor the endless drugs they try out on us Guinea pigs. Of course, like all of us, I have been on varying amounts of prednisone since the onset of this journey. Yes, I too, am thankful for the pain relief but consider it a demon the longer you are on it: bone loss, mood swings,   thoughts, cannot sleep, night sweats, and the list goes on. January: I began taking 3200mg of Advil to try to alleviate the pain. It never alleviated all of it but I could function. I took and continue to take predlisone drops and comagan drops to relief the pressure built up from the predlisone drops March: Under the supervision of a rheumatologist, I began 15 mg (6 pills) of methotrexate taken weekly and folic acid daily, while still trying to taper off prednisone. May: Humira was added, first every other week, then weekly. If you think the scleritis is bad, add all over head pain in addition to the pain behind your eye and on the bridge of your nose, swollen feet, and waking up every two hours to get a drink of water for dry mouth. I would hold my head at night and cry until I could cry no longer. I equate all those side effects to Humira. Last month, I went to Duke University in Durham, NC for a follow up appointment. A doctor, who is an associate of my specialist examined my eyes and remarked about how dry they are. She asked me to get over the counter eye drops for dry eye, without preservative, and to put them in my eye every two hours. At this point, I am willing to try almost anything. So…………… 1.       I do the dry eye drops but sometimes I forget. I found, on Amazon, a mask that heats up and is for dry eye. I do this morning and night for 30 minutes. I know it feels amazing and I think it is helping. I have been doing this for two weeks. 2.       I have been going to an Acupuncturist for about 2 months. 3.       2 weeks ago, I began   which is a process of swishing coconut oil in your mouths to rid any hidden bacteria or infection that may be present in my gums. Google ‘ .’ I hate doing it, but in the light of the alternative of scleritis, I will do it. Here is where it gets good: Last Friday, I decided my quality of life was of no quality and I did not give myself the Humira shot. Saturday, I woke up and I was a new person. It was astonishing and very unexpected. I had no head pain and no swelling in my feet. By Sunday, I slept through the night without the exhaustion of dry mouth. I have reduced my prednisone to 2.5 every other day. By Monday, I felt no need to take the Advil first thing in the morning. For eight months, I have not been able to begin my day without a cocktail of prednisone and 800mg of Advil. I asked my doctor if she would consider me going off the Humira until my next bloodwork tells the tale of my inflammation. She believes this is simply a fluke and that the Humira finally kicked in. She believes that if I stop taking the Humira, my scleirtis will get worse. For now, I am going to wait and see how I feel. Neither of my choices are good if indeed she is correct. Go blind or live a life that is not worth living on Humira. My advice to everyone is to think outside the box. You know your body better than anyone else. Think about any possible cause and try things. If I had to do it over again, I would try adding one thing at a time so I would know what indeed is working. However, like all of us, I was desperate for relief. Please pray for me that this works!    Update: I went to the acupuncturist yesterday. My regular person is on vacation so I was with the person who started the clinic. She told me that eye is a reflection of what is happening in the liver and the liver is where we store anger that is not released. I thought this very interesting. She gave me chinese herbal medicine to get ""the fire"" out of my eyes. Good luck to all!   1 like, 2 replies "

Go blind or live a life that is not worth living on Humira. My advice to everyone is to think outside the box. You know your body better than anyone else. Think about any possible cause and try things. If I had to do it over again, I would try adding one thing at a time so I would know what indeed is working. However, like all of us, I was desperate for relief. Please pray for me that this works!    Update: I went to the acupuncturist yesterday. My regular person is on vacation so I was with the person who started the clinic. She told me that eye is a reflection of what is happening in the liver and the liver is where we store anger that is not released. I thought this very interesting. She gave me chinese herbal medicine to get ""the fire"" out of my eyes. Good luck to all!   1 like, 2 replies "

I want to shout ""I can withstand a lot of pain but to endure this pain is unreasonable."" In addition to the constant pain from inflammation, I have sharp pain behind my eye that is severe and fleeting. I also have what I describe as little bursts of pain behind my eye, like little explosions. Sometimes I feel as if a knife is going through my eye over and over. As quickly as they come, they go. My doctor at Duke says the pain that comes and goes is not from the scleritis and I should consult my primary care doctor. It doesn't seem possible as severe as it is that it is not from the scleritis. Does anyone else experience this kind of pain? 0 likes, 9 replies "

Each time the test result came back normal.  The first I had epislceritis, I was prescribed  with pred forte and arcoxia oral medication by my ophalmologist.  I was totally cleared in about 2 to 3 weeks time.  The 2nd flare up in 2016, same eye drop and oral medication prescribed.  It took me one month or so to completely cleared. The 3rd flare up was recent. I went to different eye doctor, was prescribed Lotemax and synflex 275 mg oral medication for one month. The moment i stop both the lotemax and synflex, the redness return. I was asked to continue for another one month with pred forte and synflex.  The moment i stopped taking synflex said about few days the redness start to come back.  Synflex created a mess in my stomach. I need to take nexium 40 mg to go with it. I am scheduled to see my eye doctor on the 3rd July 2018.   Am very depress that it keep coming back.   I need help and hope someone can share out their experience here. Thanks! 0 likes, 0 replies "

I then used Acular but it is not nearly as effective. I got steadily more fed up with looking like something out of a horror film 2 weeks out of each month so in despair went to see a nutritionist. She advised me that the episcleritis was a symptom of my immune system being damaged and put me on a course of Vitamin B, Omega 3 fish oil, a general multi vitamin and a pro biotic plus a daily dose of an anti oxidant supplement with vitamins A,C and E. Unless you are pregnant or wanting to be, I think this has made a difference as apaprt from one day of a vague redness (normally it wold last 10) I have not had a recurrence. It seems to be working so I wanted to share this with you. erhaps give it a go. Good luck. 0 likes, 36 replies "
