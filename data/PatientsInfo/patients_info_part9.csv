My Fingers, wrist, elbow, shoulders, neck, jaw and sometimes knees. Are always in a lot of discomfort. I feel the need to constantly crack all of them, like 1-3 every 10 minutes. They feel really tense if I don't. The more I use the joints the worse the feeling gets. My whole body cracks and grinds with any movement. Is this any concern, what can I do to prevent this from happening, it's destroying quality of life. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I have a tear on my labrum of the hip. Where this tear is, a cyst has formed which is most likely causing the majority of the pain as whenever I partake in physical actions it's almost as my hip joint is pushing against this cyst. I believe to have sciatica because of where this cyst is positioned. Anyways, because of this I am going to have keyhole surgery, otherwise known as an arthoscopy, the doctors are going to remove the cyst and try to amend the tear. They may need to rebuild the cartilage if it's badly worn, they want to do this by receiving bone marrow from myself and fertilising it so the cartilage grows stronger. Personally, I believe I should of had a full hip replacement, however I'm glad things are finally getting done. I hope this procedure allows me a few years to be active and happy again. Being 18 years old and having previous operations consisting of different things it's been a lot to pull my head around, but I'm asking for advice if anyone has some for me. Has anyone had a arthroscopy before, preferently on their hip? How did the procedure go? I'd love to hear from you. My operation is estimated at the 20th of March, nearly two weeks! Crapping myself.  ?Amber. ?X   0 likes, 1 reply "

I know I asked questions about this before but didn't get any answers so I hope this helps someone else. All my tests showed no problem in my hip so my Dr said he was going to do a diagnostic arthroscopy of my hip. He suspected a torn tendon. I was so thankful he didn't quit when he found the torn tendon because I also had a torn labrum and the cartilage was so damaged it was down to the bone. To fix the cartilage issue, he did micro-fracture. He also repaired the tendon and labrum. I fell the first week after surgery but it doesn't seem to have adversly affected the hip.  Because of the micro-fracture, I am still non-weight bearing for the first 3 weeks. I then go to partial weight bearing and start PT. That is all next week. Since I haven't been able to walk, I'm not sure how sucessful this was, but hoping it takes care of my problems. I hope anyone else having to go through this has a good outcome. As for pain, it's not too bad. The day of surgery it was almost unbearable and they kept me overnight. The next day I was only taking tylenol. I did not fill my pain prescriptions as I did not need them. 0 likes, 2 replies "

About a year to two years ago, I was having pain in a very specific area in my right shoulder, along with ALOT of clicking, popping, and grinding. Come to find out, it was my AC joint. Several cortisone shots, physical therapy, and pain relievers later, I decided to have surgery, in hopes that this pain would go away, or get some kind of relief. My surgeon told me he shaved my ac joint, cleaned up arthritis, bursa, and any spurs I had, and also discovered I had a post labrum tear.

Well, here I am, 3 months post opp, and the pain in my ac joint area is unbearable..MUCH like before surgery. Minor clicking which I’m told is normal. And I have noticed the very large bump that was there before, is there, but minimal and still painful. I am going on Monday, to get a second opinion, as my doctor doesn’t understand why I am still in pain. I have been referred to a rheumatologist, as I have bad cases of arthritis related diseases in my family. However, how can I possibly be in so much pain this late in the game?

Has anyone else had such a large portion of their lateral meniscus cartilage removed? How have you felt since the op? Have you gone on to develop problems?

It’s been just over 7 week since I had it done and everything has been fine, been able to get out more without worrying if my knees gonna play up, not been on as many pain killers.. Declined hospital physio as it’s pretty much the same exercises my physio gave me prior to being referred to for surgery and for my back the previous year so thought I know what I’m doing I’ll be ok (had an open appointment til end of October if i wanted to go back) Noticed yesterday I’m struggling with stairs and can’t weight bare going up or bend fully to weight bare coming down.. Not seen consultant since September (onmy saw him prior to surgery) and don’t see him till 17th December and I know it’s a 50:50 chance it would work but thought it would last longer than this. Currently sat in bed in tears, doing physio hoping it helps and no idea what to do if it doesnt. has anyone else had this? any hints or tips would be much appreciated. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I was short of breath one summer when it was fairly humid and the air quality was not great. I went to my GP and they gave me a suck & blow (PFT) test. My breathing efficiency at the time was about 50%. They put me on Advair and a puffer. The puffers have never really made a difference, as I've never had an 'attack'. I eventually started feeling better and stopped taking the Advair, as it did not make a noticeable difference. About 4 years ago, it bothered my breathing when I ate, my abdomen became bloated and I found it hard to breath. My doctor sent me to a respirologist who spent 2 years doing PFTs, but did not provide any answers. I finally asked him to do a chest x ray , which showed that I had atelectasis and an elevated hemi-diaphragm. The doctor blamed this on my Ankylosing Spondylitis, but the Rheumatologist said this was BS, as my chest expansion was fine and AS would affect the upper chest. I asked my doctor to refer me to a second rheumatologist. He did a few additional tests, including a blood gas test and an asthma challenge. I failed the Asthma challenge, but only after they gave me significant amounts of methacholine. They also did a blood gas test and found my PAO2 was 66%. Based on some algorithm, he determined that I had a hole in mt heart. I'm thinking you're FoS, but OK off we go for a bunch of heart tests that discovered that my elevated diaphragm bothers my heart when lying down. They also did an ultrasound of my diaphragm, which showed that it is not paralyzed.  Respirologist #2 decided that my breathing issues are related to my very mild sleep apnea. Repirologist #1, who is also a sleep doctor, said this is complete horses***. I had a PFT at Repirologist #1 recently and I could tell the results were worse. The doctor did not tell me the numbers when I saw him for the folow-up, so I said the test seemed to be worse. He said yes the test was not as good the previous one, but it is in range with results over the past two years. Blah, Blah. He still did not give me the numbers. I mentioned that Ventolin does not seem to make a difference during my PFT, he agreed. My doctor said to me at one time, it looks like they are just going to monitor your results as they get worse. At on point I said to my doctor that I came to you with problems X, Y and Z, and three years later I still have problems X, Y and Z.  My doctor changed clinics shortly after that and dropped me. Other patients followed her, as the clinic mentioned it. I was not given the option. Sorry for the rant, but my question is that this does not seem to be Asthma. In fact I recently had to go to the walk-in for Bronchitis and they said you have COPD.

He said yes the test was not as good the previous one, but it is in range with results over the past two years. Blah, Blah. He still did not give me the numbers. I mentioned that Ventolin does not seem to make a difference during my PFT, he agreed. My doctor said to me at one time, it looks like they are just going to monitor your results as they get worse. At on point I said to my doctor that I came to you with problems X, Y and Z, and three years later I still have problems X, Y and Z.  My doctor changed clinics shortly after that and dropped me.

Now going for angiogram and possible stents,"My husband had an episode of severe chest pain when working abroad. He had been swimming 'hard' for 30 minutes or more and giving all he had. A friend took him to hospital where they decided he had angina. From that day he has been taking meds but has had no pain (despite ignoring the Dr and going back to swimming - just not quite as hard as he had been). On return to UK our GP reduced the number of tablets he was on and he was still fine. Tomorrow he is having an angiogram and if necessary stents. I am finding it really hard to accept he needs this intervention as he has had absolutely no problems before or after that one episode. It scared him enough to make lifestyle changes and he has already lost over half a stone. Personally I feel it is an overreaction (because he is being seen privately) but everyone else tells me I am wrong. He is a 'big bloke' and I know people look and think 'high cholesterol' (his is in fact low). He has had a thyroid problem which is also being checked out and I wonder if the recent raised reading is a result of some of the medication he was taking. He is absolutely fine at the moment. I guess I don't see there will be a benefit to this intrusive action tomorrow..............Sorry I know I go on and on ...just having a problem accepting there is anything wrong I guess 0 likes, 13 replies "

And it literally makes no difference, I still feel very tired during the day. Sometimes I get naps, but I try not to rely on them too much as I don't want to get a bad habit.  Apart from that, I've been getting dizzy spells - I'm good at coping with these because all my life I've had bad vasovagal episodes/seizures and dizzy spells (90% when having injections, 10% randomly or when stressed), but I'm getting them most days now, and doing even a little physical activity brings them on easily. I used to be quite fit, I've been going to the gym/treadmill regularly and now I can barely even jog for 5-10 minutes without feeling like I'm genuinely going to pass out. My seizures are also undiagnosed, I've had MRIs and brain scans and the rest of it. My diet's okay, it's not incredible, but it's definitely not awful, it's fairly balanced! I also do take multivitamins every morning, and have been doing so for a long time. I always eat an hour before, and straight after exercising (If I don't have some kind of energy boost after exercising I won't function for the rest of the day, my eyes will be like lead). I've also lost a bit of weight, and am finding it a bit hard to get that back up too. I've tried adding complan to my diet and things like that, but it's not working too well. I'm currently hovering around 7.5-7.7 stone, whereas I used to be 8.5!  I'm getting out of breath fairly easily too, and my chest feels a little heavy at times, like I'm breathing in, but getting no air at all, and I have to breathe really deeply to feel any kind of comfort. I'm very good at staying calm when this happens, and pace myself, luckily.  But I'm just at my absolute wits end, this is starting to massively affect my life, no matter how much I try to push on. I'm in a great point in my life right now, everything's going really well, but I'm so fed up. Doctor's never seem to take me seriously at all. I got my blood results today (Absolutely normal), and the dr just said I had no physical symptoms so it's probably stress related and is 'normal for girls my age' (I'm 20 and really not stressed about anything!) and to come back in 6 months if it's still happening!!!  Please, please, please, this is a desparate call for help. Please. Tell me I'm not making this all up, and it's not all in my head. I'm absolutely certain it's not psycho-sematic or anything like that! I'm going crazy here, I get days where I can barely even function at all, I'm just zoned out for the whole dady and can't even talk straight or get my words out at all. Does anybody have any ideas? I'm sick of drs telling me I'm fine, and I've been to a few different ones and they're all reluctant to help. Actually conisdering a private consultation. Please, any advice appreciated.

For at least 6 months now, I've been feeling really out of sorts. Getting very tired, very easily, as in, I can go to sleep easily at ANY point during the day, whether it be 1 hour after I've woken up, or 1 hour before I go to bed.  I sleep well, very few troubles in that area, and I've tried adjusting my sleeping pattern and experimenting with that, eg - Tried sleeping less for a period of time (6 hours a night), and tried sleeping more (up to 13 hours a night!) And it literally makes no difference, I still feel very tired during the day. Sometimes I get naps, but I try not to rely on them too much as I don't want to get a bad habit.  Apart from that, I've been getting dizzy spells - I'm good at coping with these because all my life I've had bad vasovagal episodes/seizures and dizzy spells (90% when having injections, 10% randomly or when stressed), but I'm getting them most days now, and doing even a little physical activity brings them on easily. I used to be quite fit, I've been going to the gym/treadmill regularly and now I can barely even jog for 5-10 minutes without feeling like I'm genuinely going to pass out. My seizures are also undiagnosed, I've had MRIs and brain scans and the rest of it. My diet's okay, it's not incredible, but it's definitely not awful, it's fairly balanced! I also do take multivitamins every morning, and have been doing so for a long time. I always eat an hour before, and straight after exercising (If I don't have some kind of energy boost after exercising I won't function for the rest of the day, my eyes will be like lead). I've also lost a bit of weight, and am finding it a bit hard to get that back up too. I've tried adding complan to my diet and things like that, but it's not working too well.

Should I be taking supplements?,"Hey everyone, I had blood work done two years ago and found out I had low ferritin, it was at 15. I started taking iron supplements, for the first couple months 150mg and then down to 75mg. I finished all my supplements the last summer but I didnt bother to check up on my iron levels right away. Finally I got blood work done again about a month ago and got the results back. My doctor requested a full iron panel for me. Everything was OK and my doctor said I didn't need to take any supplements but I am a bit sceptical. My hemoglobin and all that is actually very good, but my ferritin still seems low, it is now at 23. My hemoglobin has always been good it is just the iron stores that are low for me. I do notice my anxiety and fatigue have been so much worse the past couple months and I experienced the same symptoms right before I got tested two years ago. I am thinking of going to another doctor to get a second opinion, but i would like to hear what anyone here has to say. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I was 51 when I started taking them,  I'm 68 now) Symptoms Anxious  feelings like feeling a bit scared all the time. Burning sensation in lower legs when laid down in bed. Cramp in legs and feet. Skin blotchy.and a bit purple in colour.  A bit like when you have sat in front of a fire too long. This started in my legs but now covers most of my body. Breathlessness and a wheezy cough.

He didnt do any tests, other than to pinch and see the circulation was ok, and just asked if he was on a blood thinner, which he is.  i added that he has periodically taken ibuprofen but the doc didnt seem concerned with that.

It all started in 2009 when I began to have blood in my stool off and on for about 12 months. I didn't really think anything about it because it did not happen at every bowel movement. I was at the time working out a lot and eating a lot of protein and a lot of nuts and not alot of water which I think caused my issue turn into a chronic fissure. The first time the was at age 29, the fissure pain came was after about a year of the on and off anal bleeding after and I got constipated and noticed a sharp pain while using the bathroom that I had never felt. After going I noticed a lot of blood in my stool but just cleaned myself as normal and went back in my living room to watch some tv. About 15 min. went by and then for the first time I felt the severe pain of what I didn't yet know was a chronic fissure. (Found out a year later after visit to Mayo Clinic in Florida) The pain of a chronic fissure is unexplainable unless someone has ever had it. It feels like you are being stabbed in the rectum and I can understand any and all of the issues, pain, mental and physical problems it can cause for someone and there family.  I would like to give my advise to others with this issue to help them quicker than what it took me because of my stubbornness that I originally had. A lot of what you hear from doctors and creams told to use will not work or only for a short period when you think the fissure is gone and then it comes back. I tried everything and read everything for a long period of time and what I found that worked was not the creams as much as   my major change in diet and health. Mostly what eventually helped was a liquid diet, lots of vitamins, oils for a long period(I lost 60lbs) and eventually,  gradually adding solid food to your diet. No strenuous body, muscle workouts so that your anal muscles are not strained in any way. There is a lot more that I did and took place but I would be typing for 2 more days. If anyone has  any questions, I would be happy to help. If you have a fissure or a chronic fissure I want to let you know that you can heal it. You will have to be devoted to doing it and very very positive. I am a very positive person and I as well thought about how I did not know how I could continue my life if the pain would not stop. It will stop and you can heal your fissure. 0 likes, 7 replies "

I just made an account to post on here. I originally posted this as a reply to one individual but wanted to make my own thread as i believe this may be of help to many people. apologies if this is not allowed. This will be long so i apologise but try and make it through, it may be helpful. I am a 28 year old male, UK with Ulcerative Colitis who has dealt with a chronic fissure for 6-7 years. i was diagnosed with bowel disease and due to this ended up with a bad tear that never healed. I started as a fit and healthy male who worked out daily and weighed about 14 1/2 stone before this nightmare, I now currently sit at 9 stone. I attribute the weight loss to anxiety over eating because as we all know whatever you eat has to come out the other end! I also suffer from terrible anxiety which does not help our bottom situation at all. I have spent the last 5-7 years in my house doing nothing due to the pain and embarassment, spent so much time away from work and having no quality of life at all. I honestly believe the stress and anxiety comes hand in hand with the bottom pains as you wake up terrified to use the toilet and my whole world revolves around this. My spasms would last from first BM to 8-9:00pm at night. Horrendous pain. The pain you feel is from the internal sphincter muscle spasm in response to the fissure. The muscle spasms preventing blood flow to the area and therefore healing. This has been my experience with different procedures. My GP prescribed me the 2% Nitro Glycerin creams for 2 years which did not work, I tried 2 variations due to terrible headaches from the first cream eventually leading to an allergic reaction down there which made everything much worse. Eventually after many years I got referred to a Colorectal Specialist who gave me Botox injections and a Fissurectomy (fissure scraping to remove scar tissue) last year. This procedure in my opinion was the worst pain I experienced with the whole ordeal, even worse than the fissure itself. Recovery was tough and I was taking max doses of Ibuprofen and Paracetamol just to get through the day and this lasts for 3-4 weeks. I would not recommend this as it did not solve my issue just provided relief for a few months. My next visit with the specialist ended up with me being offered a LIS (Lateral Internal Sphincterotomy) or another round of Botox and examination under anaesthesia. I chose the Botox again for a second time as I was so terrified of a more major surgery - especially reading horror stories online about cutting into the Sphincter muscle, even in this forum lol. This round went a lot easier for me as there was no scraping of the fissure. I was walking within a week but still needed a lot of painkillers during and after BM's. Again I had short relief as the botox slightly paralyses the spincter muscle to prevent the spasms i mentioned earlier, but ended up being referred back again due to re-opening the fissure. This leads up to where i am now and after finally choosing to settle for the LIS surgery which I had 1 week ago on Monday 17th Feb 2020. I read hundreds of horror stories from people here so was prepared for the worst - incontinence, terrible pains which lasts for weeks or months etc. My experience was honestly the opposite of everything I read online. I woke up that morning to toast at 6:45am as no food is allowed after 7:00, I also drank as much water as i could before 11:00 as no fluids are allowed past that time either. I arrived at the hospital very nervous at 12:30 and had all pre checks done. The surgeon talks you through the procedure of making a small slice to the left or right of the rectum, not actually inside it. They then under the skin through the incision remove part of the internal sphincter muscle. In my case they removed the rear or posterior portion of my sphincter which was heavily damaged from years of tearing. I eventually went in for the surgery at about 3:30 and woke up completely out of it due to the painkillers and anaesthesia a few hours later. The pain isn't bad at this point so once checked out you spend that night sleeping it off. Now don't get me wrong, the next 2 or 3 days are painful, especially when going to the bathroom. It hurt like a b***h but its more of a surgical pain than the fissure pain and spasms, I was and still am black and blue and swollen down there which is to be expected and the stitches are quite uncomfortable. But in my experience it is NOTHING compared to the pain of a fissure. you need to ensure you take the relevant laxatives they recommend, this is a huge point as you do NOT want to get constipated during recovery. I took 10ML of lactulose X4 times per day and X1 sachet of Fibregel on an evening. As I'm still in recovery I eat 4-5 tiny meals a day mostly greens and white meats, soft oats etc and a LOT of water to keep everything soft. I am now just over one week in, stitches are still there, i'm still black and blue from bruising, but my experience in general is very positive. I have taken 0 and I mean no pain killers of any sort during my recovery so far going from the day after my surgery until this very second. No paracetamol no ibuprofen nothing. I currently go to the bathroom 2 or 3 times every day now and its easier to pass stool every time, i don't get the spasms at all anymore. I still have a bit of anxiety regarding going but it gets easier with each day I experience less pain. I honestly think after years of damage down there my sphincter just kept getting tighter and tighter, I felt like a grown man trying to poo from a babies sized bottom and it was ruining my life. Although i am not fully recovered or sitting yet i have been on my feet walking since day 1 post surgery and each day is getting easier. Anyone out there struggling with a chronic fissure get advice about a LIS, i am one week in and see a bright light at the end of my tunnel already and wouldn't recommend it enough. I will try and reply to any comments or questions when i get the time 😃. 2 likes, 14 replies "

I honestly think after years of damage down there my sphincter just kept getting tighter and tighter, I felt like a grown man trying to poo from a babies sized bottom and it was ruining my life. Although i am not fully recovered or sitting yet i have been on my feet walking since day 1 post surgery and each day is getting easier. Anyone out there struggling with a chronic fissure get advice about a LIS, i am one week in and see a bright light at the end of my tunnel already and wouldn't recommend it enough.

I just made an account to post on here. I originally posted this as a reply to one individual but wanted to make my own thread as i believe this may be of help to many people. apologies if this is not allowed. This will be long so i apologise but try and make it through, it may be helpful. I am a 28 year old male, UK with Ulcerative Colitis who has dealt with a chronic fissure for 6-7 years. i was diagnosed with bowel disease and due to this ended up with a bad tear that never healed. I started as a fit and healthy male who worked out daily and weighed about 14 1/2 stone before this nightmare, I now currently sit at 9 stone. I attribute the weight loss to anxiety over eating because as we all know whatever you eat has to come out the other end! I also suffer from terrible anxiety which does not help our bottom situation at all. I have spent the last 5-7 years in my house doing nothing due to the pain and embarassment, spent so much time away from work and having no quality of life at all. I honestly believe the stress and anxiety comes hand in hand with the bottom pains as you wake up terrified to use the toilet and my whole world revolves around this. My spasms would last from first BM to 8-9:00pm at night. Horrendous pain. The pain you feel is from the internal sphincter muscle spasm in response to the fissure. The muscle spasms preventing blood flow to the area and therefore healing. This has been my experience with different procedures. My GP prescribed me the 2% Nitro Glycerin creams for 2 years which did not work, I tried 2 variations due to terrible headaches from the first cream eventually leading to an allergic reaction down there which made everything much worse. Eventually after many years I got referred to a Colorectal Specialist who gave me Botox injections and a Fissurectomy (fissure scraping to remove scar tissue) last year. This procedure in my opinion was the worst pain I experienced with the whole ordeal, even worse than the fissure itself. Recovery was tough and I was taking max doses of Ibuprofen and Paracetamol just to get through the day and this lasts for 3-4 weeks. I would not recommend this as it did not solve my issue just provided relief for a few months. My next visit with the specialist ended up with me being offered a LIS (Lateral Internal Sphincterotomy) or another round of Botox and examination under anaesthesia. I chose the Botox again for a second time as I was so terrified of a more major surgery - especially reading horror stories online about cutting into the Sphincter muscle, even in this forum lol. This round went a lot easier for me as there was no scraping of the fissure. I was walking within a week but still needed a lot of painkillers during and after BM's. Again I had short relief as the botox slightly paralyses the spincter muscle to prevent the spasms i mentioned earlier, but ended up being referred back again due to re-opening the fissure. This leads up to where i am now and after finally choosing to settle for the LIS surgery which I had 1 week ago on Monday 17th Feb 2020. I read hundreds of horror stories from people here so was prepared for the worst - incontinence, terrible pains which lasts for weeks or months etc. My experience was honestly the opposite of everything I read online. I woke up that morning to toast at 6:45am as no food is allowed after 7:00, I also drank as much water as i could before 11:00 as no fluids are allowed past that time either. I arrived at the hospital very nervous at 12:30 and had all pre checks done. The surgeon talks you through the procedure of making a small slice to the left or right of the rectum, not actually inside it. They then under the skin through the incision remove part of the internal sphincter muscle. In my case they removed the rear or posterior portion of my sphincter which was heavily damaged from years of tearing. I eventually went in for the surgery at about 3:30 and woke up completely out of it due to the painkillers and anaesthesia a few hours later. The pain isn't bad at this point so once checked out you spend that night sleeping it off. Now don't get me wrong, the next 2 or 3 days are painful, especially when going to the bathroom. It hurt like a b***h but its more of a surgical pain than the fissure pain and spasms, I was and still am black and blue and swollen down there which is to be expected and the stitches are quite uncomfortable. But in my experience it is NOTHING compared to the pain of a fissure. you need to ensure you take the relevant laxatives they recommend, this is a huge point as you do NOT want to get constipated during recovery. I took 10ML of lactulose X4 times per day and X1 sachet of Fibregel on an evening. As I'm still in recovery I eat 4-5 tiny meals a day mostly greens and white meats, soft oats etc and a LOT of water to keep everything soft. I am now just over one week in, stitches are still there, i'm still black and blue from bruising, but my experience in general is very positive. I have taken 0 and I mean no pain killers of any sort during my recovery so far going from the day after my surgery until this very second. No paracetamol no ibuprofen nothing. I currently go to the bathroom 2 or 3 times every day now and its easier to pass stool every time, i don't get the spasms at all anymore. I still have a bit of anxiety regarding going but it gets easier with each day I experience less pain.

The pain I got from 2017 like glass cut every time I have BM and bleeding, I went to doctor and check to see if I have Spice but come out it is fissure and 2 skin tag.

Having bowel movements was like passing shreds of glass & the pain was so bad for hours afterwards. I would wake up the next day dreading the next bowel movement. I actually thought it was piles & didnt know what it was until after about 8 weeks. The doctor gave me the usual creams etc and it did seem to work for a few days but then would come back. I finally was able to somewhat control the pain but the fissure wasnt healing. After reading everything I could about it & peoples trials & errors I wanted to share with you what finally healed the fissure. Please note I have no medical experience and I am just sharing what worked for me.  First drink lots of water. I drink 12-14 8oz glasses everyday. I ensure I have fibre with all my meals. For 1 week I had a sitz bath with epsom salts in it & use to soak in it for 20 mins. At night before bedtime I took 30ml of Cremaffin stool softner for about 1 month. I know this is too long to be taken this as well as too much but this used to make bowel movements pain free. Afterwards I gradually reduced 5ml every 2 weeks. But what really healed the fissure itself was applying Sudocrem nappy rash cream. I applied it gently (with very short nails to make sure I didnt scratch myself further!!) just inside my anus as well as around the tag.  I read that zinc oxide would help it heal and remembered my sons Sudocrem.

For around a month I've been experiencing sharp, sudden chest pains or discomfort in the center or left side of my chest. It will sometimes come from physical activity or when I'm at rest. I have Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, which has one of the main causes of death in patients as a type of cardiac issue. However I have no family history of any heart disease. The pain has also come shooting down my left arm and hand, and sometimes I get sudden pain in my ankles. A few nights ago, I woke up from a deep sleep to my heart beat racing and pounding in my ears and chest. With the exception of that event, my usual blood pressure is normal or just above average, but not exceeding any higher whatsoever.  I am not quite sure how to deal with this currently, so I'd like to know if there are some things we couldn't rule out or pay more attention to.

Ive been referred to the Heart clinic at the Hospital where ive been before -  as had an Echo Heart test and 24 hour tape which both came back perfectly normal last year.

So as everyone knows had the botox and skin tag removal in October and still not healed. Was meant to have second botox in Feb but surgeon cancelled it as he saw a bit of progress. Is it as bad as before op? No Is it as bad as after op? No Do i have some good days? Yes But Can I get up as normal and have pain free bm? No Can I exercise? No Can I do my normal life? No Can I work as normal? No It obviously hasn't healed and I am still doing everything... Weird   cream, salt bath,  , other cream that is kept in fridge, fissure oil... All of it even witch Hazel wipes . The weird thing is is that where the skin tag was removed, that's the most painful bit (he said it was right by the fissure) it's like there's a tiny bit left and it gets inflamed and aggravated. To be honest I am thinking it won't even heal and this is for life. I get a couple of really good days in a row (the most is 4)and then it's back to the really bad pain for 2-3hours of the morning. Nothing triggers this - no I haven't had a difficult bm or got drunk or not had my fibre. I just have no idea, seems like I am healing then BAM Obviously I am 'lucky' in that I can get out and about the rest of day, but just not like i used too. As it's slightly better than before Christmas, does anyone think it is slightly healing? I guess I'm looking to see if anyone had healed could tell me if they thihk I am recovering? I think I am losing hope. I am so done with it. If this is my life for the rest of it... Well I don't know. I've also got a really bad back and coccyx from not being able to sit properly. That's really bad too but obviously the fissure way is just way more soul destroying. Hope to hear from someone soon xxxx and hope youre all safe 0 likes, 1 reply "

Thanks for the warm welcome. Please join me to celebrate my mum’s health. Losing loved ones from heart attacks can really be painful and devastating. “Gone-to-soon” becomes the tormenting wisper. It was almost impossible to believe that Dad was gone (10 years ago). Unhealthy habits had the best of him, which made Mum a widow at a young age and orphans of the kids. Dad was strong, hardly broke down but little did he know that his habits will terminate his dreams. Mum out of frustration would have died but in her state, I began  researching on ways aside medicine to combat this monster called “heart attack” till finally I came across this video :  Click the link above and you’ll land on a 5 second loading page , just click skip on the top right corner to continue, and you’ll land on a short Youtube Tutorial video, where it shows step-by-step on  what dietary habits to keep in preventing heart attacks. I wish Dad found this, but thank goodness I did and Mum isnt died rather she is hardy, healthier and happier, having applied what she learnt. Miss you, Dad. Love you so much. Again, you can watch the short Tutorial video here :  This may just be the key to save a loved one as it did my Mum. Hope it helps. Danny. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Let me start at the beginning: I'm 5'3"" and currently 170-ish pounds. My diet isn't as healthy as I want it to be and I don't exercise much aside from walking and riding my bike around. It started about a month ago, while I was working. I hadn't been getting good sleep because of work-related stress and anxiety, and as a result my energy levels would drop off randomly during the day and I'd feel off-balance and sluggish. One day it got to the point where I couldn't focus and I felt like I was going to pass out, along with what felt like muscle tension on the sides of my chest, under the armpit, as well as shoulder/neck tension and headaches. Fast-forward to a couple weeks ago and I keep having headaches along with sluggishness, and making frequent trips to the bathroom to calm down. Of course, searching my symptoms only made things worse for me. It got to the point where, on Thursday of this week I felt a painful jolt in my chest, right over my heart, which was preceded by what I thought was a heart attack. I was breathing quickly, I was cold and had chills, I was shaking, my muscles from my face and chest to my belly were tight and spasming. My heart rate was elevated and I wound up calling 911 because I thought it was a full-blown heart attack. Once at the hospital I had tests done, including an EKG, D-Dimer and the usual blood work along with an X-Ray. To my (brief) relief everything was in the clear, my heart is healthy and I am at little risk for a blood clot (D-Dimer level was at 450.) Now onto today: I want to believe that what I'm experiencing is work-related stress, but I still have a sore muscle on the far left side of my chest, just below the collar bone and close to my armpit, it itches when my clothes rub against it and I have headaches that won't go away, even when I'm not at work. Not only that but I feel split-second aches in parts of my body, especially in my left arm, my legs and the right side of my groin. I'm still experiencing headaches, tiredness and muscle aches on the left side of my body along with itching on the far left side of my chest, along with another feeling; something I can't describe. It happens for only a second but then I feel weird, like I break out in a cold sweat for a second and it feels like my heart is being squeezed for a split second, though I wouldn't know what that feels like. I've felt this after walking briskly. Part of me wants to believe that it's not heart-related or angina-related since I've been to the hospital, but there's a nagging feeling in the back of my head that I'm not in the clear. I need reassurances here: Could this be angina related or is it just stress/anxiety? I don't want to go to the hospital again nor do I want to die.

It started 2 yrs ago with episodes of a kind of vertigo feeling. Like a falling feeling. I also suffered with a discomfort just to the left of my spine near my shoulder blade that may or may not be related. I initially shrugged it off. It happened 5 or 6 times over a 6 week period then went away for a year. Then it returned with a vengence! the episodes now came with a horrible sense of doom along with pain in the tips of my shoulders, palpitations and chest pressure. I was sent to both cardiology and the musculoskeletal unit. Cardiology had me do an echo, ecg and stress test but found nothing. MSK did an MRI of my thoracic spine but found only moderate degenerative disc disease that they say is normal. MSK did an examination of my thoracic spine and found significant stiffness in the muscle that runs down the left of my thoracic spine. They gave me exersises to do and discharged me with a diagnosis of possible T4 syndrome.  By this time I began experiencing a deep aching in my back, chest, left neck, jaw and the left side of my face. This can come on at rest, last anything from 5 mins to 45 mins then go away as if nothing was wrong. i have experienced episodes of involuntary arm curling with the vertigo/doom episodes although this has only happened 3 or 4 times in 2 years and passed quite quickly. It had me feeling I was about to have a heart attack. I also began to experience a discomfort with my breathing. Feeling as though Im not getting a satisfying breath. This also comes and goes at random. I experience dizzy spells too. Over the last 12 months this has gotten worse. I was referred back to cardiology and fitted with a holter monitor (found nothing) They tested me for a pheochromocytoma (nothing) and finally a CT angiogram that showed no calcification and clear main arteries although they did say the smaller vessels could not be seen on the scan and that they couldnt rule out MVD or microvascular spasms. They discharged me with a note to my GP to try me on nitrates and calcium channel blockers to see if they improved my symptoms. My GP tried me on nitrates but they made me feel ill and I stopped them after a couple of weeks. My GP wont try me on CCBs because I am taking propanalol and says the two cannot be taken together. Since then Ive been left to suffer. No further investigations, no diagnosis and a worsening condition. In the last couple of weeks the weather has been really hot and I have noticed my symptoms are worse, difficulty getting a satisfying breath along with the usual angina type pain referal pattern. Now I also get a feeling of a knife between my shoulder blades that comes on, is really painful and then goes away in a couple of minutes.  I really dont know where to turn next. Ive also seen a Rhuematologist that said he could explain some of my symptoms but not all and questioned why I had never had a invasive angiogram. He also advised me to push for the CCBs. I have registered with a new GP but I havnt seen him yet. I have lost confidence in my old GP as I dont think she knows what to do. My blood tests show a raised lipid profile. Combined HDL LDL ratio of 6.1 but my Tryglycerides are at a massive 5.7 and I have been offered nothing to help it except ""change your diet""... I eat the odd take away like everyone else but i dont eat unhealthily at all. My Ferritin levels are at 700 but my C reactive proteins are normal indicating no inflammation and I am not anemic. My red blood cell count is slightly lower than it should be but apparently not enough to account for the breathing issue. I was also B12 deficient at 172.

For about 2 weeks, I have had the feeling of   almost daily. It's usually when I do anything that requires even minimal effort, such as walking for 5 minutes. Once the feeling shows up it can last for quite some time. I'm 26, female, never smoked cigarettes, thin (about 105 pounds) and I try to eat healthy although I do some unhealthy snacking here and there. My only risk factor is that I'm quite sedentary. I haven't exercised in years. As of right now, the only diagnosis I have is SVT, which I get horrible episodes of, maybe a few times per year. The feeling I get isn't really painful, it's more of a heaviness like something is on my chest compressing it. I also get this uncomfortable pressure in my back and down my left arm along with getting sweaty, nauseous and dizzy quite frequently. I went to the emergency room with this feeling twice this month. The first time they said my ekg and blood test is perfect, and sent me home with "" "". The second time I watched my ekg print out and at the top it said ""possible minor ischemia."" I questioned the doctor about it and he said ""the ekg isn't always right and there is nothing wrong with my heart."" Again I was sent home and told to follow up with my GP. I live in constant fear that I'm gonna just drop dead. The chest pressure and   makes me so worried I've been missing work and confined to my house.

My leg had been in a splint and I thought that my incisions were   because they were healing. However, when they took my splint off I realized that there was this clear mesh-like tape covering my stitches and on either side of the incision where that tape was touching my skin is what itched, NOT the actual incision. When that was all removed they placed steri strips (see picture) over my incisions and sent me home with a boot. The itching has not improved, and I am actually wondering if maybe my skin does not like the steri strips? I admit I have lightly itched through a sock because it is that bad. Did anyone else experience extreme itching? I have also been having clear discharge coming from the small holes left behind by the stitches. Is that normal?

You will find mixed results when searching the topic but there is plenty of research to suggest these pain killers can significantly delay bone healing.   Enough so that I was scared off and resorted to Tylenol despite my reservations about kidney and liver damage potential. At this point (6 weeks post op) Ive been completely off Tylenol and Norco for several weeks.   CBD oil has saved me at night when discomfort is the worst.

My doc wants me to progress from two to one crutch, and then without any at all over the next few weeks. I was surprised, because my surgery was 1 month ago, but he says that I have healed really well and he can barely see the fracture line.  The aircast splint allows me to put the bottom of my bare foot on the floor except where the fabric wraps around the arch; it has been too long! It feels very weird, as if my foot is having a hard time interpreting what it is feeling (I thought at first something wet was on the floor), but it is still amazing to feel the ground! I had ORIF surgery on March 5th after breaking my ankle and 5th metatarsal on Feb. 13th.   They had to repair the tip of my fibula that had broken off and was at an angle that would have made it highly unlikely to repair itself well if at all (""ugly"" and ""nasty"" were adjectives the doc used to describe my fracture). Despite my need for surgery to fix this, I have always had a stable ankle fracture which cut my time of NWB down significantly.  This is likely the reason why I have been able to progress this quickly. I am finally feeling like I am on the other side of this even though I still have healing to do.  I am so grateful to everyone that has been a part of my journey so far, because I don't think I could have kept my sanity without all of you.  Thank you so much!  Please know that I am here for all of you too.  And for those that come after us.  I am very grateful to those that have healed, but still take the time to reassure people like me when in the throes of it.  It is a sucky, scary, painful, uncomfortable, foreign experience made bearable by this forum and the people on my front lines.  I wish everyone quick healing, health and happiness.

I started taking Cortancyl (prednisone) 60 mg yesterday.  I can't remember what happened last time when my doctor prescribed it, how long it took for the inflammation (pain, stiffness and burning sensation in the sacroiliac joints, spine, hips...) to go away.  Does anyone have even a remote idea? Here's what triggered this episode: CHICORY. I started drinking it almost every day (I know, stupid) about two weeks ago. Apparently the inulin in it  doesn't feed only the good bacteria, but the ones that can trigger the inflammation as well. I started taking prednisone early this time. The last time the doctors didn't know what it was and it took them weeks to prescribe it. So I'm kind of hoping that it may work faster since the inflammation hasn't really worsened yet (I'm still cramp free!). Thank you! 0 likes, 5 replies "

The surgery went great and recovery though painful, was steady. I had post op check on 16th after which the doctor took out my stiches and put on permanent cast. Its been 15 days in permanent cast. The doctor said to have another visit after 4 weeks however, our nurse gave us appointment after 20 days. After thinking through I insisted the nurse to schedule appointment at the end of 4 weeks as I do not want to go back to permanent cast if the recovery is not where the doctor liked. Today is 31st, I am still 16 days away from my appointment. I am facing 3 issues: Has anyone faced it before? Does anyone have any suggestions? 0 likes, 5 replies "

It is swollen and “rusty”. Sometimes the pain wakes me up during the night. In the morning the pain and the sensation of stiffness are the strongest. It's starting to affect other fingers as well. This is surely exacerbated with any kind of work. But if I do not move, then the fingers get even stiffer. What worries me is the fact that now my middle finger of the left hand seems to be affected as well. I took prednisone which cleared out the back pain and my spine is straight again, thank God. But it did nothing for my hands. Here’s what I’ve been thinking about: Just before the flare up, I hurt my middle finger of the right hand twice. Nothing major. Could it be that this “injury” has provoked a chronic inflammation? Could it be that my body is mirroring the pain on its left side? I had an X-ray of my hands and everything seems to be in order, so I’m guessing that the problem is with the soft tissues. Has anybody ever hand anything similar? Is there a solution? Will it go away on its own? In truth, I think that it is getting worse. Thank you! 0 likes, 4 replies "

Day 1, my symptoms improved, but I was so ill, fatigued, heart was racing all night, kept waking myself up. I thought it was maybe the pneumonia, and kept taking pills. By Day 3, I suddenly noticed I had lost significant weight, and very quickly. That has never happened to me ever in my life, I normally have a difficult time losing weight. I went in to speak with my doctor. I asked for bloodwork (my anxiety convinced myself that something was seriously wrong, but came back clear). I was told I could either finish the dose, or start a new one for another week. I have a 9month old breastfed baby girl, and wanted to minimize her antibiotic exposure, and decided to tough it out. At this point I Googled Biaxin and realized that I am not alone! And has it ever been tough. I have been off of them since Thursday (3 days ago) and I still have zero appetite (I normally love food!), my sense of taste is affected, my milk supply is down, my feelings of anxiety are through the roof! I can't sleep, I wake myself up in the night, I'm worried about my girl not eating enough. My mind feels like it has gone through such a ringer. I feel like this drug has ruined my life. Please tell me it gets better! I have been taking probiotics and food throughout to no effect. Is it just going to take a while? 0 likes, 1 reply "

Long story short, I had to stop taking the Amitriptyline abruptly on Febuary 6th, 2019 because it caused my heart to go into V-Tach.  So i have been off the drug completely for 5 months.  I am STILL having withdrawl symptoms.  The brain zaps, dizziness, hot flashes, constant headaches, body aches, fatigued, no energy.  I am sleeping better now, but at first it was horrid.  maybe 4 hours a night tops.  sometimes only 1.

I was 25 male at the time. At the time I had a long mop, and I was just about to wash my hair because it was greasy and the light is less than a foot above my head in the bathroom mirror. I panicked I was using a 2 for 1 shampoo and conditioner conbination shampoo which I had used for years. But because I panicked I brought and tried many different shampoos I brought -A Caffeine shampoo that is meant to stop hairloss over a period of about 4-6 weeks I would wash my hair nearly everyday. I first used the thickening shampoo but did not see any difference so brought the caffeine shampoo, I used as the instructions said and would wash my hair nearly everyday. every time I used it, i would my scalp tingle like itwanted to be itched. but I ignored it. It also made my hair feel rough. I used it for about 2-3 weeks, The tingling would really peak if I was sweaty.  I ran my hand through my hair and noticed a lot of dandruff fall. I aksed my mum to look and said that looked like dandruff and some of my scalp looked red. I stopped using that everyday and started using an anti itch scalp shampoo until the redness had gone away. I also looked onlinewhat else could help so I brought and anti residue shampoo and used that. then used the anti itch shampoo after as that is what the instructions said. However, the shampoo did make my hair feel soft but it made the dandruff worse and the itchiness was bad as well. I used the anti itch shampoo for a few days a week and the caffeine shampoo the rest ofthe time. I decided to get haircut, I went from long mop to short mop with the idea to go shorter each haircut. i noticed around this point that my hair was getting greasy the day after washing so I was washing everyday still but was mainly using the anti itch shampoo. But was everyday In April I did not wash my hair for around 5-7 days as  I had nothing on and try to gain  a bit if balance back. I decided to wash my hair 3 times a week, Monday, wed and fridays, saturdays only if something was happening. My hair would get greasy so I guessed I had done some damage to it and brought a repair shampoo and conditioner with keratin in it and is smelt really nice. In May I started therapy for depression, something I have battled for years, the sessionswere on a Tuesday, and I did not want to risk having greasy hair going to see her so I swapped the days from  monday to Tuesday and then would wash my hair either wed or thursday. I would use the repair shampoo and conditioner on the Tuesday amd then just a shampoo inbetween then on the friday a little bit of anti residue shampoo and sometimes just shampoo sometime repairshampoo and conditioner. I did notice that after using the conditioner on the second day my hair did look dull and sort of greasy If I remember correctly I started to grow my hair out as well and just wash my hair on Tuesday and Fridays and if I was going out special. This continued through the summer months and then I swapped the shampoo and conditioner to a different one as I had ran out. I continued to just use the shampoo Tuesday and Fridays and use the conditioner on Tuesday and experimented when to use the conditioner and how. After I finished therapy in October, probably in November I ran out of the conditioner and just used the shampoo, I noticed depending on what I did my hair did not look as bad as if I had used the conditioner on the second day I would use a brush which I would try and clean every so often, but I think my brother was using it as well. I did not have a haircut from November ish to march as I was trying to grow my hair out. I ended up getting a bit fed up with the longer hair as it was not growing that much or appeared to be growing really slowly so in March I had it cut to a short mop. By the second day I have noticed my hair does look greasy. Probably from last year I would ""scrub"" on my scalp with my finger tips to try and clean it when I amusing the shampoo.

But was everyday In April I did not wash my hair for around 5-7 days as  I had nothing on and try to gain  a bit if balance back. I decided to wash my hair 3 times a week, Monday, wed and fridays, saturdays only if something was happening. My hair would get greasy so I guessed I had done some damage to it and brought a repair shampoo and conditioner with keratin in it and is smelt really nice. In May I started therapy for depression, something I have battled for years, the sessionswere on a Tuesday, and I did not want to risk having greasy hair going to see her so I swapped the days from  monday to Tuesday and then would wash my hair either wed or thursday.

I continued to just use the shampoo Tuesday and Fridays and use the conditioner on Tuesday and experimented when to use the conditioner and how.

I did not have a haircut from November ish to march as I was trying to grow my hair out. I ended up getting a bit fed up with the longer hair as it was not growing that much or appeared to be growing really slowly so in March I had it cut to a short mop. By the second day I have noticed my hair does look greasy. Probably from last year I would ""scrub"" on my scalp with my finger tips to try and clean it when I amusing the shampoo. Could I have been causing too much oil to be produced? I have also brought a comb I have stopped using a conditioner. I am washing 2-3 times a week I am using an anti dandruff shampoo called vosene medicated to help with the dandruff,  however I did always find that made my hair rough compared with the 2for1 shampoo think it was called wash&go but that couldve made my hair feel a bit better because it had conditioner in it as well What other options can I take to try and make my hair less greasy? and less ""dandruffy"" Could it just be that my hair is naturally greasy and needs more washing and that it is not as thick or as long as it once was it takes more washing?

I have severe fatigue, palpitations, blurred vision and bouts of depression, to name but a few symptoms. I have some anxiety too, which I think all the other symptoms cause. The mornings are the worst. When I get up I have a sore/numbness in my kidney area, and don't feel refreshed  at all. I had been seeing a doctor who I found through Thyroid UK, who treated me with Adrenavive  I as my saliva cortisol was flat lined. My Thyroid also showed a little low in his opinion, though the lab ranges said normal,  and he put me on Metavive II for that, plus some DHEA and Bio identical Progesterone. I felt better on this regime for 6 -7 months but then my symptoms started to come back.  I saw this doctor again and he thought I had done too much, and after a few weeks of rest would feel better again.  I  didn't improve. I adjusted my diet, took out all sugar and bad carbs and increased my vegetable intake.  When I also told my doctor that after being sick one late evening, the next day I felt do much better, had some of that long lost energy at last, but by the next day was back to square one. He ordered a comprehensive stool test, and I found I had a parasite in my intestines, which I have had treatment for, but still didnt feel better. I Had another cortisol saliva  test my level has lifted, but still not in the normal range a year later.  My blood glucose is a little high sometimes and showing as pre diabetic. My GP was no help at all and dismissed me. Both my GP and my Doctor have now retired, so am now with a new GP, and after I explained the above, has sent me for a basic blood test, and a chest x-ray, which will put me back to where I started 2 years ago. GP not interested in my private tests.  I havent been to work for 4 months now, and don't wont to lose my job, and need to find out what is making feel so bad with some urgency.

Im looking for some advice more than anything. for about 18months ive been having issues where i keep experiencing symptoms such as feeling very tired, weak, lethargic, sickness, shakes, headaches and palpitations. Anyway I was referred to ab endocrinologist and was asked to take a short synacthen test. This came back as abnormal with a result of 94... After speaking to the endocrinologist consultant she has said that i seem to be experiencing these symptoms due to High Cortisol levels. However not high enough to be anything serious. She hasnt prescribed me anything and hasnt really told me anything that will help. The only advice she could give me was to try some breathing exercises and also try taking up yoga. - also take up swimming. She wanted to discharge me and i asked her not to so ive got a telephone appointment in two months. anyway do you think the advice given to me is adequate? is there any supplements out there that could help me? is there any advice you could give me as i do experience most of these symptoms most days.

When i was discharged several days later this diagnosis was disputed. I still have issues of hypoglycemia, blurry vision and dizzy feeling. For the last few days i am also having skin issues, respiratory issues and mouth cavity inflammations - feels like my immune system isn’t working. My only guess is it could be adrenal insufficiency/fatigue but cannot get tested for it at present. Judging by what i have written below would you say my guess is likely to be correct. My background: - I used to never (EVER) become dizzy - I am (was prior to this) extremely active - Work all my waking hours (prior to this) - Considerable caffeine intake (been off for 7 weeks now) - Get approx. 8 hours of sleep per day - exercise 5-7 days a week (did prior to this) - Very skinny - Never had any blood sugar issues (prior to this) - For several months now i have been feeling very tired and had ‘’brain fog’’ Onset: About 5 weeks ago i started getting dizzy. It started very suddenly without a warning one midday - i turned my head aside and the room started spinning around. At the same time my vision got blurry and i felt like i am going to pass out. This was also accompanied by an extreme ‘’hot flash’’. This subsided in a matter of seconds but for the majority of the remainder of that day I felt like i was dying. Other symptoms also appeared: stomach and intestinal pain, nausea, bloating (upper intestines), trembling and joint pain and the feeling of a pounding heart. It was so bad i could barely sit. Towards the evening i got better and hungry as never before. It felt at first like some kind of poisoning (i did drink a stingy/hot tasting goat milk the day before). For the next week i was feeling better most of the time (though always tired) but i had milder recurrences of the initial episode once or twice a day. Each lasted from 30 minutes to 2 hours then subsided. On day 6 i was feeling almost completely well but on day 7 the milder recurrences of the initial episode returned. They continued for 7 more days. On day 15 (give or take a day) i felt good for the first 2 hours (after waking up) but then became very tired, nauseous and had stomach and intestinal pain. I couldn’t eat nor drink due to the nausea. As hours progressed my symptoms were getting increasingly worse. Eventually i got hot flashes again and sweat was literally dripping from me (but i had no fever). In mid afternoon i became so weak i couldn’t even sit anymore and was taken to ER. When i arrived there i was vomiting acid and bail. I was drifting in and out of sleep. My blood sugar was 2 and potassium level was slightly below minimum normal. The working diagnosis was ‘adrenal crisis’. They gave me an infusion of water, glucose and some chemical (i can’t remember the formula). Later they also added potassium. For the next 2 days i was predominantly sleeping and was on water and glucose infusions. On day 3 i was up, but my muscles were so weak i could barely even swallow. On day 4 i was out of the hospital but my muscles remained extremely weak for 5 more days. Result: Doctors checked my heart and also did an ultrasound of my stomach cavity and found nothing wrong. For some reason they ruled out adrenal insufficiency despite not having checked my hormone levels. The problem is that majority of the doctors do not officially recognise anything short of Addison's disease and since they found no physical defect of my adrenals they ruled out any insufficiency. Besides slightly low potassium i also had (likely still have) low creatinine. My dizziness and blurry vision episodes continued after getting home. Eventually I started measuring my blood sugar every 2 hours and found it gets very low if i do not eat every 3 hours. And this also coincided with my dizziness. Current status: I am constantly eating to keep my sugar up and this fixed my vertigo. However i still get poor/blurry vision from time to time and a weird sensation at the back of my head which feels like the room is about to start spinning again. I seem to get these when i work for a while but not after short term physical effort. I do not know why and it is freaking me out. I used to never be dizzy. The second issue is i have random short periods (a few minutes) of what i can only describe as ‘’emotional weakness’’. And the third is that i have a few bruises that are still green after 3 weeks. Lastly, the last couple of days different mild infections have been piling up. Thank you for any help 1 like, 12 replies "

Eventually i got hot flashes again and sweat was literally dripping from me (but i had no fever). In mid afternoon i became so weak i couldn’t even sit anymore and was taken to ER. When i arrived there i was vomiting acid and bail. I was drifting in and out of sleep. My blood sugar was 2 and potassium level was slightly below minimum normal. The working diagnosis was ‘adrenal crisis’. They gave me an infusion of water, glucose and some chemical (i can’t remember the formula). Later they also added potassium. For the next 2 days i was predominantly sleeping and was on water and glucose infusions. On day 3 i was up, but my muscles were so weak i could barely even swallow. On day 4 i was out of the hospital but my muscles remained extremely weak for 5 more days. Result: Doctors checked my heart and also did an ultrasound of my stomach cavity and found nothing wrong. For some reason they ruled out adrenal insufficiency despite not having checked my hormone levels. The problem is that majority of the doctors do not officially recognise anything short of Addison's disease and since they found no physical defect of my adrenals they ruled out any insufficiency. Besides slightly low potassium i also had (likely still have) low creatinine. My dizziness and blurry vision episodes continued after getting home. Eventually I started measuring my blood sugar every 2 hours and found it gets very low if i do not eat every 3 hours. And this also coincided with my dizziness. Current status: I am constantly eating to keep my sugar up and this fixed my vertigo. However i still get poor/blurry vision from time to time and a weird sensation at the back of my head which feels like the room is about to start spinning again. I seem to get these when i work for a while but not after short term physical effort. I do not know why and it is freaking me out. I used to never be dizzy. The second issue is i have random short periods (a few minutes) of what i can only describe as ‘’emotional weakness’’. And the third is that i have a few bruises that are still green after 3 weeks. Lastly, the last couple of days different mild infections have been piling up. Thank you for any help 1 like, 12 replies "

Yesterday i went into hospital to test for addisions disease  as i was reffered by my cardiologist he suspected due to all my symptoms . When i was injected with the ACTH hormone Within an hour I felt my symptoms improve dramatically, my muscle weakness, loss of balance, heart problrms, blood pressure etc  all improved. Told the doctor in the ward this stuff is helping me dramatically and for the first time after a very long time i have managed to find something that has improved my symtoms. As the test was specifically to rule out addisions and cortisol level were fine they could not prescribe me that or anything similar. is that right ? based on the fact they know i have been trying to find a problem and finally something has clearly  worked for me and was life changing. they said that is up to endocronolgy to do more tests so they said they will tell my GP and now i have to go  back from there. the foctor thrmselves could have reffered me there amd then or the very least fir another day. i dont think i had stressed enough how much it had helped me,  at this point that felt like a life saving drug  but i was sent home. I am finding it  difficult to walk and for  the first time in a long time i was able to walk normally. After researching i see that there is secondary adrenal insufficiency which matches exactly what i have i can not beleive it. just wanted some advice what should i do  could it be that, can my gp  prescribe me anything quickly or would i have now wait for a encrologist.  thanks 0 likes, 25 replies "

About 4 years ago, I started having weird medical symptoms which have since, gone basically unexplained. Please forgive me for the very long post. It all started out when one day, my appetite essentially disappeared. For about a week I had to force myself to eat. I went to the doctor who ran some tests and bloodwork and everything came back as “normal” and was told it was likely stress related. (Looking back, I had symptoms prior to this starting. A few times I would have early satiety and would be starving for dinner only to feel full after a few bites). Things sort of continued progressing from there. I started getting bad acid reflux all the time, my appetite never really returned and I started having issues where I was constantly constipated. I also had mucusy loose stools and at times still have oily stools. I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy which all came back as “normal” with the exception of acid reflux and was put on omeprozole which helped my acid reflux, but nothing else. Around this time, I also started getting benign fascinations in my legs after going for long walks or running (tested negative for ALS or MS) A few months later, I started having this full feeling in the upper right side of my abdomen, I got an ultrasound of my gallbladder which also came back negative for any issues. I started having issues belching because I had this fullness feeling. At times, I literally have to position my body so that I can burp. If I am slouching or not sitting straight, I can’t burp. Fast forward a few more months and I started having cognitive difficulties. Severe brain fog, concentration issues, sensitivity to bright lights, memory problems, etc... my fiancé literally gets mad at me because I am so forgetful now. I also seem to have issues with my balance. When I tilt my head back and look up, I start to get dizzy. I constantly feel fatigued, and irritable. My cognitive issues seem to have progressively gotten worse since they started with nothing really helping. A few months later, I was drinking with a few buddies and went to the bathroom, when I was peeing I noticed there was a little bit of pink in my urine. Went to my doctor the next day and was told it was “trace blood” and was nothing to worry about. Most recently within the last 12 months, I have noticed my resting heart rate is very low (low 40’s at times according to my Apple Watch and always in the 50’s otherwise) I do work out but am nowhere near an athlete. I don’t seem to have any difficulties getting my heart rate up in the gym and can run 2-3 miles at a time without issues. Went to my doctor and had an EKG done which showed everything as normal. I have also been getting light headed upon standing. This typically is noticed when I am eating a reduced calorie diet and exercising. It is also accompanied by a faster heart rate. I have also become very sensitive to cold which never used to happen to me. During the summer, I have to walk outside in the heat because I get too cold sitting in my office. Any ideas on what this could possibly be? My doctor has essentially written this all off as being in my head as all tests have come back as normal. However I can tell you something is absolutely wrong. 0 likes, 4 replies "

Naturally I took ibuprofen to reduce the pain, but the medication had an unusual effect -- itchy bumps that look like hives appeared on my elbows. The first time this happened was yesterday, but I didn't connect it to the ibuprofen so I wasn't concerned. Sure enough, the hives disappeared on their own within an hour. I took another dosage tonight and the hives appeared again. Then I realized the medication was probably causing them. I have never before had an adverse reaction to ibuprofen. Did I take too large a dosage? Was I not in enough pain to warrant medication? Should I be concerned? Thanks, Nathan 0 likes, 1 reply "

I had some blood tests done a few weeks ago and my doctor told me that the results came back with high allergy marker levels. He hasn't given me any advice however he has said that this does warrant further investigation, so has referred me to the relevant hospital department for further investigation. I can safely say that the results are probably due to one of 3 foods I have introduced in recent months, as all blood tests prior to this showed no allergy markers. These newly introduced foods contain nuts and dairy, and as such I have eliminated them from my diet, however I still have a sense of feeling constantly ill. What I would like to know is if anyone knows whether these suspect foods could cause a serious reaction such as anaphylactic shock or anything else. I'm keen on discovering the cause of these blood tests results, and in the past all these foods have done is make me feel more unwell than I normally do, so re-introducing the foods could help me discover the problem food. However I don't want to introduce these foods again if there is a chance something bad might happen. I'd be extremely grateful for any thoughts and comments anyone might have on this. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Hopefully someone can help me with allergy questions.  Even if it's just one person who can give me advice it would help so much. I'm actually a little scared worried at the moment because I rarely get allergies and something weird is happening. Okay so here goes. I'm a healthy female in my 30's. The only thing in my life that I'm aware of that I'm severely allergic to are cats.  Now here's how it all started. Yesterday I decided to cook ramen noodles. And also a family member had cooked some kind of fish earlier that day (looked like catfish but wasn't).  So I decided to cook my ramen noodles and put that cooked fish on top of my ramen.  I ate that meal around 1 PM and felt fine afterwards. Until night time when it was about 7 PM -8PM. I started to feel a tingly itch around my neck and upper shoulder. I had my laptop on as well (watching a TV show). It happened while I was sitting down watching the show on my laptop. The itch came out of no where and I knew the itch felt a little weird but at the same time I felt like it wasn't a big deal so I didn't think much of it. Then later I ate a cherry pie. Still I felt fine and didn't care to look in the mirror. But around 9-10Pm I started to notice it was really red and I could see ""welts"" or bumps raised on my skin around the neck and shoulder. I could also see the hives have also spread around my left boob (mostly under the boob) but it also had ""welts aka raised bumps"" there as well. And no where else on my body. Today (Jan/27/2020). I woke up and most of it was GONE. My skin was back to normal.  The only thing left was redness around my neck and shoulders but most of it was just clear. Same with my boob area all clear. Now later in the day which is today (Jan 27/2020)...I ate pistachios (I've eaten them numerous times in my life) and never had allergies from them. But I ate about 4 of them and started to get a huge bump (like a hives type bump) on the corner of my mouth. Then I applied Calamine lotion and it was gone (quickly). I had also eaten a small bag of Doritos today and the same thing happened. Except worse the bump was on my mouth and all over my forehead (looking life hives with welts). I eaten doritos all my life as well just like nuts and have never had this issue. Also I'm noticing the hives mostly break out when it turns into night time. Just like when it  all started yesterday. Anyone know what this could be? I've never had food allergies in my life and I'm in my 30's. But I guess it could be? I would also like to point out something that's outside the box. And it might sound very weird! But all this time that I had hives breaking out on my neck, shoulder, mouth, face. I had my LAPTOP ON....I've read stories of people getting hives from all kinds of things. Just read that a woman got hives because her body has an allergic reaction to the cold weather. Could it be that it's my laptop that's making me break out in hives? I know that sometimes my laptop makes me sneeze or itch around the nose in the past. Could be some kind of chemical fume coming out of my laptop...I'm not sure what they call it for laptops. Sometimes you can smell a certain scent from laptops. Mine is an old Dell at the moment. If anyone can help out with some advice, ideas of what this could be....I definitely would love the help. It's like one minute the hives appear, then they disappear...it's very on and off.

I don't really get any pain in my leg very often and its not noticeable if you look at the back of my leg. I can only feel it if I'm standing up straight or if I'm flexing my legs so I can't feel it if I'm sitting down or if I'm bending my legs. I've looked everywhere on Google and the only things that come up is Bakers cyst or a sarcoma and I know I don't have that because I have no swelling in my leg and its not big enough to see it. I haven't been to the doctors yet. I noticed it a few months ago so not entirely sure how long its actually been there.

","Hello everyone. I’m posting this on behalf of my girlfriend who is having an issue related to allergy whenever she is around me or my house. I know this is a bit of a wall of text but please keep reading, we can use all the help we can get at this point. Also I’m posting this with her consent.  We are in a long distance relationship. I live in Europe, she lives in Asia. This has been going on for the past 2 years now, and during that time we’ve visited each other 4 times, usually for several weeks. The first time I went to Asia we met up and for the about 2 weeks that we were together nothing was out of the ordinary, no allergic reaction whatsoever. The second time we met up she came to Europe, and that’s when problems started. After about a few days she started to develop an allergic reaction.   The itch was pretty much unbearable so we went to get some creams and medicine at the drug store.  I’m not sure what kind of cream that was, but the medicine was the antihistamine ‘’cetirizine’’. Also we got a kind of eye drops that provided only temporary relief.  All of these things had minimal effect as the rash continued throughout that visit. As soon as she left here, her symptoms gradually disappeared over the period of 1 to 2 weeks. We started thinking about what could be the cause. We thought it may have been my fabric softener or detergent, so from that point on I changed to exclusively 100% neutral allergen free detergent so that that could not be the cause on my next visit. The third time we met up I went to Asia. Apparently I was carrying the allergen again because after 1 or 2 days her symptoms started appearing again. By this time I had been washing with the allergen free detergent for 1 or 2 months. The symptoms were exactly the same as the last time, however of somewhat lesser degree, but still enough to be very uncomfortable. To take some measures I started washing with her soaps and shampoos, and to be sure I washed all of my clothing again with her detergent. Also I avoided using any deodorants and stuff like that, despite it being in the middle of a hot summer. Also I don’t use any hair gels. Again her symptoms went away about a week after I left. Sometime later I went to Asia again to visit. This visit was kind of bad in general as we got flu for different reasons. Despite that, her symptoms reoccurred again after a day or two,  to a similar lesser degree like last visit. She went to a doctor and got some different medicine for allergy that worked only somewhat. Again her symptoms went away about a week after I left. Recently she got a general allergy test for the most common allergies. The results only showed around 50% chance of allergy for dogs. She has frequent contact with a dog which give her no allergic reaction. Also a very small percentage of allergy to cats. I do have cats in the house, but actually her family house has also had a cat since she was younger. She has never gotten a reaction from that cat, and no reaction recently still. So unless Asian cats and European cats differ greatly in terms of the allergens they carry, that also seems an unlikely cause. The test also showed a very small percentage for allergy to molds and fungus. As far as I know I don’t have those around my house, and I don’t see how I could have carried a sufficient amount of that to Asia in my suitcase.  Molds also seem unlikely. The test shows she is not allergic to pollen and dust mites, unlike me. I’m allergic to dust mites myself. On the internet I’ve been reading up about allergies to a protein in semen that some people have. This also seems unlikely. For reasons we don’t really have oral or anal sex down below, with or without condom (which would also eliminate latex allergy). I can say semen has made contact with her mouth, but no allergic reaction has developed in or around her mouth which would make semen allergy unlikely. As far as she knows she’s never had any allergic reaction to any kind of food. I really hope the allergy is not the result of some sort of psychosomatic response. (perhaps in combination with some otherwise harmless allergen). I wouldn’t really know how we could deal with such an allergic response. Is there maybe something we overlooked? Some other possible causes that come to mind? She will be visiting again soon and I really hope we can prevent her allergies this time. Many thanks for all the help and advice you can provide. 1 like, 43 replies "

As far as I know I don’t have those around my house, and I don’t see how I could have carried a sufficient amount of that to Asia in my suitcase.  Molds also seem unlikely. The test shows she is not allergic to pollen and dust mites, unlike me. I’m allergic to dust mites myself. On the internet I’ve been reading up about allergies to a protein in semen that some people have. This also seems unlikely. For reasons we don’t really have oral or anal sex down below, with or without condom (which would also eliminate latex allergy). I can say semen has made contact with her mouth, but no allergic reaction has developed in or around her mouth which would make semen allergy unlikely. As far as she knows she’s never had any allergic reaction to any kind of food. I really hope the allergy is not the result of some sort of psychosomatic response. (perhaps in combination with some otherwise harmless allergen). I wouldn’t really know how we could deal with such an allergic response. Is there maybe something we overlooked? Some other possible causes that come to mind? She will be visiting again soon and I really hope we can prevent her allergies this time. Many thanks for all the help and advice you can provide. 1 like, 43 replies "

I was given pain killing drugs  and anitsickness via a drip. A further scan showed nothing, thank goodness. The next day I was  sent home  from the hospital with  a new prescription for Tramadol 50mg three times daily. During the first day after taking one pill, the pain went away. But I vomited and then had a job to stay awake. I thought it was because I was so tired from lack of sleep from the pain.  Eventually I realized I was not breathing properly which frightened the life out of me. Of course I stopped taking this medication. I think this medication should be banned I sort further treatment of Physiotherapy, a steroid injection and tried to walk twice a day with sticks.

I was recently at a party where I consumed alcohol. I don't remember  exactly how much I drank but it made  me forget minor details of the party. I maybe drank somewhere around 160ml of 40% vodka, around 3 or two 4% beers and a few sips of 40% rum in the course of somewhere between 3-5 hours, that's what I remember from that night. I stayed at the party host's house that night, no parent was home so we didn't get caught. I had fun, lots of it, I got to hang around with my friends do stupid teenager stuff with them, one of the best moments of my life. I could say I was maybe sligthly ''drunk'', I got a very strong buzz and everything was so funny and interesting for me, I felt like I was a big vibrating machine. I didn't throw up, because I read about irresponsible drinking days before the party, I decided that 2 drinks an hour would not make me throw up and it didn't. This was my first drinking experience and it felt good. I didn't have a hangover in the morning, my stomach felt weird a little but it wasn't the worst because I drank lots of water after each drink Now,I'm doing pretty great at school. I've got over the average grades for the last 6 and a half years, lots of friends and a good self-esteem. I'm planning on going to another party somewhere in December, where I will most likely drink again, nothing will stop me from going there so don't try to convince me. But a thing you can convince me with are the answers to these questions: How bad is drinking for teens really? How much of a problem is it for a teen to get drunk sometimes? How much of an impact would it make to my health if I attend a few more parties? I am very curios and a little worried to see the answers and to determine if I should stop drinking completely or drink a little sometimes. 0 likes, 5 replies "

Tomorrow I will be 17 months sober and whilst I am so so happy about this I really want to have a drink on Christmas Day.  It will just be the two of us this year and I would love to have a glass of Prosecco or something with my Xmas lunch. I think I know the answer already - 'No - don't do it' and deep down I know that I shouldn't even be thinking about it. But my question is has anyone (after drinking very heavily for years) managed to start drinking again sensibly  and be able to reach the point of knowing that one or two is enough and so stop?  Has anyone (I know we are all different) reached a 'balance' where they have found that they can cope with the odd drink and that it hasn't set them back to square one.  I am worried about testing myself as I'm not sure whether it's possible to do this and that my head will say 'Oh go on - another one won't hurt' and then disaster will happen.  It might also make me physically sick and maybe (hopefully) I'd actually hate the taste after so many  months of no alcohol?? I'd be interested to hear your thoughts and Happy Christmas to everyone and their families!! All the best. Claire xx 0 likes, 8 replies "

Let me tell you a little about myself... I'm  a two time combat (Marine) war veteran. I just turned 35 years old On Nov. 16th and been drinking too much almost everyday for the last 6 years. My daughter will be 6 yo on Dec. 29th and I remember starting drinking heavily right around the time she was born. I started with just drinking beer every night (6 to 8 beers)  starting around 5pm till about 10 pm. I wake up at 4am to be at work at 5am. The weekends I would buy a 750ml bottle of Jameson and that would last me every 2 days. The beers slowly started getting less and less and found myself just drinking whisky every night. Fast forward 6 years later now I easily drink a pint of whisky and a 6 pack of ipa every night. Longest I've stopped has been about 20 days and then back in this never ending process. Symptoms I notice is my legs feel shaky and hands are a little shaky nothing crazy. I went to the doctor last month and doctor said I have high blood pressure.  I did not tell her I drink that much..So taking some blood pressure medicine daily... I havent had a drink since 9pm last night and it is 1:50 pm now. I feel fine but like I said I have shaky legs and some stabbing pain in my kidney area once in a while. I guess I'm writing this to say ""I give up"" I'm tired and ready to move forward. I will not drink anything tonight and start this sobriety thing again. I'm just hoping it lasts longer than 20 days.... Wish me luck 2 likes, 14 replies "

On Saturday night I had a heavy night of drinking, I had a lot to drink but I felt fine all night and had an awesome time, I got to my friends house around 2 am and crashed out. The next day I woke up feeling terrible (Sunday morning) went to the bathroom and was almost sick a couple of times and then had bad  . After having the bad diarrhoeaI went back to bed and fell asleep again. Once I woke up I felt a lot better, I got up and got dressed and went to the bus stop and got a lift home. At this point it was around 2 pm and I was hungry so had some noodles. After having noodles I began to feel extremely sick and ended up going back to sleep. When I woke up I had this horrible numb feeling in my feet, it wasn't completely numb but the texture of rubbing my feet together felt very abnormal and like my sense of touch was delayed or dulled, I have only ever felt like this before after smoking weed but usually I'd just sleep that off and it would be gone so I tried sleeping again. When I got up it was gone and I felt a lot better so I walked around the house, got a drink etc then had a shower. It was only when I sat back down on my bed all hell broke loose, the feelings came back only this time it was much worse, I ended up almost having a panic attack but managed to calm myself down. I put it down to lack of sleep and went to bed at 9.30 and slept till 6.am where I woke up feeling the same weird sensations and panicking so I got up and demanded my mum to take me to a and e, we got there and they checked my blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen levels... All was normal so they put it down to anxiety and sent me home. I should also note that I have just restarted my antidepressants (Prozac) again and that's a week today so I don't know if it's the medication and alcohol mixed badly or not.... I, just terrified as these feelings won't go away, I just need some help and consolation from you guys. The feelings are in my face hands and feet, please help. -Ella 0 likes, 4 replies "

Usually have a couple to a few glasses of wine after work not every night but most. On weekends may switch to a few vodka cocktails. During this isolation I have drank consecutively like 4 days in a row in a binge last few weeks and last Tuesday I had a black formed  stool and ran straight to urgent care. They said I could possibly have   from alcohol so they gave me a prescription to control acid... Could also be ulcer worsened by alcohol.  No more black stool but they aren't 100% yet. Had a normal one last night but still a light brown yellowish. Scared as hell because Google shows yellow stool can be severe liver damage.  I also have   so I cannot stop googling. Spoke to my pcp he said to continue medication monitor it getting better. I won't be assured until normal medium brown color returns. Has anyone suffered from this.  Please I'm going crazy!

No idea what it could be from, but would definitely appreciate insight before I go to a dermatologist to see if this could spread throughout my head.

When I was young I had slick straight hair which shined and moved a lot. But I don't know why the texture has changed drastically over the years. I know puberty could change hair textures but mine has become completely different. The hair strands have become 'crinkled' and 'plasticy' and very unexplainably rough when dry or when im out in the sun. The hair tangles at very short lengths and I have tried everything from oiling to taking supplements for hair upto no avail. The problem first started at the crown of my head, where the texture became coarser than the rest of my head. soon enough it spread into all of my hair. I still have good strands left mixed here and there but I think the way my hair is changing I will lose them as well. Some hairs are crinkled only at the ends and have newer straighter growth. Its really weird. Dermatologists don't believe me when I say my hair has changed, they say thats just how my natural hair is. Both my parents have slick straight hair. I could comb my hair earlier but now its just a hard mass sitting on top of my hair that looks and feels unnatural. People call it pubes and the sad thing is that it really does look like pubes. Will my hair ever return back to what it was? For info I am an 18yo male and this problem showed up when I was like 14 or so. I had finer and smoother hair before. Both hairs are mine. The left one is so coarse and dry that it feels like I took it out from my crotch. Sorry for being so crass but my hair is making me sad. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I used to have thick hair and now it is very fine - I am extremely scared that soon it will become noticeable or that I will end up bold seeing on how long it has lasted thus far. I got really stressed over university work in October, and then had a house move so I'm guessing it correlates, especially as my GP visits and blood tests (came back clear) have ruled out other causes (interesting given that I have not had my period for more than 2 years as well). This situation feels impossible, even more so because my dandruff came back (before I used Head & Shoulders for them and it always calmed down the dandruff but with experimenting with hair loss shampoos it came back) and I feel horrible: the self-esteem is at an all time low and I have no motivation for anything anymore. I'm taking biotin / fish oil supplements, trying to use new techniques to liven up my dead hair and trying to remain optimistic and positive however that is proving extremely hard. I'm also trying to eat more as my diet before was around 1500 - 1800 on any given day with a lower BMI and cut out exercise to allow my body to maybe rest and heal itself. I looked at dermatologists or other clinics seeing as my GP effectively said to wait it out, but the prices for consultations are sky high! I'm scared to tie up my hair, wash it or brush it for fear of more falling out... the situation is also stressful for me as I am signed up to do a summer job abroad for three months and feel lost. ! 0 likes, 5 replies "

Protrusion/bulge and discoloration are signs of belly button hernia-- I didn't have either before the stabbing. I was in horrendously high, constant physical pain when that happened. Some 20 days later, surgery was done for a so-called ""belly button hernia"" though that might have been a lie. In the session when the ""belly button hernia"" surgical repair was done, the surgeon also corrected a painful LEFT groin hernia and a painless RIGHT groin hernia. Just a week or two after these surgeries were done in that 1 session a few years ago, I noticed a new problem: diastasis recti which is something that women can have from childbirth but this diastasis recti also can happen to men. In this awful, untreatable (with surgery, exercise and physical therapy) condition, the abdominal midline tissue - called the linea alba - which holds all left side abdominal muscles and all right side abdominal muscles together on that midline is forever damaged by being spread apart so that the guts easily push up against the skin in a large, ugly bulge whenever one lays down or get up from laying down. One then has to avoid lifting heavy objects, can never do abdominal exercises, and has to wear forever - even during sleep - an abdominal binder which is just a rectangle of material that wraps around the body keeping the guts somewhat in place. Along with that, I also have physical pain under the surgically altered belly button. You see, after those 3 surgeries done a few years ago, I was quite physically inactive so there was a slight annoyance and discomfort only caused by the simple tilting, bending, etc. that everyone does each day. But that slight physical pain, lower-level physical discomfort ended on 9 May 2019 when I started using only the treadmill and the elliptical at Planet Fitness. I didn't go crazy using those machines but, after only 5 visits to Planet Fitness, had to stop going on Fri. 17 May 2019 due to increasing physical pain under my former, nice-looking, trouble-free real belly button: the physical pain was so high and was nauseating, sickening for days after 17 May 2019-- it's settled down a bit since I'm not doing anything very physical. I figure that the motions I made on the elliptical must be twisting up or tugging on scar tissue beneath my former belly button. I might have mesh under my former belly button-- I don't know. Years ago I heard that castor oil packs can break up scar tissue even if internal in the abdomen. One puts the oil on flannel, puts the flannel piece on the painful area, then puts a plastic bag over the wet flannel, and finally puts a heating pad on the plastic bag. This has to be done I understand for quite some time over the days and weeks. Has anyone here done this for something like my belly button internal scars produced by the surgery of a few years ago? Does this actually work? I miss using the elliptical and therefore seek some kind of effective solution to this.   Thanks for your attention to this posting. 0 likes, 2 replies "

It got progressively worse until I was finally diagnosed at 26. I did a ton of research and started seeing two alternative doctors about it. The symptoms gradually disappeared, and I have been symptom free for about 6 months. Based on all my research, it seems like the underlying cause varies from person to person, but I will briefly summarize what I believe were contributing factors in my case.  1.) Uncomfortable sex and/or sexual abuse. There is evidence that sexual abuse can cause LS, although I'm not sure if it causes or exacerbates the problem. Either way, my symptoms got a lot worse when I was in a relationship with a man who I was not very attracted to. My only advice (really, whether you have LS or not) is to not have sex if you have symptoms, or if you simply do not want to. The friction physically damages the skin. 2.) Underlying inflammation, which can be caused by the following factors: a) infection. I had a bad one for a long time. At this point the LS symptoms were quite bad - lots of itching and pain, and shiny white patches. After getting a million tests done, I finally gave up on western doctors, went to see an alternative guy, and he gave me an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral herb (it was a strong herb). The symptoms started to clear up immediately, and I mean by the next day. I suspect it was a fungal infection because symptoms worsened several months earlier when I was on a round of antibiotics (antibiotics alone will kill the bacteria that keeps fungus and yeast at bay, permitting fungal overgrowth). Anyways, that helped, but the symptoms were still not completely gone. There were other contributing factors... b) Allergies. I got my alternative guy to test literally everything I ate on a regular basis, and it turned out I was sensitive or allergic to many foods. Dairy was the big  one, and when I cut it out, I noticed the symptoms mostly disappeared. At that point, I was sometimes asymptomatic but sometimes it still flared up a bit, which still drove me crazy, so I pressed on. c) Deficiencies. I had major deficiencies in iodine (this one was important.. I'll discuss it in my next point), vitamin E, zinc, vitamin B12, and I suspect several other things. I took supplements for a short period of time and majorly changed my diet. Now everything I eat is organic, and almost nothing is processed. I eat almost no restaurant food. Just a very natural diet - like how your grandmother would eat. It is a lot of work, but wow did it make a difference. The foods I noticed to be particularly helpful for LS are kale, swiss chard (both blanched to get rid of the oxalic acid), and bison/elk/organic beef. I also eat tons of yams and sweet potatoes. The pain and itching is completely gone. The only symptom I now have is mild follicalitis on one side which only comes up occasionally, and I'm not sure that is even related to the LS. 3.) One more thing. There seems to be a strong link between LS and hormones. As I said above, iodine was an important factor because I had subclinical hypothyroidism (this is very common). The problem is, when your thyroid gland isn't functioning properly, it throws your sex hormones out of whack. So if you are always tired and/or cold, then there is a good chance iodine supplementation might restore some hormonal balance. On top of the iodine, i also tried a couple herbs for hormone issues - black cohosh tea and raspberry leaf tea -  and found they both seemed to help with the LS and other symptoms I had. From all of this, if I could recommend anything, it would be this: first off, examine ALL your symptoms. Chances are, if there is something else going on, it is probably related and might give you a clue as to the underlying cause. Second, FIND AN ALTERNATIVE DOCTOR! The truth is, a western doctor cannot help you with this problem. I found that the naturopaths trained in North America were just as useless. The only two guys that I found who were able to help me had no formal credentials and practiced techniques that allowed them to 'get inside' my body and really figure out what was wrong. One did Muscle Response Testing and the other is simply able to 'feel' what is wrong when giving acupressure. Although these types of practitioners are less common in North America, I guarantee if you start asking around, you will find someone. If not, try going to some herb stores in your local Chinatown district, and they can often point you in the right direction.  I hope this helps! I was so hopeless when I first found out I had LS, but am now so happy I persevered in finding a solution. good luck to all who read this! 29 likes, 309 replies "

My only advice (really, whether you have LS or not) is to not have sex if you have symptoms, or if you simply do not want to. The friction physically damages the skin. 2.) Underlying inflammation, which can be caused by the following factors: a) infection. I had a bad one for a long time. At this point the LS symptoms were quite bad - lots of itching and pain, and shiny white patches. After getting a million tests done, I finally gave up on western doctors, went to see an alternative guy, and he gave me an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral herb (it was a strong herb). The symptoms started to clear up immediately, and I mean by the next day. I suspect it was a fungal infection because symptoms worsened several months earlier when I was on a round of antibiotics (antibiotics alone will kill the bacteria that keeps fungus and yeast at bay, permitting fungal overgrowth). Anyways, that helped, but the symptoms were still not completely gone. There were other contributing factors... b) Allergies. I got my alternative guy to test literally everything I ate on a regular basis, and it turned out I was sensitive or allergic to many foods. Dairy was the big  one, and when I cut it out, I noticed the symptoms mostly disappeared. At that point, I was sometimes asymptomatic but sometimes it still flared up a bit, which still drove me crazy, so I pressed on. c) Deficiencies. I had major deficiencies in iodine (this one was important.. I'll discuss it in my next point), vitamin E, zinc, vitamin B12, and I suspect several other things. I took supplements for a short period of time and majorly changed my diet. Now everything I eat is organic, and almost nothing is processed. I eat almost no restaurant food. Just a very natural diet - like how your grandmother would eat. It is a lot of work, but wow did it make a difference. The foods I noticed to be particularly helpful for LS are kale, swiss chard (both blanched to get rid of the oxalic acid), and bison/elk/organic beef. I also eat tons of yams and sweet potatoes. The pain and itching is completely gone. The only symptom I now have is mild follicalitis on one side which only comes up occasionally, and I'm not sure that is even related to the LS. 3.) One more thing. There seems to be a strong link between LS and hormones. As I said above, iodine was an important factor because I had subclinical hypothyroidism (this is very common). The problem is, when your thyroid gland isn't functioning properly, it throws your sex hormones out of whack. So if you are always tired and/or cold, then there is a good chance iodine supplementation might restore some hormonal balance. On top of the iodine, i also tried a couple herbs for hormone issues - black cohosh tea and raspberry leaf tea -  and found they both seemed to help with the LS and other symptoms I had. From all of this, if I could recommend anything, it would be this: first off, examine ALL your symptoms. Chances are, if there is something else going on, it is probably related and might give you a clue as to the underlying cause. Second, FIND AN ALTERNATIVE DOCTOR! The truth is, a western doctor cannot help you with this problem. I found that the naturopaths trained in North America were just as useless. The only two guys that I found who were able to help me had no formal credentials and practiced techniques that allowed them to 'get inside' my body and really figure out what was wrong. One did Muscle Response Testing and the other is simply able to 'feel' what is wrong when giving acupressure. Although these types of practitioners are less common in North America, I guarantee if you start asking around, you will find someone. If not, try going to some herb stores in your local Chinatown district, and they can often point you in the right direction.  I hope this helps! I was so hopeless when I first found out I had LS, but am now so happy I persevered in finding a solution. good luck to all who read this! 29 likes, 309 replies "

It got progressively worse until I was finally diagnosed at 26. I did a ton of research and started seeing two alternative doctors about it. The symptoms gradually disappeared, and I have been symptom free for about 6 months. Based on all my research, it seems like the underlying cause varies from person to person, but I will briefly summarize what I believe were contributing factors in my case.  1.) Uncomfortable sex and/or sexual abuse. There is evidence that sexual abuse can cause LS, although I'm not sure if it causes or exacerbates the problem. Either way, my symptoms got a lot worse when I was in a relationship with a man who I was not very attracted to. My only advice (really, whether you have LS or not) is to not have sex if you have symptoms, or if you simply do not want to. The friction physically damages the skin. 2.) Underlying inflammation, which can be caused by the following factors: a) infection. I had a bad one for a long time. At this point the LS symptoms were quite bad - lots of itching and pain, and shiny white patches. After getting a million tests done, I finally gave up on western doctors, went to see an alternative guy, and he gave me an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral herb (it was a strong herb). The symptoms started to clear up immediately, and I mean by the next day. I suspect it was a fungal infection because symptoms worsened several months earlier when I was on a round of antibiotics (antibiotics alone will kill the bacteria that keeps fungus and yeast at bay, permitting fungal overgrowth). Anyways, that helped, but the symptoms were still not completely gone. There were other contributing factors... b) Allergies. I got my alternative guy to test literally everything I ate on a regular basis, and it turned out I was sensitive or allergic to many foods. Dairy was the big  one, and when I cut it out, I noticed the symptoms mostly disappeared. At that point, I was sometimes asymptomatic but sometimes it still flared up a bit, which still drove me crazy, so I pressed on. c) Deficiencies. I had major deficiencies in iodine (this one was important.. I'll discuss it in my next point), vitamin E, zinc, vitamin B12, and I suspect several other things. I took supplements for a short period of time and majorly changed my diet. Now everything I eat is organic, and almost nothing is processed. I eat almost no restaurant food. Just a very natural diet - like how your grandmother would eat. It is a lot of work, but wow did it make a difference. The foods I noticed to be particularly helpful for LS are kale, swiss chard (both blanched to get rid of the oxalic acid), and bison/elk/organic beef. I also eat tons of yams and sweet potatoes. The pain and itching is completely gone. The only symptom I now have is mild follicalitis on one side which only comes up occasionally, and I'm not sure that is even related to the LS. 3.) One more thing. There seems to be a strong link between LS and hormones. As I said above, iodine was an important factor because I had subclinical hypothyroidism (this is very common). The problem is, when your thyroid gland isn't functioning properly, it throws your sex hormones out of whack. So if you are always tired and/or cold, then there is a good chance iodine supplementation might restore some hormonal balance. On top of the iodine, i also tried a couple herbs for hormone issues - black cohosh tea and raspberry leaf tea -  and found they both seemed to help with the LS and other symptoms I had. From all of this, if I could recommend anything, it would be this: first off, examine ALL your symptoms. Chances are, if there is something else going on, it is probably related and might give you a clue as to the underlying cause. Second, FIND AN ALTERNATIVE DOCTOR! The truth is, a western doctor cannot help you with this problem. I found that the naturopaths trained in North America were just as useless. The only two guys that I found who were able to help me had no formal credentials and practiced techniques that allowed them to 'get inside' my body and really figure out what was wrong.

Nasty sickness 6-10 days a month, every month. My family doctor told me it may be due to a weak immune system so I started taking these Elderberry, Echinacea, and Vitamin C gummy supplements. Almost immediately I stopped being sick. No more sinusitis symptoms. I felt normal. Due to the high cost, I switched over to a different brand whose nutrition label was exactly the same except for a little bit of sodium. Now, I'm sick again. All my symptoms are coming back and I feel horrible. It has been weeks and I am seeing no improvement so I was wondering if my body has become ""resistant"" to these combination of supplements. Is that even possible? Maybe the nutrition label on this new brand is a lie. The facility/company isn't FDA registered so it could be a sham. I got both from Amazon. And I highly doubt it's a placebo effect. I literally go through a box of tissues a day now. I'm thinking of switching back to the previous brand to see if that helps. **I know there could be other problems to my sinusitis but I really just want to know  . Thanks! 0 likes, 3 replies "

You don't need to p...","VINEGAR, VINEGAR AND MORE VINEGAR!!! You don't need to pay money to get rid of these things!! Listen up people, if you want to see quicker results just use vinegar to get rid of your awful warts or veruca/s!! Get either white wine vinear or apple cider vinegar, cotton wool balls and some duck tape. Break the cotton wool into smaller pieces (slightly larger than the veruca or wart itself) Soak these cotton wool pieces in vinegar and place directly over the veruca/s. Secure in place over night with plenty of duck tape. Do this every night. In the morning, remove the tape and shower as usual. Let the area dry up during the day and leave alone. After only a few days you will feel slight tenderness in the veruca area and you will notice that it changes colour, becoming darker. I think that this is because the veruca has absorbed the vinegar and the flesh is decaying and drying up. This is the only thing that has helped me with mine. Don't waste money on over the counter products-its a waste!! Don't have them cut out or frozen or lazered-off until youhave tried this for at least 2 weeks. I'm pretty sure this will be the most effective thing you've tried! And easy and natural and cheap. Try it!! Good luck!!! xoxox  :ok: 14 likes, 495 replies "

Dr. Pimentel who has come up with the theory about SIBO is the cause makes me think that he is correct, this is the only one doctor that had a clue. Now for the Treatment that I used daily : From 10 gram to 30 grams of L-Glutamine, to repair the damaged intestinal mucosa and lining. Repairing this will block big food particles from entering the blood stream directly due to the holes in the intestinal lining cause by the bad bacteria.  12 billion Probiotic daily at least, start by using the 50 billion probiotic and then after seeing results you may try to decrease to cheaper probiotics, but don´t go below 10 billion. Using the SIBO treatment first if desired: Use Xifaxan ( Rifaximin) antibiotic to wipe out the bad bacteria but this will also wipe out the good bacteria ( check for Dr. Pimentel’s SIBO treatment). While you are doing this, I advise you to take probiotics daily to compensate the bacterial slaughter in the intestines. You can also start L-Glutamine ate the same time to repair the intestinal mucosa and Lining. After the Xifaxan Treatment, keep on taking the heavy duty 50 billion probiotic daily and glutamine. After getting better, you may try to change the dosages of L-Glutamine and Probiotics and see how you adapt to lower dosages to try to save money. Since many if not all IBS people are prone to getting E.Coli overgrowth again, you will have to keep on taking L-Glutamine and Probiotics for the rest of your life. I am on this treatment for 1 year and now I eat Pizza, Junk food, Spicy food, drink sodas and Coca-Colas and am totally normal as I was before. I will not say I am cured because it must be an auto-immune disease, but you may keep it in check and be 100% normal by just taking this for the rest of you days ( L-Glutamine and Probiotics). I have tried previously all know medications for IBS, Antidepressants, anxiolytics , antispasmodics, tried acupuncture, etc. and I was only 30% better, because this medicines do not fix the problem, the just drug your gut to numbness… This treatment will take around 6 months to reach 100% improvement, but you will notice improvements after 2 months, so be patient.

So I thought I would write my story once I am cured. Here it is. If you have cured yourself from gastritis too, please share your experience below as well. Many people ask how long it takes to be cured. At first I started on dexilant for a month but I did not see any improvement. After a month I kept taking dexilant and I started the low acid diet in parallel. I got much better in 2-3 days. After two months on dexilant and one month on the diet, I felt completely good. Then I stopped the dexilant cold turkey and got a lot of pain and acidity back in my stomach. Now I regret I did not take the dexilant a little longer as my stomach was obviously not healed and not strong enough to go through the rebound effect of stopping dexilant. I regret also that I did not stop dexilant slowly taking it every other day for a week, then every three days for a week, .... I felt anxious about taking a medication that has so many side effects taken long term and I wanted to stop immediately, which was not reasonable. Anyway there I was back at the beginning with stomach pain and acidity day and night. I felt pain related to the esophagitis as well which really scared me. I hesitated to take dexilant again but I decided to try to cure myself the natural way. Below I describe what I did. I got cured in approximately two months, getting slowly better week by week. After two months of natural cures I had no stomach pain anymore and no excess acid, I was able to sleep again, felt like a new healthy (and lighter -- I lost a few pounds) person. However after those two months, I felt that I needed to follow the diet another month for my stomach to get strong and be able to handle a less strict diet. Most of what I did is summarized in two books which I found very useful: The first book is ""Dropping acid: the reflux diet cookbook & cure"" by Jamie Koufman.  This is the book I based my diet on. The only disagreements I have with the author regard dairy products that I stopped taking as they make the stomach produce more acid (very clear for me), and the use of ginger, manukka honey and aloe vera which I find too irritating and/or acidic (and I don't feel that they help). Also she does not talk about salt which is known to be irritating for the stomach lining in excess, I felt an improvement when I lowered my intake in salt. I will explain the diet more in details below.      The other book is ""Ulcer free! Nature's safe & effective remedy for ulcers"" by G. Halpern. I know you may have gastritis and no ulcers but the two conditions are related and what cures one usually cures the other too. I used some of the natural supplements recommended in this book. In particular slippery elm (this one is actually not mentioned in the book) and DGL licorice for stomach pain (coat the interior of the stomach lining), Zinc-Carnosine (reduce inflammation and protects stomach lining - I felt a great improvement after starting to take it especially with acid production at night), and cabbage juice (finished my recovery with this one, after two days I had no stomach pain anymore at night). I describe the supplements more below.     Mastic gum hurts my stomach. It is supposedly helpful against H. Pylori which I knew I did not have (I had been tested).     Prelief removes the acid in food and stomach very efficiently but causes constipation.     Tums works well for 45 minutes but then there is a rebound effect with the stomach producing more acid.     Manukka honey hurts my stomach (Too acidic, Ph level 4, but maybe also because of the tea tree essential oil in it). It is supposedly helpful against H. Pylori.     Aloe Vera is too acidic (around Ph level 4), and I don't feel it is doing anything positive.     Ginger is irritating and I don't feel it is doing anything positive.     Probiotics helps with digestion but not really for the stomach.     Zantac works very well at removing the acidity but makes me feel dizzy and incredibly tired.     PPI worked very well at removing the acidity and pain in my stomach while I was taking it while doing the diet, but I had a bad rebound effect when I stopped (one must stop slowly by taking it every other day for a while). Also having too low acid in the stomach because of PPI might cause problems in the long term (problems with Calcium and B12 absorption, bacterial infection more likely). 35 likes, 2998 replies "

ALMOST CURED!","Hello ALL! PLEASE CONTINUE READING IF YOU WANT TO STOP YOUR lichen sclerosus... So I have posted on here before, hectic flare up/ anal fissure/ uti you name it and have had lichen sclerosus for about 8-9 motnhs now. This being the worst month of my life, I got a biopsy in feb came back neg for cancer and was perscribed Celestone a steroid to put on which made it so so much worse and progressed my disease. Then I got an anal fissure from the lichen (HELL). Anyways went to a new gyno and he couldnt do a biopsy cause it was too enflamed and gave me advantan fatty cream to try and said to stop steroids. THEN I finally decided to go to a Chinese Medicine Doctor in Sydney to try my luck as I was becoming desperate and feared I would never be able to have sex again with my amazing boyfriend of 2 years (I am 24). LONG STORY SHORT he had never heard of lichen sclerosus and did the standard chinese logical medicine exam (tounge, pulse, thyroid ect) turns out, my immune system was not functioning properly and my hormones were out of wack thus causing everything else in my body to be weak and allow for viruses and chronic diseases to attack my body very easily. He said my circulation was horrible and my digestion was not ideal for the nutrients were not being distributed throughout my body (I am so healthy its rediculous so I found this quite a shock!!)  Anyways, had two 'treatments' with him and he said to STOP using anything western medicine gives me aka steroids and antibiotics. NO NO NO these are your worst enemy. Westen medicine is taught to treat what is enflamed, not the REASON why it is enflamed. He said one set of antibiotics can ruin your whole body system. So he gave me a cream that has chinese symbols all over it to apply to my lichen sclerosus, and brain/circulation herbs & toxic removal herbs at night & hormone balancing herbs to treat my immune system and get my balance back. He said if I get my blood count (white) back up and get my body balance back my lichen will simply ""dissapear"" I was hesitant of course to stop my gyno's orders and ditch the steroids for good, yes it was frightening, do I trust a little chinese man in a dingy shop who has reputable reviews of natural cures world wide? I chose YES. and for the past 9 days I have only been using the chinese herbs and the creams and limiting my gluten/sugar to help the toxins get out of my body. AND I sit here now. I have no itching, I have no pain, I can ride my bike, I went on a RUN today, I had sex again! I feel amazing and I feel mentally how I did about 3 years ago (NOT STRESSED AND ANXIETY FILLED) It is still not COMPLETELY healed but I am getting CLOSE GUYS. This is insane. My skin down there is becoming revujanated. I am never putting steroids down there again!!!!! Remember, if steroids have been helping you, they are simpoly treating the symptoms NOT the disease which I know will 100% claim is an autoimmune problem mixed with hormone imbalances and stress. So guys please try a naturopath, I know its hard. But I am getting better everyday and at this rate (I know everyone is different) but I rekon I could completely rid myself of this horrible disease FOREVER. Inbox me if you would like more details. I AM SO SO HAPPY and just want everyone with this horrible disease to have hope that YOU CAN GET RID OF IT! And of course I still use chinese medicine with the ""oversee-ing"" of a gyno but I choose to use natural NOT steroids that are going to make me have further complications later in life.  Other things to help all you ladies: MANUKA HONEY- USE IT ON YOUR FLARE UPS (I use +20 grade for extra strength) Do not use any other honey for wounds or medical purposes as it will be GRADE A and will cause further harm. EMU OIL- MOISTURIZER YES. Important to note that emu oil alone WILL NOT cure or reverse lichen sclerosus but will be an amazing natural moisturizer. COCONUT OIL- use it on your genitals. you will have a young vagina forever. Drink/ eat 2-4 tablespoons a day you will surprise yourself it is a natural viral stopper for the body. make sure it is EXTRA VIRGIN and organic. VASELINE- protector from peeing (if have flare up) and helps stop the vaguna opening from getting tighter (THIS WORKS) I apply every day now and can also be a lube! RASBERRY LEAF TEA- YOUR LIFESAVER. Drink this stuff everyday. It tones the uterus linning and is AMAZING for your digestive system, it also gets your hormone levels back to normal in about 5 days of drinking 2-3 cups a day.  There are more natural remidies which have been mentioned on this site, but in general you guys need to make sure you get heaps of sleep or your body will never recover. ALSO I only wash with emuaid Soap in the shower (bum/vag) and it is the only thing that doesn't sting for me (I have tried everything). I HOPE this helps you guys. I will chekc back in, in another week to let you know If I am actually cured, but at this rate I believe it will be. My bits down there have never looked this good, white almost gone, wounds almost completely gone!! (had sores for 4-5 months at a time) and my pink color is coming back! My swelling is completely GONE!!! My chinese doctor said I have decreased the swelling by 68% in 5 days. I am just so excited. Stay hopefull guys xxx Dsauce 36 likes, 197 replies "

So over the past few months, my mom's short term memory has gotten worse. She forgets that she told me or someone in my family something already earlier in the day or the day before, she'll notice something new like one of her plants growing a new flower then the next day, notice it again and not remember noticing it yesterday, she forgets words sometimes as well. She sometimes gets weird mood swings out of nowhere and gets angry or upset over small things. She gets very tired even though she gets a full night of sleep too. I'm not sure if that has anything to do with Alzheimer's. She just turned 50 so I know it's not common for her age and she just started menopause around the time of these symptoms, which could very likely (and hopefully) explain all of her symptoms, but she's so different now from how she used to be. Sometimes she'll forget something and it scares me how simple or common the thing she forgot was and it just worries me. I'm afraid to even bring it up to her because I know she would dismiss it and get upset that I would even consider it a possibility, but if she does have early onset, I'd want her to get treatment as soon as possible. How do I bring it up to her gently that I want her to get tested?  1 like, 5 replies "

The blisters have formed almost everywhere imaginable minus a few spots on her back and lower legs . We thank God for that and for her faith in Christ. I'm wondering how long does the prednisone take to actually do something to the blisters . Any advice would be more than helpful. She's on day 7 and they seem to keep spreading. I have been praying and begging God for mercy and grace. I believe He is able. I'm hoping her healing comes sooner than later as I am not wanting her to breakdown spiritually. Her faith is strong but even for the strongest person it's a lot. Any suggestions advice would really help. Please also tell me what the remission phase is like.

We did everything we could to avoid her going into a home but 1 year ago it was evident that she needed 24 hour care. From there, she deteriorated quickly and one month ago became her bound. 2 weeks ago she lost large amounts of weight and on Thursday, doctors declared her “end of life”. From that moment myself and other family members never left her bed side. We did everything to make her comfortable and family came to say their goodbyes. As the days passed, she became completely unresponsive. Her breathing was rattly, and her feet and legs began to mottle. By the last day she dedicated herself various times and her breathing became really shallow. The mottled skin travelled up her body and my Sunday evening, it had reached her face. We knew we were at the end. Her breathing became lighter and irregular and eventually she took her last breath. I will always be “glad” I could hold her hand till the very end, but watching her die has left me somewhat traumatised. It was peaceful or dignified. It was like a watching a fish that had been taken out of water. Watching her body die and her gasping for breath is all I see in my mind. The carers said she wasn’t in pain, but I feel traumatised by it all. I can only take comfort that she is no longer suffering. Has anyone got any advice on how to cope with this part of the grief??

He used to use computers in his work.  He's aware something is wrong, but tends to blame the computer.  I'm worried it's a sign of dementia or Alzeimers. I'm realizing, as well,  he's not taking things in that he watches on TV , and his memory is awful.  He needs to repeat with me plans for things we are going to do. It's difficult to be sure what's happening because he's always had a bad memory and been unreliable. I know he is worried about this. He says his confidence is low because he keeps making mistakes,  but he puts it down to old age. It's such a sensitive subject, but should I be trying to get him to have some tests?

Friday night after getting his 50mg dose in the evening, around 4am he started pounding on our bedroom door, yelling and screaming, and attacked me - hit me (though not very effectively) with a metal basket, deeply scratched/gouged my arm with his nails, and left a few bruises. When he got up the next morning I was sure to give him 25mg with breakfast to try to keep him calm throughout the day as it seems like he's been waking up with hallucinations and paranoia, vs. his usual sundowning. He was still agitated and threatening by that afternoon and we had to give him 75mg in the evening to get him to calm down. This morning I had to hide his 25mg seroquel in his cereal because he was so suspicious and paranoid of me. 0 likes, 1 reply "

This also complicated by other medications taken.....? I think there are 2 groups of side effects .. 1. Primarily due to the drug in the system .. like the mental issues .. brain fog .. memory ... depression .. feelings of doom ...nauseous.. inability to think ... and 2 . Secondary due to the effects of the calcium mechanism altered by the drug itself ..possibly the aches .. pains ... joints.. leg swells.. etc etc etc....more physical stuff.. When Am is stopped ... based on the half like calculations.. it takes approx 12 days to clear the system... mainly most sufferers report an easing of the mental issues ....see a relief of the brain fog etc etc .

For a very long time, I had been suffering from a lot of intense aches and pains in my joints and muscles and was not able to get any proper diagnosis for it. I was beginning to very worried that I had some serious illness like cancer. Thanks to the posts in this site, I was able to pinpoint amlodipine as the source of my misery. I shall try to put as much details as I can regarding my own experience in journal form, in case it becomes helpful to others. Background: I am male, 40yrs old, former competitive swimmer and in good shape (apart from the hypertension which is genetic). I was placed on 5mg amlodipine after being diagnosed with hypertension 6 years ago. 5mg seemed to work fine with no side effects. In July 2016, I went to our local clinic due to a serious case of the flu. The GP on duty was not happy with my 130/90 and said that I should increase my dosage to 10mg. Thinking nothing of it, I complied but did not consult with my specialist. In hindsight, this is when my symptoms started to appear. Symptoms: It first started with muscle pain in my left forearm and joint pain in my left shoulder. I assumed that this was due to carrying my newborn baby in the same position for hours on end. These disappeared but then I suddenly started suffering pain in my hands and feet as if someone had taken a hammer to them. I felt like my bones were crushed. In December, pain in my knees and elbows followed. My knees felt swollen at the back while my elbows felt as if there was constant pressure on my funny bone. There wasn’t any actual swelling or inflammation, just the sensation of pain really. I then started to have muscle spasms at the beginning of this year. The spasms and twitching were almost constant at night. How amlodipine became a suspect: After researching everything from arthritis to cancer, I stumbled across this site and the symptoms posted seemed similar. So I figured, what the heck! Let’s give this a shot. So on 29-Jan, I decided not to take my medication and felt some relief almost immediately. My “recovery” is detailed in the journal below: Day 1 – 0mg. By the end of the day, muscle spasms stopped completely. Have not had any ever since. This was my first clue that amlodipine may be the culprit. Pain in my right knee completely disappeared with pain in my elbows and left knee lessening and not constant. Day 2 – 2.5mg – Afraid of rebound hypertension, I decided to still take 2.5mg. Pain in right elbow, completely gone. Less pain in left knee and elbow. Developed slight occasional shoulder pain though. Pain in right thumb and toes. Day 3 – 2.5mg – No more knee and right elbow pain. Though pain in left elbow remains but significantly less. Foot and toe pain greatly reduced. Day 4 – 5mg – Started getting a headache and uncomfortable feeling in left arm so I thought I could be getting hypertension again so decided to take 5mg. Slight pain in left index finger and right thumb. Slight occasional shoulder pain. Joints in elbows, shoulders, knees and ankles started popping and clicking. Day 5 – Back to 2.5mg – No more pain in elbows and knees. However, shoulder pain increased and developed lower back and hip pain. This was after I took the 2.5mg at mid-day. Also developed a stomach upset about ten minutes after taking it. Day 6 – 2.5mg – No knee and elbow pain. No pain in fingers and toes but have feeling of stiffness. Joints still popping and clicking.  Shoulder pain increased. Felt like stabbing pain. Something new is that the front of my neck felt sore and muscles felt swollen. Day 7 – 0mg Since it was the weekend and expected less stress, I decided to try and not take amlodipine. No pain in major joints. Neck and shoulders felt stiff and sensation of neck swelling still there but not constant. Day 8 – Still 0mg – Felt almost normal. Neck soreness was there upon waking but became negligible towards the afternoon. Day 9 (today) – Pain free!!!! Still some tightness in the neck from time to time but nothing like it was in the past days. In fact, it is non-existent as I type this. Observations – Symptoms seem to get worse before they get better for each joint. Improvement also seemed to start from the bottom and progress upwards with pain in the upper joint getting worse or appearing just as the bottom joint was feeling better. Example, as my knees were getting better, my left elbow pain got worse; and as my elbows were getting better, I started to develop pain in the shoulders and neck which I did not have previously. Conclusion – I am not sure if I shall be getting off amlodipine completely. I actually plan to take 2.5mg again for a few days and work my way back to my normal 5mg dosage. I did not have any side effects then. I do plan to go back to my specialist but he only comes in on weekdays and it is a problem for me to get time off from work.   Again, apologies for the length of this post but I do hope that it is able to help someone.  6 likes, 79 replies "

For a very long time, I had been suffering from a lot of intense aches and pains in my joints and muscles and was not able to get any proper diagnosis for it. I was beginning to very worried that I had some serious illness like cancer. Thanks to the posts in this site, I was able to pinpoint amlodipine as the source of my misery. I shall try to put as much details as I can regarding my own experience in journal form, in case it becomes helpful to others. Background: I am male, 40yrs old, former competitive swimmer and in good shape (apart from the hypertension which is genetic). I was placed on 5mg amlodipine after being diagnosed with hypertension 6 years ago. 5mg seemed to work fine with no side effects. In July 2016, I went to our local clinic due to a serious case of the flu. The GP on duty was not happy with my 130/90 and said that I should increase my dosage to 10mg. Thinking nothing of it, I complied but did not consult with my specialist. In hindsight, this is when my symptoms started to appear. Symptoms: It first started with muscle pain in my left forearm and joint pain in my left shoulder. I assumed that this was due to carrying my newborn baby in the same position for hours on end. These disappeared but then I suddenly started suffering pain in my hands and feet as if someone had taken a hammer to them. I felt like my bones were crushed. In December, pain in my knees and elbows followed. My knees felt swollen at the back while my elbows felt as if there was constant pressure on my funny bone. There wasn’t any actual swelling or inflammation, just the sensation of pain really. I then started to have muscle spasms at the beginning of this year. The spasms and twitching were almost constant at night. How amlodipine became a suspect: After researching everything from arthritis to cancer, I stumbled across this site and the symptoms posted seemed similar. So I figured, what the heck! Let’s give this a shot. So on 29-Jan, I decided not to take my medication and felt some relief almost immediately. My “recovery” is detailed in the journal below: Day 1 – 0mg. By the end of the day, muscle spasms stopped completely. Have not had any ever since. This was my first clue that amlodipine may be the culprit. Pain in my right knee completely disappeared with pain in my elbows and left knee lessening and not constant. Day 2 – 2.5mg – Afraid of rebound hypertension, I decided to still take 2.5mg. Pain in right elbow, completely gone. Less pain in left knee and elbow. Developed slight occasional shoulder pain though. Pain in right thumb and toes. Day 3 – 2.5mg – No more knee and right elbow pain. Though pain in left elbow remains but significantly less. Foot and toe pain greatly reduced. Day 4 – 5mg – Started getting a headache and uncomfortable feeling in left arm so I thought I could be getting hypertension again so decided to take 5mg. Slight pain in left index finger and right thumb. Slight occasional shoulder pain. Joints in elbows, shoulders, knees and ankles started popping and clicking. Day 5 – Back to 2.5mg – No more pain in elbows and knees. However, shoulder pain increased and developed lower back and hip pain. This was after I took the 2.5mg at mid-day. Also developed a stomach upset about ten minutes after taking it. Day 6 – 2.5mg – No knee and elbow pain. No pain in fingers and toes but have feeling of stiffness. Joints still popping and clicking.  Shoulder pain increased. Felt like stabbing pain. Something new is that the front of my neck felt sore and muscles felt swollen. Day 7 – 0mg Since it was the weekend and expected less stress, I decided to try and not take amlodipine. No pain in major joints. Neck and shoulders felt stiff and sensation of neck swelling still there but not constant. Day 8 – Still 0mg – Felt almost normal. Neck soreness was there upon waking but became negligible towards the afternoon. Day 9 (today) – Pain free!!!! Still some tightness in the neck from time to time but nothing like it was in the past days. In fact, it is non-existent as I type this. Observations – Symptoms seem to get worse before they get better for each joint. Improvement also seemed to start from the bottom and progress upwards with pain in the upper joint getting worse or appearing just as the bottom joint was feeling better. Example, as my knees were getting better, my left elbow pain got worse; and as my elbows were getting better, I started to develop pain in the shoulders and neck which I did not have previously. Conclusion – I am not sure if I shall be getting off amlodipine completely. I actually plan to take 2.5mg again for a few days and work my way back to my normal 5mg dosage. I did not have any side effects then.

I do plan to go back to my specialist but he only comes in on weekdays and it is a problem for me to get time off from work.   Again, apologies for the length of this post but I do hope that it is able to help someone.  6 likes, 79 replies "

Nightmares, dizziness, depression, lack of appetite,  not to mention sleeping anywhere from 12 to 15 hours a day and feeling like I don't have the will or energy to move. I started taking Amlodipine 10mg Nov 11th, my friends started asking me what was going on the beginning of December,  I thought it was stress from waiting for the results from a procedure I had done... Well the results were positive, but my attitude didn't improve, then acid reflux begun. I have never had to take anything for heartburn,  indigestion or reflux. Now I wake up having to take something. Plus all the other side effects.  My God I rather take my chances and die a natural death than feel like this.... 0 likes, 9 replies "

In early January 2018, i went to see another GP and showed him my daily  reading.  He told me to stop taking beta blocker and gave me amlodipine 2.5 mg to be taken every 3rd day. The purpose is to wean off my bp meds. As i am super sensitive to drugs, i have several side effects though not as bad as when i was on beta blocker. Now i am off of amlo for 11 days and i am still not feeling so well.  Today I am extremely weak and tired, having anxiety and palpition as well. My bp this morning is 104/76.

I just found this forum and felt like I had to share my experience, since there seems to be quite a lot similar ones. I started Amlodipine 10mg a bit over a year ago. Shortly after that I started having heart palpitations, and about after two months I suffered from a atrial fibrillation. I was taken to emergency center, and my heart had to be shocked electrically back to it's normal rhythm. I had never suffered from anything like that before. The palpitations continued and I also started having other side effects as well. I started having blurry vision, and really bad brain fog. Also intense blushing on my face and ears, like they would get REALLY red and hot from time to time without any good reason. I used to be athletic and do a lot of sports before all this, but suddenly I couldn't even lift weights or run properly because I would get really strong heart palpitations. I talked to a few doctors and all of them just wanted to blame the fact that I'm on testosterone replacement therapy, even tho only thing that had changed before the problems started was me starting Amlodipine. Finally my trt doc told me that he thinks Amlodipine is a s****y medicine and switched it to Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker called Candesartan. It's been only a week and all of those side effects have gone away almost completely. No more brain fog, no more palpitations (knock on wood) and no more blurry vision. Anyways.. just wanted to share my experience if someone is struggling with that awful poison they call Amlodipine. 0 likes, 10 replies "

I have a bicuspid aortic valve so I monitored my blood pressure which was slightly high and called my cardiologist who put my on 2.5mg of norvasc. Later on in the month I started having bad regurgitation. Called my GP and he told me to start taking 20mg of prilosec.

Had an endoscopy and was informed I had mild esophagitis. He told me to continue prilosec. No help. Beginning of march I had an esophageal manometry and 24hr pH study.

Last week I read online that calcium channel blockers can cause reflux because it can relax the LES and allow acid into the esophagis. With the permission of my cardiologist I stopped taking the amlodipine on 4/19/2017. The first 4 days I felt terrible. High   and nerviousness with some weird feelings in my body. My blood pressure remained normal and those anxiety symptoms seemed to have went away. If the amlodipine was the cause of the reflux how long will it take the side effects to go away after taking it 4 months? I'm ready to feel normal again.

So i went to the bathroom and there was a bump there. It was painful to touch and squeeze etc. It was really bothering me so i kept on squeezing. (i know I'm not supposed to squeeze things like that but it hurt to much if i didn't) after a couple minutes of squeezing it finally popped. light yellow liquid came oozing out. after that liquid came out it oozed blood as well. well flash forward to today and i was sitting down again, moved my leg and thought, god damn this hurts my labia. and well sure enough another bump was there. same thing happened. although it was on a different side of my labia. Ive never had sex but i have masturbated. i would really like to know what was on my labia. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I have been healed without surgery and this was verified by my colon rectal surgeon. I want to start by specifying that my diagnosed fistula was the result of a hemmorhoidectomy, and not caused by Chron's or other digestive disorders.  I do believe that it is important to eliminate the source of the infection to avoid re-occurrence. So my story may be only partially helpful to those with digestive disorders that are at the root cause of their problem. I was diagnosed with a fistula during the follow up visits with the colon-rectal surgeon who performed my hemmorhoidectomy. I was obviously extremely disappointed, and I  subsequently scheduled a visit with another colon-rectal surgeon who is rated in the top 1% of his field by US News and World Reports for a second opinion. He gave me the same diagnosis: fistula, and surgery was scheduled with a tentative date. I found a few small studies that indicated Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy was effective in healing similar conditions. I want to note here that the data set is extremely small, but to avoid surgery I was willing to try it: For those considering attempting this, it is important to note that not all Hyperbaric Oxygen Chambers are the same,  nor are they all effective for this type of treatment. The most common chambers available are the ""Soft Shell"" type which cannot produce pressures above 1.5 [ATA]--DO NOT USE THE SOFT SHELL TYPE. The soft shell version has zero recorded effectiveness in treating fistula . The studies indicate pressures were used in excess of 2.0 [ATA] which require the use of the ""hard shell"" type which unfortunately is much more expensive. My personal experience was Forty (2) hour sessions in a hard shell chamber at 2.0 [ATA].  I did these sessions mostly 6 days a week and couple of 5 day weeks. I really did not see improvements that were substantial until after about the 20th session. I should add here that in the beginning I did use in conjuction with HBOT an Infrared Sauna nearly 7 days a week fr 40 min-1hr a day. This raised my core body temp to ~100 deg F. to help fight infection. The swollen fistula area began to shrink in size during this time, and when it had reduced in size to not being noticeable I stopped the sauna sessions. After all of this, my visit to the Surgeon resulted in his acknowledgement of the improvement and declared that surgery was no longer necessary. He was not willing to credit the HBOT with the healing, and said it just ""healed on its own"".  Ironically he told me on his first diagnosis of the fistula where surgery was scheduled: ""These things dont heal on their own"".  I can only say that before HBOT it was not healing on its own, and with HBOT it has healed completely. 0 likes, 0 replies "

The studies indicate pressures were used in excess of 2.0 [ATA] which require the use of the ""hard shell"" type which unfortunately is much more expensive. My personal experience was Forty (2) hour sessions in a hard shell chamber at 2.0 [ATA].  I did these sessions mostly 6 days a week and couple of 5 day weeks. I really did not see improvements that were substantial until after about the 20th session. I should add here that in the beginning I did use in conjuction with HBOT an Infrared Sauna nearly 7 days a week fr 40 min-1hr a day. This raised my core body temp to ~100 deg F. to help fight infection. The swollen fistula area began to shrink in size during this time, and when it had reduced in size to not being noticeable I stopped the sauna sessions. After all of this, my visit to the Surgeon resulted in his acknowledgement of the improvement and declared that surgery was no longer necessary. He was not willing to credit the HBOT with the healing, and said it just ""healed on its own"".  Ironically he told me on his first diagnosis of the fistula where surgery was scheduled: ""These things dont heal on their own"".  I can only say that before HBOT it was not healing on its own, and with HBOT it has healed completely. 0 likes, 0 replies "

One year ago I had a gout attack in my left ankle - came on in the middle of the night.

X-ray came back clear and by this point my ankle was hot so they sent me for blood tests. Gout was confirmed by high levels of Uric acid. I was given a dose of Naproxen, within a day or so it got better and I could walk again. I finished the dose which was perhaps 2 weeks and by this point there was just a bit of pain in my ankle when rotating it round but I could walk again. I lasted about a day or so without the tablets before it came back in the night, I got a repeat prescription quickly and took them the next day and it went pretty much straight away. I took the dose which again was 2 weeks and went back to the doctors. They prescribed me another dose but asked me to not take them until it started again. 1 year later I still have the unopened packet of Naproxen as it never came back again.  They have just sent me for blood tests again and have phoned to say that I still have high levels and they'd like to put me on Allopurinol to lower it - they want to start at 100mg and then increase it after a couple of weeks. They told me the limit for Uric acid was 360 and mine was 517. I eat healthily and exercise regularly - I run at least 50 miles a month and do quite a few half marathons. Since I had gout I only normally drink water - I drink over 2L of water every day. The only time I drink anything else is when out for a meal etc. I do drink alcohol but it is very infrequent, I might have 5 or 6 drinks perhaps 4 times a year - I don't drink at home (unless we have a party) (boring I know!)

In the last few weeks I've been training hard for a run that is coming up so I have also been drinking protein recovery shakes which I have found have helped with recovery for my calf muscles. I have drunk one of these after a hard run (600ml) in addition to the at least 2L of water I drink every day. I have declined the Allopurinol for now, partly due to the fact that I have this run coming up in a few weeks and don't want the risk of the tablets upsetting things.

The Doctor gave me the impression that given my diet and the fact that I drink plenty of water, that they don't think that I could lower my levels through a change of diet.

So they don't think it is diet related but said that it could push it over the edge. Before I had gout, I often didn't drink enough during the day at work and didn't go to the toilet at work. So that has been my biggest change since having the attack. I'd more or less forgotten about it given that I've not even had a twinge since (the ankle continued to hurt when running for a couple of months but I put that down to damage the crystals had done) - but that has all gone now and I get no pain from it.

I'm a 36 year old man living in California, 5'11"" tall and weighing 190lbs (13.5stone). I am in decent shape, exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet (rarely any of these high purine foods). I do drink a fair amount of alcohol (until recently) - a couple of beers, maybe a glass of wine or two and a whiskey night cap most everyday. I do eat marmite on toast every morning which I've shockingly just found is one of the foods to avoid (thank you UK factsheets!) I gained a fondness for Vegemite after spending some time in Australia! I'm super active and played competitive sports until pretty recently. I'm an avid swimmer, runner, hiker, biker etc. About 2.5 years ago I woke up after sleeping with my foot in a weird position to excruciating pain in my ankle. Believed it was a weird tendon irritation from sleeping in a weird position. Doctor suggested gout but I totally blew it off as something that only happens to corpulent middle aged men. Nothing came up on X-ray. The pain went away in a few days and I didn't think much else of it. A little over a year later I had a very similar thing happen in my other ankle. Then about 6-months ago I woke up with a very similar thing in my elbow - again nothing on X-rays and physical therapist I visited thinking it was a tendonitis issue was baffled. The elbow pain lasted a couple of weeks and was especially painful at night. But then with NSAIDs and rest went away and has been totally fine since. Currently I have a similar issue going on in my left big toe which at first I thought was an injury as I did roll over on my toe joint playing sport. The pain in this area though is what led me back to thinking it's possibly gout. The   seems to be instigated by some sort of minor injury each time. As I'm so active I've just sort of believed up until now that it's aches and pains of getting older after some kind of sporting activity I've been doing. The pain has been quite bad but nothing compared to more severe gout flare ups I've been reading about. My brother (2-years younger) has similarly had some strange joint pains the last couple of years and was recently tested high for uric acid - he suggested I get my levels checked. So in between this elbow flare up and this toe flare up I did get tested about 3 months ago. Uric acid level was 8.9 mg/dL. Which I didn't really understand at the time but now I looked up these results I understand that it is well into hyperuricemia (high blood uric acid greater than ~6mg/dL) territory. And the genetic link here seems pretty obvious. So not sure I really have any specific questions but just wanted to hear any thoughts the community may have on my situation. I am working on drinking plenty of water each day. Doctor has suggested some dietary changes and reduced alcohol and test again in a couple of months time to see if it's a continued high level. Will then discuss plan for the future. Allopurinol (for long-term uric acid reduction) and colchicine (for flare ups) will be discussed. I am hesitant to sign up for a lifetime medication unless absolutely necessary. The thought of long term joint damage, not being able to be physically active, chronic joint pain, and the cardiovascular risks from hyperuricemia scare the crap out of me. I feel like I'm way too young and healthy to be having these types of conditions....so really just trying to make sense of it all. Thank you all for your time. 0 likes, 10 replies "

I do eat marmite on toast every morning which I've shockingly just found is one of the foods to avoid (thank you UK factsheets!) I gained a fondness for Vegemite after spending some time in Australia! I'm super active and played competitive sports until pretty recently. I'm an avid swimmer, runner, hiker, biker etc. About 2.5 years ago I woke up after sleeping with my foot in a weird position to excruciating pain in my ankle. Believed it was a weird tendon irritation from sleeping in a weird position. Doctor suggested gout but I totally blew it off as something that only happens to corpulent middle aged men. Nothing came up on X-ray. The pain went away in a few days and I didn't think much else of it. A little over a year later I had a very similar thing happen in my other ankle. Then about 6-months ago I woke up with a very similar thing in my elbow - again nothing on X-rays and physical therapist I visited thinking it was a tendonitis issue was baffled. The elbow pain lasted a couple of weeks and was especially painful at night. But then with NSAIDs and rest went away and has been totally fine since. Currently I have a similar issue going on in my left big toe which at first I thought was an injury as I did roll over on my toe joint playing sport. The pain in this area though is what led me back to thinking it's possibly gout. The   seems to be instigated by some sort of minor injury each time. As I'm so active I've just sort of believed up until now that it's aches and pains of getting older after some kind of sporting activity I've been doing. The pain has been quite bad but nothing compared to more severe gout flare ups I've been reading about. My brother (2-years younger) has similarly had some strange joint pains the last couple of years and was recently tested high for uric acid - he suggested I get my levels checked. So in between this elbow flare up and this toe flare up I did get tested about 3 months ago. Uric acid level was 8.9 mg/dL. Which I didn't really understand at the time but now I looked up these results I understand that it is well into hyperuricemia (high blood uric acid greater than ~6mg/dL) territory. And the genetic link here seems pretty obvious. So not sure I really have any specific questions but just wanted to hear any thoughts the community may have on my situation. I am working on drinking plenty of water each day. Doctor has suggested some dietary changes and reduced alcohol and test again in a couple of months time to see if it's a continued high level. Will then discuss plan for the future. Allopurinol (for long-term uric acid reduction) and colchicine (for flare ups) will be discussed. I am hesitant to sign up for a lifetime medication unless absolutely necessary. The thought of long term joint damage, not being able to be physically active, chronic joint pain, and the cardiovascular risks from hyperuricemia scare the crap out of me. I feel like I'm way too young and healthy to be having these types of conditions....so really just trying to make sense of it all. Thank you all for your time. 0 likes, 10 replies "

I gather that i can expect a gout attack as the crystals start to dissolve.  I need to time this as well as i can for office days and not my out and about days. So, when can i expect a likely flare up - within a few days or a few weeks of starting my 100mg dose?  Any guidance would be good as if I take it now and get a flare in 5 days that will be a disaster.  If I get a flare in 9 days that is manageable.  I have steroid tabs to take if I get an attack  and they might be able to dampen it down mind...  Dicolfenac and the others dont really touch them any more...

Kind of blocked it out and carried on as normal. It gradually intensified and got a bit more swollen and stiff so it hurts to push off on that toe and ball of my foot while walking or running now. It's been at the same level now for about 10-days. Now this isn't the classic gout flare up of intense pain that I hear about from gout sufferers - but it is located right in that classic joint that gout goes after. I've had a handful of what I think might be mild gout flares in the last couple of years. Not had a formal diagnosis. The flares have been in my toe, ankle and elbow and separate times and all dissipated fairly quickly with only mediocre pain intensity compared to what I hear gout can be like. X-rays of joints have all been clear. UA blood levels were up around 9mg/dL a year ago and then after diet and lifestyle adjustments have been between 7-8 mg/dL the last few months.  I'm in my mid-30s and very active so even though this pain is mild it is not allowing me to walk and run and do much of the sports activities I typically do. Any ideas on this? Does this sound gout related or something else? I have started taking some ibuprofen and got some turmeric and some tart cherry and celery seed extract supplements to try and get down the inflammation and further reduce the urate. I'll be going to see my GP this week so we will see what the docs have to say if anything... I feel like they tent to treat acute symptoms and send you on your way and if you aren't totally crippled with pain and disability they don't take you seriously enough! 0 likes, 23 replies "

I have a doctor's appointment booked to discuss. However I'm really suffering at the moment. I over used my upper body a few days ago. I knew I'd be left aching for a day or so but now it has been three days and my arms don't feel any better. I can force them to work but it's quite painful. Resting seems to make them feel worse like everything seizes up. I know that when I had my only full on attack of   the uric acid crystals congregated in my ankle at the exact point of a recent injury (6 months old). So I'm basically asking if the current pain I'm suffering is due to crystals forming inbetween damaged muscle etc.?  As an aside, I run quite a lot and recently I've been fine with long runs off around 20km or so but I've struggled with recovery following any speed work. Could this again be related?

Since 2015 onwards, it stopped bothering me... occasionally it forms a tiny pea shaped bump if im too constipated or put pressure in that area by doing any weight lifting. Then it pops open and fresh blood drains. im managing my diet with everyday psyllium husk regularly, not to eat any gassy foods such as broccoli or beans etc. Eating only fully cooked foods. Keep the area clean, wash after bowel movements. I guess it became dormant and quiet, unless I get overly constipated or gassy. If I do, the skin surface bursts ooen and blood drains, then the skin tear heals in a week. Suggestions? 0 likes, 0 replies "

I have undergone 6 surgery and it has been really painful the whole year. My surgeon has placed a seton on my fistula and he said the fistula has gone down a lot from my first surgery, still i am very worried as initially my Dr said the fistula was so bad that i might need to put a permanent stoma if the surgery didn't go well. During this one year i have lost all my self confidence and i am dealing with a really bad insomnia and stress. My work has been really flexible and helpful during this whole period but still i feel real bad about asking leave everytime i go for a surgery. I am just wondering if there is anyone who is going through this agony or has overcome this.

So I need some advice on what to do.  I'll give you a quick synopsis of what my story is: 47 year old - male Right now, it's most comfortable if I put 1 square of toilet paper in between my cheeks, so that my bottom stays dry. I asked my surgeon, what's wrong, and he simply didn't know.  He said have the colonoscopy and I asked then what?  What if that's fine, and then what would be the next steps?  I asked him, is this is my new normal?  To have this leak like this, and he said, we could do surgery again.  I'm very nervous of surgery again, as you can imagine - and perhaps having it be worse than it is now. I just don't get it. If anyone has a similar story, or any advice, I am all ears. Thank you for listening. -Jeff 0 likes, 1 reply "

I live in the Caribbean, St Barth. Lots of sun and ocean. I am 53, mine started before menopause. My GA is not all over but I have had a few on my back for 5 years that went away. one on my neck for 3 years that went away. Now one on my hand that has taken 7 years to spread away. Mine start as a dot, spread bigger over the 7 years to the size of a lime then disappear. There is one women here who had it all over her body. She went to a doctor in France who has a technique of looking into your eye to see all the problems in your body. Heilpraktiker I can tell you she has almost completely cured herself by being very vigilant with the ampules he prescribed. the GA is at bay with only a few faded spots. I went to see him too. ( i will say not super easy to get to because he lives in a small town) Paris - train or plane to Nante then taxi to Paimboeuf  France.  I am not as covered as she was and i only have one left  that has almost disappeared. The French are very big on homeopathic medicine. My prescription was a bit different then hers with the dosage. But relatively the same. It seems to be Immune and allergy I am happy to communicate with anyone who wants to know more. Since I have seen specialists in France , Italy, USA and here in the Caribbean. I will say from my deepest thoughts. There is no complete cure. My good friend in NY studies cures in a lab for skin problems. She says they do not put research money to GA because it is a cosmetic problem without deadly or sickly symptoms. The modern medication is far worse for the liver and you then the problem. All the best Lisa 0 likes, 1 reply "

I take Levothyroxine daily and I do believe there could be some relationship between Thyroid issues and Granuloma Annulare.   I have been on this forum many times just as frustrated as many of you have been and are about your Granuloma Annulare.  I have had it on my feet (thinking it was Athlete's foot) even as a teenager and eventually it left my feet and started on my elbows.  The thickening bumps on my elbows eventually spread to the inside of my arms and especially my forearms.  It was itchy and unsightly, red and sometimes swollen.  It even started on my left middle finger, and still appears there under the skin, I assume that my wedding ring aggravates it. Cortisone cream has been my friend.  It kept the redness to a minimum and was soothing, but didn't help it go away.   I want to share with you what finally worked for me:    a 5 mg dose of Prednisone for 10 days, then tapering off to none over a week.  The redness subsided and the reaction to the Prednisone seemed to soothe it all together, even though the ridges were still visable slightly.  Over a month, the skin returned to a normal color and the ridges left.  It wasn't completely gone, so the same dose was repeated a second time and it started to go away completely. I have not been on Prednisone since.   I have been free of the itching and unsightly ridges and rash for over a year now!  The Prednisone stopped the autoimmune cycle within my body and I am no longer suffering from full blown, aggravating Granuloma Annulare!  I can tell that there is still that tendancy underlying in my skin, because I get a little itchy inside my elbows at times and I wonder when or if it will come back.  But when it does, I know what to do to stop it!  I've never been so grateful in my life for something that worked for me.  I know that everyone's body is different and this might not be the answer for you, but it was for me.   I'm hoping this information helps someone as desperate as I was.

751,C1535939,Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia,C0235290,bitter taste,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/finally-something-that-worked--677975,Finally something that worked!!,"I am 55 yrs old, a healthy, active woman with well-controlled anxiety.  I have had GA (diagnosed by biopsy) for over 10 years, mostly on my legs & thighs and in 2016 starting on upper arm.  Like many on this site I tried numerous rounds of topical medical interventions such as steroid creams, to no avail (other than reduction in itching, but lesions continued to grow in size or spread) and spent lots of money on supplements, etc from well-intentioned wholistic practitioners.   I have been dismayed by how little concern my PCP and Dermatologist showed about addressing this issue, despite its significant impact on my quality of life.  I could no longer wear shorts or a swimsuit due to the stares from strangers wondering if I had some awful contagious disease.    Fast forward to a posting on this site in Mid-2017 from a husband on behalf of his GA-suffering wife (I did not register, just read postings.).  THANK YOU! THANK YOU!  He said she had tried MSM/sulfer crystals daily and he could tell the GA lesions were fading.  I had always believed GA was some kind of auto-immune reaction, and I have sensitive skin in general to makeup products, etc. so I began researching sulfer/MSM and discovered it is one of the trace minerals our bodies need but that is lacking in modern diets.  I decided, “What the heck, it can’t be any worse and the cost is low.”  I began usage in late August 2017 and within weeks my lesions no longer itched and by the 3 month mark my husband noted a visible fading. I returned to wearing shorts & swimsuits this May.  I am here to tell you there is absolutely NO TRACE of a lesion (and I had many, large ones) anywhere on my body now! That’s one year for anyone reading!  After 10 years of suffering with this strange affliction I am beyond thrilled! My usage: 1/2 tsp each morning in a 10-12 oz. cup of black tea (any variety).  It has a bitter taste so you don’t want to overdo it. If I had more than 3 refills of tea, diluting it, I would add another 1/2 tsp.  My profile picture has the specific brand I ordered on Amazon but there are many others available I believe would likely be effective as well (this is NOT an advertisement for this brand-just trying to be helpful).  I chose organic because I hoped it would be the purest form.  I continue to use it in my tea each morning; I have never been a coffee person but that man’s wife used it in coffee.

Only two years ago I got GA after penicillin.  Most of the spots slowly disappeared except for the ones on my upper arms.  Then, this year, again after penicillin, I got GA again but with a vengence -- arms/legs.   This has nothing to do with gluten, although going gluten free is I think healthier.  In my case my digestion can't handle gluten. 0 likes, 2 replies "

In those days they thought there was a link between   and granuloma annulare. That is no longer the case. However, there must be a link somewhere whether it's related to   or hormones. I have adopted a life changing diet that has completely removed processed food and sugar and on that journey I have learned a great deal about the body and how it functions. I believe that this skin condition is your body telling you something, whether that is an imbalance of insulin, hormones, poor gut or whatever a good diet definitely helps.

I cut out alcohol for the first 3 months and reintroduced red wine only at weekends after that time. I also cut out bread and replaced it with good quality crackers for a while. I have reintroduced good breads (no sugar) but with yeast and there has been no adverse effect. I've switched dairy and meat to all organic to avoid the added hormones and as many veg as I can to organic to avoid the toxins in chemicals. As I write this I realise it all sounds a bit excessive but it is a journey of discovery which starts with sugar. It has only been in the last 30-40 years that we produce and process food the way we do - largely because it is cheap.

I've had a couple of review appointments since, at both of which I was told surgery wasnt the best option but that it wouldnt repair itself.  My right bicep seems to have developed some sort of herniated appearance, where when I flex the muscles it pops up in a mound, quite unlike the left side.  It aches continually and I'm very restricted on what I can do with my right arm, not being able to lift anything heavy and my grip is weakened.  I have another review meeting on 22 August and dont quite know what to ask or what advice I should be expecting.  Is surgery the only option for example. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I can’t write anymore, I can’t iron, can’t cut vegetables etc and it’s very weak when opening jars etc which my partner now has to do.

I'm still in pain almost 5 months later.  I'll give a little history. I started having heel pain in January 2016. Doctor told me I had tendonitis. I started with physical therapy and it unfortunately did not help. I wore a boot for 6 weeks (actually ended up being 3 months cause the Dr. told me to keep wearing it) and that didn't help either. Dr. referred me to another Dr. who does tenex procedure. I had that on August 8. While I was in therapy I ended up tearing my tendon. The Dr. referred me to a surgeon and that's when I decided on the surgery.  I was feeling great after the surgery (other than the pain that came along with it) I had my foot in a bandaged cast for 2 weeks. On New Year's Day I ended up losing my footing on crutches after a shower ( I only used crutches for showers, I had a scooter) and ended up landing on my foot and falling. I called the nurse the following day and she asked questions and said it didn't sound like I did damage. I was sore for a few days and then it seemed ok. I got my stitches out and was put in a plaster cast for 4 weeks. Most of the issue was swelling and soreness. After my cast came off I was put in a boot and told to do PT right away. I didn't get an appointment for almost 2 weeks later. I did non weight bearing exercises for a couple of weeks. My foot was so swollen I couldn't fit in my sneaker. I also couldn't walk without the use of crutches. When I could finally fit my foot in my sneaker I started weight bearing exercises and started walking without crutches about 2 weeks later. I did 8 weeks of therapy and the pain just kept getting worse. I have pain in my heel and I have pain in the tendon. It feels as it did before I had the surgery. I went back to my part time job over a month ago and went back to my full time job 2 weeks ago. Both jobs I'm on my feet. By the end of the day my foot is so swollen and bruised and I get sharp pains in my heel and in the tendon. I've been working shorter shifts and it still doesn't help. I put inserts in my shoes for heel and arch support and it helped at first withi not as much pain but I'm back to the bad pain. I've been in tears it hurts so badly.

I'm still in pain almost 5 months later.  I'll give a little history. I started having heel pain in January 2016. Doctor told me I had tendonitis. I started with physical therapy and it unfortunately did not help. I wore a boot for 6 weeks (actually ended up being 3 months cause the Dr. told me to keep wearing it) and that didn't help either. Dr. referred me to another Dr. who does tenex procedure. I had that on August 8. While I was in therapy I ended up tearing my tendon. The Dr. referred me to a surgeon and that's when I decided on the surgery.  I was feeling great after the surgery (other than the pain that came along with it) I had my foot in a bandaged cast for 2 weeks. On New Year's Day I ended up losing my footing on crutches after a shower ( I only used crutches for showers, I had a scooter) and ended up landing on my foot and falling. I called the nurse the following day and she asked questions and said it didn't sound like I did damage. I was sore for a few days and then it seemed ok. I got my stitches out and was put in a plaster cast for 4 weeks. Most of the issue was swelling and soreness. After my cast came off I was put in a boot and told to do PT right away. I didn't get an appointment for almost 2 weeks later. I did non weight bearing exercises for a couple of weeks. My foot was so swollen I couldn't fit in my sneaker. I also couldn't walk without the use of crutches. When I could finally fit my foot in my sneaker I started weight bearing exercises and started walking without crutches about 2 weeks later. I did 8 weeks of therapy and the pain just kept getting worse. I have pain in my heel and I have pain in the tendon. It feels as it did before I had the surgery. I went back to my part time job over a month ago and went back to my full time job 2 weeks ago. Both jobs I'm on my feet. By the end of the day my foot is so swollen and bruised and I get sharp pains in my heel and in the tendon. I've been working shorter shifts and it still doesn't help. I put inserts in my shoes for heel and arch support and it helped at first withi not as much pain but I'm back to the bad pain. I've been in tears it hurts so badly.

About 7 months ago, during a period fairly heavy exercise at the gym (which may or may not even be relevant), I began to feel a crampy sensation just under my right ribs along with a sensation of weakness and tenseness across my abdomen. I didn't think much of it at first--in fact, I can't really even recall the exact day I began to have the problem--but when the symptoms didn't go away I saw my GP.  He ordered all the standard tests.  Blood work all came back normal.  H. Pylori and mono negative.  Two separate ultrasounds revealed  a ""possible"" epigastric   and a slightly enlarged liver.  Based on the liver finding we re-tested LFTs and they were normal (ALT and AST in the low 20s).  We also tested for Hep B and C which came back negative. At this point I was referred to a surgeon for possible hernia surgery, but he wanted to rule out gallbladder motility problems so he ordered a HIDA scan first. My HIDA scan came back with an ejection fraction of 38%, which was the exact threshold for a ""normal"" functioning gallbladder. However, since I didn't have any of the other classic symptoms of gallbladder problems, we sort of moved past this as a possible explanation for my symptoms. I managed to convince my GP to refer me for an MRI, hoping it would confirm the hernia and give me the confidence I needed to proceed with hernia surgery.  However, the MRI didn't show any epigastric hernia at ALL.  It was otherwise completely normal. At this point I'm at a loss.  I have no clear explanation for my symptoms, and they are showing no sign of getting better.  The ""pain"" is fairly minimal.  Occasional poking sensations just under my right ribs, along with some muscle cramping when I contract my oblique muscle.  But it's the abdominal WEAKNESS and tenseness that is most bothersome.  It's not even pain so much as pure discomfort.  The discomfort seems to get worse when I use my core muscles.  My rectus abdominis feels ""tight"" when I stretch on my hands and knees.  Laying down makes it better. My leading theory at this point is the epigastric hernia, even though it wasn't seen on the MRI.  I do also have a small bulge in my stomach when I raise my head from a laying down position which seems to confirm the epigastric hernia as well.  But I struggle with the fact that an epigastric hernia doesn't really explain the RUQ pain.  I also can't totally get past the slightly enlarged liver and borderline abnormal HIDA scan. Lastly, there are a couple other unexplained, small symptoms that I've been experiencing over the past few months which quite possibly relate to my issue.  Lots of trapped air seems to ""gurgle"" up my esophagus.   I have also always had occasional benign palpitations, but they have increased in frequency since this whole thing started.  These symptoms in connection with everything else make me think of a possible hiatal hernia or ulcer.  However, I don't really suffer from heartburn and at the very begining of this whole situation my GP prescribed a PPI, thinking possible GERD, and it did nothing (I understand this to be the frontline treatment for a HH). Anyway, if you've read through all this, thank you.  If you have any ideas what my problem could be or you have experienced something similar, please let me know! 0 likes, 3 replies "

About 7 months ago, during a period fairly heavy exercise at the gym (which may or may not even be relevant), I began to feel a crampy sensation just under my right ribs along with a sensation of weakness and tenseness across my abdomen. I didn't think much of it at first--in fact, I can't really even recall the exact day I began to have the problem--but when the symptoms didn't go away I saw my GP.  He ordered all the standard tests.  Blood work all came back normal.  H. Pylori and mono negative.  Two separate ultrasounds revealed  a ""possible"" epigastric   and a slightly enlarged liver.  Based on the liver finding we re-tested LFTs and they were normal (ALT and AST in the low 20s).  We also tested for Hep B and C which came back negative. At this point I was referred to a surgeon for possible hernia surgery, but he wanted to rule out gallbladder motility problems so he ordered a HIDA scan first. My HIDA scan came back with an ejection fraction of 38%, which was the exact threshold for a ""normal"" functioning gallbladder. However, since I didn't have any of the other classic symptoms of gallbladder problems, we sort of moved past this as a possible explanation for my symptoms. I managed to convince my GP to refer me for an MRI, hoping it would confirm the hernia and give me the confidence I needed to proceed with hernia surgery.  However, the MRI didn't show any epigastric hernia at ALL.  It was otherwise completely normal. At this point I'm at a loss.  I have no clear explanation for my symptoms, and they are showing no sign of getting better.  The ""pain"" is fairly minimal.  Occasional poking sensations just under my right ribs, along with some muscle cramping when I contract my oblique muscle.  But it's the abdominal WEAKNESS and tenseness that is most bothersome.  It's not even pain so much as pure discomfort.  The discomfort seems to get worse when I use my core muscles.  My rectus abdominis feels ""tight"" when I stretch on my hands and knees.  Laying down makes it better. My leading theory at this point is the epigastric hernia, even though it wasn't seen on the MRI.  I do also have a small bulge in my stomach when I raise my head from a laying down position which seems to confirm the epigastric hernia as well.  But I struggle with the fact that an epigastric hernia doesn't really explain the RUQ pain.  I also can't totally get past the slightly enlarged liver and borderline abnormal HIDA scan. Lastly, there are a couple other unexplained, small symptoms that I've been experiencing over the past few months which quite possibly relate to my issue.  Lots of trapped air seems to ""gurgle"" up my esophagus.   I have also always had occasional benign palpitations, but they have increased in frequency since this whole thing started.

This morning the cramps and diarrhea were much worse and I ended up in bed most of the day. I'm a male in my 30's and although I'm not overweight or unhealthy I am a heavy drinker (particularly since Covid lockdowns!) and a smoker. Does this sound like it could be kidney or similar?

So I've had reflux for about two years now. For the most part it was manageable and then beginning last year I had a bachelors and the next day I was vomiting constantly and it felt like I was about to die. After that day, I've constantly had reflux symptoms such as the hoarse throat and burning stomach. About five months ago, my doctor put me on nexium for about a month and it did not seem to work. Then after that, he put me on lansoprazole twice a day for 5 days and the once a day for a month. I started to realise halfway through using the lansoprozole that I developed a weird chest sensation. It would come and go. It was a type of stabbing pain the one moment and a tightness the next. But only about once or twice an hour for about 2 or 3 minutes and then go away. I had an ECG and chest enzyme blood work done. The ECG came back clean and the blood work as well, she did say that it looked like there was some form of muscle strain from the blood, but that it might be due to something else and she was not worried. An ultrasound did show that my spleen was 13,7 cm so a bit enlarged but she was also not worried. This chest pain has been plaguing me now for about 3 months. It also feels sometimes that my heart beets really hard and I get this sinking feeling in my heart about once a day. Went to the doctor and he put me on a b2 blocker for it and that took the sinking away but not the hard poundings. I don't really feel the chest when I exercise or anything so it doesn't make it worse. I do feel it though when I try to lift something heavy sometimes but its manageable and I'm not too worried about that. I am worried about my chest though because its all I think about sometimes and it stresses me out because I don't know what it is. My throat also does not get better. On another note which I don't know if it is related or not, about once a week or so, especially at night or if I'm lying in bed, I get this strange feeling in my head.  Like a batch of light-headedness coupled with this feeling of heightened senses. It was like my senses are so heightened that I scare when anyone sneezes or anything near me. Could be totally unrelated but thought I should mention. I'm just getting tired of being sick or not feeling well! My diet is not perfect, but its also not like I eat fast food every day or week.. Sounds like there is a lot wrong with me and it could be all due to stress, but here in South Africa doctors are not that clued up on Gerd and all that stuff and G-Scopes are expensive.

On top of that I understand that IBS is very common and IBD is rare. I just am worried about some condition sneaking up on me as i have seen family have that happen before. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I wish i could keep it shorter than this but i felt the need to mention all this. A couple months ago (mid February), i developed a sudden pain (it was fairly intense) in my intestines( which lasted 2-3 days) accompanied by bloating, excessive gas, unsatisfactory and incomplete bowel movements (with a very small drop of blood on the toilet paper everyday for a week). I also experienced heartburn and acid reflux that one night (It never happened again though), so i immediately scheduled an appointment with a Gastroenterologist. He assured me it was nothing but an upset GI tract because of my poor eating habits prior to the discomfort. So he prescribed me a few medicines for the same. The major symptoms like severe intestinal pain, excessive gas and bloating and that little bleeding i had resolved within a week or so. But other symptoms like change in bowel habits (it’s mushy and thinner than it used to be), minor abdominal discomfort (occasionally) still persist to this day. When i google the symptoms it seems to be an episode of IBS or inflammation in the gut but this persistence also raises a small possibility of colon cancer which has me worried. Also there are few factors to consider before reaching a conclusion: (1). I was on a very poor and undernourished diet with lots of low quality processed fats and oils (lot of junk food basically) for a few months ( i live in a hostel and i didn’t like the food there). Though, now i’ve been at home for a month and half and my diet is mainly healthy home-made food, i keep myself fairly hydrated. (2). I have been skipping breakfast for almost an year now (poor routine management). (3). I had been hooked to smoking since 7-8 months before these symptoms appeared (i quit now). Haven’t touched a cigarette for a couple months now. (4). Both my grandfathers (Maternal and Paternal) were heavy smokers and died at approximately age 65, but were never diagnosed of cancer of any type. No once in my family (except my 43 year old mother) ever had cancer. About my mother, She was diagnosed with stage 2 uterine cancer 4 years ago (then 39) but was cured and is perfectly fine now. (5). I also developed Tonsillitis a couple weeks after my gut discomfort arised. Which, again resolved within a week.

So the last 5 days or so I've been having some odd abdominal issues.  it seems to have come out of nowhere. For the last 5 days I have been getting full quickly.  a few bites and my stomach is bloated (even with drinking water!) My hunger has somewhat diminished as well. ive been noticing its taking a long time for my food to digest. if i eat a meal at 6 pm the night before, ill hear grumbling sounds until i use the bathroom the next day at like 12 pm. Usually my metabolism is quicker than that. Now that didnt worry me too much the last 4 days, until last night when i got really scared. After I tried eating a half a burger and like three fries, i had to use the bathroom. After i defecated, i noticed maroon colored blood on the toilet paper.  not a lot, but definitely there. like i mentioned, i havent defecated often in the last 5 days, and when i do its usually soft, leaning towards diarrhea.  i never bled until last night. It also feels like my abdomen wants to expand at all times even when i havent eaten a meal (whatever that means). I have no nausea, no fever, no coughing...although a little chest pain right in the middle of my chest and/or sternum especially after eating a meal. What could be going on here? 5'7 29 years old Male 173 lbs On a side note:  I like to point out that these specific symptoms started the day after i went to the chiropractor...not sure if that means anything. i also took a Comprehensive blood test a month ago for other reasons and my blood count was within normal ranges...i dont know how that affects my development of my abdominal issues 0 likes, 1 reply "

When symptoms first started it started off with testicular aches, pain in pubic area, flank area & lower abdomen, Pains would come & go like searing hot pain, extreme tenderness in those area, etc. Naturally I thought it was a urology issue & did multiple testicular exams, blood markers,etc and came back clean. While the groin issue was happening I start to experience other symptoms which seem unrelated and come & go. Well those new symptoms are what I'm stuck with now & the unexplained groin symptoms have been absent the past 2 weeks (after being there for 5 weeks) So I'm currently at loss of what these weir symptoms and how they all relate. I'm trying to push for an upper endoscopy & an upper mri from the doctors. But not sure what else to do besides that. Do you guys have any idea what can cause this? I've went from completely healthy 22 years old to bizzare symptoms that have been 7 weeks so far. 0 likes, 4 replies "

I've gotten a lot healthier over those years and was taken off of the Amlodipine and Atenolol a couple of years ago. Three weeks ago today, I saw my doctor because my BP was dropping to 85/55, my heart rate was dropping in to the upper 40's while resting, and I was feeling very ill. Dizzy, felt like I was going to pass out, anxiety attacks. He told me to quit the Lisinopril immediately and monitor my BP so I did. My BP has leveled out at about 125/80 - 130/85  so my doctor says I definitely don't need medicine but to continue working on my health to get it below 120/80. However, the symptoms I described have not totally gone away after three weeks of being off the drug. In fact last week I ended up in the emergency room because I thought I was having a heart issue but it turned out to be a giant anxiety attack. I've had two ECG's done which show no problem with my heart (my heart rate will still drop in to the upper 50's on occasion, typically in the mid afternoon), I don't have any ear/eye problems but I still get quite dizzy and anxious. When I'm walking, the world feels like it's bouncing under my feet. That's probably the best way I can describe it. The ER prescribed hydroxyzine pamoate for the dizziness and anxiety but all that did was knock me out and feel extra groggy when I woke up. I saw my doctor again yesterday who prescribed Ativan for the anxiety which does help get rid of these symptoms but obviously it's not something I can take all the time. Everything I've read indicates that Lisinopril is out of your system in a few days and the effects of it are gone in 1 - 2 weeks. I'm wondering if that's accurate since I'm still experiencing these symptoms, although to a slightly lesser degree, after 3 weeks. 0 likes, 20 replies "

Every so often, there is a sharp pain on the right side, sometimes strong enough to stop my movements or speaking. I panic easily with health conditions, so I tend to overthinking it during the night. On Friday or Saturday, I vegan taking Motrin or Tylenol to soothe the pain, with ample water intake (sometimes coffee). I naturally don't eat many meals a day. I find sometimes the pain eases, sometimes it doesn't. The worst pain/discomfort comes after I've consciously been feeling the pain and seen if it's worsened. I'm not sure if it's worth going to a doctor still or just continuing my routine, but I'd like some comfort to stop me from sleeping at 3AM instead of my needed 9PM. 0 likes, 2 replies "

Thank you in advance if you are able to help! Some background on me before I begin- I am a 25 year-old female. My height is 5’4” and I’m about 140-145 lbs (BMI is around 24%). While my BMI is higher, I do not find myself to look anywhere near obese. I exercise almost daily and try to eat healthy (always cook meals at home, I avoid sugar/excess carbs). I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I have Thalassemia (not sure if it’s minor/intermedia, beta/alpha) with my normal hemoglobin count being about 9.5-10 grams per deciliter. My mother has hypothyroidism, and my maternal grandmother had breast cancer and a stroke. My father’s side has high blood pressure, some with heart attacks. I’m writing this because I’ve had a long and painful journey healing from my injury. I was in a car accident 4/3/19, so it has been one year now. My right hand was flat on the wheel while honking the horn, then I t-boned another vehicle at 35-40 mph, and the airbag did go off. The impact went right into my wrist and arm, as I tried to hold my head and body in place. I got a pisiform fracture (which is apparently very rare, only about 1-3% of all wrist injuries), as well as a concussion and neck muscle spasm. The ER did not see the fracture in the X-Ray, so I did not get a cast like I should have. Three weeks after the accident I found out about the fracture. As of right now, while the fracture does appear healed and all tests look normal according to the doctors, I am still experiencing chronic pain in my wrist and elbow, and sometimes in my shoulder and neck. I did everything recommended by my doctors. I’ve been going to the doctor’s regularly since the accident. I started taking B Vitamins as directed by my doctor, as well. However, all the care I’ve received has only helped up to a point. Around June of 2019, the amount of pain I had plateaued, and has not improved since. I had multiple X-Rays of my wrist, one of my elbow, another of my neck and spine, an MRI of my wrist, and an EMG of my right wrist/arm. I also did Occupational Therapy in October 2019, and while the therapy improved my overall function (strength and flexibility) it caused a significant amount of pain. The pain did not improve after that. The pain is concentrated at the site of the injury, in the left side of the ball of my right hand (when looking at if from the palm). The main thing that causes pain is pressure on my wrist and elbow, and doing repetitive dexterous movements. It seems to get irritated and inflamed from these actions, and causes pain for a time after the fact. Sometimes I’ll get random bouts of pain that are intense and throbbing. The pain also frequently goes up into my pinky. The level of pain can be anywhere from a 1-2 out of 10, to 3-4 out of 10. I am almost completely numb at the site of the injury. From there, going down to my elbow, my skin is desensitized. That’s not completely numb, but it certainly doesn’t feel the same as my other arm. My wrist also pops abnormally compared to my other wrist. During this journey of caring for my wrist, I feel like all my doctors have not truly cared to find what’s wrong. Of course at first, I thought I might just need extra time. But at the six month point, it seemed like I was on a goose chase, with no helpful answers. Now at the year mark, I find it nearly impossible that I could be experiencing this pain without something being wrong. It is extremely frustrating to go to all these appointments and spend all this money with no solid answer, and also not being taken seriously by doctors. Unfortunately, I find it hard to trust many doctors after these experiences. I think it is important to mention that my Orthopedic Surgeon Hand Specialist doctor recommended I see a Rheumatologist to rule out a possible autoimmune disease causing inflammation. The Rheumatologist looked at me like I had three heads when I came in. I’m not sure if that was incompetence on the part of my Orthopedic Surgeon for recommending it or the Rheumatologist for not taking me seriously. However, I do wonder if an autoimmune disease is possible. I researched common symptoms of diseases like Lupus, and chest pain is one of them. I’ve had unexplained sternum pains since about 8 years ago. At the time, my PCP diagnosed Costochondritis with no specific cause. I had an Echocardiogram performed to rule out a heart issue. While this isn’t definitive evidence of me having an autoimmune disease, it does seem like it’s possible. I hope this information helps. I am truly desperate to find some sort of solution to this. I want this situation to be over. I suppose I may just be stuck with this pain for years or life, but I want to do anything I can to prevent that.

Thank you in advance if you are able to help! Some background on me before I begin- I am a 25 year-old female. My height is 5’4” and I’m about 140-145 lbs (BMI is around 24%). While my BMI is higher, I do not find myself to look anywhere near obese. I exercise almost daily and try to eat healthy (always cook meals at home, I avoid sugar/excess carbs). I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I have Thalassemia (not sure if it’s minor/intermedia, beta/alpha) with my normal hemoglobin count being about 9.5-10 grams per deciliter. My mother has hypothyroidism, and my maternal grandmother had breast cancer and a stroke. My father’s side has high blood pressure, some with heart attacks. I’m writing this because I’ve had a long and painful journey healing from my injury. I was in a car accident 4/3/19, so it has been one year now. My right hand was flat on the wheel while honking the horn, then I t-boned another vehicle at 35-40 mph, and the airbag did go off. The impact went right into my wrist and arm, as I tried to hold my head and body in place. I got a pisiform fracture (which is apparently very rare, only about 1-3% of all wrist injuries), as well as a concussion and neck muscle spasm. The ER did not see the fracture in the X-Ray, so I did not get a cast like I should have. Three weeks after the accident I found out about the fracture. As of right now, while the fracture does appear healed and all tests look normal according to the doctors, I am still experiencing chronic pain in my wrist and elbow, and sometimes in my shoulder and neck. I did everything recommended by my doctors. I’ve been going to the doctor’s regularly since the accident. I started taking B Vitamins as directed by my doctor, as well. However, all the care I’ve received has only helped up to a point. Around June of 2019, the amount of pain I had plateaued, and has not improved since. I had multiple X-Rays of my wrist, one of my elbow, another of my neck and spine, an MRI of my wrist, and an EMG of my right wrist/arm. I also did Occupational Therapy in October 2019, and while the therapy improved my overall function (strength and flexibility) it caused a significant amount of pain. The pain did not improve after that. The pain is concentrated at the site of the injury, in the left side of the ball of my right hand (when looking at if from the palm). The main thing that causes pain is pressure on my wrist and elbow, and doing repetitive dexterous movements. It seems to get irritated and inflamed from these actions, and causes pain for a time after the fact. Sometimes I’ll get random bouts of pain that are intense and throbbing. The pain also frequently goes up into my pinky. The level of pain can be anywhere from a 1-2 out of 10, to 3-4 out of 10. I am almost completely numb at the site of the injury. From there, going down to my elbow, my skin is desensitized. That’s not completely numb, but it certainly doesn’t feel the same as my other arm. My wrist also pops abnormally compared to my other wrist. During this journey of caring for my wrist, I feel like all my doctors have not truly cared to find what’s wrong. Of course at first, I thought I might just need extra time. But at the six month point, it seemed like I was on a goose chase, with no helpful answers. Now at the year mark, I find it nearly impossible that I could be experiencing this pain without something being wrong. It is extremely frustrating to go to all these appointments and spend all this money with no solid answer, and also not being taken seriously by doctors. Unfortunately, I find it hard to trust many doctors after these experiences. I think it is important to mention that my Orthopedic Surgeon Hand Specialist doctor recommended I see a Rheumatologist to rule out a possible autoimmune disease causing inflammation. The Rheumatologist looked at me like I had three heads when I came in. I’m not sure if that was incompetence on the part of my Orthopedic Surgeon for recommending it or the Rheumatologist for not taking me seriously. However, I do wonder if an autoimmune disease is possible. I researched common symptoms of diseases like Lupus, and chest pain is one of them. I’ve had unexplained sternum pains since about 8 years ago. At the time, my PCP diagnosed Costochondritis with no specific cause. I had an Echocardiogram performed to rule out a heart issue. While this isn’t definitive evidence of me having an autoimmune disease, it does seem like it’s possible. I hope this information helps. I am truly desperate to find some sort of solution to this.

While this isn’t definitive evidence of me having an autoimmune disease, it does seem like it’s possible. I hope this information helps. I am truly desperate to find some sort of solution to this. I want this situation to be over. I suppose I may just be stuck with this pain for years or life, but I want to do anything I can to prevent that. If it helps, here is a dated list of all the doctors I saw and the what/why: 0 likes, 0 replies "

It happens every week and it is always bursting with blood and blood clots. Then I have 3 holes on my ass crack near the top which is always giving out sticky pus and blood. I don’t know If it is related but my lower back is hurting very badly and so are my muscles in general. Can someone tell me exactly what it is and tell me some solution for this other than surgery. I would do surgery but the doctor says it’s not 100% guaranteed solution as they can always come back therefore I am looking for some other solution like maybe some anti-biotic or cream etc. Thank you. 0 likes, 1 reply "

This never happened before but it's never gone away and it's progressively getting worse. Now it doesn't itch at all but has definitely gotten both bigger in size, not just overall radius, and has a brighter redness to it now as well. Yes I use soap and I scrub myself. I hope this isn't anything to worry about although for being married a year and a half and now this comes right out of the blue just after a couple suspicious behaviours are brought out from my wife, I do hope that this isn't meaning she's cheating such as with contracting an STD and then sharing it with me but as with no strong reason for suspicion as of yet, I still don't know if she is. I am hoping she is being honest but this does have me concerned about my health. (Pics below). Also, we are both 24 years old, this rash or whatever it is has only shown up on my butt and I have fairly good hygiene. My underwear is breathable and I never wear the same pair the next day. I'm shocked thinking about it considering my family goes my entirely different standards. Thanks in advance 0 likes, 1 reply "

I was discharged 2 days after and was  only taking paracetamol or ibuprofen twice a day but nothing now. Sleep still disturbed but bladder seems to be working better (not having to go in night) Too early to tell what else. Has anyone had similar? Interested in how the stomach scar heals (is like a caesarean) as stomach still numb above scar. I am 42 and not overweigh, but likely eating more atm and started swimming yesterday. Stomach pretty large still. In last 24hrs seem to be getting some clear discharge, pretty sure not wee. Can anyone help by telling me about their recovery?

It felt like a sharp pins/needles pain. Very sensitive to the touch and also felt like an electrical current running down my leg. I stayed in bed all day because it hurt to walk. The next morning- which was Wed, April 1st- the pain was so bad it woke me up out of my sleep. It shot up to my vagina. I went to the bathroom and noticed an extremely burning pain. It felt like a cigarette burn. I noticed a bump as i wiped myself so I took a picture of my vagina and noticed a red painful bump on my labia minora- near the clitoris. Ive never had a bump there and never had a pain so bad down there. I thought it was a cyst, but now im not too sure. I put alcohol and Thayers witch hazel on it yesterday and it seemed to go down only alittle tiny bit.  The day the pain initially started in my right leg, I had sex with my boyfriend. I DID NOT have a bump at the time. I had this type of sharp, tingly pain before and had sex with him so I didnt think anything of it. Two days later he tells me it burns when he pees. I looked at his penis and there's no type of outbreak anywhere. It burns inside as the pee is about to come out. He said he's never had burning pee and even had   to go to the bathroom. He was afraid that I gave him something. I told him I have was a cyst because that's what I was thinking. I told him maybe he has a UTI. So we went to the store to get UTI medicine for him (we didnt see one for men, so we just picked up Azo maximum relief UTI medicine and some cranberry juice). He's had it for three days now and he's saying the pain is getting alittle better I attached some pics of how the bump looked on my vagina when i first noticed it. I also show how it looks now on Day 6. I really need someone's opinion on if this is   or not. Its hard to go to the doctor since the COVID-19. Thank you and blessings! 0 likes, 5 replies "

It felt like a cigarette burn. I noticed a bump as i wiped myself so I took a picture of my vagina and noticed a red painful bump on my labia minora- near the clitoris. Ive never had a bump there and never had a pain so bad down there. I thought it was a cyst, but now im not too sure. I put alcohol and Thayers witch hazel on it yesterday and it seemed to go down only alittle tiny bit.  The day the pain initially started in my right leg, I had sex with my boyfriend. I DID NOT have a bump at the time. I had this type of sharp, tingly pain before and had sex with him so I didnt think anything of it. Two days later he tells me it burns when he pees. I looked at his penis and there's no type of outbreak anywhere. It burns inside as the pee is about to come out. He said he's never had burning pee and even had   to go to the bathroom. He was afraid that I gave him something. I told him I have was a cyst because that's what I was thinking. I told him maybe he has a UTI. So we went to the store to get UTI medicine for him (we didnt see one for men, so we just picked up Azo maximum relief UTI medicine and some cranberry juice). He's had it for three days now and he's saying the pain is getting alittle better I attached some pics of how the bump looked on my vagina when i first noticed it. I also show how it looks now on Day 6. I really need someone's opinion on if this is   or not. Its hard to go to the doctor since the COVID-19. Thank you and blessings! 0 likes, 5 replies "

I will get retested, however, my question is has anyone experienced this? my girlfriend swears she doesnt have it. here are my thoughts. 1. shes asymptomatic and it took time as they shed less for me to get the virus.  2. she cheated on me and before she even had an outbreak she passed it to me. supporting thoughts/info: I've read you are most contagious and shed the most right after infection. and shed less 1 year after infection. we are and have been very sexually active during our entire relationship. we have or had sex at least 7 times a week on average, and it took (if she had it previously) 4.5 months for me to contract the virus. (this may not be relevant) the last time we had sex prior to the outbreak was exactly 4 days, which is what I read is the most common time frame to show symptoms after being infected. she kinda freaked out, then didnt really at all. she swore it would end up being a spider bite and that I didnt have it. she talked to her doctor but wont get tested because she doesnt have an outbreak. due to coronavirus her gyn will only see her for emergencies, however, if her partner has hsv2 wouldnt that constitute an emergency? I'm worried that she didnt want to have the igm test done with igg which would show she just contracted the virus. that said the covid19 issue going on makes me worried to go to urgent care as well, but I said we could go to a lab and she refused. she either says she doesnt have it, or if she does it doesnt change anything. I dont know what to believe or what I can do. I know I got it from her, but most the time I believe her. she still acts like I didnt get it from her from time to time, like I cheated but obviously I know that's not true. anyone whose gone through this please help. I got the igm and igg together to give me piece of mind that I got it from her, and that she cheated... only to find out about asymptomatic cases... any experiences and advice is greatly appreciated. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I'll try keep my story short here. I am 28 years old, had a vaginal delivery to my first baby 7 months ago. I had a tear on my perineal body which wasn't stitched up properly. So I ended up having a wide  open vagina and it wouldn't even close up when I squeeze it. It was very distressing for me and of course my husband, so we decided to fix it and have a C-section for the next baby. However, at the consultation I was diagnosed with 2nd degree back wall prolapse. And the surgeon suggested to fix it at the same time (his reason was it would support the perineal body better), which I did, and it solved my terrible lower abdonimal and back pain from day 1. ( I even had no idea what caused it previously) Now I am 19 days op, everything has been going really well. But I am very stressed about lifting my 7 months old baby even after 6 weeks' recovery. The surgeon has advised me it is not recommended to lift anything over 10kg with 12 weeks, and he 10kgs Has anyone here had similar experience or some advice about this? I know it might sound very foolish to you that I decided to have a prolapse surgery before even I complete my family. But I am really glad I had it, esp now my vagina can actually close again. I just couldn't move on with my life feeling it open everyday. Thank you everyone! 0 likes, 17 replies "
