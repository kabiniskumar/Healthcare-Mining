In February 2017 I was urinating more than I thought I should. So I went into my doctor.  They found microscopic hematuria in my urine 3-10hpf.  They referred me to a urologist.  When I went to the urologist they did another urinalysis,  rectal check,  CT  scan of my abdominal and pelvic areas, cyctoscopy,  and a PSA blood draw. My PSA level was a 2. They said everything was normal. They found right lateral hydrothrophy of my prostrate.  That I had possible gallstones and a fatty liver. This reassured me for awhile. Then fear started creeping in that they missed something and I had cancer somewhere.  I started running to my doctor every other day.  I had about three episodes of syncope.  The hospital did 2 CT scan of my head, a lot of blood work and multiple chest xrays.  They said everything was normal.  My doctor said everything was normal and I was suffering from anxiety.  They put me on venlafixine 37.5mg.  They just upped it 5 weeks ago to 75mg . I start seeing a psychiatrist Wednesday.  I also had a colonoscopy two years ago and they said it was normal.  I had 1 polyp that they said had no way of being cancer. I've also had fatigue and back pain. The back pain has been off and on for years.  Here are my questions. 1. Do you think the doctors have done enough testing to rule out anything serious? 2. Do you think it's my anxiety? 3. Could the hernias, fatty liver, and gallstones cause the stomach bloating and back pain? Thanks for the help.  0 likes, 0 replies "

Last year I had it for well over a month and had several types of antibiotics and they did nothing. I tried something which got rid of the pain instantly which my family kept telling me to take from the start but I had never heard of. I went into my local supermarket and got this magical cure.  This really helps me out and I wanted to share this in hope it would help somebody else. I found that barley helped take away that awful pain and sting. I got Robinson’s fruit orange with barley and diluted it with water. I had around 2 pints a day and the next day woke up without the urge and the pain. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I had like a hard pimple right between my buttocks and it hurt when I sit down on a chair or something. The doctor told me that it is a tail cyst and it needs to be removed or treated with medicines. She told me that usually the removal of the cyst is the easiest and fastest way to get rid of it. And right now I am freaking out. I have never had someone cut through my skin or something like that. I have never gone through any kind of surgery. Also after the surgery I need to go to the hospital every day to get the bandages and everything changed so it doesn't get infected. I am literally freaking out just by walking into a hospital and I cant imagine going there every day for about a month. And what am I going to say to my friends everyday after school? Bye, I don't have time to hang out with you, because I need to go to the hospital? I just cant imagine this happening. My dad told me that it is important to remove it in early age, because the longer it stays the harder it is to remove.  So staying with it isn't a good idea. I just need to know if the surgery is painful and is it going to go away after it? I am terrified from hospitals and doctors. I just need someone to explain to me how is everything going to go. My doctor told me that it is okay and I will be fine, but I am still so scared. I literally want to cry. Like I feel like I am the only one from my friends with this thing. How am I going to explain to them why am I going to the hospital every day? I cant tell them the truth, it is embarrassing to think about having this thing and I definitely can't tell them.

I have another one this month on the 10th. Nothing was found during the Scope and my urodynamics showed I have an obstruction which has been deemed a bladder neck obstruction. At the 7 month point I could no longer squeeze the last few drops of urine out of my bladder or urethra. This happened one day out of the blue. Sometimes my stream will hit 8ml/s, it averages between 12-15ml/s and sometimes it'll even hit 20ml/s. This is supposedly due to my bladder neck not opening correctly. I am supcious that the cystoscopy caused a stricture but I have no evidence and will find out within the next week. Sometimes when I urinate I will have a slight sting about 1/4 down from the opening of my urethra. It's worse when my urine is more concentrated. It gets really bad when I try to squeeze the last bits left over in my bladder and my whole urethra feels like it's being stabbed with a hot poker. Something that is bothering me is after I ejaculate I seem to leak a large amount of post-ejaculate. It's see through and really stings that specific spot. I can milk my urethra, get it all out and I will always know when i'm leaking more or some is in my urethra because i'll get a sharp sting. it goes away when i milk it and get it out. Sometimes I'll look because there is that sting and I will have a large blob of post-ejac just sitting there at the opening of my penis. Why would it sting at the end of urination (rarely) and always sting every-time post-ejac leaks? It doesn't burn during urination nor when I ejaculate. Ejaculation force seem strong. Why at that one specific location? I'm thinking it's scar tissues but my urologist thinks it's highly unlikely and it's probably due to my urethra not emptying and the urine has inflamed that part of my urethra. opinions? 0 likes, 12 replies "

The attempt was horribly painful and now I have a planned surgery of dilation and the cystoscopy. Has anyone heard of this procedure and have any insight of what to expect? My biggest concern is the pain post-op and having to have a catheter in for a few days while my urethra is already sore and even more sensitive. The doctor thinks it's likely the original stricture could have been caused by a poorly placed catheter along with scaring from an appendectomy so I'm already holding a grudge against catheters in general. If anyone has any insight into this procedure please let me know. Very much appreciated. 0 likes, 19 replies "

I got tested multiple times for anything you can think of, UTI, prostate exam etc. I was referred to a urologist. When I went to the urologist I took a sheet home and filled out all the times I urinated, but this wasn't the issue, the issue was this constant irritating urge to urinate, almost as if something was swollen in my urethra. It sort of died down for a few month before my next appointment (August of this year) so the urologist discharged me. 3 nights ago and it has began again, I have no idea what to do it genuinely ruins my life and my mood and makes it impossible to sleep. it sort of feels like something is stuck in my tube. Seems to get worse after going to the toilet, if I hold it in and go to urinate when I am able to then as soon as i leave the toilet it goes back to being so intense. Can anyone help me? This is a nightmare I really need some help with this, I start uni in a few weeks, I've just been put on solifenacin but I can't help but think that isn't going to help, found a discussion on here nearly 14 pages long with the same issue but was hoping I could get some more insight. Could it possibly be linked to masturbation? 0 likes, 6 replies "

I’m due to have a Urethroplasty procedure at the end of this month - and to be honest having read the various articles guys have posted, I’m seriously reconsidering whether to go ahead with this. Most significantly, almost every person has reported a 1-1.5 inch shortening of their penis, a minimum of 1 year recovery time and various aches and pains (which I guess is understandable) Has anyone had experience of a Urethroplasty and if so have you suffered from any of the above? I’ve had ongoing issues with my structure which is near the prostate (bulbar I think) and to be honest other than one kidney infection 1.5 years ago I have not had any issues (long may it continue). My symptoms just now are literally just low flow rate and discomfort when passing urine (especially in the morning). Any help would be greatly appreciated. Do I go ahead with the surgery at this age or do I wait and hope that a less invasive procedure is developed (such as Urotronic).  At the very least having done some research, I’m cancelling my op and chatting to my Urologist. Thank you 0 likes, 12 replies "

Also i have noticed slightly more bleeding (8-9 drops) and clots after urination. My current medication is antibiotic Septrin DS 100 (1 tab/day for month). Is above common to  expect after a week of urethrotomy? How long it would take to bleeding subside? Is this due to catheter? Feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your help! Ismail PS: I read one article on nihs regarding similar matter and I am little worried. 0 likes, 12 replies "

I didn't think I had discharge but I do feel a dropping sensation when I first pee as if maybe there was an accumulation of something there. Nothing has appeared on tissue or under garments though. I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary when I inspected my urethra. It all seems to be my urethra. I feel fine between peeing. I am worried about urethra cancer and now I'm worried that not treating whatever this is for so many months will turn into cancer. Everything I read sounds like what I have is urethra cancer. I'm only 37.  It also says prolonged inflammation of the urethra causes that cancer which is essentily incurable. sorry, terrified 😦 0 likes, 2 replies "

The consultant said it was a short stricture and was soft so when it was cut it pinged back and the urethra opened up  nicely. I had a catheter in place for a week which was removed today. The catheter was no fun and I was in considerable pain the last 48 hours but put up with it as it would soon be removed. The only way to relieve the pain was to sit or preferably lie down, I'm guessing it was bladder spasms. So I had the catheter removed and the relief was instant. For the next hour I drank more than a litre of water (and a cup of tea) and then relieved myself in a bottle and then was then scanned straight away to see how much was left in my bladder. They compare the contents of the bottle to the scan results and came to the conclusion that all was good and I could be on my way. Everything was fine - no stinging and just a little pink urine. However, I was under the impression that my urinary flow would be much improved, but it wasn't it was worse. I didn't see the consultant today, but I asked a ward doctor if there is normally a reduced flow just after the catheter is removed. He told me that it was normal and it would get better. 14 hours later and the flow doesn't seem to be getting any better - is it still too soon? I am also urinating quite frequently, but no more blood, and just a little uncomfortable in the bladder region. I have also been told I will have to dilate the urethra. I'm wondering if anyone else has had this experience of a weak flow straight after a catheter removal after a urethrotomy? Thanks for any comments. /tees 0 likes, 3 replies "

I feel like urine is stuck or there is some stinging feeling in the penis from the tip to may be around 1 inch down. Sometimes I also feel pressure behind the testicles. My erection is always weak and short and it only gets erect with touch. As soon as I start masturbating or having intercourse I feel like I need to pee because there is so much stinging feeling in the penis so I just ejaculate. When I ejaculate or pee it feels like there is no force or strength just like I feel there is no strength in my penis. Please help me I am going to go under   because of this.

I tried clearing this with D Mannose and loads of water but when I experienced low back pain I went to the doctor with a sample.   it came back with mixed bacteria including e coli     ***He put me on 7 days of antibiotics which seem to do the trick as when I tested again everything was back to normal. However 3 days later although I had no symptoms I decided to do a test which again showed high WBC  but everything else was normal.    I do realise that sometimes these things come back but really do not want to try more antibiotics.

About 2 months ago I developed a UTI while on holiday in France (I live in London, UK). I went to see a GP who did a dipstick test and confirmed that there was blood and pus in my urine. She gave me 10 days of antibiotics (Cefixime) which I took (although admittedly, I think i missed a couple of antibiotics). After I stopped taking these, I still had symptoms so went to see a GP who prescribed me with 7 days of Nitrofurantoin. I couldn't get an appointment with my NHS GP that day so I paid to go and see a GP privately. They didn't do a dipstick test or send a urine sample off to a lab - they just went by the symptoms I described to them and gave me the antiobiotics. After finishing this course, I still felt that the infection hadn't gone away. I got an appointment with my NHS GP who sent my urine off to be cultured. It came back with a high level of bacteria and pus cells but no growth. My GP referred me to a urologist who sent me off for various tests (full bloods, cytology, scans) - everything came back normal. I also spoke to him about my most recent urine culture and he said that as there was no growth, he would not put me on antiobiotics. Instead he asked me to take D Mannose and Cranberry Tablets three times a day. I tried this for a couple of weeks but still didn't feel any better so I went back to my GP who did another urine culture and sent it off to the lab. Again, it came back with high bacteria and pus but no growth. She prescribed me another 7 day course of Nitrofurantoin, which I took, but still didn't feel any better. On Friday I went to see a urogynecologist. He suggested putting me on a long-term low dose of antibiotics - probably Nitrofurantoin. One of my main concerns is whether this will work given that i have already been on Nitrofurantoin twice (albeit a higher dose for a shorter amount of time - 7 days), and this clearly didn't work? It's also concerning that the last urine culture I had said that my infection was sensitive to Nitrofurantoin, which I took for 7 days, and the UTI still didn't clear up! The urogynecologist also did a very brief examination and said that the outside of my vagina looked quite red/sore and suggested using a thrush cream on it. Just by way of background I am a 34 year old female. I had recurrent UTIs in my 20s for a few years (brought on by intercourse). The past year or so, I have probably had 5 UTIs and I'm not sure what has brought them on as I have not been sexually active. My main symptoms are pressure on my bladder and pain when urinating. My vagina also feels very sore and irritated. I just wondered if anyone had any advice in relation to treating a very stubborn UTI that clearly won't go away? Are long-term antibiotics a good solution? I'm just worried because although I have had MANY UTIs before, I have never had one that has lasted this long. They have always cleared up after the first round of antibiotics. Thank you for taking the time to read this and as I've said before, any guidance would be greatly appreciated! x 0 likes, 17 replies "

This is the 3rd day and it's driving me mental. I've had to take the day off work because I keep having panic attacks over it. Havn't been able to sleep for days and I'm terrified.

My issue started one morning when I woke up and everything was spinning, my eyes we moving without my control and I had the urge to vomit. I thought it was just brief but then I understood that something is wrong. My girlfriend thought that I was just sleep walking again so she just ignored it 😛 but I kept complaining so to shorten the story I was vomiting on the floor while the ambulance was coming in to the house. I've spent 12 hours in the hospital doing various tests until they told me that I have vestibular neuritis so they gave me corticosteroids to take everyday for 10 days lowering the dose every time, nausea pills and set of exercises to do at home. Trip home was painful as I wasn't able to calm my eyes and had this constant feeling of Nausea. First 3 days I spend them in bed not moving or barely only to go to the bathroom until I forced myself to move, watch TV, take walks, do the vestibular exercises. My world was still spinning but I forced myself everyday to move. I did not know it at the time but little by little the things kept improving. I tried new things everyday trying to push myself even with the dizziness. I don't even know when I got to normal because I don't even know what normal feels like anymore but I can say that now after 3 months I feel perfect. Even after a month and a half I started playing football again. So my advice is start moving as soon as possible(do the vestibular exercises), fight through the dizziness it will get better, eat healthy, sleep well ,get fresh air every day and be positive!! P.S. I know it's hard but do not read the horror stories from the internet!!! It will get better!! 1 like, 0 replies "

Just some general info about myself: F, 26 years, normal weight, vegetarian for 20 years. I'll try to keep the story short but there is a lot to explain, so here goes nothing... My health problems started in the beginning of 2016 where I would feel off balance/dizzy mainly when walking which got worse when I would try to look around a lot. The feeling exactly how I felt is difficult to describe but included feelings of swaying, sometimes caught by surprise of my own movement, weak legs etc. Went to the doctor, did some usual tests and blood tests (whole blood count, iron, thyroid, liver, kidney etc.) and everything came back clear, but slight tachycardia at the time (90 bpm rest or so) so I was sent for heart tests (echo, stress test, ecg's, 24 h Holter) but nothing was found so my heart was cleared at the time. I should mention here that I did mention being a vegetarian and questioning my B12 levels, so these were checked too, but the doctor diagnosed them as being fine (which turned out to be a misdiagnosis 6 months later, at levels of 189...). Time went on, about 6 months of walking around with these symptoms, when things really got worse and I would feel very faint at times, super unbalanced when walking, very anxious, sweating a lot and chest tightness. Revisited the doctor, all the tests again were fine, except my B12 which dropped to 98 at the time. Was put on oral cyanocobalamin (4mg/day for 2 weeks and from then on 1mg/day). Despite having B12 medication things regarding my balance remained the same or got worse at days. I think it is during this time of all the worrying that I also developed an anxiety/panic disorder. Brought myself 3 times to the ER thinking something was massively wrong, because of my off balance feelings, extreme feelings of being uncomfortable in my chest (very warm, tight, heart palpitations often happening after lunch). ER did the usual tests and found nothing but high heart rate which was attributed to it being a panic attack.  That brings us to now, where I am seeing a psychiatrist for my anxiety disorder, but I believe there is a medical underlying condition that is not detected yet. During the last year I got too scared to work out thinking my balance got worse. Recently though I forced myself to go back to run 5k's which I loved doing before all of this happened. And this is when I got surprised: When I run I don't notice ANY of the symptoms. My body feels strong and I am able to pull of a 5k in about 26 mins, which is pretty decent for me considering I have not worked out in about 10 years. However, as soon also here when I am done with the run and start walking again this horrible off balance feeling is back! I can't stand this any longer. The off balance feelings I feel are always there but the severity degree is very dependent on the day or time of the day. Usually a lot worse towards the end of the day and also in the weekend which are often accompanied with some weird eye strain/headache. Also seems that when I have had bad anxiety/an attack it takes a toll on my balance that requires a couple days to go back to more normal levels, truth is the balance issues are always there in some degree or another. I am just hoping to find answers to what could be going on. Could it be permanent damage from my B12 deficiency, of course also scared of MS or some other undiagnosed disease or could it really all be part of my anxiety disorder. Are there any of you that can find themselves in these symptoms/have any tips/advice?  I'd greatly appreciate any input as it seems I can't enjoy life like I used to and want my old normal carefree life back...

Revisited the doctor, all the tests again were fine, except my B12 which dropped to 98 at the time. Was put on oral cyanocobalamin (4mg/day for 2 weeks and from then on 1mg/day). Despite having B12 medication things regarding my balance remained the same or got worse at days. I think it is during this time of all the worrying that I also developed an anxiety/panic disorder. Brought myself 3 times to the ER thinking something was massively wrong, because of my off balance feelings, extreme feelings of being uncomfortable in my chest (very warm, tight, heart palpitations often happening after lunch). ER did the usual tests and found nothing but high heart rate which was attributed to it being a panic attack.  That brings us to now, where I am seeing a psychiatrist for my anxiety disorder, but I believe there is a medical underlying condition that is not detected yet. During the last year I got too scared to work out thinking my balance got worse. Recently though I forced myself to go back to run 5k's which I loved doing before all of this happened. And this is when I got surprised: When I run I don't notice ANY of the symptoms. My body feels strong and I am able to pull of a 5k in about 26 mins, which is pretty decent for me considering I have not worked out in about 10 years. However, as soon also here when I am done with the run and start walking again this horrible off balance feeling is back! I can't stand this any longer. The off balance feelings I feel are always there but the severity degree is very dependent on the day or time of the day. Usually a lot worse towards the end of the day and also in the weekend which are often accompanied with some weird eye strain/headache. Also seems that when I have had bad anxiety/an attack it takes a toll on my balance that requires a couple days to go back to more normal levels, truth is the balance issues are always there in some degree or another. I am just hoping to find answers to what could be going on. Could it be permanent damage from my B12 deficiency, of course also scared of MS or some other undiagnosed disease or could it really all be part of my anxiety disorder. Are there any of you that can find themselves in these symptoms/have any tips/advice?  I'd greatly appreciate any input as it seems I can't enjoy life like I used to and want my old normal carefree life back... Thanks a bunch Mary   0 likes, 57 replies "

Long story short: I had chest pain (probably muscular) for a couple of days, took a long haul 30 hours flight. Two days after arriving in New Zealand I had sudden dizziness, nausea, legs weakness and such a weird brain fog/heaviness in my head as if my skull is too big for my brain. I was in a library and really just couldnt stand up. I went home immediately. Lying down didnt really help. I ended up vomiting everything and feeling like I am on a rollercoaster. I went to the ER, they said it is probably the stomach flu, gave me some iv fluids and Zofran and sent me home. Since that day which was 2.5 Weeks ago. I am dizzy with a mental fog and sometimes weird headache like heaviness or as if my skull is too big for my brain and it is just moving around combined with weird vision as if my eyes are too slow or lagging behind. Being in a moving car actually helps and running or walking quickly helps. It is worst when sitting down straight like when wanting to eat dinner or when standing still or walking slowly or being in the supermarket or in a museum. I cant find an ENT specialist around me or Neurologist since I am in rural NZ so I was wondering if this sounds familiar to anyone and if you ve got tips and maybe some hope to share. Needless to say this is ruining my lifetime vacation that I quit my job for. Thank you 0 likes, 2 replies "

It only happens for approximately 5 seconds and when I understand that I'm experiencing a dizziness episode I can sort of just snap myself out of it and then everything is back to normal. I don't think its BPPV as i dont make any sudden headmovements before these attacks happen. I'm worried that what Im experiencing is a seizure of some sort?

There are no other symptoms to report. Recently she has banged her head at school, strangely we get 2 to 3 calls per month from her school informing us that she has banged her head in PE or in class, my wife and I are becoming worried that it's happening too often. After she hit her head, she was conscious each time and this time I can't see any lumps or cuts. I can only assume that her dizziness has been caused by her banging her head too often? if she continues to have  dizziness , what should I do? I took her to the doctor this morning and she didn't say much, just said there is nothing to worry about and didn't even give me any advice or things to look out for if the problem progresses 0 likes, 3 replies "

I think whoever it was also mentioned how often you should do it, and how long you need to continue. I'd be very grateful if you'd post again. As I'm suffering from BPPV - not for the first time - and was made thoroughly ill by the Epley manoeuvre when it was performed on me nearly 30 years ago, I thought I'd try the half-somersault manoeuvre while waiting for my physio appointment next week. I admit it took me a long time to psych myself up to try it, as I'm in my 70s, live alone and didn't want to make the vertigo worse again. Anyway, I studied the recommended video and did the manoeuvre five times at 15-minute intervals, as suggested. At the end of that time, I was suffering mild instability and ""sea-sickness"" but nothing approaching my post-Epley state. I've just done the Dix-Hallpike test now, and have found - somewhat to my surprise - that although it provoked an attack of spinning, it was slower and briefer than it's been to date. I therefore suspect I might be onto something. The inventor of the manoeuvre suggests in the video that the vertigo should disappear instantly, but that certainly hasn't happened in my case. Other sites hint that it should be repeated over a longer period, but don't give any clear instructions. Please could that helpful poster tell me how often I should do it, and how long I should keep it up in the hope of a full recovery? And thanks a million for your original post! 0 likes, 31 replies "

I don't know where else to go, and was hoping someone could please help me. I'll start off by saying I'm a 23 year old Caucasian female. Going on 5 months now, I have had absolutely debilitating symptoms which have hindered my daily life. I feel these symptoms every moment of every day.  It started with   and a persistent brain fog. I just thought I had a bug, and tried to go on about my life. However, my symptoms have never gone away. This ""brain fog"" I am talking about is a feeling of complete mental confusion, I have no memory, I cannot concentrate on anything, it feels like there's a dark blanket on my brain clouding all my thoughts. I have extreme disorientation and haziness. I feel like I'm always in a dream like state.  I am constantly dizzy and feel a pulling sensation, as if I'm ready to fall over at any moment. It feels like there's air inside my head, and I'm always very lightheaded. Whenever I try to drive I feel this pulling sensation pulling me down.  Another problem I have is with my vision. I am having very blurred vision and have double vision. Everytime I look at something up close it is extremely blurry and I cannot see at all. My perception on things has completely changed. I feel like everything looks very odd and strange and I don't have the right depth perception. It's like I'm in a horrible dream like state all the time.  I have been having headaches and head pressure as well, and having horrible pains behind my eyes. The pin starts from the back of my head close to my neck and continues up my head and the sides of my temples. My eyes hurt so bad, and it feels like knives are jabbing my eyes. My head also feels extremely heavy all the time.  All these symptoms have been causing me severe  , and I have been having panic attacks from them and feel like I'm dying. It is causing a strange disrespity sensation, where I feel like I'm not even here anymore and there's a detachment from myself and my body. I have had to drop all my classes at college and quit my job because these symptoms make me lay in bed all day long. I have been unable to drive for months and can barely get up to walk around. If anyone could please help me or know anything as a suggestion to try.  I have been to my general doctor, 2 ENTs, 1 neurologist, have had 2 MRIs, a hearing test, VNG, multiple  , and no one knows what is wrong. I can't live like this anymore. Any help is greatly appreciated.  -Elise  10 likes, 1658 replies "

I have had   since early last year. My doctor thinks it's affecting my ear/inner ear because I have been having balance problems, not a spinning sensation but as if the floor is moving up and down. Some days it's worse than others, but either way I hate it. Some things that trigger the balance issues are walking in the dark, open spaces like malls and stores, watching cars move, watching crowds move... and sometimes riding in the car makes me woozy. The nurse cleaned my ears a few weeks ago and when she was cleaning my left ear I got SO dizzy and off balance, but a few minutes after she was done I felt so good, like the best I've felt in forever, but the symptoms were back the next day. I've also noticed I can't lay down or sleep on my left side without getting dizzy. I get occasional ringing in my ears but my hearing has always been fine. Does this sound like an inner ear disorder?

I’ll be seeing an endo at the memorial Sloan Kettering center in NYC on July 3rd, but before then I have to complete my third 24 hour free cortisol test, a saliva test, a full pituitary blood workup, and the dexamethasone suppression test. I’m very concerned about what has been going on with my health over the last few years and am anxious but hoping I will finally get some answers. My story is long and complicated, as I’m sure everyones is here, so apologies! I’m hoping I can get some opinions as my case seems to have stumped my previous drs and other drs just wrote me off as crazy.  I can’t remember the exact year I started changing, but I would say I noticed mild changes in 2014. I’m 5’0 and was always a thin-average petite girl. I started noticing body composition changes, I was always a pear shape but suddenly seemed to start getting a belly. I always had a very flat nice stomach. I blamed my desk job, long commute, and bad eating habits. Living in NYC, I basically subsisted on takeout. I had other weird symptoms though like muscle weakness starting in my thighs and arms, back pain too. Sometimes I was in pain for weeks then it would just go away. I thought maybe it was the way I was sleeping weird or something. I started developing aura migraines and everyday general headaches as well. Pain and pressure behind the eyes, like eye strain. I started thinking my apartment had toxic mold or something. I just felt wrong.  In 2015 I started gaining weight and lost a lot of energy. I was always around 110-115 lbs but now was around 125 lbs, so not a crazy amount but my body just looked different. It was all flab, no muscle, jiggly weird cellulite covered belly. I tried losing it but couldn’t. I blamed myself again and not working out enough. I started getting hot flashes and my face would flush. I always had rosy cheeks and was told I had rosacea so that isn’t anything new but the flushing was. I also started getting night sweats and sleep disturbances once in a while. I would have no issue falling asleep, but would instantly enter REM stage and dream but wake up every hour or two all night long. Then it would just go away and I’d sleep like normal.  I started losing my sex drive and blamed my appearance on it and depression. My moods started going crazy. I started having rage episodes, mood swings, severe crippling anxiety (like becoming agoraphobic anxiety), paranoia, depression. My body felt so weak and heavy in my limbs, I just kept blaming depression.  In 2016 same symptoms but all intensified. I noticed I think around this time that my hair was thinning, however a coworker passed away and I assumed it was telogen effluvium from stress. As my moods continued to go haywire, I started noticing my skin and face just seemed different. I was bruising very easily, my face looked puffier but not like full on moon face. My skin all over seemed like it was losing collagen, just thin and crepey. Still had zero motivation and weak muscles. Felt horrible all year and became convinced I was entering some type of early perimenopause.  In 2017 things continued to worsen. Sleep disturbances happened on a regular basis, headaches, zero sex drive, mood issues, horrific anger outbursts, digestive issues, hair loss, severe depression, muscle weakness, no energy. I knew something was wrong with my hormones because things were going well in my life aside from all these weird health issues and I went to see my gyno to have hormones tested. This is after two years telling my gp that I wasn’t well to only be written off as crazy or having fibromyalgia.  My hormones were checked for run of the mill female hormones, fsh, LH, prolactin, etc. my total testosterone was mildly high and my prolactin was high. Free testosterone was normal. Prolactin was retested and came back in range. I was told I was fine. I continued on and just got worse.  At this point I was around 135 lbs. I started a restrictive diet bordering on an eating disorder and could only lose a pound or two only to just gain it back the next few days. My hair seemed to be getting noticeably thinner in November and I couldn’t ignore it anymore. I started collecting it in a baggy and saw my nurse practitioner in December. I explained all my issues and was told I needed psychiatric help, antidepressants, to stop stressing, and my hair was not balding. I left p****d off. Also was told I was fixated too much on my weight. At this point it was found my cholesterol went up, which was unusual for me.  In Jan. 2018 I went on a vacation and caught the flu. I was so sick with a very high fever. I thought I was going to die. My boyfriend barely got sick even though we were in very close quarters. After the flu I’ve never been the same. All my symptoms exploded. I’ve had sleep disturbances since, I do not sleep anymore and if I do I’m tense and dreaming. I wake up after what seems like hours and it’s been 20 minutes. I started becoming   end of feb. And spent so much money on cabs because if I went down to the subway I was scared I would jump. In March I couldn’t even have strength to carry groceries. I developed a week long massive headache and afterwards my hair started falling out in clumps. It is official now, I am balding. It started with just my sides then the temples. Now it’s diffuse and I lost well over half my hair, weeellllll over. I put extensions in and it is not helping anymore. Just the last week, I lost so much hair. Like 400 strands a day. My hair is gone.  At this point I was already seeing an endo for the prolactin. She did an MRI of my pituitary and it was unremarkable. My total testosterone came back high but my free T always normal and my sex hormone binding globulin was high, at one point off the range high. She thought I was on birth control but I wasn’t. TSH normal, thyroid antibodies normal, Free T3 normal. I asked her to test cortisol and she said I didn’t look cushingnoid but it does take years to take on the appearance so she did an am blood test. My result was 21.6 with top range being 22. She had me do a 24 hour urine and the result was 48.something with top being 50.  I started developing in April long vellus hair all over my body and face. Like, all over. My forehead, cheeks, back, breasts, thighs, stomach. I was always pretty hairless my whole life. This is freaking me out. I was diagnosed with insulin resistance and pre-diabetes. My blood pressure was up a bit when I usually have low. The other odd thing is that now I am dropping weight like crazy. I’m only 103 lbs now and I have nooo muscle left on me but still have a flabby fat belly. My bones hurt even sitting on a cushion. There’s no muscle.  I’ve seen REs who told me I had pcos. Had cystic ovaries and then didn’t on a second scan. Had one endo take back their pcos diagnosis, tell me I’m just crazy and that I have an eating disorder. I don’t.  I had my gp test my am cortisol again and it was almost 50 with top range being 22. Was told it was stress. My CBC had high red blood cells, high hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Low lymphocytes and high neutrophils. Saw a hematologist who said high neutrophils could be from high cortisol. He didn’t believe I had pcos. Thought stress.   Most of my endos and drs washed their hands of me but I am not well! I did have a ct scan too of my adrenals Bc my DHEA-S shot up so I demanded one. Adrenals were fine but they found a benign tumor on my kidney and a cyst on my liver.  I’m balding, growing weird long vellus hair all over, weak, not sleeping, mood issues, anxious, falling apart. I haven’t been to work since April. I can no longer function. My boss recommended this pituitary and adrenal specialist and I faxed all my labs to herald was told she’d review and let me know if she wants to see me. I found out the other day that she wants to see me and is having me take all the cushing’s tests.  I’m so scared this is like an ectopic tumor and is cancer. Why am I losing weight when I couldn’t budge it before? My hair is gone. I’m so depressed. I had very thick hair even when it was thinning, it was thick. There’s nothing left. I feel so sick all the time. I used to be an active person who had dreams and desires in life. I’m just a husk of what I used to be. My life is in shambles and I don’t understand why no one helped me years ago. No one listened. My family all see it now and are doing everything they can to help.  I know this is not pcos. I have normal menstrual cycles and did for 20 years. Never had any signs of pcos. I have so many signs of high cortisol and cushings. The only difference is now I’m thin, flabby but thin. I was working with a trainer too who thought this seemed weird. I was dropping weight but body fat was going up so I was losing muscle even though I was weight lifting. I had to stop because in May I became too weak.  I want this nightmare to end. I also developed dry flaky skin and my cuts are not healing well. I actually got my ear pierced and have had 8 piercings with never an infection. Tattoos with zero infection. After my unremarkable ct scan I thought I’d go get my ear pierced because maybe I am nuts. Maybe the drs are right and I am losing my mind and it’s pcos. I was worried it wouldn’t heal but did it. Was fine for a couple weeks then I developed perichondritis I think it’s called or cellulitis. Had to go to the ER twice in the same night. Was told to take two different antibiotics and if it didn’t get better I needed to be admitted. My body is not the same. I’m scared. I want my life back and my hair. I’m so scared and depressed. I do t wang to die from cancer either. I just want help and answers. This can’t be normal. I know I used to feel healthy and energetic and was not balding and did not have weird mood issues and sleep issues.  Thank you for reading if you did. Anyone have any advice? Am I crazy? Is this pcos? Every pcos forum I joined, I feel rejected from. No one connects with my symptoms.  0 likes, 2 replies "

I explained all my issues and was told I needed psychiatric help, antidepressants, to stop stressing, and my hair was not balding. I left p****d off. Also was told I was fixated too much on my weight. At this point it was found my cholesterol went up, which was unusual for me.  In Jan. 2018 I went on a vacation and caught the flu. I was so sick with a very high fever. I thought I was going to die. My boyfriend barely got sick even though we were in very close quarters. After the flu I’ve never been the same. All my symptoms exploded. I’ve had sleep disturbances since, I do not sleep anymore and if I do I’m tense and dreaming. I wake up after what seems like hours and it’s been 20 minutes. I started becoming   end of feb. And spent so much money on cabs because if I went down to the subway I was scared I would jump. In March I couldn’t even have strength to carry groceries. I developed a week long massive headache and afterwards my hair started falling out in clumps. It is official now, I am balding. It started with just my sides then the temples. Now it’s diffuse and I lost well over half my hair, weeellllll over. I put extensions in and it is not helping anymore. Just the last week, I lost so much hair. Like 400 strands a day. My hair is gone.  At this point I was already seeing an endo for the prolactin. She did an MRI of my pituitary and it was unremarkable. My total testosterone came back high but my free T always normal and my sex hormone binding globulin was high, at one point off the range high. She thought I was on birth control but I wasn’t. TSH normal, thyroid antibodies normal, Free T3 normal. I asked her to test cortisol and she said I didn’t look cushingnoid but it does take years to take on the appearance so she did an am blood test. My result was 21.6 with top range being 22. She had me do a 24 hour urine and the result was 48.something with top being 50.  I started developing in April long vellus hair all over my body and face. Like, all over. My forehead, cheeks, back, breasts, thighs, stomach. I was always pretty hairless my whole life. This is freaking me out. I was diagnosed with insulin resistance and pre-diabetes. My blood pressure was up a bit when I usually have low. The other odd thing is that now I am dropping weight like crazy. I’m only 103 lbs now and I have nooo muscle left on me but still have a flabby fat belly. My bones hurt even sitting on a cushion. There’s no muscle.  I’ve seen REs who told me I had pcos. Had cystic ovaries and then didn’t on a second scan. Had one endo take back their pcos diagnosis, tell me I’m just crazy and that I have an eating disorder. I don’t.  I had my gp test my am cortisol again and it was almost 50 with top range being 22. Was told it was stress. My CBC had high red blood cells, high hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Low lymphocytes and high neutrophils. Saw a hematologist who said high neutrophils could be from high cortisol. He didn’t believe I had pcos. Thought stress.   Most of my endos and drs washed their hands of me but I am not well! I did have a ct scan too of my adrenals Bc my DHEA-S shot up so I demanded one. Adrenals were fine but they found a benign tumor on my kidney and a cyst on my liver.  I’m balding, growing weird long vellus hair all over, weak, not sleeping, mood issues, anxious, falling apart. I haven’t been to work since April. I can no longer function. My boss recommended this pituitary and adrenal specialist and I faxed all my labs to herald was told she’d review and let me know if she wants to see me. I found out the other day that she wants to see me and is having me take all the cushing’s tests.  I’m so scared this is like an ectopic tumor and is cancer. Why am I losing weight when I couldn’t budge it before? My hair is gone. I’m so depressed. I had very thick hair even when it was thinning, it was thick. There’s nothing left. I feel so sick all the time. I used to be an active person who had dreams and desires in life. I’m just a husk of what I used to be. My life is in shambles and I don’t understand why no one helped me years ago. No one listened. My family all see it now and are doing everything they can to help.  I know this is not pcos. I have normal menstrual cycles and did for 20 years. Never had any signs of pcos. I have so many signs of high cortisol and cushings. The only difference is now I’m thin, flabby but thin. I was working with a trainer too who thought this seemed weird. I was dropping weight but body fat was going up so I was losing muscle even though I was weight lifting. I had to stop because in May I became too weak.  I want this nightmare to end. I also developed dry flaky skin and my cuts are not healing well. I actually got my ear pierced and have had 8 piercings with never an infection. Tattoos with zero infection. After my unremarkable ct scan I thought I’d go get my ear pierced because maybe I am nuts. Maybe the drs are right and I am losing my mind and it’s pcos. I was worried it wouldn’t heal but did it. Was fine for a couple weeks then I developed perichondritis I think it’s called or cellulitis. Had to go to the ER twice in the same night. Was told to take two different antibiotics and if it didn’t get better I needed to be admitted. My body is not the same. I’m scared. I want my life back and my hair. I’m so scared and depressed. I do t wang to die from cancer either. I just want help and answers. This can’t be normal. I know I used to feel healthy and energetic and was not balding and did not have weird mood issues and sleep issues.  Thank you for reading if you did. Anyone have any advice? Am I crazy? Is this pcos? Every pcos forum I joined, I feel rejected from. No one connects with my symptoms.  0 likes, 2 replies "

I’ll be seeing an endo at the memorial Sloan Kettering center in NYC on July 3rd, but before then I have to complete my third 24 hour free cortisol test, a saliva test, a full pituitary blood workup, and the dexamethasone suppression test. I’m very concerned about what has been going on with my health over the last few years and am anxious but hoping I will finally get some answers. My story is long and complicated, as I’m sure everyones is here, so apologies! I’m hoping I can get some opinions as my case seems to have stumped my previous drs and other drs just wrote me off as crazy.  I can’t remember the exact year I started changing, but I would say I noticed mild changes in 2014. I’m 5’0 and was always a thin-average petite girl. I started noticing body composition changes, I was always a pear shape but suddenly seemed to start getting a belly. I always had a very flat nice stomach. I blamed my desk job, long commute, and bad eating habits. Living in NYC, I basically subsisted on takeout. I had other weird symptoms though like muscle weakness starting in my thighs and arms, back pain too. Sometimes I was in pain for weeks then it would just go away. I thought maybe it was the way I was sleeping weird or something. I started developing aura migraines and everyday general headaches as well. Pain and pressure behind the eyes, like eye strain. I started thinking my apartment had toxic mold or something. I just felt wrong.  In 2015 I started gaining weight and lost a lot of energy. I was always around 110-115 lbs but now was around 125 lbs, so not a crazy amount but my body just looked different. It was all flab, no muscle, jiggly weird cellulite covered belly. I tried losing it but couldn’t. I blamed myself again and not working out enough. I started getting hot flashes and my face would flush. I always had rosy cheeks and was told I had rosacea so that isn’t anything new but the flushing was. I also started getting night sweats and sleep disturbances once in a while. I would have no issue falling asleep, but would instantly enter REM stage and dream but wake up every hour or two all night long. Then it would just go away and I’d sleep like normal.  I started losing my sex drive and blamed my appearance on it and depression. My moods started going crazy. I started having rage episodes, mood swings, severe crippling anxiety (like becoming agoraphobic anxiety), paranoia, depression. My body felt so weak and heavy in my limbs, I just kept blaming depression.  In 2016 same symptoms but all intensified. I noticed I think around this time that my hair was thinning, however a coworker passed away and I assumed it was telogen effluvium from stress. As my moods continued to go haywire, I started noticing my skin and face just seemed different. I was bruising very easily, my face looked puffier but not like full on moon face. My skin all over seemed like it was losing collagen, just thin and crepey. Still had zero motivation and weak muscles. Felt horrible all year and became convinced I was entering some type of early perimenopause.  In 2017 things continued to worsen. Sleep disturbances happened on a regular basis, headaches, zero sex drive, mood issues, horrific anger outbursts, digestive issues, hair loss, severe depression, muscle weakness, no energy. I knew something was wrong with my hormones because things were going well in my life aside from all these weird health issues and I went to see my gyno to have hormones tested. This is after two years telling my gp that I wasn’t well to only be written off as crazy or having fibromyalgia.  My hormones were checked for run of the mill female hormones, fsh, LH, prolactin, etc. my total testosterone was mildly high and my prolactin was high. Free testosterone was normal. Prolactin was retested and came back in range. I was told I was fine. I continued on and just got worse.  At this point I was around 135 lbs.

As my moods continued to go haywire, I started noticing my skin and face just seemed different. I was bruising very easily, my face looked puffier but not like full on moon face. My skin all over seemed like it was losing collagen, just thin and crepey. Still had zero motivation and weak muscles. Felt horrible all year and became convinced I was entering some type of early perimenopause.  In 2017 things continued to worsen. Sleep disturbances happened on a regular basis, headaches, zero sex drive, mood issues, horrific anger outbursts, digestive issues, hair loss, severe depression, muscle weakness, no energy. I knew something was wrong with my hormones because things were going well in my life aside from all these weird health issues and I went to see my gyno to have hormones tested. This is after two years telling my gp that I wasn’t well to only be written off as crazy or having fibromyalgia.  My hormones were checked for run of the mill female hormones, fsh, LH, prolactin, etc. my total testosterone was mildly high and my prolactin was high. Free testosterone was normal. Prolactin was retested and came back in range. I was told I was fine. I continued on and just got worse.  At this point I was around 135 lbs. I started a restrictive diet bordering on an eating disorder and could only lose a pound or two only to just gain it back the next few days. My hair seemed to be getting noticeably thinner in November and I couldn’t ignore it anymore. I started collecting it in a baggy and saw my nurse practitioner in December. I explained all my issues and was told I needed psychiatric help, antidepressants, to stop stressing, and my hair was not balding. I left p****d off. Also was told I was fixated too much on my weight. At this point it was found my cholesterol went up, which was unusual for me.  In Jan. 2018 I went on a vacation and caught the flu. I was so sick with a very high fever. I thought I was going to die. My boyfriend barely got sick even though we were in very close quarters. After the flu I’ve never been the same. All my symptoms exploded. I’ve had sleep disturbances since, I do not sleep anymore and if I do I’m tense and dreaming. I wake up after what seems like hours and it’s been 20 minutes. I started becoming   end of feb. And spent so much money on cabs because if I went down to the subway I was scared I would jump. In March I couldn’t even have strength to carry groceries. I developed a week long massive headache and afterwards my hair started falling out in clumps. It is official now, I am balding. It started with just my sides then the temples. Now it’s diffuse and I lost well over half my hair, weeellllll over. I put extensions in and it is not helping anymore. Just the last week, I lost so much hair. Like 400 strands a day. My hair is gone.  At this point I was already seeing an endo for the prolactin. She did an MRI of my pituitary and it was unremarkable. My total testosterone came back high but my free T always normal and my sex hormone binding globulin was high, at one point off the range high. She thought I was on birth control but I wasn’t. TSH normal, thyroid antibodies normal, Free T3 normal. I asked her to test cortisol and she said I didn’t look cushingnoid but it does take years to take on the appearance so she did an am blood test. My result was 21.6 with top range being 22. She had me do a 24 hour urine and the result was 48.something with top being 50.  I started developing in April long vellus hair all over my body and face. Like, all over. My forehead, cheeks, back, breasts, thighs, stomach. I was always pretty hairless my whole life. This is freaking me out. I was diagnosed with insulin resistance and pre-diabetes. My blood pressure was up a bit when I usually have low. The other odd thing is that now I am dropping weight like crazy. I’m only 103 lbs now and I have nooo muscle left on me but still have a flabby fat belly. My bones hurt even sitting on a cushion. There’s no muscle.  I’ve seen REs who told me I had pcos. Had cystic ovaries and then didn’t on a second scan. Had one endo take back their pcos diagnosis, tell me I’m just crazy and that I have an eating disorder. I don’t.  I had my gp test my am cortisol again and it was almost 50 with top range being 22. Was told it was stress. My CBC had high red blood cells, high hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Low lymphocytes and high neutrophils. Saw a hematologist who said high neutrophils could be from high cortisol. He didn’t believe I had pcos. Thought stress.   Most of my endos and drs washed their hands of me but I am not well! I did have a ct scan too of my adrenals Bc my DHEA-S shot up so I demanded one. Adrenals were fine but they found a benign tumor on my kidney and a cyst on my liver.  I’m balding, growing weird long vellus hair all over, weak, not sleeping, mood issues, anxious, falling apart. I haven’t been to work since April. I can no longer function. My boss recommended this pituitary and adrenal specialist and I faxed all my labs to herald was told she’d review and let me know if she wants to see me. I found out the other day that she wants to see me and is having me take all the cushing’s tests.  I’m so scared this is like an ectopic tumor and is cancer. Why am I losing weight when I couldn’t budge it before? My hair is gone. I’m so depressed. I had very thick hair even when it was thinning, it was thick. There’s nothing left. I feel so sick all the time. I used to be an active person who had dreams and desires in life. I’m just a husk of what I used to be. My life is in shambles and I don’t understand why no one helped me years ago. No one listened. My family all see it now and are doing everything they can to help.  I know this is not pcos. I have normal menstrual cycles and did for 20 years. Never had any signs of pcos. I have so many signs of high cortisol and cushings. The only difference is now I’m thin, flabby but thin. I was working with a trainer too who thought this seemed weird. I was dropping weight but body fat was going up so I was losing muscle even though I was weight lifting. I had to stop because in May I became too weak.  I want this nightmare to end. I also developed dry flaky skin and my cuts are not healing well. I actually got my ear pierced and have had 8 piercings with never an infection. Tattoos with zero infection. After my unremarkable ct scan I thought I’d go get my ear pierced because maybe I am nuts. Maybe the drs are right and I am losing my mind and it’s pcos. I was worried it wouldn’t heal but did it. Was fine for a couple weeks then I developed perichondritis I think it’s called or cellulitis. Had to go to the ER twice in the same night. Was told to take two different antibiotics and if it didn’t get better I needed to be admitted. My body is not the same. I’m scared. I want my life back and my hair. I’m so scared and depressed. I do t wang to die from cancer either. I just want help and answers. This can’t be normal. I know I used to feel healthy and energetic and was not balding and did not have weird mood issues and sleep issues.  Thank you for reading if you did. Anyone have any advice? Am I crazy? Is this pcos? Every pcos forum I joined, I feel rejected from. No one connects with my symptoms.  0 likes, 2 replies "

I’ll be seeing an endo at the memorial Sloan Kettering center in NYC on July 3rd, but before then I have to complete my third 24 hour free cortisol test, a saliva test, a full pituitary blood workup, and the dexamethasone suppression test.

My story is long and complicated, as I’m sure everyones is here, so apologies! I’m hoping I can get some opinions as my case seems to have stumped my previous drs and other drs just wrote me off as crazy.  I can’t remember the exact year I started changing, but I would say I noticed mild changes in 2014. I’m 5’0 and was always a thin-average petite girl. I started noticing body composition changes, I was always a pear shape but suddenly seemed to start getting a belly. I always had a very flat nice stomach. I blamed my desk job, long commute, and bad eating habits. Living in NYC, I basically subsisted on takeout. I had other weird symptoms though like muscle weakness starting in my thighs and arms, back pain too. Sometimes I was in pain for weeks then it would just go away. I thought maybe it was the way I was sleeping weird or something. I started developing aura migraines and everyday general headaches as well. Pain and pressure behind the eyes, like eye strain. I started thinking my apartment had toxic mold or something. I just felt wrong.  In 2015 I started gaining weight and lost a lot of energy. I was always around 110-115 lbs but now was around 125 lbs, so not a crazy amount but my body just looked different. It was all flab, no muscle, jiggly weird cellulite covered belly. I tried losing it but couldn’t. I blamed myself again and not working out enough. I started getting hot flashes and my face would flush. I always had rosy cheeks and was told I had rosacea so that isn’t anything new but the flushing was. I also started getting night sweats and sleep disturbances once in a while. I would have no issue falling asleep, but would instantly enter REM stage and dream but wake up every hour or two all night long. Then it would just go away and I’d sleep like normal.  I started losing my sex drive and blamed my appearance on it and depression. My moods started going crazy.

I started thinking my apartment had toxic mold or something. I just felt wrong.  In 2015 I started gaining weight and lost a lot of energy. I was always around 110-115 lbs but now was around 125 lbs, so not a crazy amount but my body just looked different. It was all flab, no muscle, jiggly weird cellulite covered belly. I tried losing it but couldn’t. I blamed myself again and not working out enough. I started getting hot flashes and my face would flush. I always had rosy cheeks and was told I had rosacea so that isn’t anything new but the flushing was. I also started getting night sweats and sleep disturbances once in a while. I would have no issue falling asleep, but would instantly enter REM stage and dream but wake up every hour or two all night long. Then it would just go away and I’d sleep like normal.  I started losing my sex drive and blamed my appearance on it and depression. My moods started going crazy. I started having rage episodes, mood swings, severe crippling anxiety (like becoming agoraphobic anxiety), paranoia, depression. My body felt so weak and heavy in my limbs, I just kept blaming depression.  In 2016 same symptoms but all intensified. I noticed I think around this time that my hair was thinning, however a coworker passed away and I assumed it was telogen effluvium from stress. As my moods continued to go haywire, I started noticing my skin and face just seemed different. I was bruising very easily, my face looked puffier but not like full on moon face. My skin all over seemed like it was losing collagen, just thin and crepey. Still had zero motivation and weak muscles. Felt horrible all year and became convinced I was entering some type of early perimenopause.  In 2017 things continued to worsen. Sleep disturbances happened on a regular basis, headaches, zero sex drive, mood issues, horrific anger outbursts, digestive issues, hair loss, severe depression, muscle weakness, no energy. I knew something was wrong with my hormones because things were going well in my life aside from all these weird health issues and I went to see my gyno to have hormones tested. This is after two years telling my gp that I wasn’t well to only be written off as crazy or having fibromyalgia.  My hormones were checked for run of the mill female hormones, fsh, LH, prolactin, etc. my total testosterone was mildly high and my prolactin was high. Free testosterone was normal. Prolactin was retested and came back in range. I was told I was fine. I continued on and just got worse.  At this point I was around 135 lbs. I started a restrictive diet bordering on an eating disorder and could only lose a pound or two only to just gain it back the next few days. My hair seemed to be getting noticeably thinner in November and I couldn’t ignore it anymore. I started collecting it in a baggy and saw my nurse practitioner in December. I explained all my issues and was told I needed psychiatric help, antidepressants, to stop stressing, and my hair was not balding. I left p****d off. Also was told I was fixated too much on my weight. At this point it was found my cholesterol went up, which was unusual for me.  In Jan. 2018 I went on a vacation and caught the flu. I was so sick with a very high fever. I thought I was going to die. My boyfriend barely got sick even though we were in very close quarters. After the flu I’ve never been the same. All my symptoms exploded. I’ve had sleep disturbances since, I do not sleep anymore and if I do I’m tense and dreaming. I wake up after what seems like hours and it’s been 20 minutes. I started becoming   end of feb. And spent so much money on cabs because if I went down to the subway I was scared I would jump. In March I couldn’t even have strength to carry groceries. I developed a week long massive headache and afterwards my hair started falling out in clumps. It is official now, I am balding. It started with just my sides then the temples. Now it’s diffuse and I lost well over half my hair, weeellllll over. I put extensions in and it is not helping anymore. Just the last week, I lost so much hair. Like 400 strands a day. My hair is gone.  At this point I was already seeing an endo for the prolactin. She did an MRI of my pituitary and it was unremarkable. My total testosterone came back high but my free T always normal and my sex hormone binding globulin was high, at one point off the range high. She thought I was on birth control but I wasn’t. TSH normal, thyroid antibodies normal, Free T3 normal. I asked her to test cortisol and she said I didn’t look cushingnoid but it does take years to take on the appearance so she did an am blood test. My result was 21.6 with top range being 22. She had me do a 24 hour urine and the result was 48.something with top being 50.  I started developing in April long vellus hair all over my body and face. Like, all over. My forehead, cheeks, back, breasts, thighs, stomach. I was always pretty hairless my whole life. This is freaking me out. I was diagnosed with insulin resistance and pre-diabetes. My blood pressure was up a bit when I usually have low. The other odd thing is that now I am dropping weight like crazy. I’m only 103 lbs now and I have nooo muscle left on me but still have a flabby fat belly. My bones hurt even sitting on a cushion. There’s no muscle.  I’ve seen REs who told me I had pcos. Had cystic ovaries and then didn’t on a second scan. Had one endo take back their pcos diagnosis, tell me I’m just crazy and that I have an eating disorder. I don’t.  I had my gp test my am cortisol again and it was almost 50 with top range being 22. Was told it was stress. My CBC had high red blood cells, high hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Low lymphocytes and high neutrophils. Saw a hematologist who said high neutrophils could be from high cortisol. He didn’t believe I had pcos. Thought stress.   Most of my endos and drs washed their hands of me but I am not well! I did have a ct scan too of my adrenals Bc my DHEA-S shot up so I demanded one. Adrenals were fine but they found a benign tumor on my kidney and a cyst on my liver.  I’m balding, growing weird long vellus hair all over, weak, not sleeping, mood issues, anxious, falling apart. I haven’t been to work since April. I can no longer function. My boss recommended this pituitary and adrenal specialist and I faxed all my labs to herald was told she’d review and let me know if she wants to see me. I found out the other day that she wants to see me and is having me take all the cushing’s tests.  I’m so scared this is like an ectopic tumor and is cancer. Why am I losing weight when I couldn’t budge it before? My hair is gone. I’m so depressed. I had very thick hair even when it was thinning, it was thick. There’s nothing left. I feel so sick all the time. I used to be an active person who had dreams and desires in life. I’m just a husk of what I used to be. My life is in shambles and I don’t understand why no one helped me years ago. No one listened. My family all see it now and are doing everything they can to help.  I know this is not pcos. I have normal menstrual cycles and did for 20 years. Never had any signs of pcos. I have so many signs of high cortisol and cushings. The only difference is now I’m thin, flabby but thin. I was working with a trainer too who thought this seemed weird. I was dropping weight but body fat was going up so I was losing muscle even though I was weight lifting. I had to stop because in May I became too weak.  I want this nightmare to end. I also developed dry flaky skin and my cuts are not healing well. I actually got my ear pierced and have had 8 piercings with never an infection. Tattoos with zero infection. After my unremarkable ct scan I thought I’d go get my ear pierced because maybe I am nuts. Maybe the drs are right and I am losing my mind and it’s pcos. I was worried it wouldn’t heal but did it. Was fine for a couple weeks then I developed perichondritis I think it’s called or cellulitis. Had to go to the ER twice in the same night. Was told to take two different antibiotics and if it didn’t get better I needed to be admitted. My body is not the same. I’m scared. I want my life back and my hair. I’m so scared and depressed. I do t wang to die from cancer either. I just want help and answers. This can’t be normal. I know I used to feel healthy and energetic and was not balding and did not have weird mood issues and sleep issues.  Thank you for reading if you did. Anyone have any advice? Am I crazy? Is this pcos? Every pcos forum I joined, I feel rejected from. No one connects with my symptoms.  0 likes, 2 replies "

I’ll be seeing an endo at the memorial Sloan Kettering center in NYC on July 3rd, but before then I have to complete my third 24 hour free cortisol test, a saliva test, a full pituitary blood workup, and the dexamethasone suppression test. I’m very concerned about what has been going on with my health over the last few years and am anxious but hoping I will finally get some answers. My story is long and complicated, as I’m sure everyones is here, so apologies! I’m hoping I can get some opinions as my case seems to have stumped my previous drs and other drs just wrote me off as crazy.  I can’t remember the exact year I started changing, but I would say I noticed mild changes in 2014. I’m 5’0 and was always a thin-average petite girl. I started noticing body composition changes, I was always a pear shape but suddenly seemed to start getting a belly. I always had a very flat nice stomach. I blamed my desk job, long commute, and bad eating habits. Living in NYC, I basically subsisted on takeout. I had other weird symptoms though like muscle weakness starting in my thighs and arms, back pain too. Sometimes I was in pain for weeks then it would just go away. I thought maybe it was the way I was sleeping weird or something. I started developing aura migraines and everyday general headaches as well. Pain and pressure behind the eyes, like eye strain. I started thinking my apartment had toxic mold or something. I just felt wrong.  In 2015 I started gaining weight and lost a lot of energy. I was always around 110-115 lbs but now was around 125 lbs, so not a crazy amount but my body just looked different. It was all flab, no muscle, jiggly weird cellulite covered belly. I tried losing it but couldn’t. I blamed myself again and not working out enough. I started getting hot flashes and my face would flush. I always had rosy cheeks and was told I had rosacea so that isn’t anything new but the flushing was. I also started getting night sweats and sleep disturbances once in a while. I would have no issue falling asleep, but would instantly enter REM stage and dream but wake up every hour or two all night long. Then it would just go away and I’d sleep like normal.  I started losing my sex drive and blamed my appearance on it and depression. My moods started going crazy. I started having rage episodes, mood swings, severe crippling anxiety (like becoming agoraphobic anxiety), paranoia, depression. My body felt so weak and heavy in my limbs, I just kept blaming depression.  In 2016 same symptoms but all intensified. I noticed I think around this time that my hair was thinning, however a coworker passed away and I assumed it was telogen effluvium from stress. As my moods continued to go haywire, I started noticing my skin and face just seemed different. I was bruising very easily, my face looked puffier but not like full on moon face. My skin all over seemed like it was losing collagen, just thin and crepey. Still had zero motivation and weak muscles. Felt horrible all year and became convinced I was entering some type of early perimenopause.  In 2017 things continued to worsen. Sleep disturbances happened on a regular basis, headaches, zero sex drive, mood issues, horrific anger outbursts, digestive issues, hair loss, severe depression, muscle weakness, no energy. I knew something was wrong with my hormones because things were going well in my life aside from all these weird health issues and I went to see my gyno to have hormones tested. This is after two years telling my gp that I wasn’t well to only be written off as crazy or having fibromyalgia.  My hormones were checked for run of the mill female hormones, fsh, LH, prolactin, etc. my total testosterone was mildly high and my prolactin was high. Free testosterone was normal. Prolactin was retested and came back in range. I was told I was fine. I continued on and just got worse.  At this point I was around 135 lbs. I started a restrictive diet bordering on an eating disorder and could only lose a pound or two only to just gain it back the next few days. My hair seemed to be getting noticeably thinner in November and I couldn’t ignore it anymore. I started collecting it in a baggy and saw my nurse practitioner in December. I explained all my issues and was told I needed psychiatric help, antidepressants, to stop stressing, and my hair was not balding. I left p****d off. Also was told I was fixated too much on my weight. At this point it was found my cholesterol went up, which was unusual for me.  In Jan. 2018 I went on a vacation and caught the flu. I was so sick with a very high fever. I thought I was going to die. My boyfriend barely got sick even though we were in very close quarters. After the flu I’ve never been the same. All my symptoms exploded. I’ve had sleep disturbances since, I do not sleep anymore and if I do I’m tense and dreaming. I wake up after what seems like hours and it’s been 20 minutes. I started becoming   end of feb. And spent so much money on cabs because if I went down to the subway I was scared I would jump. In March I couldn’t even have strength to carry groceries. I developed a week long massive headache and afterwards my hair started falling out in clumps. It is official now, I am balding. It started with just my sides then the temples. Now it’s diffuse and I lost well over half my hair, weeellllll over. I put extensions in and it is not helping anymore. Just the last week, I lost so much hair. Like 400 strands a day. My hair is gone.  At this point I was already seeing an endo for the prolactin. She did an MRI of my pituitary and it was unremarkable. My total testosterone came back high but my free T always normal and my sex hormone binding globulin was high, at one point off the range high. She thought I was on birth control but I wasn’t. TSH normal, thyroid antibodies normal, Free T3 normal. I asked her to test cortisol and she said I didn’t look cushingnoid but it does take years to take on the appearance so she did an am blood test. My result was 21.6 with top range being 22. She had me do a 24 hour urine and the result was 48.something with top being 50.  I started developing in April long vellus hair all over my body and face. Like, all over. My forehead, cheeks, back, breasts, thighs, stomach. I was always pretty hairless my whole life. This is freaking me out. I was diagnosed with insulin resistance and pre-diabetes. My blood pressure was up a bit when I usually have low. The other odd thing is that now I am dropping weight like crazy. I’m only 103 lbs now and I have nooo muscle left on me but still have a flabby fat belly. My bones hurt even sitting on a cushion. There’s no muscle.  I’ve seen REs who told me I had pcos. Had cystic ovaries and then didn’t on a second scan. Had one endo take back their pcos diagnosis, tell me I’m just crazy and that I have an eating disorder. I don’t.  I had my gp test my am cortisol again and it was almost 50 with top range being 22. Was told it was stress. My CBC had high red blood cells, high hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Low lymphocytes and high neutrophils. Saw a hematologist who said high neutrophils could be from high cortisol. He didn’t believe I had pcos. Thought stress.   Most of my endos and drs washed their hands of me but I am not well! I did have a ct scan too of my adrenals Bc my DHEA-S shot up so I demanded one. Adrenals were fine but they found a benign tumor on my kidney and a cyst on my liver.  I’m balding, growing weird long vellus hair all over, weak, not sleeping, mood issues, anxious, falling apart. I haven’t been to work since April. I can no longer function. My boss recommended this pituitary and adrenal specialist and I faxed all my labs to herald was told she’d review and let me know if she wants to see me. I found out the other day that she wants to see me and is having me take all the cushing’s tests.  I’m so scared this is like an ectopic tumor and is cancer. Why am I losing weight when I couldn’t budge it before? My hair is gone. I’m so depressed. I had very thick hair even when it was thinning, it was thick. There’s nothing left. I feel so sick all the time. I used to be an active person who had dreams and desires in life. I’m just a husk of what I used to be. My life is in shambles and I don’t understand why no one helped me years ago. No one listened. My family all see it now and are doing everything they can to help.  I know this is not pcos. I have normal menstrual cycles and did for 20 years. Never had any signs of pcos. I have so many signs of high cortisol and cushings. The only difference is now I’m thin, flabby but thin. I was working with a trainer too who thought this seemed weird. I was dropping weight but body fat was going up so I was losing muscle even though I was weight lifting. I had to stop because in May I became too weak.  I want this nightmare to end. I also developed dry flaky skin and my cuts are not healing well. I actually got my ear pierced and have had 8 piercings with never an infection. Tattoos with zero infection. After my unremarkable ct scan I thought I’d go get my ear pierced because maybe I am nuts. Maybe the drs are right and I am losing my mind and it’s pcos. I was worried it wouldn’t heal but did it. Was fine for a couple weeks then I developed perichondritis I think it’s called or cellulitis. Had to go to the ER twice in the same night. Was told to take two different antibiotics and if it didn’t get better I needed to be admitted. My body is not the same. I’m scared. I want my life back and my hair. I’m so scared and depressed. I do t wang to die from cancer either. I just want help and answers. This can’t be normal. I know I used to feel healthy and energetic and was not balding and did not have weird mood issues and sleep issues.  Thank you for reading if you did. Anyone have any advice? Am I crazy?

I was working with a trainer too who thought this seemed weird. I was dropping weight but body fat was going up so I was losing muscle even though I was weight lifting. I had to stop because in May I became too weak.  I want this nightmare to end. I also developed dry flaky skin and my cuts are not healing well. I actually got my ear pierced and have had 8 piercings with never an infection. Tattoos with zero infection. After my unremarkable ct scan I thought I’d go get my ear pierced because maybe I am nuts. Maybe the drs are right and I am losing my mind and it’s pcos. I was worried it wouldn’t heal but did it. Was fine for a couple weeks then I developed perichondritis I think it’s called or cellulitis. Had to go to the ER twice in the same night. Was told to take two different antibiotics and if it didn’t get better I needed to be admitted. My body is not the same. I’m scared. I want my life back and my hair. I’m so scared and depressed. I do t wang to die from cancer either. I just want help and answers. This can’t be normal. I know I used to feel healthy and energetic and was not balding and did not have weird mood issues and sleep issues.  Thank you for reading if you did. Anyone have any advice? Am I crazy? Is this pcos? Every pcos forum I joined, I feel rejected from. No one connects with my symptoms.  0 likes, 2 replies "

I’ll be seeing an endo at the memorial Sloan Kettering center in NYC on July 3rd, but before then I have to complete my third 24 hour free cortisol test, a saliva test, a full pituitary blood workup, and the dexamethasone suppression test. I’m very concerned about what has been going on with my health over the last few years and am anxious but hoping I will finally get some answers. My story is long and complicated, as I’m sure everyones is here, so apologies! I’m hoping I can get some opinions as my case seems to have stumped my previous drs and other drs just wrote me off as crazy.  I can’t remember the exact year I started changing, but I would say I noticed mild changes in 2014. I’m 5’0 and was always a thin-average petite girl. I started noticing body composition changes, I was always a pear shape but suddenly seemed to start getting a belly. I always had a very flat nice stomach. I blamed my desk job, long commute, and bad eating habits. Living in NYC, I basically subsisted on takeout. I had other weird symptoms though like muscle weakness starting in my thighs and arms, back pain too. Sometimes I was in pain for weeks then it would just go away. I thought maybe it was the way I was sleeping weird or something. I started developing aura migraines and everyday general headaches as well. Pain and pressure behind the eyes, like eye strain. I started thinking my apartment had toxic mold or something. I just felt wrong.  In 2015 I started gaining weight and lost a lot of energy. I was always around 110-115 lbs but now was around 125 lbs, so not a crazy amount but my body just looked different. It was all flab, no muscle, jiggly weird cellulite covered belly. I tried losing it but couldn’t. I blamed myself again and not working out enough. I started getting hot flashes and my face would flush. I always had rosy cheeks and was told I had rosacea so that isn’t anything new but the flushing was. I also started getting night sweats and sleep disturbances once in a while. I would have no issue falling asleep, but would instantly enter REM stage and dream but wake up every hour or two all night long. Then it would just go away and I’d sleep like normal.  I started losing my sex drive and blamed my appearance on it and depression. My moods started going crazy. I started having rage episodes, mood swings, severe crippling anxiety (like becoming agoraphobic anxiety), paranoia, depression. My body felt so weak and heavy in my limbs, I just kept blaming depression.  In 2016 same symptoms but all intensified. I noticed I think around this time that my hair was thinning, however a coworker passed away and I assumed it was telogen effluvium from stress. As my moods continued to go haywire, I started noticing my skin and face just seemed different. I was bruising very easily, my face looked puffier but not like full on moon face. My skin all over seemed like it was losing collagen, just thin and crepey. Still had zero motivation and weak muscles. Felt horrible all year and became convinced I was entering some type of early perimenopause.  In 2017 things continued to worsen. Sleep disturbances happened on a regular basis, headaches, zero sex drive, mood issues, horrific anger outbursts, digestive issues, hair loss, severe depression, muscle weakness, no energy. I knew something was wrong with my hormones because things were going well in my life aside from all these weird health issues and I went to see my gyno to have hormones tested. This is after two years telling my gp that I wasn’t well to only be written off as crazy or having fibromyalgia.  My hormones were checked for run of the mill female hormones, fsh, LH, prolactin, etc. my total testosterone was mildly high and my prolactin was high. Free testosterone was normal. Prolactin was retested and came back in range. I was told I was fine. I continued on and just got worse.  At this point I was around 135 lbs. I started a restrictive diet bordering on an eating disorder and could only lose a pound or two only to just gain it back the next few days. My hair seemed to be getting noticeably thinner in November and I couldn’t ignore it anymore. I started collecting it in a baggy and saw my nurse practitioner in December. I explained all my issues and was told I needed psychiatric help, antidepressants, to stop stressing, and my hair was not balding. I left p****d off. Also was told I was fixated too much on my weight. At this point it was found my cholesterol went up, which was unusual for me.  In Jan. 2018 I went on a vacation and caught the flu. I was so sick with a very high fever. I thought I was going to die. My boyfriend barely got sick even though we were in very close quarters. After the flu I’ve never been the same. All my symptoms exploded. I’ve had sleep disturbances since, I do not sleep anymore and if I do I’m tense and dreaming. I wake up after what seems like hours and it’s been 20 minutes. I started becoming   end of feb. And spent so much money on cabs because if I went down to the subway I was scared I would jump. In March I couldn’t even have strength to carry groceries. I developed a week long massive headache and afterwards my hair started falling out in clumps. It is official now, I am balding. It started with just my sides then the temples. Now it’s diffuse and I lost well over half my hair, weeellllll over. I put extensions in and it is not helping anymore. Just the last week, I lost so much hair. Like 400 strands a day. My hair is gone.  At this point I was already seeing an endo for the prolactin. She did an MRI of my pituitary and it was unremarkable. My total testosterone came back high but my free T always normal and my sex hormone binding globulin was high, at one point off the range high. She thought I was on birth control but I wasn’t. TSH normal, thyroid antibodies normal, Free T3 normal. I asked her to test cortisol and she said I didn’t look cushingnoid but it does take years to take on the appearance so she did an am blood test. My result was 21.6 with top range being 22. She had me do a 24 hour urine and the result was 48.something with top being 50.  I started developing in April long vellus hair all over my body and face. Like, all over. My forehead, cheeks, back, breasts, thighs, stomach. I was always pretty hairless my whole life. This is freaking me out. I was diagnosed with insulin resistance and pre-diabetes. My blood pressure was up a bit when I usually have low. The other odd thing is that now I am dropping weight like crazy. I’m only 103 lbs now and I have nooo muscle left on me but still have a flabby fat belly. My bones hurt even sitting on a cushion. There’s no muscle.  I’ve seen REs who told me I had pcos. Had cystic ovaries and then didn’t on a second scan. Had one endo take back their pcos diagnosis, tell me I’m just crazy and that I have an eating disorder. I don’t.  I had my gp test my am cortisol again and it was almost 50 with top range being 22. Was told it was stress. My CBC had high red blood cells, high hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Low lymphocytes and high neutrophils. Saw a hematologist who said high neutrophils could be from high cortisol. He didn’t believe I had pcos. Thought stress.   Most of my endos and drs washed their hands of me but I am not well! I did have a ct scan too of my adrenals Bc my DHEA-S shot up so I demanded one. Adrenals were fine but they found a benign tumor on my kidney and a cyst on my liver.  I’m balding, growing weird long vellus hair all over, weak, not sleeping, mood issues, anxious, falling apart. I haven’t been to work since April. I can no longer function. My boss recommended this pituitary and adrenal specialist and I faxed all my labs to herald was told she’d review and let me know if she wants to see me. I found out the other day that she wants to see me and is having me take all the cushing’s tests.  I’m so scared this is like an ectopic tumor and is cancer. Why am I losing weight when I couldn’t budge it before? My hair is gone. I’m so depressed. I had very thick hair even when it was thinning, it was thick. There’s nothing left. I feel so sick all the time. I used to be an active person who had dreams and desires in life. I’m just a husk of what I used to be. My life is in shambles and I don’t understand why no one helped me years ago. No one listened. My family all see it now and are doing everything they can to help.  I know this is not pcos.

Thought stress.   Most of my endos and drs washed their hands of me but I am not well! I did have a ct scan too of my adrenals Bc my DHEA-S shot up so I demanded one. Adrenals were fine but they found a benign tumor on my kidney and a cyst on my liver.  I’m balding, growing weird long vellus hair all over, weak, not sleeping, mood issues, anxious, falling apart. I haven’t been to work since April. I can no longer function. My boss recommended this pituitary and adrenal specialist and I faxed all my labs to herald was told she’d review and let me know if she wants to see me. I found out the other day that she wants to see me and is having me take all the cushing’s tests.  I’m so scared this is like an ectopic tumor and is cancer. Why am I losing weight when I couldn’t budge it before? My hair is gone. I’m so depressed. I had very thick hair even when it was thinning, it was thick. There’s nothing left. I feel so sick all the time. I used to be an active person who had dreams and desires in life. I’m just a husk of what I used to be. My life is in shambles and I don’t understand why no one helped me years ago. No one listened. My family all see it now and are doing everything they can to help.  I know this is not pcos. I have normal menstrual cycles and did for 20 years. Never had any signs of pcos. I have so many signs of high cortisol and cushings. The only difference is now I’m thin, flabby but thin. I was working with a trainer too who thought this seemed weird. I was dropping weight but body fat was going up so I was losing muscle even though I was weight lifting. I had to stop because in May I became too weak.  I want this nightmare to end. I also developed dry flaky skin and my cuts are not healing well. I actually got my ear pierced and have had 8 piercings with never an infection. Tattoos with zero infection. After my unremarkable ct scan I thought I’d go get my ear pierced because maybe I am nuts. Maybe the drs are right and I am losing my mind and it’s pcos. I was worried it wouldn’t heal but did it. Was fine for a couple weeks then I developed perichondritis I think it’s called or cellulitis. Had to go to the ER twice in the same night. Was told to take two different antibiotics and if it didn’t get better I needed to be admitted. My body is not the same. I’m scared. I want my life back and my hair. I’m so scared and depressed. I do t wang to die from cancer either. I just want help and answers. This can’t be normal. I know I used to feel healthy and energetic and was not balding and did not have weird mood issues and sleep issues.  Thank you for reading if you did. Anyone have any advice? Am I crazy? Is this pcos? Every pcos forum I joined, I feel rejected from. No one connects with my symptoms.  0 likes, 2 replies "

Is there such a thing and can it turn to Addisons,"I have issues with my autonomic nervous system, particulary flght or flight responses. Three years ago my cardios had me tested for an adrenal tumour as my BP is highly unstable. Tests came back negative and at the time the majority of results placed me in the range of Cushings although my cartisol was extremely low then raised after a second test Go forward 3 years, for the last 20 months I have had to deal with recurrent pneumonias, they are querying asthma and my Cardios feel its more linked to dysfunctional breathing but I threw another low cortisol reading at 58 a few weeks ago so was referred for an ACTH stimulation test Yesterday I got the results - Cortisol was no longer low but high and ACTH pushed this really high. Other pointers suggested Cushings but because of the variations in BP and Cotisol the Endos thought it was secondary Cushings which I had never heard of I was told that having repeated courses of prednisone isnt helping (8 in the last 16 months) and that if this were to carry on im at severe risk of developing Addisons within 5 years.  I just feel so confused right now. My cardiologist said my cortisol may be just as unstable as my BP, but the Endos mentioned levels of Immunglobins  in the red and eosinophils that climb even on steroids. None of this actually makes sense so Im hoping someone can give me a little more info on why they say Secondary Cushings, why they gave me all the warnings about   and how I deal with this given those warnings are the same symptoms as I have with my other medical conditions Feel so lost right now - who do you recommend as the best person to see in the UK right now ???

I was always very slim, athletic, and full of energy but this disease has stripped me of everything that makes me myself. I finally completed my 24 hr urine cortisol tests and have incredibly elevated levels (it honestly came as a relief to finally get an abnormal test result as I have been feeling ill for so long and my doctors were about to give up on me). Although now I am finding it frustrating to continue to keep things moving along. My doctors are taking an incredibly long time to get back to me since my results have come in and just keep telling me to ""stay tuned for further instruction.""

At first my endo did not believe that I followed instructions (he thought I filled for two days worth). I then proceeded to tell him that of course I only did a sample for 24 hour and that I drink and pee wayyy more than the average person. Been like that my whole life and honestly get a lot of grief about it. Anyways, he finally gets back to me and says that my high volume likely skewed my results and that an average woman my age and size cannot have a urine output that large. He then told me to come back in a month to re-do the test! I was at a complete loss of words for this, not only am I totally miserable but I have all the physical symptoms of cushings.  So does anyone know anything about UFC volumes and whether it can actually skew results, especially for someone like me who has always have a high urine output?

I had body composition changes, weight gain of 35 lbs although I recently lost after cutting sugar and carbs but my loss is weird. My stomach is still flabby and fat but everywhere is skinny. I used to be pear shaped with a perfect flat stomach when I was my old self. I had a puffy round face that went away with weight loss but when I compare pics from my past I can see my face was not puffy looking at higher weights and at lower weights I had a puffy face. Makes no sense. I have worsening rosacea, bad muscle weakness and fatigue, hair loss, major sleep disturbances and insomnia, migraines, easy bruising and thin skin, severe mood and emotional issues. It really exploded this past March. I started losing hair more rapidly and all over my head, all the vellus hair on my body and face grew crazy long and I used to be a hairless person. I even have long vellus hairs on my eyelids now. I’m getting episodes of rapid heart rate for no reason, dx with prediabetes, insulin resistance, developed hypertension, high cholesterol, have had weird skin infections (cellulitis). I used to be so healthy, never ever had an infection like that before and I’ve had tattoos and piercings that I could have cleaned better during the healing process but no issues. Can psuedo cushings really cause my issues? I feel trapped in a nightmare. Before it became apparent that everything that was happening to me was NOT my fault, I would ask my family if my face looks different, I would cry to my mom that I’m not myself anymore and I want to be old Gina. In 2016 I had a painful small hump between my shoulders that I took photos of, I blamed my deskjob but that’s when I read about cushings and suspected I had it. I remember checking every girl’s back on the subway to work to see if they had it too. I thought I just felt beaten down by a stressful lifestyle but I’m a total mess now and don’t even recognize myself in the mirror anymore. My hair is so thinned and my smooth skin is covered in a layer of long spikey hair.  The dr wants me to go back in September and do more tests. I don’t know how to wait that long. I feel so sick and weak and I’m going to be bald by then. How did everyone get through this? Are they just going to wait until I’m a textbook case? I want to salvage what I can of my body, health and life and I’m just always being put on a back burner or told I’m just crazy.  Anyone have to push through a pseudo cushings diagnosis before finally getting treatment or determining the source? My mri of the pituitary and ct scan of the abdomen were clear although the endocrinologist did say that many pituitary tumors are too small to see on the mri. I still think she’s leaning towards me being nuts though. Having lived with this for years, I can surely attest that I’m not crazy. Something is very wrong, beyond my control and I used to be a fit athletic happy girl. Sometimes I wonder if mine has been cyclical all this time. I had a UFC June 6th that was 32.5 out of 50. Now a couple weeks later I get a UFC at this clinics lab of 56 out of 45. Ugh. Sorry for the rant. I’m scared. I just want my old self back and to feel healthy and have energy and sleep back in my life. And a sex drive! I wanted to be a mother so badly but I’m 30 and this is delaying my dream. I want to gain back my hopes and dreams that I’ve lost to whatever hijacked my body and mind. I’m terrified because I feel trapped in a body I don’t recognize and feel like I’m developing the health status of an 80 year old.

Something is very wrong, beyond my control and I used to be a fit athletic happy girl. Sometimes I wonder if mine has been cyclical all this time. I had a UFC June 6th that was 32.5 out of 50. Now a couple weeks later I get a UFC at this clinics lab of 56 out of 45. Ugh. Sorry for the rant. I’m scared. I just want my old self back and to feel healthy and have energy and sleep back in my life. And a sex drive! I wanted to be a mother so badly but I’m 30 and this is delaying my dream. I want to gain back my hopes and dreams that I’ve lost to whatever hijacked my body and mind. I’m terrified because I feel trapped in a body I don’t recognize and feel like I’m developing the health status of an 80 year old. Anyone get slapped with pseudo cushings at first? 0 likes, 0 replies "

I’m hoping to connect with other’s through this forum who might have gone through a similar experience. .. To condense my story,  after many months of symptoms and testing, I was finally diagnosed with Cushings Syndrome last February. I had a 4cm adenoma on my right adrenal gland that was producing excess cortisol. My surgery was done laparoscopically at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville on 3/30. I was only in the hospital a couple of nights and have been back since home Easter Sunday.  The first 2 weeks were OK - I was a sore , but had pain medication, took it easy, and rested. They put me on Hydrocorisone with a taper schedule : 25mg 2 x day for 1st 2 weeks, and then 20mg 2x day for another 2 weeks , then down to 10mg, etc. I started feeling unwell (more tired, achy and emotional) - and having more pain on my right side around to my back at about the 2 weeks ...I was out of the pain medication- which they said I should no longer need at the this point. I was feeling so poorly last week that I went to the ER on Tuesday (it was too long of a drive to go back to Mayo). They did some tests, gave me a 100 mg shot of steroids and 3 day rx for more pain medication.  This helped... and I felt a better until Friday. Once again out of pain medication. I tried to rest, take Advil , Tylenol & hot showers. By 2a.m. On Saturday, I was so miserable that I went back  to the ER.  They did some lab work , CT scan and everything came back “normal”.  So home again with another 3 day rx of pain medication.  Then last night , I took a pain pill at about 11:30 and went to bed. Woke up at 3a.m feeling awful.  Pain on my side and mid-back, flushed, headache, nauseous, chills and felt very weak and lightheaded. I live by myself so this was kind of scary ... I tried to calm myself down and took another pain pill. Laid back down until 6:30-7 - when I woke up feeling even worse. I called 911 and was taken to the ER by ambulance.  They gave me IV fluids , medication for nausea, more pain medication, labs and another CT scan. Once again, everything  was “normal”.  I asked for another shot of cortisol since that seemed to help so much last time ...  I’m back home now and feeling better - just very tired.  It is hard to tell - but it seems to me like I’m having a hard time with cortisol withdrawal ... and maybe need a slower taper ? Unfortunately the doctors at the ER know very little about Cushings or adrenal insufficiency  - and could  really only rule out a major problem with my organs or an infection (and treat my symptoms).  I’m calling my Endo at Mayo tomorrow to ask for some help ... I don’t think it’s normal to feel so sick - but can’t keep going to the ER every few days!!   So I guess my questions would be:  1) has anyone else experienced post op pain or problems with cortisol levels?  2) how can you tell between the difference between normal cortisol withdrawal and a “crisis”?  (and what kinds of things can cause a crisis)?  Thank you so much for taking the time to read my post...

First off apologies for what might seem like a long post however I've had a few health issues which have been with me for about 18 months now and I dont seem to be any closer to getting a diagnosis as I was when this first started. I'm after help and advice as I seem to be stuck now and i'm all out of ideas. About 18 months ago I was taking a long drive on holiday (about an 8 hour drive) - during the journey myself, partner and children were taking regular breaks and making sure we had plenty of food and drink on the way. When we eventually pulled up for some reason I was feeling really weak, and felt like if I got out of the car I would pass out quite quickly. The feeling I got was that feeling when your really hungry and really tired, perhaps low on blood sugar. I some how managed to survive this ordeal and for the duration of our holiday I kept having spells like this. There were two quite intense occasions during the week we were there where I felt like this. I had to get some food in me and it perked me up. The final day we were there we stopped off at a tourist attraction and I spent the entire 2 hours in a public toilet as I was struggling to not pass out. - When we finally got home I decided I would go to the doctors. Ok so back to my symptoms. Since this first started I seem to get the following. I get the shakes EVERY day without fail and generally feel worse in the morning. Shakes and Nausea seem to always be together and the rest seem to be random. In the past 18 months I've been back and forth to the GP and had countless blood tests taken (if anyone is interested in which tests then I am happy to post them with their results). Everything has come back as Satisfactory and after exhausting the GPs they finally referred me to the hospital to see an endocrinologist. When I went to meet the endo she listened to all my symptoms and gave me a physical examination. She said that she wanted me to have a Short Synacthen test to test my adrenal functionality. - To my surprise this came back Abnormal. - This is the first test I've had where its actually come back like this. Everything else has been fine. It says that my level came back as the following ""Serum ACTH level 93.7 ng/L"" - Which makes no sense to me tbh. If anyone can give me an explanation of this level then I would be most grateful. Anyway I was quite happy to see that this had come back and I was thinking it proves that im not making any of this up. I had a follow up ""telephone appointment"" with my endo and she basically said that it shows that I've got a high level of Cortisol in my blood. The only way to lower this is for me to take up Yoga, breathing exercises and perhaps do some light cardio such as swimming. - Thats it. She wanted to discharge me. I said i want another follow up in a months time to see how im getting on by doing this and luckily she agreed.  I kind of feel like i've been   off tbh. Here i am feeling rubbish every day. I've tried to alter my diet, excercise and sleep routine and nothing has helped. Everyday I get the same symptoms. Mostly I get the shakes and nausea. I have had lots of other tests such as blood glucose, thyroid, vitamin deficiency, 24 hour urine sample and they have all come back as fine. Im sort of lost as what I can do. I've put this in here as after googling everything it feels like this forum might be the right place. Anyone with cushings have you had the same sort of symptoms etc?

About 4 months ago I was visiting family at the weekend when someone spotted an unsightly hump on the back of my neck between my shoulders. Weirded out, I took myself to the GP the following week assuming my rubbish posture had caught up with me and I might need some physio. Instead, she paired this lump with the sudden weight gain and exhaustion I’d been complaining to her about for the last year, and suggested a cortisol issue. At this point I’d had an overnight sleep test and countless thyroid and other blood tests over the last year, which all came back normal, so I was excited to have a new route to explore. My symptoms had begun with increasingly bad daytime sleepiness which was interfering with my full-time office job, making me fall asleep at my desk and in meetings, and over the year I had packed on 40lb despite having a very normal diet and going to the gym once or twice a week. I was also experiencing a lot of heart palpitations, night sweats, headaches, and shoulder, back and leg pain. I thought this was just me being generally small and weedy, but it had started to seem out of proportion for my age (27) as I was finding it genuinely hard to climb stairs at a decent pace or lift slightly heavier objects. Through my GP surgery I had a 1mg dexamethasone suppression blood test, which came back with a cortisol level twice what it should have been and slightly elevated prolactin too. I was referred to an endocrinologist and about six weeks after the initial 1mg dexa test, I had an MRI, CT scan, 24hr urine test and 2mg dexamethasone suppression test under their supervision. The MRI immediately came back showing a pituitary adenoma of about 3mm, and I thought the answer was obvious- but then last week my bloods, urine and bone density all cane back within normal ranges, and the hospital has essentially told me I do not have an endocrine issue and to go back to the drawing board with my GP. I was so frustrated I cried in front of the consultant and her observing student, and she responded by... suggesting I look into psychiatric care. At that point I left, humiliated, because I felt like any response would just be used to blackball me further as a hypochondriac. I don’t know what to do next. Everyone, even well-meaning friends and family, seems to think I am basically just fat and physically and mentally weak and need to do meditation, CBT and strict calorie-counting. I want to ask for a second opinion, or to have the blood and urine tests re-run several times to see if there’s some sort of out-of-step cortisol cycle happening to me, but people are telling me not to do this or I’ll just be pigeonholed even more as ‘difficult’. I seem to be being thrown on the scrapheap as just another mad, bad fatty who won’t help herself by shutting up and getting on the treadmill. Does this story ring any bells with anyone? Has anyone ever found the magic words to make a consultant curious enough to re-run the cortisol tests? Has anyone ever gone the same route and found a definable problem that wasn’t Cushing’s but was still treatable? I’m just desperate for advice that isn’t just ‘be a stronger person’, and would be so grateful for anything anyone who’s experienced this first-hand can suggest. 0 likes, 10 replies "

My symptoms had begun with increasingly bad daytime sleepiness which was interfering with my full-time office job, making me fall asleep at my desk and in meetings, and over the year I had packed on 40lb despite having a very normal diet and going to the gym once or twice a week. I was also experiencing a lot of heart palpitations, night sweats, headaches, and shoulder, back and leg pain. I thought this was just me being generally small and weedy, but it had started to seem out of proportion for my age (27) as I was finding it genuinely hard to climb stairs at a decent pace or lift slightly heavier objects. Through my GP surgery I had a 1mg dexamethasone suppression blood test, which came back with a cortisol level twice what it should have been and slightly elevated prolactin too. I was referred to an endocrinologist and about six weeks after the initial 1mg dexa test, I had an MRI, CT scan, 24hr urine test and 2mg dexamethasone suppression test under their supervision. The MRI immediately came back showing a pituitary adenoma of about 3mm, and I thought the answer was obvious- but then last week my bloods, urine and bone density all cane back within normal ranges, and the hospital has essentially told me I do not have an endocrine issue and to go back to the drawing board with my GP. I was so frustrated I cried in front of the consultant and her observing student, and she responded by... suggesting I look into psychiatric care. At that point I left, humiliated, because I felt like any response would just be used to blackball me further as a hypochondriac. I don’t know what to do next. Everyone, even well-meaning friends and family, seems to think I am basically just fat and physically and mentally weak and need to do meditation, CBT and strict calorie-counting. I want to ask for a second opinion, or to have the blood and urine tests re-run several times to see if there’s some sort of out-of-step cortisol cycle happening to me, but people are telling me not to do this or I’ll just be pigeonholed even more as ‘difficult’. I seem to be being thrown on the scrapheap as just another mad, bad fatty who won’t help herself by shutting up and getting on the treadmill. Does this story ring any bells with anyone? Has anyone ever found the magic words to make a consultant curious enough to re-run the cortisol tests? Has anyone ever gone the same route and found a definable problem that wasn’t Cushing’s but was still treatable? I’m just desperate for advice that isn’t just ‘be a stronger person’, and would be so grateful for anything anyone who’s experienced this first-hand can suggest. 0 likes, 10 replies "

I tried every diet with no success.  I bought   tablets which had no effect.  My symptoms were a cycle of either wanting constantly to pee or else suffering chronic, severe pain in my bladder and pelvic area. After trying amitriptyline and every antibiotic going I was still getting no relief.  Anyway to cut a long story short as a last resort a doctor prescribed me Gabapentin 300mg which I took 1 per day for 3 days, then 2 for 3 days and then 3 tablets.  After only half an hour of taking the first tablet I felt an improvement and by the time I took 3 per day my pain and urgency had completely disappeared for the first time in 3 years.  This drug is usually for epilepsy but is also used to treat neuropathic pain (long lasting pain caused by damage to the nerves.) For me the symptoms of IC were, I suppose, due to damage to the nerves rather than any of the other possible causes.  Please try this drug as there are bound to be some of you who are suffering these debilitating symptoms for the same reason.  This drug has been life changing for me and I feel I now have my life back.

It all started when about this time last year I started getting urinary frequency, needing to go for a wee very often (around 8-9 times a day) and when I needed to go it would feel urgent and as if my urethra was spasming, pee was about to leak? I would have no blood, no pain or incontinence. Around Christmas time I started noticing a deep ache in my lower mid-right pelvic region if I was drinking anything (water, squash etc). It is as if I could feel my bladder filling up  but I still don't know if the pain is coming directly from my bladder. I would also notice frequency and needing to go for a wee quite urgently like before but when I would go there would not be very much there. Once again I would have no blood or incontinence.  I mentioned to my GP in February and they thought I had overactive bladder so prescribed me with Neditol for 4 weeks which didn't do a lot for me. I then tried Vesicare for 4 weeks, which again..didn't do much for me either. The last couple of months, I have also had some rectal issues where I was experiencing intense aching and pain in my rectal area. I saw a colorectal consultant privately and he said I have something called proctalgia fugix with possible levator ani syndrome. I mentioned the pelvic ache/urinary frequency as well and he didn't seem too concerned about it so I guess he doesn't think they are linked. I feel like I'm going crazy, I've had a bladder ultrasound in October which came back normal, urine samples are always fine, and pelvic scan in March was normal as well. I think the doctors think I'm a hypochondriac but I'm really not I just want answers and to feel normal again. My urinary symptoms disappeared for about 6 weeks but have come back again. I am still getting the deep pelvic ache which feels like a throbbing pain, especially when I am drinking water, and when I pass urine it feels like there will be a lot, but there isn't much there, (sometimes only 100ml). GP has finally referred me to Urology at the hospital but there is a long waiting list and I am really worried this could be IC as from my research it doesn't look like it could be anything else.  I haven't mentioned this to my GP as I know they don't like it when you try and self-diagnose and I feel that they already think I am dramatic and overly anxious 😦 Sorry about the long message I just feel like I have to vent and would really like to hear if anyone's ever experienced anything similar? Half of me thinks this could just be a pelvic floor problem (I have been referred to physio for myofascial stretch but I am waiting for this), and the other half thinks it could be IC.

It all started when about this time last year I started getting urinary frequency, needing to go for a wee very often (around 8-9 times a day) and when I needed to go it would feel urgent and as if my urethra was spasming, pee was about to leak? I would have no blood, no pain or incontinence. Around Christmas time I started noticing a deep ache in my lower mid-right pelvic region if I was drinking anything (water, squash etc). It is as if I could feel my bladder filling up  but I still don't know if the pain is coming directly from my bladder. I would also notice frequency and needing to go for a wee quite urgently like before but when I would go there would not be very much there. Once again I would have no blood or incontinence.  I mentioned to my GP in February and they thought I had overactive bladder so prescribed me with Neditol for 4 weeks which didn't do a lot for me. I then tried Vesicare for 4 weeks, which again..didn't do much for me either. The last couple of months, I have also had some rectal issues where I was experiencing intense aching and pain in my rectal area. I saw a colorectal consultant privately and he said I have something called proctalgia fugix with possible levator ani syndrome. I mentioned the pelvic ache/urinary frequency as well and he didn't seem too concerned about it so I guess he doesn't think they are linked. I feel like I'm going crazy, I've had a bladder ultrasound in October which came back normal, urine samples are always fine, and pelvic scan in March was normal as well. I think the doctors think I'm a hypochondriac but I'm really not I just want answers and to feel normal again. My urinary symptoms disappeared for about 6 weeks but have come back again. I am still getting the deep pelvic ache which feels like a throbbing pain, especially when I am drinking water, and when I pass urine it feels like there will be a lot, but there isn't much there, (sometimes only 100ml). GP has finally referred me to Urology at the hospital but there is a long waiting list and I am really worried this could be IC as from my research it doesn't look like it could be anything else.  I haven't mentioned this to my GP as I know they don't like it when you try and self-diagnose and I feel that they already think I am dramatic and overly anxious 😦 Sorry about the long message I just feel like I have to vent and would really like to hear if anyone's ever experienced anything similar? Half of me thinks this could just be a pelvic floor problem (I have been referred to physio for myofascial stretch but I am waiting for this), and the other half thinks it could be IC.

For the past eight months  (starting in November 2018) After masturbating with a sex toy,  I immediately  felt like I had to go pee really badly even though I just went! I went to bed and tried to ignore it hoping it would go away in the morning and the intense feeling of going pee went down a lot but I still felt weird. After I went pee it  felt like I had to go slightly and my urethra would BURN ( not when peeing but after). The burning sensation lasted the whole entire month of November  and still slightly now almost every day but less intense. If it isn't burning then my urethra feels like it pushing, swollen or I have to GO PEE. Originally I thought i had a UTI so I went to the doctors who said they didn't see any infection but gave me antibiotic anyway which did not work.I only go pee on average 4 - 6 times a day which hasn't changed when these symptoms arrived. Also i feel no pressure/ cramping in my lower stomach it just my urethra that feels irritated.  I have done numerous urine test, STI test (I'm not sexually active)  and yeast infection test and everything came back negative. I'm in so much pain all the time that i don't know what to do anymore. My family doctor brought up IC and referred me to a urologist. The urologist said he didn't want to look internally because I am so young (19) and didn't think it was IC so i got referred to see a gyno and a Pelvic floor physio therapist. My gyno appointment is not until feb 2020! and i'm in so much pain. I'm so worried it's IC and i don't want to have it the rest of my life!   I have changed my diet to be less acidic, use %100 natural wipe and menstrual products, over the counter meds, muscle relaxants, epson salt baths, drinking tons of water but nothing seems to help. I feel like I injured my urethra some how internally through my vagina with using the sex toy? if anyone has similar symptom please leave any suggestion on what helped or what this could be, I'm so desperate and afraid the gyno won't help me after I've been over looked by many doctors. 0 likes, 3 replies "

It always happened when I drank anything. I still had the above symptoms alongside this. Went back to my GP who prescribed me with OAB medication which I tried for 4 weeks. I still had the aching so they prescribed me with a different type which again..didn't really do much. I've had a pelvic ultrasound to check my ovaries as well as a bladder ultrasound which both came back normal. At this point, my GP started implying this is all in my head and that its anxiety related which upset me to say the least.. As time went on, I developed some new symptoms. I had this awful pressure/aching in my rectal area which I ended up seeing a colorectal  privately for as the aching was 24/7.

He said I have something called proctalgia fugix with possible levator ani syndrome which is related to the pelvic floor, prescribed me with diazapam for this which worked really well, but wanted to do a colonoscopy to make sure the aching in my pelvic area/bowel symptoms weren't anything sinister. (This never went ahead as my heart rate was too high due to anxiety of having the procedure done but surgeon concluded he thinks bowel issues are just IBS). For the past couple of months, the aching next to my bladder has got worse/more constant. Before this, it wasn't occurring on a daily basis and would sometimes disappear for weeks.  The past week, the throbbing ache has also been more central /intense as if its actually in my bladder this time. This is worse after I have drank anything and continues until my bladder feels full. It feels like someone is pressing hard on a bruise once every few minutes. I look back to this time last year and things are definitely worse, I have been measuring my pee where possible as I'm guessing the urologist will ask. I can hold maximum about 350ml of pee but usually void between 200-250ml. I don't have any pain when I pee and my urine stream is average.

About Christmas time I noticed a deep throbbing ache in my lower mid-right pelvic area, next to my bladder, whenever I drank anything (water, squash etc.), it would feel like I could feel my bladder filling up. even though the pain wasn't directly on my bladder. It always happened when I drank anything. I still had the above symptoms alongside this. Went back to my GP who prescribed me with OAB medication which I tried for 4 weeks. I still had the aching so they prescribed me with a different type which again..didn't really do much. I've had a pelvic ultrasound to check my ovaries as well as a bladder ultrasound which both came back normal. At this point, my GP started implying this is all in my head and that its anxiety related which upset me to say the least.. As time went on, I developed some new symptoms. I had this awful pressure/aching in my rectal area which I ended up seeing a colorectal  privately for as the aching was 24/7. During this time, the pelvic ache/urinary frequency wasn't so bad and had pretty much stopped so I stupidly didn't make a big thing out of it when he examined me, I did mention it but he didn't seem to think the two were linked. I've also had IBS symptoms on and off since about June which seems to be worse a week or so before my period. He said I have something called proctalgia fugix with possible levator ani syndrome which is related to the pelvic floor, prescribed me with diazapam for this which worked really well, but wanted to do a colonoscopy to make sure the aching in my pelvic area/bowel symptoms weren't anything sinister. (This never went ahead as my heart rate was too high due to anxiety of having the procedure done but surgeon concluded he thinks bowel issues are just IBS). For the past couple of months, the aching next to my bladder has got worse/more constant. Before this, it wasn't occurring on a daily basis and would sometimes disappear for weeks.  The past week, the throbbing ache has also been more central /intense as if its actually in my bladder this time. This is worse after I have drank anything and continues until my bladder feels full. It feels like someone is pressing hard on a bruise once every few minutes. I look back to this time last year and things are definitely worse, I have been measuring my pee where possible as I'm guessing the urologist will ask. I can hold maximum about 350ml of pee but usually void between 200-250ml. I don't have any pain when I pee and my urine stream is average. I don't know whats wrong with me and the IBS symptoms suck as well and have developed over time with this, I feel like the two could be related but I'm not sure? I haven't felt right in months, cry constantly and just feel like there's no way out anymore:(. I am awful at explaining things to the doctor and when I get there I am a nervous wreck, I just hate it:( even if I write things down, I feel like as soon as I start talking I am interrupted and I just lose control of the situation. This then makes me emotional which makes me look even more like a hypochondriac which I am not:( Thank you so much for reading I would appreciate any advice so much and I'm so sorry for rambling.x 0 likes, 2 replies "

A little background on myself. I am a 27 year old male who has been going back and forth with health issues and mental problems for the past 2 years. Before all this I was perfectly healthy and no problems at all. Here is my story. Back in August of 2017 I had unprotected sex with a female which I believe may be the cause of all these problems. Anyways I felt a burning sensation the next day  while going to the bathroom so a week later I went to see the doctor and it turned out I was positive for  chlamydia so I was prescribed the generic medication to cure it (I can list a full medication list later on if it will help.) So I took the medication for the desired time but still felt a burning sensation so I went back to the doctor and was prescribed a stronger medication for longer. I took the medication as directed but still felt a burning sensation when going to the bathroom. So I ended up getting re-tested for chlamydia to make sure the meds were working and everything came back negative but i still have a burning sensation and weak urine stream and sometime hard to go number 1. This is where it gets confusing. Somewhere between October-December of 2017 I started feeling very abnormal. I literally woke up one morning feeling extremely tired, like my eyes feeling super heavy, and I Just can't feel awake at all, and I have very very low to no energy whatsoever and my stools when I go the bathroom are very runny, sometimes green, sometimes really dark and I always have to wipe a lot. Its never just a normal poop. My stomach is constantly bloated. Please remember I literally just woke up one day feeling like this and these issues ive listed above have been going on for almost 2 years now! Some days I feel like gouging my eyes out because the heaviness and tiredness of my eyes is just so annoying and unbearable that I don't know what to do. I just want to feel normal again. Same when i go to the bathroom. My energy level is so low I could literally sleep 12-16 hours a day. Anyways the doctor refereed me to a urologist because of the on going problems. So a couple weeks later I went the urologist and told him my issues and he decided to run a tube up my urethra to see if he could help find out what was wrong and he ended up finding a lot of redness and inflammation around my prostate so a couple weeks later he did a biopsy of my prostate and ended up with the diagnosis of CYSTITIS GLANDULARIS so I ended up taking anti-inflammation meds for this and none of the meds ended up working as I still have the burning sensation to this day. So more about the stools and tiredness problems. I went back to my primary care doctor and updated him all the things I have been feeling so I got my poop tested and numerous other blood tests and testosterone tests and so on. Everything came back negative. Everything. He ended up referring me to a gastroenterologist. Please be aware from time I went to my primary care doctor to the time he referred to me a  gastroenterologist I had taken countless different types medication to help with stool problems and nothing helped. Anyways I went to the gastroenterologist and told him my issues and we ended up doing a biopsy of my colon and stomach and came out with the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori  so I was prescribed  meds to help the situation and nothing helped whatsoever. I still feel the exact same as day 1. This is mainly what I feel everyday. Very very low energy. If im not at work you will find me in bed having a hard time keeping my eyes open. They feel so heavy, and burn. There is a strange heaviness in my eyes. like i cant get them feel awake ever! I am still bloated and have loose stools every single day. Nothing is working. I have no sex drive at all. Ive ruined countless of potential relationships because i literally feel croggy and like s**t 24/7! I don't know how much more I can take. I don't feel alive anymore. I feel like the well being of an 80 yr old trapped in 27 year olds body. Sorry for the rant. I just want to feel normal again! Thats it. Ive been prescribed anti-depressants and those do not help. I know I am not depressed. Just my overall mood is s**t 24/7 because of the things I have mentioned above. If anyone could provide some insight or point me in the right direction I would be forever grateful!!! Thank you 0 likes, 1 reply "

Same when i go to the bathroom. My energy level is so low I could literally sleep 12-16 hours a day. Anyways the doctor refereed me to a urologist because of the on going problems. So a couple weeks later I went the urologist and told him my issues and he decided to run a tube up my urethra to see if he could help find out what was wrong and he ended up finding a lot of redness and inflammation around my prostate so a couple weeks later he did a biopsy of my prostate and ended up with the diagnosis of CYSTITIS GLANDULARIS so I ended up taking anti-inflammation meds for this and none of the meds ended up working as I still have the burning sensation to this day. So more about the stools and tiredness problems. I went back to my primary care doctor and updated him all the things I have been feeling so I got my poop tested and numerous other blood tests and testosterone tests and so on. Everything came back negative. Everything. He ended up referring me to a gastroenterologist. Please be aware from time I went to my primary care doctor to the time he referred to me a  gastroenterologist I had taken countless different types medication to help with stool problems and nothing helped. Anyways I went to the gastroenterologist and told him my issues and we ended up doing a biopsy of my colon and stomach and came out with the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori  so I was prescribed  meds to help the situation and nothing helped whatsoever. I still feel the exact same as day 1. This is mainly what I feel everyday. Very very low energy. If im not at work you will find me in bed having a hard time keeping my eyes open. They feel so heavy, and burn. There is a strange heaviness in my eyes. like i cant get them feel awake ever! I am still bloated and have loose stools every single day. Nothing is working. I have no sex drive at all. Ive ruined countless of potential relationships because i literally feel croggy and like s**t 24/7! I don't know how much more I can take. I don't feel alive anymore. I feel like the well being of an 80 yr old trapped in 27 year olds body. Sorry for the rant. I just want to feel normal again! Thats it. Ive been prescribed anti-depressants and those do not help. I know I am not depressed. Just my overall mood is s**t 24/7 because of the things I have mentioned above. If anyone could provide some insight or point me in the right direction I would be forever grateful!!! Thank you 0 likes, 1 reply "

I've been since going to see a chiropractor, massages, and daily stretching and it somewhat subsided and suddenly this week, week 17!  post surgery it came back with a vengeance. I have no idea if this is related to the surgery - if because for at least 8 weeks I could only sleep on my back and not able to regularly stretch and exercise during the recovery period.

They were really good, I had a CT and some pretty good stuff for the pain but not before some doctor made me drop my pants and he had a look and a feel.  They made me p**s into a jar and the urology doc was worried when he saw the blood. After some more waiting he came back and told me he wanted to use a small camera to have a look inside my bladder. I was a bit confused at first what he meant thinking it would be another scan/x-ray type thingy but when he described it I realized he litterally was going to put a camera inside me haha! We were taken to a different room and I was told to have a seat on the bed. 2 nurses came in and asked a bunch more wuestions about stuff before they wrapped a hot blanket around my chest, tucking my arms down by my sides while this guy suddenly grabbed my waist and yanked my jeans and underpants down with no warning! It was quite sudden and embarrasing to be honest. He grabbed my ankles and bent my legs open on the table so my parts were on display. The doc came back in and squirted some cold numbing jelly into my pee hole which felt really weird. He then showed me the camera which to my amazement was huge! Litteraly the size of my finger, i was still in disbelief. By this point dad was holding my hands near my head while the nurse had his hand pressing lightly on my chest. It was all a bit sureall. As a 15 year old  I couldnt think of anything worse then being seen naked in front of a group of people let alone having something forcefully shoved down my penis! The doc said to count to 3 slowely while he grabbed ahold of me with one hand and slipped the camera rod inside my tip and pushed it all the way in.  The pain was sudden and excrutiating, I remember thr nurse putting his hand on my chest and knees to stop me moving. Every time he pushed the camera in a little further he would pull my penis up the scope towards him which made it hurt even more. There was a whole heap of moving the camera up, down, around before he pulled it out and said “all done mate.” He couldnt see any damage. I was wuite teary towards the end. They cleaned me up and let me get up off the table. Next they told me I had to stay overnight so they could keep an eye on the bleeding and they wanted to flush my bladder out as well. After some more waiting dad took me up to my ward bed where i would be staying snd a nurse changed me into a gown and took my clothes away. Another doc came in and told me he was going to have to put a catheter in to flush my bladder out. I couldnt think of snythig worse by now. So eventually with some pursuasion from dad I ended up laying on the bed and letting them shove this little rubber tube down inside, it hurt a little but no where near as bad as the hard camera. They hung a big fluid bag above the bed which drained into the catheter and they put another bag on the end of my tube and hung it off the side of the bed. It constantly felt like I had to pee as all the wash ran into my bladder but the nurse said to try ignoring it.  So I slept over and got a good feed and some more tablets and got woken up every few hours while the nurse came in and emptied my catheter bag. In the morning the doc came around and pulled the catheter out and said I could go home now.  I did some digging around online and found out i had had a rigid cystoscopy yesterday and had a foley catheter left in last night. Its really wuite painful when I pee now and theres still a little blood but its gradually getting better. Doc said it’s likely i bruised my bladder during the fall.  Has anyone else had a rigid and how do you stop the stinging everytime i go to the loo??? -Jordan 0 likes, 11 replies "

I quite remember in 2004  I had a similar one but was put to sleep so when the Doctor told me it will be performed with my eyes on, I was a little bit skeptical. Got in the clinic with this fear built in mind but the fear disappeared when the nurse injected me with a medicine to numb my penis. The doctor then used a tiny camera and inserted it in my penis and pushed it slowly to my bladder and other parts. The only discomfort I felt was when it hit my prostate.

I didn't have any pains or discomfort before operation. Now it's just horrible I don't want to go to toilet. The pain is unreal.... after the burning,when urinating. Then comes an intense pain up your back. Almost like pulling a muscle or trapped nerve. It has eased up a little. My urine is red then brown then normal. I get spasms, Odd feeling around my chest.... and I was feeling normal Tuesday. I can't do all the normal things I did. Worried about going back to work. Was intending to go back to work Friday. But got the hassle of having to take holiday so I get paid. And the more exercise I do, the more I will bleed....? Why the hell did I bother going for op. I was fine before.Why so much lack of communication with me?... I now have to have chest ct scan?... and go though all the pain again when I heal. I just want to know what's happening? Is this lump likely to be a stone? Why would he say lump, not stone? Would a stone look completely different to a tumour/lump on ct scans? I need more information before I lose the plot.

I did it twice a few years back, the first time I needed antibiotics, other than the burning effect in the first 2 days during pee, all were good. This time, the burning stopped after the 1st day. But constant urgency to go, peeing is difficult, have to push hard (feel like some kind of blockage at the top of the urethra), only droplets come out. I relaxed a few minutes for the 2nd void which has better stream but still not much. I did ask doctor for antibiotics just in case; he said ""you will know when you need it"". I took the antibiotics on the 2nd night, still has 1 more day supply, the amount is only for 3 days. Although, there is improvement,  the problems remain - urgency every 30 -45mins (didn't get much sleep), 1st void is droplets, 2nd void better but not enough to empty the bladder. Did the procedure damage something inside? I have bph with enlarged median lobe which has been getting worst. May be the worsen bph is causing the grieve? urologist is off on weekend, I will visit the family doctor if symptoms do not improve tonight. Anyone had these symptoms? 0 likes, 0 replies "

In January of this year, I went to a urologist to discuss my symptom. I was dealing mainly with urgency (bathroom 34 times a day), and occasional pain (burning sensation when I pee). He suggested a cystoscopy so that he could see what was going on inside. Two days after the cystoscopy, I was struck with a severe stinging sensation in the tip of my penis. It feels like I'm being stuck with a sharp painful needle. This pain persisted for several months about once a week. I was given nothing for the pain, and discovered OTC AZO which helped with the pain from time to time in the beginning. In June, he did a TUIP to relieve pressure on my bladder. He told me then that it would help with urgency, but not with pain.

I went to see him two weeks ago and he told me to use lidocain 4% topically, and to come back in February. even with the lidocain, I am awakened almost every night with pain and the only thing that touches the pain is 2000mg of tylenol (yeah, I said 2000mg).

In January of this year, I went to a urologist to discuss my symptom. I was dealing mainly with urgency (bathroom 34 times a day), and occasional pain (burning sensation when I pee). He suggested a cystoscopy so that he could see what was going on inside. Two days after the cystoscopy, I was struck with a severe stinging sensation in the tip of my penis. It feels like I'm being stuck with a sharp painful needle. This pain persisted for several months about once a week. I was given nothing for the pain, and discovered OTC AZO which helped with the pain from time to time in the beginning. In June, he did a TUIP to relieve pressure on my bladder. He told me then that it would help with urgency, but not with pain.

I've been passing urine normally and it hasn't even stung, so I guess Ive been lucky. I had no pain until a couple of hours after the procedure, when I guess my anaesthetic had worn off. It was just like Period Pain. I took a couple of Paracetamol and it eased off, and today I am fine.  So trust my post here! I am the biggest softy ever! And if I can do this you can too.

I have been put on 2 different DMARDs and was given a steroid injection in my bum to tide me over until those start working. The day after the steroid i felt so much better and was able to walk and use my hands without pain. However, that seemed to be short lived and the pain is back. I need some advice on how to reduce the pain. Rest? Gentle exercise? Anti-inflammatories?  Heat (I have an infrared lamp)? Cold? What about diet (I am vegan)? I have never smoked, rarely drink alcohol and I am not overweight. I am new to this, so any advice on managing the pain would be welcome. 0 likes, 7 replies "

I was prescribed atorvastatin which did give me some aches in my legs but to to much to worry me about. After a blood test I visited my GP who was completely puzzled by the results. My Good  Cholesterol wasn't even reaching the start of the scale, my bad Cholesterol was OK as was all the other tests that go with the blood test. My GP changed me to another statin and asked to see how this one goes for a while. The new Stain gave me more side effects, so after another blood test I visited another GP in my Surgery  who found my blood test were similar to the last one. Then this GP said ""do you want to know a how I keep my  cholesterol down?"" I eat 6 almonds nuts a day and they keep my cholesterol at an acceptable level. That GP didn't say anything about stopping  my Statins, but I took it upon myself to stop and start eating almonds nuts instead. When I stopped the statins  my total cholesterol  was 5.2 after 6 months of just eating Almonds my blood test showed my total cholesterol  was 3.8 with the good and bad cholesterol sitting in the correct place on the scales. My GP has stopped giving me Statins but is still amazed how I reduced my cholesterol down to 3.8 in total. 1 like, 7 replies "

That being said, the odd thing is even though some symptoms are diminishing, I feel like I'm developing new symptoms. It almost feels like I am drowsy, drunk. I get tired very easily.

I was perfectly fine leading up to the new year (working out 4 out of 7 days a week) then all of a sudden I'm having all these odd symptoms.

I've been through all of the urological tests and they are always normal. A scan revealed large fibroids that made my uterus = to an 18-week pregnancy. One doctor said a fibroid was causing my urethra to kink, which led to urinary retention. I had uterine fibroid embollisation (UFE) in December, but it did not shrink the fibroids enough. Apparently, I still have one pressing n my bladder. I do not have any complaints about my periods, which is what most women with fibroids complain about (although my fibroids are subserosal). My symptoms are: intense pressure on my bladder, which gets unbearable before my period and alleviates somewhat at the end of my period; constant feeling that I need to pee (not urgency, though); weak stream; tender to touch lower pelvis sometimes; discharge, but can't tell if it's vaginal or urinary. I DO NOT have burning, urgency, odour. Does anyone have any experience with bladder symptoms being from fibroids? I am scheduled for a hysterectomy, but am freaking out -- what if this is not caused by my fibroids at all, but instead is some bizarre bladder condition?! 1 like, 17 replies "

I'm hoping someone out there recognizes this and knows how to deal with it. I've been in pain for over four weeks now. It feels like my vaginal entrance is on fire. Sometimes the burning pain is barely there; other times it's bad enough that I maxed out on Ibuprofen, Advil and Tramadol without any relief (and had to go to the ER).  It gets worse when I urinate—yet I don't have an increased urge to urinate (which you would expect from a bladder problem). I've been to two clinics, the ER, a gynecologist, and an imaging center (for an ultrasound). Got two pap tests and had my urine tested. All the tests came back negative.

First of all i noticed a pain in my kidney area in the mornings and my pee had an unusual smell to it, kind of sweet'ish? I made nothing out of it, i just blamed it on the cold weather but the pain around my kidney (lower back but also radiating to the front right side of my stomach) has became constant. So out of interest and for my peace of mind about two weeks ago i checked my pee with a dipstick and it showed white blood cells and proteins so i went to my gp. They didn't say much, they just seemed more curious why i had a dipstick in my flat but they asked for a sample, which i gave them. They never got back to me but the problem has been ongoing and today i checked my pee again and it still show white blood cells, proteins and now also blood. I am not quite sure what to do, its really hard to get through to my gp and also i don't want them to think that i am a hypochondriac because i have a dipstick or something like that but the whole situation is worrying me. Also apart from that i have been suffering from unexplained iron deficiency for four years now and i lost a bit of weight in the past eight months (about two stone) and to be honest i am feeling quite worn off with it all and i would like to have some explanation or even an idea of what going on. What can be the problem? Should i go back to my gp anyway? I am sorry for writing so much and thank you for any help. 0 likes, 2 replies "

Burning at tip of penis. After bowel movement pee urgency increases. What is? ,"Hi there, I'm a 23 year old male and I started having problems around 3 months ago. It started after I finished an edging session (masturbating). I felt the constant urge to pee. I didn't give it much notice because something similar happened in the past, in a similar circumstance. Usually after a nights rest it will disappear. However, not this time around. I was visiting the toilet every 30-60 minutes.  And always have the urge at the tip of the penile area. I visited my local GP,  they prescribed me antibiotics for a UTI as well as performing a urine test.  I finished the course of antibiotics with no difference in my condition and test results coming back clean. No UTI or STD.  (cephalexin 500mg). My GP referred me to get an ultrasound done on my bladder and a blood test. And during the meantime prescribed me overactive bladder medication in hopes of reducing my symptoms. The ultrasound was performed and nothing abnormal was found. No thickening of the bladder walls and prostate was normal walnut size. Blood test returned with everything normal.  For OAB I was first given (oxybutynin) giving me heavy side effects, dry mouth, dry eyes, losing my voice, barely any saliva in throat, etc. Then alternatively given (solifenacin 5mg or Vesicare) giving me no side effects. However, neither of those medications gave me relief. At this point I was referred to a urologist. Seeing the urologist I explained to him exactly as above. That this started after my edging session. He dismissed how it could be linked with my current issues. He believed it was OAB. Giving me (mirabegron 50mg or Betmiga). He also put me on the waiting for a cystoscopy. Still needing to visit the toilet every few minutes it was clear the OAB medications aren't effective. At this stage I was really unsettled. I was really depressed about everything. 4 medications with no luck. I live a very active life. Doing cardio and resistance training for an hour each day. My BMI is optimal. My abdominal muscles are defined. I would perform core exercises and yoga as recovery. My nutrition is managed. No caffeine, no alcohol.  Balanced diet. But with this issue I've had to stop exercising due to the discomfort. So I went to a sexual health clinic. Providing them all the tests I've done beforehand to see what they believe could be the cause. Nonspecific Urethritis or NGU was a possibility. I was prescribed (doxycycline 100mg). This also proved unsuccessful. Being 1 month and a half my symptoms sort of subsided some days. I was going every hour to 2 hours. But the burning and urge was still constant. Always at the tip of the penis. I figured I would try some vitamins to see. I've had urinary tract support vitamins, hiprex for urinary tract infections. Still nothing. After waiting what seemed an eternity (2 weeks) I was able to see the urologist again. He prescribed me (zithromax 500mg) 2 tablets at once. In hopes of getting rid of any infection or bacteria that could be causing me this discomfort. This was also unsuccessful. However, I noticed that during my bowel movement my penis felt burning. I would pee alittle while pooing and it would trigger my urge to pee even more. After I would finish pooing the urge to pee would be every 30 minutes. I believed it could be a prostate related problem. I returned to my GP and explained what's been happening currently. She believed it could be prostatitis. She had me do a urine test again and blood test to measure the PSA levels. Prescribing me (trimethoprim 300mg) a 2 week treatment. I've currently entered my second week of treatment with no signs of improvement. Now 3 months with this issue I'll explain my current condition. The urge to pee is still constant however I can hold it for 3 hours or more sometimes. Going 5 - 6 times in a normal day. I don't wake up at night to go, I can get 6 - 8 hours rest. I've stopped masturbating for 2 months. I can get erections and maintain them without issues. I feel no testicular pain or abdominal pain. I've been performing pelvic based exercises every 2 days (kegel exercises), I average between 8000 steps daily (which is below my standard before this issue happened). Cut out any foods that may trigger my bladder. I've found the only times I get relief is after a hot shower. When I'm seated, with my legs crossed over (sometimes). When I'm laying down raising my knees to my chest. Gently massaging the area between the testicles and anus. These are the only times. But now after I poo the urge is extreme. I do my bowel movement once a day. Sometimes I'll skip a day. And during that day I'll go 5 times to the toilet but have light burning & urgency. Bowel movement really triggers it. Thank you for reading all this. I'll be happy to answer any questions. Any help would be appreciated immensely. 0 likes, 10 replies "

Burning at tip of penis. After bowel movement pee urgency increases. What is? ,"Hi there, I'm a 23 year old male and I started having problems around 3 months ago. It started after I finished an edging session (masturbating). I felt the constant urge to pee. I didn't give it much notice because something similar happened in the past, in a similar circumstance. Usually after a nights rest it will disappear. However, not this time around. I was visiting the toilet every 30-60 minutes.  And always have the urge at the tip of the penile area. I visited my local GP,  they prescribed me antibiotics for a UTI as well as performing a urine test.  I finished the course of antibiotics with no difference in my condition and test results coming back clean. No UTI or STD.  (cephalexin 500mg). My GP referred me to get an ultrasound done on my bladder and a blood test. And during the meantime prescribed me overactive bladder medication in hopes of reducing my symptoms. The ultrasound was performed and nothing abnormal was found. No thickening of the bladder walls and prostate was normal walnut size. Blood test returned with everything normal.  For OAB I was first given (oxybutynin) giving me heavy side effects, dry mouth, dry eyes, losing my voice, barely any saliva in throat, etc. Then alternatively given (solifenacin 5mg or Vesicare) giving me no side effects. However, neither of those medications gave me relief. At this point I was referred to a urologist. Seeing the urologist I explained to him exactly as above. That this started after my edging session. He dismissed how it could be linked with my current issues. He believed it was OAB. Giving me (mirabegron 50mg or Betmiga). He also put me on the waiting for a cystoscopy. Still needing to visit the toilet every few minutes it was clear the OAB medications aren't effective. At this stage I was really unsettled. I was really depressed about everything. 4 medications with no luck. I live a very active life. Doing cardio and resistance training for an hour each day. My BMI is optimal. My abdominal muscles are defined. I would perform core exercises and yoga as recovery. My nutrition is managed. No caffeine, no alcohol.  Balanced diet. But with this issue I've had to stop exercising due to the discomfort. So I went to a sexual health clinic. Providing them all the tests I've done beforehand to see what they believe could be the cause. Nonspecific Urethritis or NGU was a possibility. I was prescribed (doxycycline 100mg). This also proved unsuccessful. Being 1 month and a half my symptoms sort of subsided some days. I was going every hour to 2 hours. But the burning and urge was still constant. Always at the tip of the penis. I figured I would try some vitamins to see. I've had urinary tract support vitamins, hiprex for urinary tract infections. Still nothing. After waiting what seemed an eternity (2 weeks) I was able to see the urologist again. He prescribed me (zithromax 500mg) 2 tablets at once. In hopes of getting rid of any infection or bacteria that could be causing me this discomfort. This was also unsuccessful. However, I noticed that during my bowel movement my penis felt burning. I would pee alittle while pooing and it would trigger my urge to pee even more. After I would finish pooing the urge to pee would be every 30 minutes. I believed it could be a prostate related problem. I returned to my GP and explained what's been happening currently. She believed it could be prostatitis. She had me do a urine test again and blood test to measure the PSA levels. Prescribing me (trimethoprim 300mg) a 2 week treatment. I've currently entered my second week of treatment with no signs of improvement. Now 3 months with this issue I'll explain my current condition. The urge to pee is still constant however I can hold it for 3 hours or more sometimes. Going 5 - 6 times in a normal day. I don't wake up at night to go, I can get 6 - 8 hours rest. I've stopped masturbating for 2 months. I can get erections and maintain them without issues. I feel no testicular pain or abdominal pain. I've been performing pelvic based exercises every 2 days (kegel exercises), I average between 8000 steps daily (which is below my standard before this issue happened).

Thank you for reading all this. I'll be happy to answer any questions. Any help would be appreciated immensely. 0 likes, 10 replies "

I'm posting here because maybe i can find answers. Around a year ago, I suddenly while sitting infront of the pc started to feel pain in the left testicle. I remember vaguely it happened after I masturbated like 3 times in a day or after i slept with my wife when my bladder was full. Hard to remember after so long. Anyway I went to a GP and he thought i have epididymitis and i have been given doxycycline for 2 weeks. About 3 days into treatment I suddenly felt constant itchiness and burning in the distal part of my urethra and it goes away for couple of seconds while i Pee. The itchiness and burning is in the area of the fossa navicularis, maybe a bit below the glans penis. Anyway not only i felt constant itchiness and burning I started to have two streams of urine, the higher one was strong and lower one was dribbling. Usually when i have alot of urine the stream was more less as one. But as the voiding came to stop the urine started to bifurcated again. I also started to notice my flow is less strong and the diameter of my urine is less wide like it was. Before it i remembered i peed with no problems at all, maybe went more to the toilet than other people but i drank a lot of coffee. Anyway after finishing my treatment the pain in the testicle went away and I went to the Urologist who thought I have prostatitis and gave me ciprofloxacin. I must say I thought it wasn't the prostate because I knew the pain is only in one place in the urethra, even when i ejaculated the semen came a bit bifurcated (gushing bifurcated not shooting. sorry for the extreme details). Anyway I took the the antibiotics and did vast STD blood test, urine culture and US of kidney and bladder. Everything was perfect and normal. after 3 weeks of taking the pills i was still suffering from itchiness and bifurcated stream. My urologist thought there is nothing he can do and so he thought I have chronic pelvic pain syndrome and the urine burning and itchiness is a refereed pain and the split stream urine is because of the prostate. I do not think it is a CPPS. I think it is something with my urethra, I once put inside Dermacombin ointment and it felt a bit better afterwards but my urologist didn't recommended it. He said there is nothing he can do for me. and so I have been suffering for the last year the same thing. very very mild itchiness and tingling in the distal part of the urethra, sometimes when i study and work i don't feel a thing but if i touch the area its like inflamed again. I try not to touch the area so much not to irritate it. I still ejaculate with a bit bifurcation and it still not shooting and only gushing. I wonder if i'm stuck with this thing for all my life. I noticed my stream is quite the same, I can be quite strong if i drink a lot of fluids but there's always in the end of voiding 2 streams of urine and one the lower one is more dribbling. And like i say i think the diameter of the urine is smaller than before. And now, 1 week ago I started to have the same pain in my testicle so I went to another urologist because now the left testicle is much higher than before i thought i have a torsion so he did an ultrasound and saw very mild inflammation of the epididymis (some fluid and thicker epidiymis). So im back to ciproflaxcin for 10 days. I told him about the split stream urine and the very mild itchiness and he think it is nothing. I would love to ear your thoughts. 0 likes, 11 replies "

I'm posting here because maybe i can find answers. Around a year ago, I suddenly while sitting infront of the pc started to feel pain in the left testicle. I remember vaguely it happened after I masturbated like 3 times in a day or after i slept with my wife when my bladder was full. Hard to remember after so long. Anyway I went to a GP and he thought i have epididymitis and i have been given doxycycline for 2 weeks. About 3 days into treatment I suddenly felt constant itchiness and burning in the distal part of my urethra and it goes away for couple of seconds while i Pee. The itchiness and burning is in the area of the fossa navicularis, maybe a bit below the glans penis. Anyway not only i felt constant itchiness and burning I started to have two streams of urine, the higher one was strong and lower one was dribbling. Usually when i have alot of urine the stream was more less as one. But as the voiding came to stop the urine started to bifurcated again. I also started to notice my flow is less strong and the diameter of my urine is less wide like it was. Before it i remembered i peed with no problems at all, maybe went more to the toilet than other people but i drank a lot of coffee. Anyway after finishing my treatment the pain in the testicle went away and I went to the Urologist who thought I have prostatitis and gave me ciprofloxacin. I must say I thought it wasn't the prostate because I knew the pain is only in one place in the urethra, even when i ejaculated the semen came a bit bifurcated (gushing bifurcated not shooting. sorry for the extreme details). Anyway I took the the antibiotics and did vast STD blood test, urine culture and US of kidney and bladder. Everything was perfect and normal. after 3 weeks of taking the pills i was still suffering from itchiness and bifurcated stream. My urologist thought there is nothing he can do and so he thought I have chronic pelvic pain syndrome and the urine burning and itchiness is a refereed pain and the split stream urine is because of the prostate. I do not think it is a CPPS. I think it is something with my urethra, I once put inside Dermacombin ointment and it felt a bit better afterwards but my urologist didn't recommended it.

Many people suffer from this ailment which causes people to contantly (usually in 4-7 minute intervals) to take a deep breath in order to just ""trigger"" that satisfying feeling in their upper lungs. But it's not that simple, because sometimes that feeling doesn't come. And we keep forcing that deep breath, trying to get the satisfaction - a forced yawn, contortion of the body, whatever it will take. It always comes eventually, but the cycle starts over. We all say it's worse when we eat. We all say it's not a problem while sleeping. We all say it goes away at times when we are heavily focused on something.  Trust me, I HAD it for almost 2 years, and it wasn't just once in a while. I literally had this thing NON STOP EVERY DAY until a few weeks ago. One caveat before I say what I did - I've talked to many people with this condition, and it's true it's not a one size fits all solution - some have hiatial hernias, others have GERD, and I'm sure others have other conditions that cause it. But if you have any inkling of a thought that it could be anxiety, keep reading. The reason why you will never hear someone say ""here's the cure for it"" is because it's not that simple. But I'll just throw it out there right now. YES IT'S A COMBINATION OF ANXIETY AND LIFESTYLE. STOP seeing doctors (again, caveat - unless you think it might not be anxiety per the above), STOP reading on the internet about what people do to fix it (pepto bismal, breathing exercises, just STOP). It's ANXIETY AND LIFESTYLE. And I didn't believe it either because, sure I was anxious about a few things every now and then (who isn't?), but this thing lurks around all day even though you don't think you are particularly anxious. But I guarantee there are things you are anxious about. For me, and I bet for many of you, I was anxious about my overall health. Why wouldn't I be? I was grasping for a satisfying breath every few minutes thinking this must be the end, so it makes sense. But I did something drastic, and I admit that I am a little bit in shock that it ACTUALLY worked! I completely turned my lifestyle upside down. I am not suggesting all of you are fast food junkies, but I was. I wasn't obese (196 weight 5'10 male) but I could stand to lose 20-25 pounds. I was drinking coffee, diet coke, some water here and there - but burgers, fried foods, some good foods here and there - ZERO exercise. My waist was 38 and I remember it being a 36 for years, so this was a relatively sudden expansion.  For the past three weeks (which isn't long), I've 100% cut out: 1) Caffeine and carbonated drinks 2) Soda 3) Fast food 4) Fried foods And added: 1) Vegetables and fruits to diet 2) Exercised vigorously on an eliptycal for 20 min a day As time went on and my weight dropped (now at 190.3), the need to deep breath almost exponentially vanished. I still breath deep every now and then mind you, but you have to remember, everyone breathes deep every now and then. I talked to a doctor who said people breath deep once every 20 minutes. But we are hyper focused on it, so we will think ""Oh geez, it's back"". It's not. I never in a million years thought I would beat this thing, especially as quickly as I did, and a couple people I know did a massive lifestyle change and they said things look better. I wish this worked for everyone, and I'm sure there will be someone who says ""but I am super fit and already eat well"". You might have a different issue, OR, it is still anxiety but as I said - I was nervous about my health - now that my blood pressure has visibly dropped and I'm sure my cholesterol levels have too - I am NOT SO NERVOUS ABOUT IT and that's why my deep breathing went away. So you need to find out what you worried about and address it. I hope this helps folks, and it can't hurt to try this if you think you might be worried about your health. I also feel there's a component of your stomach expanding (from food, extra fat around waist, etc.) that changes your breathing patterns - I don't know if it's more that or anxiety, but I don't really care as this works. Please do try it for a couple of weeks and let me know how it goes! Again as a final disclaimer: I am not a doctor so if your deep breathing is totally unrelated to anxiety or diet/lifestyle, then you should definitely get it checked out. I can speak for myself, and many others, we've had our fair share of doctors and there's nothing they can give you to fix it. You need to fix it yourself and I am living proof that I was able to beat it! Good luck! 7 likes, 105 replies "

Many people suffer from this ailment which causes people to contantly (usually in 4-7 minute intervals) to take a deep breath in order to just ""trigger"" that satisfying feeling in their upper lungs. But it's not that simple, because sometimes that feeling doesn't come. And we keep forcing that deep breath, trying to get the satisfaction - a forced yawn, contortion of the body, whatever it will take. It always comes eventually, but the cycle starts over. We all say it's worse when we eat. We all say it's not a problem while sleeping. We all say it goes away at times when we are heavily focused on something.  Trust me, I HAD it for almost 2 years, and it wasn't just once in a while. I literally had this thing NON STOP EVERY DAY until a few weeks ago. One caveat before I say what I did - I've talked to many people with this condition, and it's true it's not a one size fits all solution - some have hiatial hernias, others have GERD, and I'm sure others have other conditions that cause it. But if you have any inkling of a thought that it could be anxiety, keep reading. The reason why you will never hear someone say ""here's the cure for it"" is because it's not that simple. But I'll just throw it out there right now. YES IT'S A COMBINATION OF ANXIETY AND LIFESTYLE. STOP seeing doctors (again, caveat - unless you think it might not be anxiety per the above), STOP reading on the internet about what people do to fix it (pepto bismal, breathing exercises, just STOP).

Please help.,"My name is PARTHO DEY. I am 23 years old. I am a football player. Till june 7, I was totally fit and fine , and I still remember that I played football on that day with no issues. I use to play football  3-4 hours continuously and even did gymnasium but never had any breathing problems. But in the childhood  I suffered from poor digestion associated with chronic   which took 10 years to cure with homeopathic medicines. I also had nasal polyp surgery done in 2012 when I was in 10th grade. Suddenly some breathing problem started from 8 June ,2015 morning 7.00 am. The problem started with swollen turbinate  and adenoids and deviated septum and at the same time changes in my breathing pattern.  There's a constant urge to deep breath with a satisfactory sensation. Sometimes when that urge comes and I  breath deeply , i dont feel satisfied  and again i have to breath  deep until I reach that sensation. Sometimes I have to wait for the yawn to get full deep breath. This is going on the whole day after every 4-5 mins. On july 6, 2016  i had a surgery for swollen turbinates, deviated septum and adenoids. But still the problem is there. This problem is there everytime whether i am engaged into something or when i am ideally sitting or watching videos or even while playing computer games. I am also having shortness of breath while talking, walking , climbing up the stairs or whether i am sitting ideal at a place. I cannot move out of house due to breathlessness. Have problem while eating food. As soon as i start swallowing, there is shortness of breath. Sometimes i cannot sleep due to this thing. I stay awake till late night and try to normalise. Also there is   in right ear. Have difficulty sleeping at night due to continuous noise in silence. I am also having digestive issue like gas and bleching even after having home normal meals. My digestion is very poor. This all problems has made my life difficult, i cannot attend college for lectures, i had missed my exams, i cannot spend time with friends, cannot start up with a job ,etc. I have consulted many doctors including MD, pulmonologist,  gastroenterologist,  homeopathic physicians , psychiatrist etc and have done all my blood test, CT chest, PFT, Sonography, but all came normal. I took Psychiatrist medicines too but none helped. They just made me sleep and then i had side effects. Doctors tell me that it is due to my  . They tell that i think too much , i have something going in my mind, but the question is why would i do that? To be very honest,  there's  nothing wrong, i dont have any  fear or anxiety. I have completed my graduation with the same breathing condition. I didnt had any stress neither got panic during my exams too. I am regularly doing deep breathing exercises according to my comfort. If anybody’s suffering from this similar type of  issues and have got cured by consulting some doctor or taking some medicines, then please give me the details. Please help! 0 likes, 13 replies "

My son, who is a twin, and is now 7, has had two problems for many years now: My son has been under the care of a paediatric specialist since he was 2 and was thought to be asthmatic (this wasnt an official diagnosis but a feeling by his doctor)  so and was prescribed a bunch of different medication including Salubutomol inhalers, beclamethasone, cetirizine hydrochloride, montelukast, nose sprays like flucticanose, and also the atrovent inhaler. All these medications were given in different combinations at different times to see if any combination would work. Nothing helped so the feeling now is he's not asthamatic. Since he was intubated in December 2018, he’s had an MLB where they found two cysts on his voice box which the surgeons believe had appeared as a result of the intubation tube. While the cysts were on his voice box, the persistent cough appeared to go away. As soon as the cysts were removed the persistent cough came back. When we ask my son what he feels and why he coughs, he says he feels an itch in his throat and hopes a cough would take the itch away. The cough frequency increases significantly with activity. And the cough frequency definitely increases when unwell where he coughs every 10 seconds and this frequent cough always ultimately turns into upper airway restrictions where he requires his rescue medication. With the persistent cough being that frequent he says it’s difficult to breathe and finds it hard to speak.

It doesn't happen constantly, maybe one or twice a month, sometimes i won't have it for a while but then it'll come back. I don't know how to describe the pain, it feels like maybe pressure. I just thought that this was normal because maybe I stood up all day for too long or that my legs just fell asleep but then I would be awake at night and have to move my legs or get up. Sometimes I'd cry myself to sleep because I wanted the pain to go away and I was so sleepy. I'm in my teens so I thought maybe this is growing pains. I'm not sure if this is also related but I get a tingling pins and needles in my feet and arms throughout the day. I haven't seen a doctor because I don't think this is greatly affecting me since it doesn't happen everyday or so. I'd just like to know your thoughts. Thanks! 0 likes, 10 replies "

Also lack of stability in grip. Currently on medication Naproxen . Also Amitriptyline which has been upped in dosage.

Previously had a short course of physio from my employer who works within an NHS trust. Who has now referred me back to orthpedic specialist once again. With a 3 to 4 month wait. also more physio work required. The physio has come to a conclusion that i have a problem with my brachial plexus or with my c5 to c7. I previously has Acromioplasty to my left shoulder 8/9 years ago. Which took over 2.5 years of seeing GP doctors, hospital appointments with orthorpedic specialist and neurologist, physio, steriod injections and medication. Could a mis-diagnosis or a failed subacromial decompression be the cause of this? Also is there anything you can recommend to help with pain management. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I feel that I would like to get my story out there, to share my experience so that others are not caught off guard like I was. Just so you understand where I’m coming from. I am 35 yrs. old and have never been sick like this ever in my life. I always considered myself super healthy because I never through my years and years of playing sports any injuries that sidelined me. Well now I’ve payed for playing through the pain. I would consider myself an advanced indoor volleyball player. I played thru high school, on traveling teams who went to nationals and then continued my career thru college. I still (prior to this injury) play indoor volleyball as much as possible and even help out coaching an area high school team. Volleyball is my life and the thought of never playing again breaks my heart. The only real injury I’ve had was while I was playing in college. I being a young naive player who really only wanted to play, started having problems with my hitting. It was horrible pain just making contact with the volleyball, let alone trying to hit it at the opposing team. Now that I’m older I see my mistake. I should have gone to my coach and said something but I didn’t. Granted...as a coach you must be observant of your players and if they start acting ""not normal"" you need to pull them aside and talk to them. My coach did not do that. I in no way blame him, it was more my fault not telling anyone but I was raised to play thru the pain and never to quit. That may seem like a great idea but it wasn’t. So I basically played thru my injury and finished my volleyball career playing every game but not at 100%. I got real good at hiding my problem. That is until I had to go out into the real world and work. I am a Cat Scan technologist at an area hospital. Most people think all we do is push buttons all day, with no real heavy work.... I’m here to tell you on an average day I lift a minimum 15 patients who weigh from 160lbs-450lbs. most of that is cart to cart moving but it also counts the people I have to hold onto that are fall risks (which means they have some medical issue that has made them very prone to falling so I have to hold onto them so they don’t fall). A lot of the moving is dead weight which means getting no help from the patient. Let’s not forget the people who grab at the tech when trying to get up or just freaking out. Please don’t do that ever! You will hurt me and I’m not ok with that. I’m there trying to help you the best I can. Granted some of those people are truly sick and I totally have no problem moving them, but the others are just people who think just because they are in the emergency room that means they don’t have to help or move on their own. I’m here to tell you, if you are able to move, it is in your best interest to move yourself because if I move you you’re going to be uncomfortable and on a hard plastic board for the 15 minutes if everything goes as planned and just so you know its hard board with no cushion. The board is there to help me make it easier to get you from the cart to the CT table and back, I call it my second person. I work evenings and I’m alone. No help anywhere. If I need help it takes up to 5-10 minutes to find someone. So if I don’t have you on the board I can’t physically move you back to the cart without hurting you more. I don’t want to hurt you or myself. The CT table is not a flat table like most people think, the table is kind of molded with a curve to it, I describe it kind of like a ditch. So with no board under you and I was to pull you over... expect a very big bump and it’s probably not going to feel very good especially if you are already hurting. Oh and by the way I will not pull you over on my own. That’s why I’m in my current situation. I care too much for my patients that is my weakness. I don’t think about my well-being and I’ve screwed myself over by doing that. So after 13 years of doing CT, last year I started having RT shoulder pain. It started off gradual then was getting worse and worse the more I used it at work. I was having so issues with something moving out of place which made it impossible for me to use my shoulder. The last time it happened it took me 5 painful hours to get it to pop back in. So after that I finally broke down and went to an orthopedic doctor to whom I knew at my hospital. We started off with physical therapy and steroid injections. We did also finally get the insurance company to approve an MR Arthrogram (they inject contrast dye into the shoulder joint then do an MRI looking for tears or abnormal anatomy). The MRI said I had bursitis and some mild fraying of my labrum. So I ended up doing PT for 4 months with no improvements. It hurt just as much as it did when I started if not a little worse. I think within that time frame I did 3-4 steroid injections which never helped one bit with my pain. It did help the tendonitis and bursitis that I kept getting but never helped my anterior shoulder pain. This pain felt like someone was stabbing me in the shoulder with a knife. It’s really uncomfortable. So I finished my first round of PT with no relief. Unfortunately I knew where this was taking me. I went back to the ortho doctor for an appt and yes amazingly surgery was the next step. So surgery was scheduled. Would I do it again....NO, I’d wait til I couldn’t use my arm at all then do it but unfortunately I went ahead and had surgery. It was supposed to be an easy fix and it kind of was at first. So I went in for the surgery, arriving at 6am at the hospital. Got all undressed and ready. The anesthesiologist came in and started my IV and did a shoulder block which of all the things done to me that was the weirdest and best thing ever. I would recommend the shoulder block, it helped a lot with the pain and trust me the pain is horrible. They put me to sleep and when I woke up I was in the recovery room with my arm in an immobilizer. The words that came out of my mouth were not good ones. I had a warning that if I woke up with just a sling on, it was an easy fix but if I woke up in an immobilizer sling then it had gotten difficult. So as you can guess I said a few choice words and since I was still coming out of my anesthesia I believe I said them pretty darn loud. I didn’t care though and still don’t. I don’t remember much from the recovery room other than trying to throw up. (FYI....just do it, don’t fight it, it just makes it worse.) Getting dressed was a challenge. It took 2 people to dress me. My modesty was out the window, I could have cared less who saw me or what they saw. Which when it’s at your place of employment maybe I should have cared a little more but I didn’t and still don’t care who saw what. I just wanted to go home. They got me dressed. I had rigged up a loose tank top with Velcro at the top so all the nurses had to do is have me stand up and slip it up and Velcro it together. It worked out great, the nurses loved it and told me to sell them. I lived in tank tops for like 3 months following surgery. It was just easier that way. The only downside was I had my surgery in January so I was a little cold but I had a jacket that I would throw over my shoulders when I went outside. It worked. So they had me all dressed, gave my parents all the instructions and pain meds and sent me home. Here’s a good thing to know.....for the car ride home have a pillow and a mild soda in the car. The soda is there just to change the taste in your mouth from the anesthesia which is the reason you will keep wanting to vomit but don’t drink too much otherwise you will vomit. Turn the cold air on in the car and have it hit you in the face. That will help with the nausea and hopefully keep you from up chucking. I’d wait an hour or so after leaving and getting home before trying to put something in your stomach. And when you do make it bland....no flavor. I went with toast with a little butter. It did what I needed it to do and that was be in my stomach for my pain meds. You will live on your pain meds continuously for a good 3-4 days probably. I started to taper down I think on day 3 but that was so I could get off of them sooner so I could leave my parents’ house on my own. I love my parents but there is a reason I don’t live with them anymore. So the first day after surgery you will get to take your dressings they put on you (to cover your incisions with sutures) off. It was a great feeling except when I had to take the tape off. I told them I was allergic to tape aka adhesive but that didn’t stop them from putting a lot of super sticky tape on me. Let’s just say I lost some skin that morning. I was not a happy camper. Once I got it off and covered my incisions with sensitive skin band-aids I was all good. Each day after that was ok, I made myself get out of the house at least twice a day mostly just to walk around Walmart or wherever. Usually didn’t last long maybe 30min but at least I was out and not stuck inside. Mostly I ended up sleeping because of the pain meds. Or attempting to watch TV but usually I fell asleep with that too. It wasn’t until I really worked myself off the meds did I finally feel like doing things. Even then though I’d eventually pop a pill because I’d overdo it. But that’s how it goes at the beginning. So a week after my surgery was my first PT appointment. I had the same PT therapist I had the first time so he knew me and what was going on, so it made things a little better. For the longest time at the beginning PT is all passive motion which means you don’t do any work, the therapist does all the movement for you. And if you do try to do something they will know and they do yell at you to stop it...ha ha ha. It’s not your fault it’s just instinct. So just an FYI..they won’t let you get away with much. I will tell you the stretching sucks. It’s painful and especially when they massage your incision sites.....look out it really hurts but will get better as you move through your PT. I recommend getting ice for your shoulder after they are done picking on you, just ask for some they have plenty. They can wrap it around your shoulder so it will stay on its own. It will help the pain. Go straight home if possible and take a pain pill because you will be hurting. Now if you have a driver driving you to PT then I’d go ahead and take a pain pill before your appt but if you are like me and have no one I just ended up taking Advil before PT then the awesome magical pain pill after when I got myself home. FYI....I drove myself which they don’t recommend when you are in your immobilizer (and when it’s your dominant arm=kind of makes driving a little hard) because the cops will give you a ticket if you get into an accident or pulled over but I had no choice so I took the risk. I just took my time and tried to not be in a hurry. Easier said than done when you’re in pain but that’s why I recommend the ice it helps. After a few weeks PT will start letting you do things but with caution. They will introduce some weight not much only like a 1 lb. weight but at first that’s heavy. Gradually you will work yourself up to 3-4 lb. weight, resistance bands of multiple strength, weighted balls and exercises but that’s usually towards the end of your PT experience. The key is slow and steady and if something hurts TELL your therapist. They can come up with a different exercise and they need to document pain in case something isn’t right....once again I’m speaking from experience. So I did PT post op for 5 months. At my 3rd month I started complaining about shoulder pain in the area of my bicipital groove. I told my PT guy and he worked around it and documented it. This pain would not go away. So I had a follow up appt with my Ortho Dr and brought this problem up. Now this is where I should have known I was screwed. My ortho would not take my pain seriously, he kept saying some pain is normal until 1 year post op so he wouldn’t take me seriously til that one year had passed since the surgery. I know some pain is normal, I get that however I’m in the medical field and totally get that a little pain should be normal but this pain wasn’t giving up and it was getting worse. Every appt I had after that I complained and all he would do is give me steroid injections. No imaging was done only injections. I completed PT after doing it for 5 months, had great Range of Motion with no problems but still had that anterior pain going down my bicep. Went for another ortho appt which turned out to be the one where he cleared me for work so I would have no restrictions. When he said he was going to clear me I questioned him because for my work I have to be able to lift a minimum 75lbs on my own and the heaviest I could do after all my PT was 35 lbs. The dr proceeded to tell me I would be fine to just be careful. Alert, Alert....that was warning sign number 2 that I should have seen as a red flag to go to another dr. But being a person who was going crazy not being able to work, I was like ok but I did hesitate. So now I’m back to work....two months later I was back in his office for another injection and complaining session. He ignored me like usual....red flag number three. A week after that last injection I was fed up with this ortho doc. I was hurting and work was getting impossible. So I went to one of my radiologists whom I’ve worked with for 13 years and asked if he knew another doctor to go to for a second opinion. He gave me a name and I went for it. I got all my paperwork together, anything I could get my hands onto and took it into his office for his review and for a week I patiently waited for a phone call for an approval or denial. To my great surprise and relief, his office called to schedule an appointment. I went to that appt hoping he could and would help me. I was just stuck with no help from my current doctor and I didn’t know what else to do. At my appt we sat down together and talked about what was going on. He was listening....it was great. I no longer was being treated like an older person who didn’t know anything about medicine. He agreed with me.....I shouldn’t be hurting like I was. So he ordered another MR Arthrogram to see what was going on in the shoulder. One week later I was at the imaging facility enjoying another MRI. It actually wasn’t too bad, a lot more painful than the first time but I just said that was because of the surgery scar tissue.....apparently I was wrong. According to the MR I have re-tore my labrum a lot worse than I had the first time. So now I just found out I get to have another awesome shoulder surgery. Won’t know the extent of damage fully til he gets in but I saw the MR images and the tear looks rather large. Granted I don’t do MRI but I do understand the images. Even my radiologist said he's not sure what’s going on other than yes I will have to have surgery again. Well that was reassuring…thanks doc. So here I am just days before I see my new ortho to plan surgery. I just want to cry.....it sucked the first time and now I have to do it again. It’s so not fair!!! Now I do want to let you guys know about something that happened while I was off the first time around. I feel that it’s really important to share this with you... I’ve been plagued with anxiety/depression over the last few years. I’ve dealt with it on my own and it’s been fine. It’s never been bad....Unfortunately after my shoulder surgery it got worse...way worse. I’m not proud about what I almost did, but I’m glad I noticed I was having a problem before I followed through with a very bad idea. I’ll just be truthful....I was sitting at a stoplight, first in line at a very busy intersection, I looked left and then right to see a lot of traffic when the very bad thought popped into my head. If I just go now, I won’t have to deal with things for a while. That thought scared the crap out of me. I’ve never had any ideas like that before let alone want to actually do it. That moment was when I knew I had to get help. I was crying my eyes out for no real reason. I was stressed... yes who wouldn’t be but I didn’t think it was that bad. Thank goodness my body didn’t listen to what my mind was saying. I could have easily seen my foot just tap the excelerator just enough to get me into traffic. It would have been bad but thankfully I was aware enough not to do it. Now I tell you my story to make you aware that when you get laid up, be aware and make your friends aware so they know to keep an eye out for odd behavior. Prior to my incident, I was showing signs of having issues but no one said anything. Please as a friend be there for each other because you could easily save their life. The next day I called my primary doctor up and scheduled an appt for possible depression/anxiety disorder. He put me on Zoloft and it was heaven. No anxiety, no worrying.....I couldn’t even think 5 minutes ahead and it was great. I was a notorious worrier, I’d be worrying about something a month away but now no more. It was awesome. Prior to surgery I researched constantly trying to get my head around what I was about to go through. Nowhere did I read anything about depression. I had no idea. I’m writing this so hopefully it will make people aware what they need to look out for. What I hope you have taken away from my story..... Don’t let a doctor tell you your fine when you feel there is something wrong. Be constant with your complaints and keep complaining until they either listen or you find a doctor who will listen. You know your body better than they do so don’t give up. Be mindful of your mindset. Basically watch out for signs of depression. You may think it won’t happen to you but that’s usually when it comes and bites you in your butt. Don’t seclude yourself, get out and get around people. You don’t have to talk to them just be around them. That alone will help. Don’t be afraid of getting help. If you have the right doctor he/she will listen and give you choices on how to help the problems. To Family and friends... please keep an eye on your friends/family who undergo any kind of surgery. You may be the one who notices some behavior that isn’t right. Please watch out for their safety because they may not even notice it. For coaches and parents.....pay attention to your athlete. You are around them almost or if not every day, you know what ""normal"" is for them. If they injure themselves they may not tell you and try to play it off which could make the injury worse. So please be diligent and if you think somethings not right, pull them aside quietly and ask them. If my coach had done that I might not be where I am today (aka surgery #2). And to my fellow athletes and medical professionals.....don’t be afraid to say somethings wrong, I’m hurt. Don’t let people bully you into making you think you are fine. I know we all love our sport/job and just want to keep working/playing but if you hurt yourself and not say anything, you could end up regretting it down the road. I don’t want you to go through the pain if it can be avoided. 4 likes, 16 replies "

I feel that I would like to get my story out there, to share my experience so that others are not caught off guard like I was. Just so you understand where I’m coming from. I am 35 yrs. old and have never been sick like this ever in my life. I always considered myself super healthy because I never through my years and years of playing sports any injuries that sidelined me. Well now I’ve payed for playing through the pain. I would consider myself an advanced indoor volleyball player. I played thru high school, on traveling teams who went to nationals and then continued my career thru college. I still (prior to this injury) play indoor volleyball as much as possible and even help out coaching an area high school team. Volleyball is my life and the thought of never playing again breaks my heart. The only real injury I’ve had was while I was playing in college. I being a young naive player who really only wanted to play, started having problems with my hitting. It was horrible pain just making contact with the volleyball, let alone trying to hit it at the opposing team. Now that I’m older I see my mistake. I should have gone to my coach and said something but I didn’t. Granted...as a coach you must be observant of your players and if they start acting ""not normal"" you need to pull them aside and talk to them. My coach did not do that. I in no way blame him, it was more my fault not telling anyone but I was raised to play thru the pain and never to quit. That may seem like a great idea but it wasn’t. So I basically played thru my injury and finished my volleyball career playing every game but not at 100%. I got real good at hiding my problem. That is until I had to go out into the real world and work. I am a Cat Scan technologist at an area hospital. Most people think all we do is push buttons all day, with no real heavy work.... I’m here to tell you on an average day I lift a minimum 15 patients who weigh from 160lbs-450lbs. most of that is cart to cart moving but it also counts the people I have to hold onto that are fall risks (which means they have some medical issue that has made them very prone to falling so I have to hold onto them so they don’t fall). A lot of the moving is dead weight which means getting no help from the patient. Let’s not forget the people who grab at the tech when trying to get up or just freaking out. Please don’t do that ever! You will hurt me and I’m not ok with that. I’m there trying to help you the best I can. Granted some of those people are truly sick and I totally have no problem moving them, but the others are just people who think just because they are in the emergency room that means they don’t have to help or move on their own. I’m here to tell you, if you are able to move, it is in your best interest to move yourself because if I move you you’re going to be uncomfortable and on a hard plastic board for the 15 minutes if everything goes as planned and just so you know its hard board with no cushion. The board is there to help me make it easier to get you from the cart to the CT table and back, I call it my second person. I work evenings and I’m alone. No help anywhere. If I need help it takes up to 5-10 minutes to find someone. So if I don’t have you on the board I can’t physically move you back to the cart without hurting you more. I don’t want to hurt you or myself. The CT table is not a flat table like most people think, the table is kind of molded with a curve to it, I describe it kind of like a ditch. So with no board under you and I was to pull you over... expect a very big bump and it’s probably not going to feel very good especially if you are already hurting. Oh and by the way I will not pull you over on my own. That’s why I’m in my current situation. I care too much for my patients that is my weakness. I don’t think about my well-being and I’ve screwed myself over by doing that. So after 13 years of doing CT, last year I started having RT shoulder pain. It started off gradual then was getting worse and worse the more I used it at work. I was having so issues with something moving out of place which made it impossible for me to use my shoulder. The last time it happened it took me 5 painful hours to get it to pop back in. So after that I finally broke down and went to an orthopedic doctor to whom I knew at my hospital. We started off with physical therapy and steroid injections. We did also finally get the insurance company to approve an MR Arthrogram (they inject contrast dye into the shoulder joint then do an MRI looking for tears or abnormal anatomy). The MRI said I had bursitis and some mild fraying of my labrum. So I ended up doing PT for 4 months with no improvements. It hurt just as much as it did when I started if not a little worse. I think within that time frame I did 3-4 steroid injections which never helped one bit with my pain. It did help the tendonitis and bursitis that I kept getting but never helped my anterior shoulder pain. This pain felt like someone was stabbing me in the shoulder with a knife. It’s really uncomfortable. So I finished my first round of PT with no relief. Unfortunately I knew where this was taking me. I went back to the ortho doctor for an appt and yes amazingly surgery was the next step. So surgery was scheduled. Would I do it again....NO, I’d wait til I couldn’t use my arm at all then do it but unfortunately I went ahead and had surgery. It was supposed to be an easy fix and it kind of was at first. So I went in for the surgery, arriving at 6am at the hospital. Got all undressed and ready. The anesthesiologist came in and started my IV and did a shoulder block which of all the things done to me that was the weirdest and best thing ever. I would recommend the shoulder block, it helped a lot with the pain and trust me the pain is horrible. They put me to sleep and when I woke up I was in the recovery room with my arm in an immobilizer. The words that came out of my mouth were not good ones. I had a warning that if I woke up with just a sling on, it was an easy fix but if I woke up in an immobilizer sling then it had gotten difficult. So as you can guess I said a few choice words and since I was still coming out of my anesthesia I believe I said them pretty darn loud. I didn’t care though and still don’t. I don’t remember much from the recovery room other than trying to throw up. (FYI....just do it, don’t fight it, it just makes it worse.) Getting dressed was a challenge. It took 2 people to dress me. My modesty was out the window, I could have cared less who saw me or what they saw. Which when it’s at your place of employment maybe I should have cared a little more but I didn’t and still don’t care who saw what. I just wanted to go home. They got me dressed. I had rigged up a loose tank top with Velcro at the top so all the nurses had to do is have me stand up and slip it up and Velcro it together. It worked out great, the nurses loved it and told me to sell them. I lived in tank tops for like 3 months following surgery. It was just easier that way. The only downside was I had my surgery in January so I was a little cold but I had a jacket that I would throw over my shoulders when I went outside. It worked. So they had me all dressed, gave my parents all the instructions and pain meds and sent me home. Here’s a good thing to know.....for the car ride home have a pillow and a mild soda in the car. The soda is there just to change the taste in your mouth from the anesthesia which is the reason you will keep wanting to vomit but don’t drink too much otherwise you will vomit. Turn the cold air on in the car and have it hit you in the face. That will help with the nausea and hopefully keep you from up chucking. I’d wait an hour or so after leaving and getting home before trying to put something in your stomach. And when you do make it bland....no flavor. I went with toast with a little butter. It did what I needed it to do and that was be in my stomach for my pain meds. You will live on your pain meds continuously for a good 3-4 days probably. I started to taper down I think on day 3 but that was so I could get off of them sooner so I could leave my parents’ house on my own. I love my parents but there is a reason I don’t live with them anymore. So the first day after surgery you will get to take your dressings they put on you (to cover your incisions with sutures) off. It was a great feeling except when I had to take the tape off. I told them I was allergic to tape aka adhesive but that didn’t stop them from putting a lot of super sticky tape on me. Let’s just say I lost some skin that morning. I was not a happy camper. Once I got it off and covered my incisions with sensitive skin band-aids I was all good. Each day after that was ok, I made myself get out of the house at least twice a day mostly just to walk around Walmart or wherever. Usually didn’t last long maybe 30min but at least I was out and not stuck inside. Mostly I ended up sleeping because of the pain meds. Or attempting to watch TV but usually I fell asleep with that too. It wasn’t until I really worked myself off the meds did I finally feel like doing things. Even then though I’d eventually pop a pill because I’d overdo it. But that’s how it goes at the beginning. So a week after my surgery was my first PT appointment. I had the same PT therapist I had the first time so he knew me and what was going on, so it made things a little better. For the longest time at the beginning PT is all passive motion which means you don’t do any work, the therapist does all the movement for you. And if you do try to do something they will know and they do yell at you to stop it...ha ha ha. It’s not your fault it’s just instinct. So just an FYI..they won’t let you get away with much. I will tell you the stretching sucks. It’s painful and especially when they massage your incision sites.....look out it really hurts but will get better as you move through your PT. I recommend getting ice for your shoulder after they are done picking on you, just ask for some they have plenty. They can wrap it around your shoulder so it will stay on its own. It will help the pain. Go straight home if possible and take a pain pill because you will be hurting. Now if you have a driver driving you to PT then I’d go ahead and take a pain pill before your appt but if you are like me and have no one I just ended up taking Advil before PT then the awesome magical pain pill after when I got myself home. FYI....I drove myself which they don’t recommend when you are in your immobilizer (and when it’s your dominant arm=kind of makes driving a little hard) because the cops will give you a ticket if you get into an accident or pulled over but I had no choice so I took the risk. I just took my time and tried to not be in a hurry. Easier said than done when you’re in pain but that’s why I recommend the ice it helps. After a few weeks PT will start letting you do things but with caution. They will introduce some weight not much only like a 1 lb. weight but at first that’s heavy. Gradually you will work yourself up to 3-4 lb. weight, resistance bands of multiple strength, weighted balls and exercises but that’s usually towards the end of your PT experience. The key is slow and steady and if something hurts TELL your therapist. They can come up with a different exercise and they need to document pain in case something isn’t right....once again I’m speaking from experience. So I did PT post op for 5 months. At my 3rd month I started complaining about shoulder pain in the area of my bicipital groove. I told my PT guy and he worked around it and documented it. This pain would not go away. So I had a follow up appt with my Ortho Dr and brought this problem up. Now this is where I should have known I was screwed. My ortho would not take my pain seriously, he kept saying some pain is normal until 1 year post op so he wouldn’t take me seriously til that one year had passed since the surgery. I know some pain is normal, I get that however I’m in the medical field and totally get that a little pain should be normal but this pain wasn’t giving up and it was getting worse. Every appt I had after that I complained and all he would do is give me steroid injections. No imaging was done only injections. I completed PT after doing it for 5 months, had great Range of Motion with no problems but still had that anterior pain going down my bicep. Went for another ortho appt which turned out to be the one where he cleared me for work so I would have no restrictions.

I would recommend the shoulder block, it helped a lot with the pain and trust me the pain is horrible. They put me to sleep and when I woke up I was in the recovery room with my arm in an immobilizer. The words that came out of my mouth were not good ones. I had a warning that if I woke up with just a sling on, it was an easy fix but if I woke up in an immobilizer sling then it had gotten difficult. So as you can guess I said a few choice words and since I was still coming out of my anesthesia I believe I said them pretty darn loud. I didn’t care though and still don’t. I don’t remember much from the recovery room other than trying to throw up. (FYI....just do it, don’t fight it, it just makes it worse.) Getting dressed was a challenge. It took 2 people to dress me. My modesty was out the window, I could have cared less who saw me or what they saw. Which when it’s at your place of employment maybe I should have cared a little more but I didn’t and still don’t care who saw what. I just wanted to go home. They got me dressed. I had rigged up a loose tank top with Velcro at the top so all the nurses had to do is have me stand up and slip it up and Velcro it together. It worked out great, the nurses loved it and told me to sell them. I lived in tank tops for like 3 months following surgery. It was just easier that way. The only downside was I had my surgery in January so I was a little cold but I had a jacket that I would throw over my shoulders when I went outside. It worked. So they had me all dressed, gave my parents all the instructions and pain meds and sent me home. Here’s a good thing to know.....for the car ride home have a pillow and a mild soda in the car. The soda is there just to change the taste in your mouth from the anesthesia which is the reason you will keep wanting to vomit but don’t drink too much otherwise you will vomit. Turn the cold air on in the car and have it hit you in the face. That will help with the nausea and hopefully keep you from up chucking. I’d wait an hour or so after leaving and getting home before trying to put something in your stomach. And when you do make it bland....no flavor. I went with toast with a little butter. It did what I needed it to do and that was be in my stomach for my pain meds. You will live on your pain meds continuously for a good 3-4 days probably. I started to taper down I think on day 3 but that was so I could get off of them sooner so I could leave my parents’ house on my own. I love my parents but there is a reason I don’t live with them anymore. So the first day after surgery you will get to take your dressings they put on you (to cover your incisions with sutures) off. It was a great feeling except when I had to take the tape off. I told them I was allergic to tape aka adhesive but that didn’t stop them from putting a lot of super sticky tape on me. Let’s just say I lost some skin that morning. I was not a happy camper. Once I got it off and covered my incisions with sensitive skin band-aids I was all good. Each day after that was ok, I made myself get out of the house at least twice a day mostly just to walk around Walmart or wherever. Usually didn’t last long maybe 30min but at least I was out and not stuck inside. Mostly I ended up sleeping because of the pain meds. Or attempting to watch TV but usually I fell asleep with that too. It wasn’t until I really worked myself off the meds did I finally feel like doing things. Even then though I’d eventually pop a pill because I’d overdo it. But that’s how it goes at the beginning. So a week after my surgery was my first PT appointment. I had the same PT therapist I had the first time so he knew me and what was going on, so it made things a little better. For the longest time at the beginning PT is all passive motion which means you don’t do any work, the therapist does all the movement for you. And if you do try to do something they will know and they do yell at you to stop it...ha ha ha. It’s not your fault it’s just instinct. So just an FYI..they won’t let you get away with much. I will tell you the stretching sucks. It’s painful and especially when they massage your incision sites.....look out it really hurts but will get better as you move through your PT. I recommend getting ice for your shoulder after they are done picking on you, just ask for some they have plenty. They can wrap it around your shoulder so it will stay on its own. It will help the pain. Go straight home if possible and take a pain pill because you will be hurting. Now if you have a driver driving you to PT then I’d go ahead and take a pain pill before your appt but if you are like me and have no one I just ended up taking Advil before PT then the awesome magical pain pill after when I got myself home. FYI....I drove myself which they don’t recommend when you are in your immobilizer (and when it’s your dominant arm=kind of makes driving a little hard) because the cops will give you a ticket if you get into an accident or pulled over but I had no choice so I took the risk. I just took my time and tried to not be in a hurry. Easier said than done when you’re in pain but that’s why I recommend the ice it helps. After a few weeks PT will start letting you do things but with caution. They will introduce some weight not much only like a 1 lb. weight but at first that’s heavy. Gradually you will work yourself up to 3-4 lb. weight, resistance bands of multiple strength, weighted balls and exercises but that’s usually towards the end of your PT experience. The key is slow and steady and if something hurts TELL your therapist. They can come up with a different exercise and they need to document pain in case something isn’t right....once again I’m speaking from experience. So I did PT post op for 5 months. At my 3rd month I started complaining about shoulder pain in the area of my bicipital groove. I told my PT guy and he worked around it and documented it. This pain would not go away. So I had a follow up appt with my Ortho Dr and brought this problem up. Now this is where I should have known I was screwed. My ortho would not take my pain seriously, he kept saying some pain is normal until 1 year post op so he wouldn’t take me seriously til that one year had passed since the surgery. I know some pain is normal, I get that however I’m in the medical field and totally get that a little pain should be normal but this pain wasn’t giving up and it was getting worse. Every appt I had after that I complained and all he would do is give me steroid injections. No imaging was done only injections. I completed PT after doing it for 5 months, had great Range of Motion with no problems but still had that anterior pain going down my bicep. Went for another ortho appt which turned out to be the one where he cleared me for work so I would have no restrictions. When he said he was going to clear me I questioned him because for my work I have to be able to lift a minimum 75lbs on my own and the heaviest I could do after all my PT was 35 lbs. The dr proceeded to tell me I would be fine to just be careful. Alert, Alert....that was warning sign number 2 that I should have seen as a red flag to go to another dr. But being a person who was going crazy not being able to work, I was like ok but I did hesitate. So now I’m back to work....two months later I was back in his office for another injection and complaining session. He ignored me like usual....red flag number three. A week after that last injection I was fed up with this ortho doc. I was hurting and work was getting impossible. So I went to one of my radiologists whom I’ve worked with for 13 years and asked if he knew another doctor to go to for a second opinion. He gave me a name and I went for it. I got all my paperwork together, anything I could get my hands onto and took it into his office for his review and for a week I patiently waited for a phone call for an approval or denial. To my great surprise and relief, his office called to schedule an appointment. I went to that appt hoping he could and would help me. I was just stuck with no help from my current doctor and I didn’t know what else to do. At my appt we sat down together and talked about what was going on. He was listening....it was great. I no longer was being treated like an older person who didn’t know anything about medicine. He agreed with me.....I shouldn’t be hurting like I was. So he ordered another MR Arthrogram to see what was going on in the shoulder. One week later I was at the imaging facility enjoying another MRI. It actually wasn’t too bad, a lot more painful than the first time but I just said that was because of the surgery scar tissue.....apparently I was wrong. According to the MR I have re-tore my labrum a lot worse than I had the first time. So now I just found out I get to have another awesome shoulder surgery. Won’t know the extent of damage fully til he gets in but I saw the MR images and the tear looks rather large. Granted I don’t do MRI but I do understand the images. Even my radiologist said he's not sure what’s going on other than yes I will have to have surgery again. Well that was reassuring…thanks doc. So here I am just days before I see my new ortho to plan surgery. I just want to cry.....it sucked the first time and now I have to do it again. It’s so not fair!!! Now I do want to let you guys know about something that happened while I was off the first time around. I feel that it’s really important to share this with you... I’ve been plagued with anxiety/depression over the last few years. I’ve dealt with it on my own and it’s been fine. It’s never been bad....Unfortunately after my shoulder surgery it got worse...way worse. I’m not proud about what I almost did, but I’m glad I noticed I was having a problem before I followed through with a very bad idea. I’ll just be truthful....I was sitting at a stoplight, first in line at a very busy intersection, I looked left and then right to see a lot of traffic when the very bad thought popped into my head. If I just go now, I won’t have to deal with things for a while. That thought scared the crap out of me. I’ve never had any ideas like that before let alone want to actually do it. That moment was when I knew I had to get help. I was crying my eyes out for no real reason. I was stressed... yes who wouldn’t be but I didn’t think it was that bad. Thank goodness my body didn’t listen to what my mind was saying. I could have easily seen my foot just tap the excelerator just enough to get me into traffic. It would have been bad but thankfully I was aware enough not to do it. Now I tell you my story to make you aware that when you get laid up, be aware and make your friends aware so they know to keep an eye out for odd behavior. Prior to my incident, I was showing signs of having issues but no one said anything. Please as a friend be there for each other because you could easily save their life. The next day I called my primary doctor up and scheduled an appt for possible depression/anxiety disorder. He put me on Zoloft and it was heaven. No anxiety, no worrying.....I couldn’t even think 5 minutes ahead and it was great. I was a notorious worrier, I’d be worrying about something a month away but now no more. It was awesome. Prior to surgery I researched constantly trying to get my head around what I was about to go through. Nowhere did I read anything about depression. I had no idea. I’m writing this so hopefully it will make people aware what they need to look out for. What I hope you have taken away from my story..... Don’t let a doctor tell you your fine when you feel there is something wrong. Be constant with your complaints and keep complaining until they either listen or you find a doctor who will listen. You know your body better than they do so don’t give up. Be mindful of your mindset. Basically watch out for signs of depression. You may think it won’t happen to you but that’s usually when it comes and bites you in your butt. Don’t seclude yourself, get out and get around people. You don’t have to talk to them just be around them. That alone will help. Don’t be afraid of getting help. If you have the right doctor he/she will listen and give you choices on how to help the problems. To Family and friends... please keep an eye on your friends/family who undergo any kind of surgery. You may be the one who notices some behavior that isn’t right. Please watch out for their safety because they may not even notice it. For coaches and parents.....pay attention to your athlete. You are around them almost or if not every day, you know what ""normal"" is for them. If they injure themselves they may not tell you and try to play it off which could make the injury worse. So please be diligent and if you think somethings not right, pull them aside quietly and ask them. If my coach had done that I might not be where I am today (aka surgery #2). And to my fellow athletes and medical professionals.....don’t be afraid to say somethings wrong, I’m hurt. Don’t let people bully you into making you think you are fine. I know we all love our sport/job and just want to keep working/playing but if you hurt yourself and not say anything, you could end up regretting it down the road. I don’t want you to go through the pain if it can be avoided. 4 likes, 16 replies "

I feel that I would like to get my story out there, to share my experience so that others are not caught off guard like I was. Just so you understand where I’m coming from. I am 35 yrs. old and have never been sick like this ever in my life. I always considered myself super healthy because I never through my years and years of playing sports any injuries that sidelined me. Well now I’ve payed for playing through the pain. I would consider myself an advanced indoor volleyball player. I played thru high school, on traveling teams who went to nationals and then continued my career thru college. I still (prior to this injury) play indoor volleyball as much as possible and even help out coaching an area high school team. Volleyball is my life and the thought of never playing again breaks my heart. The only real injury I’ve had was while I was playing in college. I being a young naive player who really only wanted to play, started having problems with my hitting. It was horrible pain just making contact with the volleyball, let alone trying to hit it at the opposing team. Now that I’m older I see my mistake. I should have gone to my coach and said something but I didn’t. Granted...as a coach you must be observant of your players and if they start acting ""not normal"" you need to pull them aside and talk to them. My coach did not do that. I in no way blame him, it was more my fault not telling anyone but I was raised to play thru the pain and never to quit. That may seem like a great idea but it wasn’t. So I basically played thru my injury and finished my volleyball career playing every game but not at 100%. I got real good at hiding my problem. That is until I had to go out into the real world and work. I am a Cat Scan technologist at an area hospital. Most people think all we do is push buttons all day, with no real heavy work.... I’m here to tell you on an average day I lift a minimum 15 patients who weigh from 160lbs-450lbs. most of that is cart to cart moving but it also counts the people I have to hold onto that are fall risks (which means they have some medical issue that has made them very prone to falling so I have to hold onto them so they don’t fall). A lot of the moving is dead weight which means getting no help from the patient. Let’s not forget the people who grab at the tech when trying to get up or just freaking out. Please don’t do that ever! You will hurt me and I’m not ok with that. I’m there trying to help you the best I can. Granted some of those people are truly sick and I totally have no problem moving them, but the others are just people who think just because they are in the emergency room that means they don’t have to help or move on their own. I’m here to tell you, if you are able to move, it is in your best interest to move yourself because if I move you you’re going to be uncomfortable and on a hard plastic board for the 15 minutes if everything goes as planned and just so you know its hard board with no cushion. The board is there to help me make it easier to get you from the cart to the CT table and back, I call it my second person. I work evenings and I’m alone. No help anywhere. If I need help it takes up to 5-10 minutes to find someone. So if I don’t have you on the board I can’t physically move you back to the cart without hurting you more. I don’t want to hurt you or myself. The CT table is not a flat table like most people think, the table is kind of molded with a curve to it, I describe it kind of like a ditch. So with no board under you and I was to pull you over... expect a very big bump and it’s probably not going to feel very good especially if you are already hurting. Oh and by the way I will not pull you over on my own. That’s why I’m in my current situation. I care too much for my patients that is my weakness. I don’t think about my well-being and I’ve screwed myself over by doing that. So after 13 years of doing CT, last year I started having RT shoulder pain. It started off gradual then was getting worse and worse the more I used it at work. I was having so issues with something moving out of place which made it impossible for me to use my shoulder. The last time it happened it took me 5 painful hours to get it to pop back in. So after that I finally broke down and went to an orthopedic doctor to whom I knew at my hospital. We started off with physical therapy and steroid injections. We did also finally get the insurance company to approve an MR Arthrogram (they inject contrast dye into the shoulder joint then do an MRI looking for tears or abnormal anatomy). The MRI said I had bursitis and some mild fraying of my labrum. So I ended up doing PT for 4 months with no improvements. It hurt just as much as it did when I started if not a little worse. I think within that time frame I did 3-4 steroid injections which never helped one bit with my pain. It did help the tendonitis and bursitis that I kept getting but never helped my anterior shoulder pain. This pain felt like someone was stabbing me in the shoulder with a knife. It’s really uncomfortable. So I finished my first round of PT with no relief. Unfortunately I knew where this was taking me. I went back to the ortho doctor for an appt and yes amazingly surgery was the next step. So surgery was scheduled. Would I do it again....NO, I’d wait til I couldn’t use my arm at all then do it but unfortunately I went ahead and had surgery. It was supposed to be an easy fix and it kind of was at first. So I went in for the surgery, arriving at 6am at the hospital. Got all undressed and ready. The anesthesiologist came in and started my IV and did a shoulder block which of all the things done to me that was the weirdest and best thing ever. I would recommend the shoulder block, it helped a lot with the pain and trust me the pain is horrible.

I don’t want you to go through the pain if it can be avoided. 4 likes, 16 replies "

I feel that I would like to get my story out there, to share my experience so that others are not caught off guard like I was. Just so you understand where I’m coming from. I am 35 yrs. old and have never been sick like this ever in my life. I always considered myself super healthy because I never through my years and years of playing sports any injuries that sidelined me. Well now I’ve payed for playing through the pain. I would consider myself an advanced indoor volleyball player. I played thru high school, on traveling teams who went to nationals and then continued my career thru college. I still (prior to this injury) play indoor volleyball as much as possible and even help out coaching an area high school team. Volleyball is my life and the thought of never playing again breaks my heart. The only real injury I’ve had was while I was playing in college. I being a young naive player who really only wanted to play, started having problems with my hitting. It was horrible pain just making contact with the volleyball, let alone trying to hit it at the opposing team. Now that I’m older I see my mistake. I should have gone to my coach and said something but I didn’t. Granted...as a coach you must be observant of your players and if they start acting ""not normal"" you need to pull them aside and talk to them. My coach did not do that. I in no way blame him, it was more my fault not telling anyone but I was raised to play thru the pain and never to quit. That may seem like a great idea but it wasn’t. So I basically played thru my injury and finished my volleyball career playing every game but not at 100%. I got real good at hiding my problem. That is until I had to go out into the real world and work. I am a Cat Scan technologist at an area hospital. Most people think all we do is push buttons all day, with no real heavy work.... I’m here to tell you on an average day I lift a minimum 15 patients who weigh from 160lbs-450lbs. most of that is cart to cart moving but it also counts the people I have to hold onto that are fall risks (which means they have some medical issue that has made them very prone to falling so I have to hold onto them so they don’t fall). A lot of the moving is dead weight which means getting no help from the patient. Let’s not forget the people who grab at the tech when trying to get up or just freaking out. Please don’t do that ever! You will hurt me and I’m not ok with that. I’m there trying to help you the best I can. Granted some of those people are truly sick and I totally have no problem moving them, but the others are just people who think just because they are in the emergency room that means they don’t have to help or move on their own. I’m here to tell you, if you are able to move, it is in your best interest to move yourself because if I move you you’re going to be uncomfortable and on a hard plastic board for the 15 minutes if everything goes as planned and just so you know its hard board with no cushion. The board is there to help me make it easier to get you from the cart to the CT table and back, I call it my second person. I work evenings and I’m alone. No help anywhere. If I need help it takes up to 5-10 minutes to find someone. So if I don’t have you on the board I can’t physically move you back to the cart without hurting you more. I don’t want to hurt you or myself. The CT table is not a flat table like most people think, the table is kind of molded with a curve to it, I describe it kind of like a ditch. So with no board under you and I was to pull you over... expect a very big bump and it’s probably not going to feel very good especially if you are already hurting. Oh and by the way I will not pull you over on my own. That’s why I’m in my current situation. I care too much for my patients that is my weakness. I don’t think about my well-being and I’ve screwed myself over by doing that. So after 13 years of doing CT, last year I started having RT shoulder pain. It started off gradual then was getting worse and worse the more I used it at work. I was having so issues with something moving out of place which made it impossible for me to use my shoulder. The last time it happened it took me 5 painful hours to get it to pop back in. So after that I finally broke down and went to an orthopedic doctor to whom I knew at my hospital. We started off with physical therapy and steroid injections. We did also finally get the insurance company to approve an MR Arthrogram (they inject contrast dye into the shoulder joint then do an MRI looking for tears or abnormal anatomy). The MRI said I had bursitis and some mild fraying of my labrum. So I ended up doing PT for 4 months with no improvements. It hurt just as much as it did when I started if not a little worse. I think within that time frame I did 3-4 steroid injections which never helped one bit with my pain. It did help the tendonitis and bursitis that I kept getting but never helped my anterior shoulder pain. This pain felt like someone was stabbing me in the shoulder with a knife. It’s really uncomfortable. So I finished my first round of PT with no relief. Unfortunately I knew where this was taking me. I went back to the ortho doctor for an appt and yes amazingly surgery was the next step. So surgery was scheduled. Would I do it again....NO, I’d wait til I couldn’t use my arm at all then do it but unfortunately I went ahead and had surgery. It was supposed to be an easy fix and it kind of was at first. So I went in for the surgery, arriving at 6am at the hospital. Got all undressed and ready. The anesthesiologist came in and started my IV and did a shoulder block which of all the things done to me that was the weirdest and best thing ever. I would recommend the shoulder block, it helped a lot with the pain and trust me the pain is horrible. They put me to sleep and when I woke up I was in the recovery room with my arm in an immobilizer. The words that came out of my mouth were not good ones. I had a warning that if I woke up with just a sling on, it was an easy fix but if I woke up in an immobilizer sling then it had gotten difficult. So as you can guess I said a few choice words and since I was still coming out of my anesthesia I believe I said them pretty darn loud. I didn’t care though and still don’t. I don’t remember much from the recovery room other than trying to throw up. (FYI....just do it, don’t fight it, it just makes it worse.) Getting dressed was a challenge. It took 2 people to dress me. My modesty was out the window, I could have cared less who saw me or what they saw. Which when it’s at your place of employment maybe I should have cared a little more but I didn’t and still don’t care who saw what. I just wanted to go home. They got me dressed. I had rigged up a loose tank top with Velcro at the top so all the nurses had to do is have me stand up and slip it up and Velcro it together. It worked out great, the nurses loved it and told me to sell them. I lived in tank tops for like 3 months following surgery. It was just easier that way. The only downside was I had my surgery in January so I was a little cold but I had a jacket that I would throw over my shoulders when I went outside. It worked. So they had me all dressed, gave my parents all the instructions and pain meds and sent me home. Here’s a good thing to know.....for the car ride home have a pillow and a mild soda in the car. The soda is there just to change the taste in your mouth from the anesthesia which is the reason you will keep wanting to vomit but don’t drink too much otherwise you will vomit. Turn the cold air on in the car and have it hit you in the face. That will help with the nausea and hopefully keep you from up chucking. I’d wait an hour or so after leaving and getting home before trying to put something in your stomach. And when you do make it bland....no flavor. I went with toast with a little butter. It did what I needed it to do and that was be in my stomach for my pain meds. You will live on your pain meds continuously for a good 3-4 days probably. I started to taper down I think on day 3 but that was so I could get off of them sooner so I could leave my parents’ house on my own. I love my parents but there is a reason I don’t live with them anymore. So the first day after surgery you will get to take your dressings they put on you (to cover your incisions with sutures) off. It was a great feeling except when I had to take the tape off. I told them I was allergic to tape aka adhesive but that didn’t stop them from putting a lot of super sticky tape on me. Let’s just say I lost some skin that morning. I was not a happy camper. Once I got it off and covered my incisions with sensitive skin band-aids I was all good. Each day after that was ok, I made myself get out of the house at least twice a day mostly just to walk around Walmart or wherever. Usually didn’t last long maybe 30min but at least I was out and not stuck inside. Mostly I ended up sleeping because of the pain meds. Or attempting to watch TV but usually I fell asleep with that too. It wasn’t until I really worked myself off the meds did I finally feel like doing things. Even then though I’d eventually pop a pill because I’d overdo it. But that’s how it goes at the beginning. So a week after my surgery was my first PT appointment. I had the same PT therapist I had the first time so he knew me and what was going on, so it made things a little better. For the longest time at the beginning PT is all passive motion which means you don’t do any work, the therapist does all the movement for you. And if you do try to do something they will know and they do yell at you to stop it...ha ha ha. It’s not your fault it’s just instinct. So just an FYI..they won’t let you get away with much. I will tell you the stretching sucks. It’s painful and especially when they massage your incision sites.....look out it really hurts but will get better as you move through your PT. I recommend getting ice for your shoulder after they are done picking on you, just ask for some they have plenty. They can wrap it around your shoulder so it will stay on its own. It will help the pain. Go straight home if possible and take a pain pill because you will be hurting. Now if you have a driver driving you to PT then I’d go ahead and take a pain pill before your appt but if you are like me and have no one I just ended up taking Advil before PT then the awesome magical pain pill after when I got myself home. FYI....I drove myself which they don’t recommend when you are in your immobilizer (and when it’s your dominant arm=kind of makes driving a little hard) because the cops will give you a ticket if you get into an accident or pulled over but I had no choice so I took the risk. I just took my time and tried to not be in a hurry. Easier said than done when you’re in pain but that’s why I recommend the ice it helps. After a few weeks PT will start letting you do things but with caution. They will introduce some weight not much only like a 1 lb. weight but at first that’s heavy. Gradually you will work yourself up to 3-4 lb. weight, resistance bands of multiple strength, weighted balls and exercises but that’s usually towards the end of your PT experience. The key is slow and steady and if something hurts TELL your therapist. They can come up with a different exercise and they need to document pain in case something isn’t right....once again I’m speaking from experience. So I did PT post op for 5 months. At my 3rd month I started complaining about shoulder pain in the area of my bicipital groove. I told my PT guy and he worked around it and documented it. This pain would not go away. So I had a follow up appt with my Ortho Dr and brought this problem up. Now this is where I should have known I was screwed. My ortho would not take my pain seriously, he kept saying some pain is normal until 1 year post op so he wouldn’t take me seriously til that one year had passed since the surgery. I know some pain is normal, I get that however I’m in the medical field and totally get that a little pain should be normal but this pain wasn’t giving up and it was getting worse. Every appt I had after that I complained and all he would do is give me steroid injections. No imaging was done only injections. I completed PT after doing it for 5 months, had great Range of Motion with no problems but still had that anterior pain going down my bicep. Went for another ortho appt which turned out to be the one where he cleared me for work so I would have no restrictions. When he said he was going to clear me I questioned him because for my work I have to be able to lift a minimum 75lbs on my own and the heaviest I could do after all my PT was 35 lbs. The dr proceeded to tell me I would be fine to just be careful. Alert, Alert....that was warning sign number 2 that I should have seen as a red flag to go to another dr. But being a person who was going crazy not being able to work, I was like ok but I did hesitate. So now I’m back to work....two months later I was back in his office for another injection and complaining session. He ignored me like usual....red flag number three. A week after that last injection I was fed up with this ortho doc. I was hurting and work was getting impossible. So I went to one of my radiologists whom I’ve worked with for 13 years and asked if he knew another doctor to go to for a second opinion. He gave me a name and I went for it. I got all my paperwork together, anything I could get my hands onto and took it into his office for his review and for a week I patiently waited for a phone call for an approval or denial. To my great surprise and relief, his office called to schedule an appointment. I went to that appt hoping he could and would help me. I was just stuck with no help from my current doctor and I didn’t know what else to do. At my appt we sat down together and talked about what was going on. He was listening....it was great. I no longer was being treated like an older person who didn’t know anything about medicine. He agreed with me.....I shouldn’t be hurting like I was. So he ordered another MR Arthrogram to see what was going on in the shoulder. One week later I was at the imaging facility enjoying another MRI. It actually wasn’t too bad, a lot more painful than the first time but I just said that was because of the surgery scar tissue.....apparently I was wrong. According to the MR I have re-tore my labrum a lot worse than I had the first time. So now I just found out I get to have another awesome shoulder surgery. Won’t know the extent of damage fully til he gets in but I saw the MR images and the tear looks rather large. Granted I don’t do MRI but I do understand the images. Even my radiologist said he's not sure what’s going on other than yes I will have to have surgery again. Well that was reassuring…thanks doc. So here I am just days before I see my new ortho to plan surgery. I just want to cry.....it sucked the first time and now I have to do it again. It’s so not fair!!! Now I do want to let you guys know about something that happened while I was off the first time around. I feel that it’s really important to share this with you... I’ve been plagued with anxiety/depression over the last few years. I’ve dealt with it on my own and it’s been fine. It’s never been bad....Unfortunately after my shoulder surgery it got worse...way worse. I’m not proud about what I almost did, but I’m glad I noticed I was having a problem before I followed through with a very bad idea. I’ll just be truthful....I was sitting at a stoplight, first in line at a very busy intersection, I looked left and then right to see a lot of traffic when the very bad thought popped into my head. If I just go now, I won’t have to deal with things for a while. That thought scared the crap out of me. I’ve never had any ideas like that before let alone want to actually do it. That moment was when I knew I had to get help. I was crying my eyes out for no real reason. I was stressed... yes who wouldn’t be but I didn’t think it was that bad. Thank goodness my body didn’t listen to what my mind was saying. I could have easily seen my foot just tap the excelerator just enough to get me into traffic. It would have been bad but thankfully I was aware enough not to do it. Now I tell you my story to make you aware that when you get laid up, be aware and make your friends aware so they know to keep an eye out for odd behavior. Prior to my incident, I was showing signs of having issues but no one said anything. Please as a friend be there for each other because you could easily save their life. The next day I called my primary doctor up and scheduled an appt for possible depression/anxiety disorder. He put me on Zoloft and it was heaven. No anxiety, no worrying.....I couldn’t even think 5 minutes ahead and it was great. I was a notorious worrier, I’d be worrying about something a month away but now no more. It was awesome. Prior to surgery I researched constantly trying to get my head around what I was about to go through. Nowhere did I read anything about depression. I had no idea. I’m writing this so hopefully it will make people aware what they need to look out for. What I hope you have taken away from my story..... Don’t let a doctor tell you your fine when you feel there is something wrong. Be constant with your complaints and keep complaining until they either listen or you find a doctor who will listen. You know your body better than they do so don’t give up. Be mindful of your mindset. Basically watch out for signs of depression. You may think it won’t happen to you but that’s usually when it comes and bites you in your butt. Don’t seclude yourself, get out and get around people. You don’t have to talk to them just be around them. That alone will help. Don’t be afraid of getting help. If you have the right doctor he/she will listen and give you choices on how to help the problems. To Family and friends... please keep an eye on your friends/family who undergo any kind of surgery. You may be the one who notices some behavior that isn’t right. Please watch out for their safety because they may not even notice it. For coaches and parents.....pay attention to your athlete. You are around them almost or if not every day, you know what ""normal"" is for them. If they injure themselves they may not tell you and try to play it off which could make the injury worse. So please be diligent and if you think somethings not right, pull them aside quietly and ask them. If my coach had done that I might not be where I am today (aka surgery #2). And to my fellow athletes and medical professionals.....don’t be afraid to say somethings wrong, I’m hurt. Don’t let people bully you into making you think you are fine. I know we all love our sport/job and just want to keep working/playing but if you hurt yourself and not say anything, you could end up regretting it down the road. I don’t want you to go through the pain if it can be avoided. 4 likes, 16 replies "

I completed PT after doing it for 5 months, had great Range of Motion with no problems but still had that anterior pain going down my bicep. Went for another ortho appt which turned out to be the one where he cleared me for work so I would have no restrictions. When he said he was going to clear me I questioned him because for my work I have to be able to lift a minimum 75lbs on my own and the heaviest I could do after all my PT was 35 lbs. The dr proceeded to tell me I would be fine to just be careful. Alert, Alert....that was warning sign number 2 that I should have seen as a red flag to go to another dr. But being a person who was going crazy not being able to work, I was like ok but I did hesitate. So now I’m back to work....two months later I was back in his office for another injection and complaining session. He ignored me like usual....red flag number three. A week after that last injection I was fed up with this ortho doc. I was hurting and work was getting impossible. So I went to one of my radiologists whom I’ve worked with for 13 years and asked if he knew another doctor to go to for a second opinion. He gave me a name and I went for it. I got all my paperwork together, anything I could get my hands onto and took it into his office for his review and for a week I patiently waited for a phone call for an approval or denial. To my great surprise and relief, his office called to schedule an appointment. I went to that appt hoping he could and would help me. I was just stuck with no help from my current doctor and I didn’t know what else to do. At my appt we sat down together and talked about what was going on. He was listening....it was great. I no longer was being treated like an older person who didn’t know anything about medicine. He agreed with me.....I shouldn’t be hurting like I was. So he ordered another MR Arthrogram to see what was going on in the shoulder. One week later I was at the imaging facility enjoying another MRI. It actually wasn’t too bad, a lot more painful than the first time but I just said that was because of the surgery scar tissue.....apparently I was wrong. According to the MR I have re-tore my labrum a lot worse than I had the first time. So now I just found out I get to have another awesome shoulder surgery. Won’t know the extent of damage fully til he gets in but I saw the MR images and the tear looks rather large. Granted I don’t do MRI but I do understand the images. Even my radiologist said he's not sure what’s going on other than yes I will have to have surgery again. Well that was reassuring…thanks doc. So here I am just days before I see my new ortho to plan surgery. I just want to cry.....it sucked the first time and now I have to do it again. It’s so not fair!!! Now I do want to let you guys know about something that happened while I was off the first time around. I feel that it’s really important to share this with you... I’ve been plagued with anxiety/depression over the last few years. I’ve dealt with it on my own and it’s been fine. It’s never been bad....Unfortunately after my shoulder surgery it got worse...way worse. I’m not proud about what I almost did, but I’m glad I noticed I was having a problem before I followed through with a very bad idea. I’ll just be truthful....I was sitting at a stoplight, first in line at a very busy intersection, I looked left and then right to see a lot of traffic when the very bad thought popped into my head. If I just go now, I won’t have to deal with things for a while. That thought scared the crap out of me. I’ve never had any ideas like that before let alone want to actually do it. That moment was when I knew I had to get help. I was crying my eyes out for no real reason. I was stressed... yes who wouldn’t be but I didn’t think it was that bad. Thank goodness my body didn’t listen to what my mind was saying. I could have easily seen my foot just tap the excelerator just enough to get me into traffic. It would have been bad but thankfully I was aware enough not to do it. Now I tell you my story to make you aware that when you get laid up, be aware and make your friends aware so they know to keep an eye out for odd behavior. Prior to my incident, I was showing signs of having issues but no one said anything. Please as a friend be there for each other because you could easily save their life. The next day I called my primary doctor up and scheduled an appt for possible depression/anxiety disorder. He put me on Zoloft and it was heaven. No anxiety, no worrying.....I couldn’t even think 5 minutes ahead and it was great. I was a notorious worrier, I’d be worrying about something a month away but now no more. It was awesome. Prior to surgery I researched constantly trying to get my head around what I was about to go through. Nowhere did I read anything about depression. I had no idea. I’m writing this so hopefully it will make people aware what they need to look out for. What I hope you have taken away from my story..... Don’t let a doctor tell you your fine when you feel there is something wrong. Be constant with your complaints and keep complaining until they either listen or you find a doctor who will listen. You know your body better than they do so don’t give up. Be mindful of your mindset. Basically watch out for signs of depression. You may think it won’t happen to you but that’s usually when it comes and bites you in your butt. Don’t seclude yourself, get out and get around people. You don’t have to talk to them just be around them. That alone will help. Don’t be afraid of getting help. If you have the right doctor he/she will listen and give you choices on how to help the problems. To Family and friends... please keep an eye on your friends/family who undergo any kind of surgery. You may be the one who notices some behavior that isn’t right. Please watch out for their safety because they may not even notice it. For coaches and parents.....pay attention to your athlete. You are around them almost or if not every day, you know what ""normal"" is for them. If they injure themselves they may not tell you and try to play it off which could make the injury worse. So please be diligent and if you think somethings not right, pull them aside quietly and ask them. If my coach had done that I might not be where I am today (aka surgery #2). And to my fellow athletes and medical professionals.....don’t be afraid to say somethings wrong, I’m hurt. Don’t let people bully you into making you think you are fine. I know we all love our sport/job and just want to keep working/playing but if you hurt yourself and not say anything, you could end up regretting it down the road. I don’t want you to go through the pain if it can be avoided. 4 likes, 16 replies "

I feel that I would like to get my story out there, to share my experience so that others are not caught off guard like I was. Just so you understand where I’m coming from. I am 35 yrs. old and have never been sick like this ever in my life. I always considered myself super healthy because I never through my years and years of playing sports any injuries that sidelined me. Well now I’ve payed for playing through the pain. I would consider myself an advanced indoor volleyball player. I played thru high school, on traveling teams who went to nationals and then continued my career thru college. I still (prior to this injury) play indoor volleyball as much as possible and even help out coaching an area high school team. Volleyball is my life and the thought of never playing again breaks my heart. The only real injury I’ve had was while I was playing in college. I being a young naive player who really only wanted to play, started having problems with my hitting. It was horrible pain just making contact with the volleyball, let alone trying to hit it at the opposing team. Now that I’m older I see my mistake. I should have gone to my coach and said something but I didn’t. Granted...as a coach you must be observant of your players and if they start acting ""not normal"" you need to pull them aside and talk to them. My coach did not do that. I in no way blame him, it was more my fault not telling anyone but I was raised to play thru the pain and never to quit. That may seem like a great idea but it wasn’t. So I basically played thru my injury and finished my volleyball career playing every game but not at 100%. I got real good at hiding my problem. That is until I had to go out into the real world and work. I am a Cat Scan technologist at an area hospital. Most people think all we do is push buttons all day, with no real heavy work.... I’m here to tell you on an average day I lift a minimum 15 patients who weigh from 160lbs-450lbs. most of that is cart to cart moving but it also counts the people I have to hold onto that are fall risks (which means they have some medical issue that has made them very prone to falling so I have to hold onto them so they don’t fall). A lot of the moving is dead weight which means getting no help from the patient. Let’s not forget the people who grab at the tech when trying to get up or just freaking out. Please don’t do that ever! You will hurt me and I’m not ok with that. I’m there trying to help you the best I can. Granted some of those people are truly sick and I totally have no problem moving them, but the others are just people who think just because they are in the emergency room that means they don’t have to help or move on their own. I’m here to tell you, if you are able to move, it is in your best interest to move yourself because if I move you you’re going to be uncomfortable and on a hard plastic board for the 15 minutes if everything goes as planned and just so you know its hard board with no cushion. The board is there to help me make it easier to get you from the cart to the CT table and back, I call it my second person. I work evenings and I’m alone. No help anywhere. If I need help it takes up to 5-10 minutes to find someone. So if I don’t have you on the board I can’t physically move you back to the cart without hurting you more. I don’t want to hurt you or myself. The CT table is not a flat table like most people think, the table is kind of molded with a curve to it, I describe it kind of like a ditch. So with no board under you and I was to pull you over... expect a very big bump and it’s probably not going to feel very good especially if you are already hurting. Oh and by the way I will not pull you over on my own. That’s why I’m in my current situation. I care too much for my patients that is my weakness. I don’t think about my well-being and I’ve screwed myself over by doing that. So after 13 years of doing CT, last year I started having RT shoulder pain. It started off gradual then was getting worse and worse the more I used it at work. I was having so issues with something moving out of place which made it impossible for me to use my shoulder. The last time it happened it took me 5 painful hours to get it to pop back in. So after that I finally broke down and went to an orthopedic doctor to whom I knew at my hospital. We started off with physical therapy and steroid injections. We did also finally get the insurance company to approve an MR Arthrogram (they inject contrast dye into the shoulder joint then do an MRI looking for tears or abnormal anatomy). The MRI said I had bursitis and some mild fraying of my labrum. So I ended up doing PT for 4 months with no improvements. It hurt just as much as it did when I started if not a little worse. I think within that time frame I did 3-4 steroid injections which never helped one bit with my pain. It did help the tendonitis and bursitis that I kept getting but never helped my anterior shoulder pain. This pain felt like someone was stabbing me in the shoulder with a knife. It’s really uncomfortable. So I finished my first round of PT with no relief. Unfortunately I knew where this was taking me. I went back to the ortho doctor for an appt and yes amazingly surgery was the next step. So surgery was scheduled. Would I do it again....NO, I’d wait til I couldn’t use my arm at all then do it but unfortunately I went ahead and had surgery. It was supposed to be an easy fix and it kind of was at first. So I went in for the surgery, arriving at 6am at the hospital. Got all undressed and ready. The anesthesiologist came in and started my IV and did a shoulder block which of all the things done to me that was the weirdest and best thing ever. I would recommend the shoulder block, it helped a lot with the pain and trust me the pain is horrible. They put me to sleep and when I woke up I was in the recovery room with my arm in an immobilizer. The words that came out of my mouth were not good ones. I had a warning that if I woke up with just a sling on, it was an easy fix but if I woke up in an immobilizer sling then it had gotten difficult. So as you can guess I said a few choice words and since I was still coming out of my anesthesia I believe I said them pretty darn loud. I didn’t care though and still don’t. I don’t remember much from the recovery room other than trying to throw up. (FYI....just do it, don’t fight it, it just makes it worse.) Getting dressed was a challenge. It took 2 people to dress me. My modesty was out the window, I could have cared less who saw me or what they saw. Which when it’s at your place of employment maybe I should have cared a little more but I didn’t and still don’t care who saw what. I just wanted to go home. They got me dressed. I had rigged up a loose tank top with Velcro at the top so all the nurses had to do is have me stand up and slip it up and Velcro it together. It worked out great, the nurses loved it and told me to sell them. I lived in tank tops for like 3 months following surgery. It was just easier that way. The only downside was I had my surgery in January so I was a little cold but I had a jacket that I would throw over my shoulders when I went outside. It worked. So they had me all dressed, gave my parents all the instructions and pain meds and sent me home. Here’s a good thing to know.....for the car ride home have a pillow and a mild soda in the car. The soda is there just to change the taste in your mouth from the anesthesia which is the reason you will keep wanting to vomit but don’t drink too much otherwise you will vomit. Turn the cold air on in the car and have it hit you in the face. That will help with the nausea and hopefully keep you from up chucking. I’d wait an hour or so after leaving and getting home before trying to put something in your stomach. And when you do make it bland....no flavor. I went with toast with a little butter. It did what I needed it to do and that was be in my stomach for my pain meds. You will live on your pain meds continuously for a good 3-4 days probably. I started to taper down I think on day 3 but that was so I could get off of them sooner so I could leave my parents’ house on my own. I love my parents but there is a reason I don’t live with them anymore. So the first day after surgery you will get to take your dressings they put on you (to cover your incisions with sutures) off. It was a great feeling except when I had to take the tape off. I told them I was allergic to tape aka adhesive but that didn’t stop them from putting a lot of super sticky tape on me. Let’s just say I lost some skin that morning. I was not a happy camper. Once I got it off and covered my incisions with sensitive skin band-aids I was all good. Each day after that was ok, I made myself get out of the house at least twice a day mostly just to walk around Walmart or wherever. Usually didn’t last long maybe 30min but at least I was out and not stuck inside. Mostly I ended up sleeping because of the pain meds. Or attempting to watch TV but usually I fell asleep with that too. It wasn’t until I really worked myself off the meds did I finally feel like doing things. Even then though I’d eventually pop a pill because I’d overdo it. But that’s how it goes at the beginning. So a week after my surgery was my first PT appointment. I had the same PT therapist I had the first time so he knew me and what was going on, so it made things a little better. For the longest time at the beginning PT is all passive motion which means you don’t do any work, the therapist does all the movement for you. And if you do try to do something they will know and they do yell at you to stop it...ha ha ha. It’s not your fault it’s just instinct. So just an FYI..they won’t let you get away with much. I will tell you the stretching sucks. It’s painful and especially when they massage your incision sites.....look out it really hurts but will get better as you move through your PT. I recommend getting ice for your shoulder after they are done picking on you, just ask for some they have plenty. They can wrap it around your shoulder so it will stay on its own. It will help the pain. Go straight home if possible and take a pain pill because you will be hurting. Now if you have a driver driving you to PT then I’d go ahead and take a pain pill before your appt but if you are like me and have no one I just ended up taking Advil before PT then the awesome magical pain pill after when I got myself home. FYI....I drove myself which they don’t recommend when you are in your immobilizer (and when it’s your dominant arm=kind of makes driving a little hard) because the cops will give you a ticket if you get into an accident or pulled over but I had no choice so I took the risk. I just took my time and tried to not be in a hurry. Easier said than done when you’re in pain but that’s why I recommend the ice it helps. After a few weeks PT will start letting you do things but with caution. They will introduce some weight not much only like a 1 lb. weight but at first that’s heavy. Gradually you will work yourself up to 3-4 lb. weight, resistance bands of multiple strength, weighted balls and exercises but that’s usually towards the end of your PT experience. The key is slow and steady and if something hurts TELL your therapist. They can come up with a different exercise and they need to document pain in case something isn’t right....once again I’m speaking from experience. So I did PT post op for 5 months. At my 3rd month I started complaining about shoulder pain in the area of my bicipital groove. I told my PT guy and he worked around it and documented it. This pain would not go away. So I had a follow up appt with my Ortho Dr and brought this problem up. Now this is where I should have known I was screwed. My ortho would not take my pain seriously, he kept saying some pain is normal until 1 year post op so he wouldn’t take me seriously til that one year had passed since the surgery. I know some pain is normal, I get that however I’m in the medical field and totally get that a little pain should be normal but this pain wasn’t giving up and it was getting worse. Every appt I had after that I complained and all he would do is give me steroid injections. No imaging was done only injections.

I would recommend the shoulder block, it helped a lot with the pain and trust me the pain is horrible. They put me to sleep and when I woke up I was in the recovery room with my arm in an immobilizer. The words that came out of my mouth were not good ones. I had a warning that if I woke up with just a sling on, it was an easy fix but if I woke up in an immobilizer sling then it had gotten difficult. So as you can guess I said a few choice words and since I was still coming out of my anesthesia I believe I said them pretty darn loud. I didn’t care though and still don’t. I don’t remember much from the recovery room other than trying to throw up. (FYI....just do it, don’t fight it, it just makes it worse.) Getting dressed was a challenge. It took 2 people to dress me. My modesty was out the window, I could have cared less who saw me or what they saw. Which when it’s at your place of employment maybe I should have cared a little more but I didn’t and still don’t care who saw what. I just wanted to go home. They got me dressed. I had rigged up a loose tank top with Velcro at the top so all the nurses had to do is have me stand up and slip it up and Velcro it together. It worked out great, the nurses loved it and told me to sell them. I lived in tank tops for like 3 months following surgery. It was just easier that way. The only downside was I had my surgery in January so I was a little cold but I had a jacket that I would throw over my shoulders when I went outside. It worked. So they had me all dressed, gave my parents all the instructions and pain meds and sent me home. Here’s a good thing to know.....for the car ride home have a pillow and a mild soda in the car. The soda is there just to change the taste in your mouth from the anesthesia which is the reason you will keep wanting to vomit but don’t drink too much otherwise you will vomit. Turn the cold air on in the car and have it hit you in the face. That will help with the nausea and hopefully keep you from up chucking. I’d wait an hour or so after leaving and getting home before trying to put something in your stomach. And when you do make it bland....no flavor. I went with toast with a little butter. It did what I needed it to do and that was be in my stomach for my pain meds. You will live on your pain meds continuously for a good 3-4 days probably. I started to taper down I think on day 3 but that was so I could get off of them sooner so I could leave my parents’ house on my own. I love my parents but there is a reason I don’t live with them anymore. So the first day after surgery you will get to take your dressings they put on you (to cover your incisions with sutures) off. It was a great feeling except when I had to take the tape off. I told them I was allergic to tape aka adhesive but that didn’t stop them from putting a lot of super sticky tape on me. Let’s just say I lost some skin that morning. I was not a happy camper. Once I got it off and covered my incisions with sensitive skin band-aids I was all good. Each day after that was ok, I made myself get out of the house at least twice a day mostly just to walk around Walmart or wherever. Usually didn’t last long maybe 30min but at least I was out and not stuck inside. Mostly I ended up sleeping because of the pain meds. Or attempting to watch TV but usually I fell asleep with that too. It wasn’t until I really worked myself off the meds did I finally feel like doing things. Even then though I’d eventually pop a pill because I’d overdo it. But that’s how it goes at the beginning. So a week after my surgery was my first PT appointment. I had the same PT therapist I had the first time so he knew me and what was going on, so it made things a little better. For the longest time at the beginning PT is all passive motion which means you don’t do any work, the therapist does all the movement for you. And if you do try to do something they will know and they do yell at you to stop it...ha ha ha. It’s not your fault it’s just instinct. So just an FYI..they won’t let you get away with much. I will tell you the stretching sucks. It’s painful and especially when they massage your incision sites.....look out it really hurts but will get better as you move through your PT. I recommend getting ice for your shoulder after they are done picking on you, just ask for some they have plenty. They can wrap it around your shoulder so it will stay on its own. It will help the pain. Go straight home if possible and take a pain pill because you will be hurting. Now if you have a driver driving you to PT then I’d go ahead and take a pain pill before your appt but if you are like me and have no one I just ended up taking Advil before PT then the awesome magical pain pill after when I got myself home. FYI....I drove myself which they don’t recommend when you are in your immobilizer (and when it’s your dominant arm=kind of makes driving a little hard) because the cops will give you a ticket if you get into an accident or pulled over but I had no choice so I took the risk. I just took my time and tried to not be in a hurry. Easier said than done when you’re in pain but that’s why I recommend the ice it helps. After a few weeks PT will start letting you do things but with caution. They will introduce some weight not much only like a 1 lb. weight but at first that’s heavy. Gradually you will work yourself up to 3-4 lb. weight, resistance bands of multiple strength, weighted balls and exercises but that’s usually towards the end of your PT experience. The key is slow and steady and if something hurts TELL your therapist. They can come up with a different exercise and they need to document pain in case something isn’t right....once again I’m speaking from experience. So I did PT post op for 5 months. At my 3rd month I started complaining about shoulder pain in the area of my bicipital groove. I told my PT guy and he worked around it and documented it. This pain would not go away. So I had a follow up appt with my Ortho Dr and brought this problem up. Now this is where I should have known I was screwed. My ortho would not take my pain seriously, he kept saying some pain is normal until 1 year post op so he wouldn’t take me seriously til that one year had passed since the surgery. I know some pain is normal, I get that however I’m in the medical field and totally get that a little pain should be normal but this pain wasn’t giving up and it was getting worse. Every appt I had after that I complained and all he would do is give me steroid injections. No imaging was done only injections. I completed PT after doing it for 5 months, had great Range of Motion with no problems but still had that anterior pain going down my bicep. Went for another ortho appt which turned out to be the one where he cleared me for work so I would have no restrictions. When he said he was going to clear me I questioned him because for my work I have to be able to lift a minimum 75lbs on my own and the heaviest I could do after all my PT was 35 lbs. The dr proceeded to tell me I would be fine to just be careful. Alert, Alert....that was warning sign number 2 that I should have seen as a red flag to go to another dr. But being a person who was going crazy not being able to work, I was like ok but I did hesitate. So now I’m back to work....two months later I was back in his office for another injection and complaining session. He ignored me like usual....red flag number three. A week after that last injection I was fed up with this ortho doc. I was hurting and work was getting impossible. So I went to one of my radiologists whom I’ve worked with for 13 years and asked if he knew another doctor to go to for a second opinion. He gave me a name and I went for it. I got all my paperwork together, anything I could get my hands onto and took it into his office for his review and for a week I patiently waited for a phone call for an approval or denial. To my great surprise and relief, his office called to schedule an appointment. I went to that appt hoping he could and would help me. I was just stuck with no help from my current doctor and I didn’t know what else to do. At my appt we sat down together and talked about what was going on. He was listening....it was great. I no longer was being treated like an older person who didn’t know anything about medicine. He agreed with me.....I shouldn’t be hurting like I was. So he ordered another MR Arthrogram to see what was going on in the shoulder. One week later I was at the imaging facility enjoying another MRI. It actually wasn’t too bad, a lot more painful than the first time but I just said that was because of the surgery scar tissue.....apparently I was wrong. According to the MR I have re-tore my labrum a lot worse than I had the first time. So now I just found out I get to have another awesome shoulder surgery. Won’t know the extent of damage fully til he gets in but I saw the MR images and the tear looks rather large. Granted I don’t do MRI but I do understand the images. Even my radiologist said he's not sure what’s going on other than yes I will have to have surgery again. Well that was reassuring…thanks doc. So here I am just days before I see my new ortho to plan surgery. I just want to cry.....it sucked the first time and now I have to do it again. It’s so not fair!!! Now I do want to let you guys know about something that happened while I was off the first time around. I feel that it’s really important to share this with you... I’ve been plagued with anxiety/depression over the last few years. I’ve dealt with it on my own and it’s been fine. It’s never been bad....Unfortunately after my shoulder surgery it got worse...way worse. I’m not proud about what I almost did, but I’m glad I noticed I was having a problem before I followed through with a very bad idea. I’ll just be truthful....I was sitting at a stoplight, first in line at a very busy intersection, I looked left and then right to see a lot of traffic when the very bad thought popped into my head. If I just go now, I won’t have to deal with things for a while. That thought scared the crap out of me. I’ve never had any ideas like that before let alone want to actually do it. That moment was when I knew I had to get help. I was crying my eyes out for no real reason. I was stressed... yes who wouldn’t be but I didn’t think it was that bad. Thank goodness my body didn’t listen to what my mind was saying. I could have easily seen my foot just tap the excelerator just enough to get me into traffic. It would have been bad but thankfully I was aware enough not to do it. Now I tell you my story to make you aware that when you get laid up, be aware and make your friends aware so they know to keep an eye out for odd behavior. Prior to my incident, I was showing signs of having issues but no one said anything. Please as a friend be there for each other because you could easily save their life. The next day I called my primary doctor up and scheduled an appt for possible depression/anxiety disorder. He put me on Zoloft and it was heaven. No anxiety, no worrying.....I couldn’t even think 5 minutes ahead and it was great. I was a notorious worrier, I’d be worrying about something a month away but now no more. It was awesome. Prior to surgery I researched constantly trying to get my head around what I was about to go through. Nowhere did I read anything about depression. I had no idea. I’m writing this so hopefully it will make people aware what they need to look out for. What I hope you have taken away from my story..... Don’t let a doctor tell you your fine when you feel there is something wrong. Be constant with your complaints and keep complaining until they either listen or you find a doctor who will listen. You know your body better than they do so don’t give up. Be mindful of your mindset. Basically watch out for signs of depression. You may think it won’t happen to you but that’s usually when it comes and bites you in your butt. Don’t seclude yourself, get out and get around people. You don’t have to talk to them just be around them. That alone will help. Don’t be afraid of getting help. If you have the right doctor he/she will listen and give you choices on how to help the problems. To Family and friends... please keep an eye on your friends/family who undergo any kind of surgery. You may be the one who notices some behavior that isn’t right. Please watch out for their safety because they may not even notice it. For coaches and parents.....pay attention to your athlete. You are around them almost or if not every day, you know what ""normal"" is for them. If they injure themselves they may not tell you and try to play it off which could make the injury worse. So please be diligent and if you think somethings not right, pull them aside quietly and ask them. If my coach had done that I might not be where I am today (aka surgery #2). And to my fellow athletes and medical professionals.....don’t be afraid to say somethings wrong, I’m hurt. Don’t let people bully you into making you think you are fine. I know we all love our sport/job and just want to keep working/playing but if you hurt yourself and not say anything, you could end up regretting it down the road. I don’t want you to go through the pain if it can be avoided. 4 likes, 16 replies "

I feel that I would like to get my story out there, to share my experience so that others are not caught off guard like I was. Just so you understand where I’m coming from. I am 35 yrs. old and have never been sick like this ever in my life. I always considered myself super healthy because I never through my years and years of playing sports any injuries that sidelined me. Well now I’ve payed for playing through the pain. I would consider myself an advanced indoor volleyball player. I played thru high school, on traveling teams who went to nationals and then continued my career thru college. I still (prior to this injury) play indoor volleyball as much as possible and even help out coaching an area high school team. Volleyball is my life and the thought of never playing again breaks my heart. The only real injury I’ve had was while I was playing in college. I being a young naive player who really only wanted to play, started having problems with my hitting. It was horrible pain just making contact with the volleyball, let alone trying to hit it at the opposing team. Now that I’m older I see my mistake. I should have gone to my coach and said something but I didn’t. Granted...as a coach you must be observant of your players and if they start acting ""not normal"" you need to pull them aside and talk to them. My coach did not do that. I in no way blame him, it was more my fault not telling anyone but I was raised to play thru the pain and never to quit. That may seem like a great idea but it wasn’t. So I basically played thru my injury and finished my volleyball career playing every game but not at 100%. I got real good at hiding my problem. That is until I had to go out into the real world and work. I am a Cat Scan technologist at an area hospital. Most people think all we do is push buttons all day, with no real heavy work.... I’m here to tell you on an average day I lift a minimum 15 patients who weigh from 160lbs-450lbs. most of that is cart to cart moving but it also counts the people I have to hold onto that are fall risks (which means they have some medical issue that has made them very prone to falling so I have to hold onto them so they don’t fall). A lot of the moving is dead weight which means getting no help from the patient. Let’s not forget the people who grab at the tech when trying to get up or just freaking out. Please don’t do that ever! You will hurt me and I’m not ok with that. I’m there trying to help you the best I can. Granted some of those people are truly sick and I totally have no problem moving them, but the others are just people who think just because they are in the emergency room that means they don’t have to help or move on their own. I’m here to tell you, if you are able to move, it is in your best interest to move yourself because if I move you you’re going to be uncomfortable and on a hard plastic board for the 15 minutes if everything goes as planned and just so you know its hard board with no cushion. The board is there to help me make it easier to get you from the cart to the CT table and back, I call it my second person. I work evenings and I’m alone. No help anywhere. If I need help it takes up to 5-10 minutes to find someone. So if I don’t have you on the board I can’t physically move you back to the cart without hurting you more. I don’t want to hurt you or myself. The CT table is not a flat table like most people think, the table is kind of molded with a curve to it, I describe it kind of like a ditch. So with no board under you and I was to pull you over... expect a very big bump and it’s probably not going to feel very good especially if you are already hurting. Oh and by the way I will not pull you over on my own. That’s why I’m in my current situation. I care too much for my patients that is my weakness. I don’t think about my well-being and I’ve screwed myself over by doing that. So after 13 years of doing CT, last year I started having RT shoulder pain. It started off gradual then was getting worse and worse the more I used it at work. I was having so issues with something moving out of place which made it impossible for me to use my shoulder. The last time it happened it took me 5 painful hours to get it to pop back in. So after that I finally broke down and went to an orthopedic doctor to whom I knew at my hospital. We started off with physical therapy and steroid injections. We did also finally get the insurance company to approve an MR Arthrogram (they inject contrast dye into the shoulder joint then do an MRI looking for tears or abnormal anatomy). The MRI said I had bursitis and some mild fraying of my labrum. So I ended up doing PT for 4 months with no improvements. It hurt just as much as it did when I started if not a little worse. I think within that time frame I did 3-4 steroid injections which never helped one bit with my pain. It did help the tendonitis and bursitis that I kept getting but never helped my anterior shoulder pain. This pain felt like someone was stabbing me in the shoulder with a knife. It’s really uncomfortable. So I finished my first round of PT with no relief. Unfortunately I knew where this was taking me. I went back to the ortho doctor for an appt and yes amazingly surgery was the next step. So surgery was scheduled. Would I do it again....NO, I’d wait til I couldn’t use my arm at all then do it but unfortunately I went ahead and had surgery. It was supposed to be an easy fix and it kind of was at first. So I went in for the surgery, arriving at 6am at the hospital. Got all undressed and ready. The anesthesiologist came in and started my IV and did a shoulder block which of all the things done to me that was the weirdest and best thing ever. I would recommend the shoulder block, it helped a lot with the pain and trust me the pain is horrible.

I don’t want you to go through the pain if it can be avoided. 4 likes, 16 replies "

I feel that I would like to get my story out there, to share my experience so that others are not caught off guard like I was. Just so you understand where I’m coming from. I am 35 yrs. old and have never been sick like this ever in my life. I always considered myself super healthy because I never through my years and years of playing sports any injuries that sidelined me. Well now I’ve payed for playing through the pain. I would consider myself an advanced indoor volleyball player. I played thru high school, on traveling teams who went to nationals and then continued my career thru college. I still (prior to this injury) play indoor volleyball as much as possible and even help out coaching an area high school team. Volleyball is my life and the thought of never playing again breaks my heart. The only real injury I’ve had was while I was playing in college. I being a young naive player who really only wanted to play, started having problems with my hitting. It was horrible pain just making contact with the volleyball, let alone trying to hit it at the opposing team. Now that I’m older I see my mistake. I should have gone to my coach and said something but I didn’t. Granted...as a coach you must be observant of your players and if they start acting ""not normal"" you need to pull them aside and talk to them. My coach did not do that. I in no way blame him, it was more my fault not telling anyone but I was raised to play thru the pain and never to quit. That may seem like a great idea but it wasn’t. So I basically played thru my injury and finished my volleyball career playing every game but not at 100%. I got real good at hiding my problem. That is until I had to go out into the real world and work. I am a Cat Scan technologist at an area hospital. Most people think all we do is push buttons all day, with no real heavy work.... I’m here to tell you on an average day I lift a minimum 15 patients who weigh from 160lbs-450lbs. most of that is cart to cart moving but it also counts the people I have to hold onto that are fall risks (which means they have some medical issue that has made them very prone to falling so I have to hold onto them so they don’t fall). A lot of the moving is dead weight which means getting no help from the patient. Let’s not forget the people who grab at the tech when trying to get up or just freaking out. Please don’t do that ever! You will hurt me and I’m not ok with that. I’m there trying to help you the best I can. Granted some of those people are truly sick and I totally have no problem moving them, but the others are just people who think just because they are in the emergency room that means they don’t have to help or move on their own. I’m here to tell you, if you are able to move, it is in your best interest to move yourself because if I move you you’re going to be uncomfortable and on a hard plastic board for the 15 minutes if everything goes as planned and just so you know its hard board with no cushion. The board is there to help me make it easier to get you from the cart to the CT table and back, I call it my second person. I work evenings and I’m alone. No help anywhere. If I need help it takes up to 5-10 minutes to find someone. So if I don’t have you on the board I can’t physically move you back to the cart without hurting you more. I don’t want to hurt you or myself. The CT table is not a flat table like most people think, the table is kind of molded with a curve to it, I describe it kind of like a ditch. So with no board under you and I was to pull you over... expect a very big bump and it’s probably not going to feel very good especially if you are already hurting. Oh and by the way I will not pull you over on my own. That’s why I’m in my current situation. I care too much for my patients that is my weakness. I don’t think about my well-being and I’ve screwed myself over by doing that. So after 13 years of doing CT, last year I started having RT shoulder pain. It started off gradual then was getting worse and worse the more I used it at work. I was having so issues with something moving out of place which made it impossible for me to use my shoulder. The last time it happened it took me 5 painful hours to get it to pop back in. So after that I finally broke down and went to an orthopedic doctor to whom I knew at my hospital. We started off with physical therapy and steroid injections. We did also finally get the insurance company to approve an MR Arthrogram (they inject contrast dye into the shoulder joint then do an MRI looking for tears or abnormal anatomy). The MRI said I had bursitis and some mild fraying of my labrum. So I ended up doing PT for 4 months with no improvements. It hurt just as much as it did when I started if not a little worse. I think within that time frame I did 3-4 steroid injections which never helped one bit with my pain. It did help the tendonitis and bursitis that I kept getting but never helped my anterior shoulder pain. This pain felt like someone was stabbing me in the shoulder with a knife. It’s really uncomfortable. So I finished my first round of PT with no relief. Unfortunately I knew where this was taking me. I went back to the ortho doctor for an appt and yes amazingly surgery was the next step. So surgery was scheduled. Would I do it again....NO, I’d wait til I couldn’t use my arm at all then do it but unfortunately I went ahead and had surgery. It was supposed to be an easy fix and it kind of was at first. So I went in for the surgery, arriving at 6am at the hospital. Got all undressed and ready. The anesthesiologist came in and started my IV and did a shoulder block which of all the things done to me that was the weirdest and best thing ever. I would recommend the shoulder block, it helped a lot with the pain and trust me the pain is horrible. They put me to sleep and when I woke up I was in the recovery room with my arm in an immobilizer. The words that came out of my mouth were not good ones. I had a warning that if I woke up with just a sling on, it was an easy fix but if I woke up in an immobilizer sling then it had gotten difficult. So as you can guess I said a few choice words and since I was still coming out of my anesthesia I believe I said them pretty darn loud. I didn’t care though and still don’t. I don’t remember much from the recovery room other than trying to throw up. (FYI....just do it, don’t fight it, it just makes it worse.) Getting dressed was a challenge. It took 2 people to dress me. My modesty was out the window, I could have cared less who saw me or what they saw. Which when it’s at your place of employment maybe I should have cared a little more but I didn’t and still don’t care who saw what. I just wanted to go home. They got me dressed. I had rigged up a loose tank top with Velcro at the top so all the nurses had to do is have me stand up and slip it up and Velcro it together. It worked out great, the nurses loved it and told me to sell them. I lived in tank tops for like 3 months following surgery. It was just easier that way. The only downside was I had my surgery in January so I was a little cold but I had a jacket that I would throw over my shoulders when I went outside. It worked. So they had me all dressed, gave my parents all the instructions and pain meds and sent me home. Here’s a good thing to know.....for the car ride home have a pillow and a mild soda in the car. The soda is there just to change the taste in your mouth from the anesthesia which is the reason you will keep wanting to vomit but don’t drink too much otherwise you will vomit. Turn the cold air on in the car and have it hit you in the face. That will help with the nausea and hopefully keep you from up chucking. I’d wait an hour or so after leaving and getting home before trying to put something in your stomach. And when you do make it bland....no flavor. I went with toast with a little butter. It did what I needed it to do and that was be in my stomach for my pain meds. You will live on your pain meds continuously for a good 3-4 days probably. I started to taper down I think on day 3 but that was so I could get off of them sooner so I could leave my parents’ house on my own. I love my parents but there is a reason I don’t live with them anymore. So the first day after surgery you will get to take your dressings they put on you (to cover your incisions with sutures) off. It was a great feeling except when I had to take the tape off. I told them I was allergic to tape aka adhesive but that didn’t stop them from putting a lot of super sticky tape on me. Let’s just say I lost some skin that morning. I was not a happy camper. Once I got it off and covered my incisions with sensitive skin band-aids I was all good. Each day after that was ok, I made myself get out of the house at least twice a day mostly just to walk around Walmart or wherever. Usually didn’t last long maybe 30min but at least I was out and not stuck inside. Mostly I ended up sleeping because of the pain meds. Or attempting to watch TV but usually I fell asleep with that too. It wasn’t until I really worked myself off the meds did I finally feel like doing things. Even then though I’d eventually pop a pill because I’d overdo it. But that’s how it goes at the beginning. So a week after my surgery was my first PT appointment. I had the same PT therapist I had the first time so he knew me and what was going on, so it made things a little better. For the longest time at the beginning PT is all passive motion which means you don’t do any work, the therapist does all the movement for you. And if you do try to do something they will know and they do yell at you to stop it...ha ha ha. It’s not your fault it’s just instinct. So just an FYI..they won’t let you get away with much. I will tell you the stretching sucks. It’s painful and especially when they massage your incision sites.....look out it really hurts but will get better as you move through your PT. I recommend getting ice for your shoulder after they are done picking on you, just ask for some they have plenty. They can wrap it around your shoulder so it will stay on its own. It will help the pain. Go straight home if possible and take a pain pill because you will be hurting. Now if you have a driver driving you to PT then I’d go ahead and take a pain pill before your appt but if you are like me and have no one I just ended up taking Advil before PT then the awesome magical pain pill after when I got myself home. FYI....I drove myself which they don’t recommend when you are in your immobilizer (and when it’s your dominant arm=kind of makes driving a little hard) because the cops will give you a ticket if you get into an accident or pulled over but I had no choice so I took the risk. I just took my time and tried to not be in a hurry. Easier said than done when you’re in pain but that’s why I recommend the ice it helps. After a few weeks PT will start letting you do things but with caution. They will introduce some weight not much only like a 1 lb. weight but at first that’s heavy. Gradually you will work yourself up to 3-4 lb. weight, resistance bands of multiple strength, weighted balls and exercises but that’s usually towards the end of your PT experience. The key is slow and steady and if something hurts TELL your therapist. They can come up with a different exercise and they need to document pain in case something isn’t right....once again I’m speaking from experience. So I did PT post op for 5 months. At my 3rd month I started complaining about shoulder pain in the area of my bicipital groove. I told my PT guy and he worked around it and documented it. This pain would not go away. So I had a follow up appt with my Ortho Dr and brought this problem up. Now this is where I should have known I was screwed. My ortho would not take my pain seriously, he kept saying some pain is normal until 1 year post op so he wouldn’t take me seriously til that one year had passed since the surgery. I know some pain is normal, I get that however I’m in the medical field and totally get that a little pain should be normal but this pain wasn’t giving up and it was getting worse. Every appt I had after that I complained and all he would do is give me steroid injections. No imaging was done only injections. I completed PT after doing it for 5 months, had great Range of Motion with no problems but still had that anterior pain going down my bicep. Went for another ortho appt which turned out to be the one where he cleared me for work so I would have no restrictions. When he said he was going to clear me I questioned him because for my work I have to be able to lift a minimum 75lbs on my own and the heaviest I could do after all my PT was 35 lbs. The dr proceeded to tell me I would be fine to just be careful. Alert, Alert....that was warning sign number 2 that I should have seen as a red flag to go to another dr. But being a person who was going crazy not being able to work, I was like ok but I did hesitate. So now I’m back to work....two months later I was back in his office for another injection and complaining session. He ignored me like usual....red flag number three. A week after that last injection I was fed up with this ortho doc. I was hurting and work was getting impossible. So I went to one of my radiologists whom I’ve worked with for 13 years and asked if he knew another doctor to go to for a second opinion. He gave me a name and I went for it. I got all my paperwork together, anything I could get my hands onto and took it into his office for his review and for a week I patiently waited for a phone call for an approval or denial. To my great surprise and relief, his office called to schedule an appointment. I went to that appt hoping he could and would help me. I was just stuck with no help from my current doctor and I didn’t know what else to do. At my appt we sat down together and talked about what was going on. He was listening....it was great. I no longer was being treated like an older person who didn’t know anything about medicine. He agreed with me.....I shouldn’t be hurting like I was. So he ordered another MR Arthrogram to see what was going on in the shoulder. One week later I was at the imaging facility enjoying another MRI. It actually wasn’t too bad, a lot more painful than the first time but I just said that was because of the surgery scar tissue.....apparently I was wrong. According to the MR I have re-tore my labrum a lot worse than I had the first time. So now I just found out I get to have another awesome shoulder surgery. Won’t know the extent of damage fully til he gets in but I saw the MR images and the tear looks rather large. Granted I don’t do MRI but I do understand the images. Even my radiologist said he's not sure what’s going on other than yes I will have to have surgery again. Well that was reassuring…thanks doc. So here I am just days before I see my new ortho to plan surgery. I just want to cry.....it sucked the first time and now I have to do it again. It’s so not fair!!! Now I do want to let you guys know about something that happened while I was off the first time around. I feel that it’s really important to share this with you... I’ve been plagued with anxiety/depression over the last few years. I’ve dealt with it on my own and it’s been fine. It’s never been bad....Unfortunately after my shoulder surgery it got worse...way worse. I’m not proud about what I almost did, but I’m glad I noticed I was having a problem before I followed through with a very bad idea. I’ll just be truthful....I was sitting at a stoplight, first in line at a very busy intersection, I looked left and then right to see a lot of traffic when the very bad thought popped into my head. If I just go now, I won’t have to deal with things for a while. That thought scared the crap out of me. I’ve never had any ideas like that before let alone want to actually do it. That moment was when I knew I had to get help. I was crying my eyes out for no real reason. I was stressed... yes who wouldn’t be but I didn’t think it was that bad. Thank goodness my body didn’t listen to what my mind was saying. I could have easily seen my foot just tap the excelerator just enough to get me into traffic. It would have been bad but thankfully I was aware enough not to do it. Now I tell you my story to make you aware that when you get laid up, be aware and make your friends aware so they know to keep an eye out for odd behavior. Prior to my incident, I was showing signs of having issues but no one said anything. Please as a friend be there for each other because you could easily save their life. The next day I called my primary doctor up and scheduled an appt for possible depression/anxiety disorder. He put me on Zoloft and it was heaven. No anxiety, no worrying.....I couldn’t even think 5 minutes ahead and it was great. I was a notorious worrier, I’d be worrying about something a month away but now no more. It was awesome. Prior to surgery I researched constantly trying to get my head around what I was about to go through. Nowhere did I read anything about depression. I had no idea. I’m writing this so hopefully it will make people aware what they need to look out for. What I hope you have taken away from my story..... Don’t let a doctor tell you your fine when you feel there is something wrong. Be constant with your complaints and keep complaining until they either listen or you find a doctor who will listen. You know your body better than they do so don’t give up. Be mindful of your mindset. Basically watch out for signs of depression. You may think it won’t happen to you but that’s usually when it comes and bites you in your butt. Don’t seclude yourself, get out and get around people. You don’t have to talk to them just be around them. That alone will help. Don’t be afraid of getting help. If you have the right doctor he/she will listen and give you choices on how to help the problems. To Family and friends... please keep an eye on your friends/family who undergo any kind of surgery. You may be the one who notices some behavior that isn’t right. Please watch out for their safety because they may not even notice it. For coaches and parents.....pay attention to your athlete. You are around them almost or if not every day, you know what ""normal"" is for them. If they injure themselves they may not tell you and try to play it off which could make the injury worse. So please be diligent and if you think somethings not right, pull them aside quietly and ask them. If my coach had done that I might not be where I am today (aka surgery #2). And to my fellow athletes and medical professionals.....don’t be afraid to say somethings wrong, I’m hurt. Don’t let people bully you into making you think you are fine. I know we all love our sport/job and just want to keep working/playing but if you hurt yourself and not say anything, you could end up regretting it down the road. I don’t want you to go through the pain if it can be avoided. 4 likes, 16 replies "

I completed PT after doing it for 5 months, had great Range of Motion with no problems but still had that anterior pain going down my bicep. Went for another ortho appt which turned out to be the one where he cleared me for work so I would have no restrictions. When he said he was going to clear me I questioned him because for my work I have to be able to lift a minimum 75lbs on my own and the heaviest I could do after all my PT was 35 lbs. The dr proceeded to tell me I would be fine to just be careful. Alert, Alert....that was warning sign number 2 that I should have seen as a red flag to go to another dr. But being a person who was going crazy not being able to work, I was like ok but I did hesitate. So now I’m back to work....two months later I was back in his office for another injection and complaining session. He ignored me like usual....red flag number three. A week after that last injection I was fed up with this ortho doc. I was hurting and work was getting impossible. So I went to one of my radiologists whom I’ve worked with for 13 years and asked if he knew another doctor to go to for a second opinion. He gave me a name and I went for it. I got all my paperwork together, anything I could get my hands onto and took it into his office for his review and for a week I patiently waited for a phone call for an approval or denial. To my great surprise and relief, his office called to schedule an appointment. I went to that appt hoping he could and would help me. I was just stuck with no help from my current doctor and I didn’t know what else to do. At my appt we sat down together and talked about what was going on. He was listening....it was great. I no longer was being treated like an older person who didn’t know anything about medicine. He agreed with me.....I shouldn’t be hurting like I was. So he ordered another MR Arthrogram to see what was going on in the shoulder. One week later I was at the imaging facility enjoying another MRI. It actually wasn’t too bad, a lot more painful than the first time but I just said that was because of the surgery scar tissue.....apparently I was wrong. According to the MR I have re-tore my labrum a lot worse than I had the first time. So now I just found out I get to have another awesome shoulder surgery. Won’t know the extent of damage fully til he gets in but I saw the MR images and the tear looks rather large. Granted I don’t do MRI but I do understand the images. Even my radiologist said he's not sure what’s going on other than yes I will have to have surgery again. Well that was reassuring…thanks doc. So here I am just days before I see my new ortho to plan surgery. I just want to cry.....it sucked the first time and now I have to do it again. It’s so not fair!!! Now I do want to let you guys know about something that happened while I was off the first time around. I feel that it’s really important to share this with you... I’ve been plagued with anxiety/depression over the last few years. I’ve dealt with it on my own and it’s been fine. It’s never been bad....Unfortunately after my shoulder surgery it got worse...way worse. I’m not proud about what I almost did, but I’m glad I noticed I was having a problem before I followed through with a very bad idea. I’ll just be truthful....I was sitting at a stoplight, first in line at a very busy intersection, I looked left and then right to see a lot of traffic when the very bad thought popped into my head. If I just go now, I won’t have to deal with things for a while. That thought scared the crap out of me. I’ve never had any ideas like that before let alone want to actually do it. That moment was when I knew I had to get help. I was crying my eyes out for no real reason. I was stressed... yes who wouldn’t be but I didn’t think it was that bad. Thank goodness my body didn’t listen to what my mind was saying. I could have easily seen my foot just tap the excelerator just enough to get me into traffic. It would have been bad but thankfully I was aware enough not to do it. Now I tell you my story to make you aware that when you get laid up, be aware and make your friends aware so they know to keep an eye out for odd behavior. Prior to my incident, I was showing signs of having issues but no one said anything. Please as a friend be there for each other because you could easily save their life. The next day I called my primary doctor up and scheduled an appt for possible depression/anxiety disorder. He put me on Zoloft and it was heaven. No anxiety, no worrying.....I couldn’t even think 5 minutes ahead and it was great. I was a notorious worrier, I’d be worrying about something a month away but now no more. It was awesome. Prior to surgery I researched constantly trying to get my head around what I was about to go through. Nowhere did I read anything about depression. I had no idea. I’m writing this so hopefully it will make people aware what they need to look out for. What I hope you have taken away from my story..... Don’t let a doctor tell you your fine when you feel there is something wrong. Be constant with your complaints and keep complaining until they either listen or you find a doctor who will listen. You know your body better than they do so don’t give up. Be mindful of your mindset. Basically watch out for signs of depression. You may think it won’t happen to you but that’s usually when it comes and bites you in your butt. Don’t seclude yourself, get out and get around people. You don’t have to talk to them just be around them. That alone will help. Don’t be afraid of getting help. If you have the right doctor he/she will listen and give you choices on how to help the problems. To Family and friends... please keep an eye on your friends/family who undergo any kind of surgery. You may be the one who notices some behavior that isn’t right. Please watch out for their safety because they may not even notice it. For coaches and parents.....pay attention to your athlete. You are around them almost or if not every day, you know what ""normal"" is for them. If they injure themselves they may not tell you and try to play it off which could make the injury worse. So please be diligent and if you think somethings not right, pull them aside quietly and ask them. If my coach had done that I might not be where I am today (aka surgery #2). And to my fellow athletes and medical professionals.....don’t be afraid to say somethings wrong, I’m hurt. Don’t let people bully you into making you think you are fine. I know we all love our sport/job and just want to keep working/playing but if you hurt yourself and not say anything, you could end up regretting it down the road. I don’t want you to go through the pain if it can be avoided. 4 likes, 16 replies "

I had a full thickness tear repaired 10 weeks ago, and I have followed all instructions from surgeon and PT to a T. I work on a computer all day, and it is so painful, just like before the surgery. I am literally in tears every afternoon and have to take so many breaks during the day. I feel like my spirit is just broken and I don't know how much more I can take. My right hand gets freezing cold after 20-30 minutes at my PC and it stays that way until I stop. I take muscle relaxers to sleep at night, and have so much pain when I wake up from rolling onto the operated shoulder. I know I'm not too far into recovery, but I just was hoping for some relief at this point?! Also, my shoulder looks deformed and it scares me. It is kind of curled forward and sticking out on the top and front. I can't even force it into a normal position like the other shoulder with good posture. Does anyone else have pain while on a computer or this deformed look? I go back to my doctor in 2 weeks. My PT is fabulous and very compassionate and understanding. I trust him completely. He is trying to help. My ROM is improving and is actually where it should be at this point, but I'm just so tired of the pain, especially using my arm all day. I want to be able to go to the grocery store, cook, do normal activities that require BOTH hands! I'm single and have no help so it's just frustrating.

I thought because the MRI did not say so and I have good strength and ROM I probably do not. MY PT said since I have been in PT for over a year and a half straight that the PT could be helping with that and I could still have a small(ish) tear not a full? She also said she felt I would probably recover better because of all the PT I have done... I have a previously scheduled vacation with my daughter and family one month after surgery. My original PT said I may be sore a bit but should be pretty good by then.  All this just makes me more and more anxious. Oh and my sister-in-law had rotator cuff surgery and says she hated the Oxycodone and not to take it. Any feedback is much appreciated. 0 likes, 5 replies "

Anchors were placed in the bone of my upper arm to attach the biceps tendon to and an anchor was attached to the top of my shoulder to attach the rotator cuff tendon to. Everything was going fine with PT and I had regained most of my shoulder's mobility when I had a setback. I picked up a bag of what I thought was household trash to place in the trash bin with my repaired arm/shoulder. Unfortunately inside the trash bag were broken pieces of concrete and mortar which I'm guessing weighed about 90 pounds. As I picked up the bag and put it in the trash bin I felt a strain in my shoulder. I didn't hear anything pop and originally thought I may just have stretched things a bit. However the pain gradually increased over the next several days on the top of my shoulder where the rotator cuff was repaired and under my arm where the labrum was repaired. The pain increased to the point of here it was before my surgery and  for the next several days I had to go back on pain medication. Although the pain has subsided a bit, I am still experiencing a searing type of pain especially on the top of my shoulder. My doctor said if I didn't hear any thing pop and experienced pain right away that I probably just had a relapse in the healing. I am worried that I possibly pulled out the sutures or worse yet the anchors. Has anyone has had this occur (i.e., lifting a unsafe amount of weight at 8 weeks post op)? If so, did it result in a rupture of the repair? My Doctor took an x-ray and said that the anchors still appeared to be where he placed them but he also said he cannot tell from the x-ray whether or not they could have become dislodged from the bone. He told me to wait a few weeks until the pain has subsided and the flare up has settled down so he can perform an MRI with dye injections. I'm worried that if I did damage the repair areas I am just postponing the inevitable (another surgery).Anyone out there experience anything like this? 1 like, 13 replies "

I am having sharp pains in the clavicle area any time I reach for anything, lift my arm up, every morning I wake and often while just at rest. Also sharp and aching pain where my biceps muscle sits in the bottom of my arm and in the biceps region (I assume it's a partial tendonectomy because of this) Biceps muscle often 'seizes' while picking something up. Physio is concerned I may have done further damage when the biceps muscle popped and thinks I will require more surgery, I do not see my surgeon until mid April, I'm fed up and sooo tired of being in pain. Original injury occured in June 2015 after bouncing up concrete steps, tripping and landing very hard on my shoulder.  Anyone had anything similar happen and have any insight?

I am having sharp pains in the clavicle area any time I reach for anything, lift my arm up, every morning I wake and often while just at rest. Also sharp and aching pain where my biceps muscle sits in the bottom of my arm and in the biceps region (I assume it's a partial tendonectomy because of this) Biceps muscle often 'seizes' while picking something up. Physio is concerned I may have done further damage when the biceps muscle popped and thinks I will require more surgery, I do not see my surgeon until mid April, I'm fed up and sooo tired of being in pain. Original injury occured in June 2015 after bouncing up concrete steps, tripping and landing very hard on my shoulder.  Anyone had anything similar happen and have any insight?

Totally out of the blue, never having suffered before. Today, I get this every week, one day a week and mostly on a Saturday. I was prescribed cetirizone and a nasal spray. These don’t seem to stop the one day attack. Every time I stand up my nose runs like water, the itch is insane, I’m tired, foggy, can’t concentrate or focus at all. I go to bed at night and wake up Sunday morning feeling fine. Blood tests came back as “mild dust mite allergy” but I can say hand on heart there is nothing mild about my symptoms. I have bought a new mattress, anti-allergy linens etc etc and there doesn’t seem to be any exposure to anything or anything I do differently one day a week. Please help! I have another ENT appointment in a month but last time I went I don’t think he believed me when I said I can genuinely sneeze hundreds of times a day. This is ruining my life  0 likes, 3 replies "

Rhinitis? ","Hi Everyone, I'm trying to find people in similar situations that are either dealing better than I am, have some treatment that is working or have come out the other side. Before reading about my symptoms I believe its relevant to point out that I bought my house just over 7 years ago. My house has a cellar and only original floorboards separating the cellar to my living area (with half inch gaps between each board). I also have found black mold in other areas of my home. I didn't catch onto this/piece together until recently. My issue started around 6.5 years ago when I was diagnosed with M.E or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I suffered from extreme tiredness, sensitivity to light, muscle and joint pain, brain fog and confusion. I then later got diagnosed with acid reflux. Around 5.5 years ago I caught a cold and took a small blow to the nose at the same time. This resulted in difficultly breathing and a permanently blocked nose. I went to the doctors more times than I care to remember, they said everything looked fine but eventually got referred to an ENT after much pressure! I was on antihistamines and a nasal steroid spray too. The ENT took one look and diagnosed me with a deviated septum, enlarged turbinates and a bone spur all blocking my breathing. My first surgery saw the ENT trim my turbinates, reposition and reshape them. I was desperate for this to work but it didn't. I got some light relief and the issue mainly stayed in one nostril. Time went on and I had another surgery around 12-15 months later. This time a probe inserted to heat the turbinate tissue and reduce their size. I had more luck with this but still have a really blocked nose and little quality of life. Recently I caught the flu and ended up with pressure in my ears that won't go away. I have had an allergy test in the past and the results were cat dander, grass pollen, dust mites and mold. I did have two cats but these were rehomed to another family member and I have had no improvement. I think that my issue may have been caused from breathing in damp for a long period of time? I had no allergic symptoms for the 18 months before my nose blocked. Could this be mold poisioning or simply a severe allergy? I would assume I'd have had an initial reaction to it when I first moved in. Has anyone been treated for allergies with enlarged turbinates are actually recovered? I think we are going to move house to see if that helps too. I have asked for a referral to an allergist to see if this can help in any way. the last 6 years of my life have been hell. I've lost friends, upset family, lost a partner due to my inability to cope. I feared empty nose syndrome for a long time due to the two surgeries too. Update: last week I purchased two air purifiers with HEPA filters and I had my best week in the 6 years I have mentioned. This was however short lived and I now feel worse than ever again. Could this be an allergy and can it still get better? Please advise or share similar experiences. Hopefully there is a success story out there 0 likes, 13 replies "

I ask that because always when I found someone with a condition same as mine, the discussion was filled with comments from people suffering from other rhinitis symptoms besides swollen turbinates, especially from people with runny noses. I have compassion for you, but trust me, this is different. Places where my condition is the worst are caffe bars and cheap restaurants with poor ventilation. My turbinates become swollen almost immediately after I enter these places, it takes only a few seconds. After leaving those places and getting some fresh air, I immediately feel partial relief, but not completely, I suspect that's because the allergen remains present on my skin. Condition also gets worse in many other indoor places, such as my apartment and college classrooms. We recently did a detailed cleaning of the apartment, especially my bedroom. Soon after that, my condition became a bit better (not dramatically) both at home and at other places where it usually gets worse. But that small improvement only lasted couple of days. Places where I get almost immediate relief are doctors' and dentists' offices. Immediately upon entering I feel significant relief, and after couple minutes spent there it gets even better. I am quite sure it happens because those places are sterilized. Being out on fresh air also brings significant relief, but not as much as being in doctors' and dentists' offices. I used many different medications and visited many doctors. Medications that provided significant relief are antihistamines. I tried different types and all of them caused extreme drowsiness and limb weakness. One time it was so extreme that I almost dropped a pot while carrying it from the fridge to the table. Even bilastine, which was designed for treating allergy without drowsiness, caused severe drowsiness. Corticosteroids such as Avamys and Nasonex didn't provide any relief at all. Capsaicin (ingredient found in hot peppers) based sprays bring mild, very short-lasting relief (up to one hour). Besides medications, there are some other things that provide partial relief. Saline solution provides partial relief immediately. Condition worsens again in 20-30 minutes, depending on the place I'm at. Showers also provide instant parital relief, but it worsens after I spend about 20 minutes in my room. I did allergy tests. I used skin prick test to test for all common allergens and it turned out negative. Then I measured total IgE in blood, it was 193 kU/L, which is higher than the reference value (122 kU/L). Then I ran specific IgE tests from blood for some allergens, and all of them turned out to be negative. All of this means I am allergic, but can't determine exact cause of allergy. I had a deviated septum surgery before we determined I suffered from allergy, the surgery didn't help at all (during the surgery they also removed a little bit of my turbinates). Later I had RF mucotomy (basically burning your turbinates with high temperature) done, it didn't provide significant relief. More detailed, there are 2 problems with  turbinates. One is the burning sensation and the other one is the enlargement of turbinates. Burning sensation is bad, but it can be controlled with large quantities of saline solution. Also, the burning sensation almost always comes together with enlargened turbinates, but turbinates can be enlargened without the burning sensation. The enlargement of the turbinates is the biggest problem. At almost all times only one turbinate is enlargened, every couple of hours they switch sides (nasal cycle). In some places both turbinates swell badly (places with poor ventilation like caffe bars and some restaurants). The problem with enlargened turbinates is that I feel they are literally pressing my brain against the skull. If the left turbinate is enlargened then I feel pressure in the left side of the head, and if the right turbinate is enlargened then I feel pressure in the right side of the head. This pressure makes me go mad. I go to into ""Hulk-like mode"". I become very nervous and talk aggressively to people around me for no real reason except for enlargened turbinates. I believe that  enlargened turbinates are significantly reducing blood flow to the brain because of the following:  First, POTS (Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) - when I stand up after sitting or lying down for a longer period of time I feel like I will pass out, my vision goes black. I already passed out once. When I stand up I need to sit down immediately for 10 seconds until my head gets better, if I don't sit down I'd pass out for sure. What is important is that if my left turbinate is enlargened then I get a black out feeling in the left side of my head (same goes for right turbinate and right side of head). Second, when my turbinates are enlargened I feel extreme tiredness, regardless of the amount of sleep I get. I sometimes fall asleep during lectures while sitting in the first row of the classroom. I believe it is caused by enlargened turbinates because when I rinse my nose with saline solution I immediately become less tired or stop being tired at all. Washing my face with water also helps with tiredness. I believe that by rinsing my nose and washing my face I am removing the allergen from my body. Third, partially connected to the second, is yawning. When my turbinates are enlargened I yawn literally once every minute. Fourth, my focus becomes very poor. It is what gives me the most trouble. I literally can't pay attention for more than 5 seconds, and when I lose focus it takes at least as much to regain it. I often can't even have a decent conversation because it's too hard to think about what the other side is saying and what I will respond. I also become very slowed down. Everyday normal tasks, like taking a shower and preparing meals take a lot longer than they should. The hardest activity is learning. It takes ages to read something and even more time to memorize it. It becomes harder and harder each semester (I am studying computer science). Fifth, also very important, is that my voice is weird and more quiet when turbinates are enlargened, it feels like I am speaking through my nose. People don't take me seriously when I talk using that voice. If you suffer from the same condition or know someone who does please share your advice and your diagnosis. I repeat my kind request: please do not to post comments if you suffer from runny nose. 0 likes, 13 replies "

I have been suffering from sinuses pain at last ten years.I'm 48 man from Croatia. In January i went to my ENT  and i have been diagnosis with vasomotor and allergic Rhinitis and chronic laryngitis!! I also have reflux under therapy. 22.02-I have the flu,badly sinus congestion,and bronchitis.I was constantly getting post nasal drip and coughing up phlegm.Sinuses pressure was very painful.I did try inhaling 2-3 days with Essential oil  in boiling water (buy in my drugstore)and I felt consistent relief from sinuses pressure. 25.02.When I went to the doctor I was given Antibiotics for bronchitis.That day I discovered that i unable to smell!! Unable to smell hardly anything for 5-6 days.After 5-6 day my smell are slowly beck.(30%)Taste is OK. I have tried 2 different ENTs after flu and I have been diagnosis with chronic rhinosinusitis,edema of the nasal mucosa.. Therapy:Nasonex 2x2 for first 14 days than 1x2 another 14 days..From 08 March..Saline nasal spray,Rinse nasal passages,B vitamins!! 18.03-CT scan show that my left turbinate is swollen,no nasal polyps,retention cysts 7x10 mm at the bottom right Maxillar sinuses with edema mucosa.The left Maxillar sinuses have thickened edges on the mucous membrane.Rest of my sinuses look normal. I'll be an allergy test 18.04 (I've never been allergic to anythig) 28.03 I went my ENT and after he seen my CT he told me to continue with Nasonex 1x2!!He said The cause of the discomfort and the diminished sense of smell is in the swelling of the mucous membranes of the nasal shells I suffer from burning pain and dryness in my nose with pain in the bridge and behind.At the moment, I have no mucus on my nose.Often i feel blocked nose.Constant ""clamping"" and crackling feeling on my right nostrils.No sneezing or running nose!No Headache.Pain under my left eye..Cigarette smoke and pollution are huge triggers.. I tried pretty much everything to overcome,steroid sprays-nasonex (4 weeks-) nasal sprays,nasal irrigation.I'm  taking a break from nasonex,6 days now to see what's happend.I think the Still I have not found any consistent relief. My anxiety does play a role in making me feel worse.I've been experiencing fatigue,stuffy nose (worse at night when lying down,mainly in the right nostril)where it feels mostly blocked and pressure,congested,dry mouth exspecially night,loud constant tinnitus (left ear). I also planing go to a neurologist.. I can smell properly when i put my nose close to something that i sniffing.

I have very swallon turbinates, and persistent chronic allergy symptoms for months. Resulting in my loss of taste and smell. I went to the doctors and they prescribed me steroid nasal spray, which after a week started to show some results. I used this along side clarityn and it worked great for about 2 weeks! I could finally taste and smell again. But for the past 3 weeks im back to square one again, Completely blocked up, constant allergy symptoms and loss of smell and taste.  I went to the doctors again yesterday, begging for an allergy test to find out what the cause of this is. They told me its not widely available anymore so I can't be tested for it unless i have an idea of what it is... He then referred me to the ent clinic, and the wait is 4 months just to be seen ( it took me 4 weeks just to get an appointment with the doctors) He gave me some more allergy tablets which do NOTHING. None of them work any more, I've tried every brand to try along side my steroid spray. The spray does nothing anymore either. I am honestly at the end of my tether with this now, the past 9 months have been miserable. I've completely lost my appetite too as I just can't enjoy food. Can anyone please give me any sort of advice that i can try? literally anything. I've tried most things that I can think of but at this stage im desperate to get this sorted.  1 like, 39 replies "

I have noticed if the weather is raining or damp or windy my rhinitus is worse. All smells set if off. Its worse first thing in the morning.  It only started about 2 years ago out of the blue. So hard trying to sleep as its blocked or one of my nostrils makes that annoying half blocked sound when breathing through it all night which keeps me away as no matter how many times I blow my nose it comes back.  All smells or perfums or any smells set it off. Being out in the open air is my only relief.  1 like, 8 replies "

I'm male, late 20s, and have always tried to take care of my skin, probably more than most I'd say. Always had reasonable skin, the odd spots or dryness etc but nothing major. Then a couple of years ago I started occasionally getting redness on my nose. Itchy, sore and awful to look at - but I never had it diagnosed as Rosacea as I was always clear when I happened to go to the doc. That's the thing, it can sometimes not flare up for months and months, my skin can be perfect and then half a year down the line, from nowhere, it explodes in this awful redness. Anyway, after trying loads of different creams and moisturisers and getting nowhere, with my GP not being enoguh help (to be fair I appreciate they aren't a skin specialist so can be limited in what they can do) I paid a lot of money to see a dermatologist privately. I brought photos as I didn't have a flare up at the time and he quickly diagnosed it as Rosacea and prescribed Mirvaso - which I'd never heard of. Anyway, I got the stuff (pretty expensive I may add) and didn't use it until about a month ago, as I'd been all clear. It certainly seemed to work, clearing up redness on my nose very quickly. I only used a tiny bit of it on occasion initially and it was working OK. I did notice however that there seemed to be unusually white patches on my nose after using, like the opposite of Roscea but almost unnatural looking. Then small blotches appeared. I persisted and last week I used it a bit more as a flare up was on the cards. Again, it seemed to do the job but suddenly within a day or so my nose has turned completely. Now every few hours it turns totally red, not sore or itchy like Rosacea but still awful looking and 100 times worse than I'd ever experienced before. As soon as I'm out in the cold a bit it turns red and can stay that way for hours, but when it does change back it's bizarre, like it changs in 15-20 minutes from all red to regular.  I've now stopped using the Mirvaso for a good 5 days, but my nose won't stop fluctuating between bright red and normal 3 or 4 times a day. It looks horrendous and it's driving me mad - not to mention affecting my work (it flared up moments before a meeting today) and my personal life (don't want to leave the house). Is there any solution that can stop this? Has anyone else experienced this with Mirvaso? I wanted to try to use nothing at all on my face for a bit but I have found that using a regular moisturiser does seem to speed up the return to normal colour on my nose.  Just feel so disheartened that I've been frustrated by this for years (granted it may only affect me intermittently, but it doesn't make it any less awful when it happened) and just when I thought I'd found somethine to clear it up when it occurs I've actually made it far worse than before.

I have recently been diagnosed with Rosacea, although looking back I believe I've had it a while and didn't know what the issue was. I have been given Metrosa gel for 8 weeks and told to go back and visit my GP.  I've looked online and there are so many sites, my mind is rather baffled, can anyone please recommend a good moisturiser? Also on a separate issue, I went to give blood today as i always do and was told I couldn't because of this. The moment I sat down the lady asked if I had a rash, I explained I had recently been diagnosed with Rosacea and after discussing the treatment I'm having I was told I couldn't donate. Does anyone with Rosacea donate blood? If I didn't already feel like crap this made me feel even worse  Thanks for any help 0 likes, 1 reply "

During most of that time I had been stable on 125mg of Levothyroxine, TSH 2. something.   3 years ago I moved  over 200miles.  during that time I had my dose reduced to 100mg as my routine test showed level to be getting lower I wish I could remember the level but I think it was about 0.8 or 9.  It was a time when I was having tests for angina which turned out to be negative.  I also started to suffer from anxiety with other ongoing health problems as well.  I think my next blood tests level were around 1-2.   A few month ago I was speaking to the pharmacist about another tablet and whether to take it with food and he said that I should take the levothyroxine when I wake leave at least 30mins then take my other tablets then have breakfast which is what I have been doing.  I should add that I did try taking it at night but was difficult because I had at the time other tablets to take.   I  have just had had my yearly blood results and my TSH is 0.6  range 0.4 to 4.  I know all about the difference of opinion on range and optimum levels.  Do you think this is too low.   I have other problems at the moment namely diagnosis of mild fibromylagia against background of widespread osteoarthritis and have recently had to have a course of B12 tablets.

She doesn't like leaving the house and never has enjoyed being surrounded by people. She almost missed all three of her childrens' weddings because of her conditions and missed my graduation last week because of how she is now. She's quite and always in pain, mostly from her mouth but also from rhuematism. I'm telling you this so you have a small character profile to judge her new behaviour on as missing my graduation is a massive shock because to her the sun shines out of my arse. So missing my graduation is a massive thing, even more than if she actually had missed her childrens' weddings. So now I feel there is definitely need to worry.    She recently had a bad few days where she wouldn't leave bed and believed she was dying. My aunty and uncle took her to the doctors and they prescribed her with some anxiety medications - I don't know which one. Then she was fine for a month, back to her normal self. Still very timid and disliked leaving the house but could still go do her shopping and was as happy as she could be. Last week, the doctors took her off her anxiety tablets and changed her blood pressure tablets to Ramipril - I don't know what blood pressure tablets she was on before. Since then she's been massively depressed. She can't leave the house and says she constantly feels terrible and once again thinks she's gonna die. She is currently going to the hospital for pains in her mouth and something to do with her spine but nobody knows anything yet, they're still testing. So I imagine that added with her depression can quite easily make someone feel as if they are going to die.  My mum has come round and told her of a story of three women somewhere in the world who all had the exact symptoms that my nana has and it took a special doctor somewhere to connect the dots and realise that it was the Ramipril so now my nana believes it's Ramipril that is making her feel so bad. She refuses to believe that she's ever been like this before, even though she was in bed believing she was going to die before Ramipril. I've done some googling and it does seem that there's enough evidence that Ramipril can cause or worsen depression but my mum is a pretty strong liar who told her to stop taking her rheumatic medication and to replace it with fake   so I'd just like information from someone more reliable on Ramipril and depression.  She also takes:  Simvastatin, Levothyroxine, Mirtazapine, Ibuprofen and Cardide SR. I guess my overall question is: can Rampril be the issue? She fully refuses to believe that she has ever been this depressed and therefore doesn't tell her doctor about her depression, even though she believed she was dying just over a month ago.  Cheers for any help. Sorry if I seem out of touch with depression, I was diagnosed with anxiety at an early age because both my parents are addicts so I can semi understand her feelings but I've never been diagnosed with depression so I cannot fully understand it.    0 likes, 1 reply "

The effect is very much like that of Raynauds (spasm of the small blood vessels causing restriction of blood flow / numbness / burning pain), but this only affects one single finger, the finger turns blue instead of white, and the event is not neccessarily triggered by cold. The finger is hyper-sensitive. The first episode in the little finger on my left hand lasted about 6-8 weeks and caused me a lot of pain. If I accidentally bumped my finger pain shot like a lightning bolt up my entire arm. Several times I woke up during the night from the intolerable pain, which didn't show any reaction to painkillers. Next to the nail I developed necrotic tissue which later fell off (Jeeeez!). Even when the wound and finger finally healed it was still sensitive and I could still feel the trauma the finger had been through for a while. I am experiencing episode #2 on my ring finger (right hand) which appeared middle of March. After showing Raynaud's-like symptoms (white fingertip, numbness) and also increased sensitivity (not a Raynauds symptom) I suddenly was in so much pain one evening that I didn't know what to do with myself and I eventually took myself to A&E! (pointless, as the hospital didn't even have vascular services and as the pain fairly suddenly disappeared as if someone had flicked a switch). Earlier on the finger looked thin and drawn with creases down the fingertips. Some days later the fnger was warm, pulsating and swollen, the fingerprint lines have almost disappeared due to the swelling and the skin feels too tight and pulls away from the fingernail when I stretch my finger. I assume the latter might have indeed happenend and caused a small tear, as I have developed a small wound under my nail which looks almost as if I have to expect some necrotic tissue again (damn!) The finger is swollen and stiff - I can't bend the last digit at all and I can't straighten the finger which makes everyday tasks heaps of fun. Meanwhile I started to notice the potentially first symptoms (increased Raynauds white fingertips, burning sensitivity in the finger) in the middle finger of my left (!) hand! Seriously? My right hand is already in a fairly disabled state, now the left hand too?!?  I have had a series of tests done at the vascular surgery department at UCLH London, including a Doppler ultrasound test of the arteries in my arms and neck, as well as a CT scan. Doctors couldn't find anything wrong and I was discharged from any further testing. I am now awaiting for a referral to a rheumatologist for further tests. But essentially they are telling me that the tests being done are for the purpose of excluding certain things but that we are not under the illusion to find the actual cause and treat / heal it. There is some information available on the internet, although it is pretty clear that the 'acute blue finger' (as was diagnosed by Prof. Toby Richards at UCLH, who also wrote a scienticic paper about the syptom) is a rather rare occurence, as opposed to Raynaud's which is fairly common. Most articles decribe the disease as a benign condition (for me or for my finger??) which heals by itself (it doesn't state how many weeks it takes and rules out the possibility of necrotic tissue loss). I have also been diagnosed by a dermatologist with a patch of morphea (scleroderma?) on my back, which is an overproduction of collagen which causes thickening of the skin. I have reason to believe that there might be a connection between the two. My best hope is now to look for anyone having had any experience with this and discussion forums like this.

Perhaps....,"Ok so I posted my sob story yesterday thank you to those who responded. Coincidentally I started at a new chiropractor today. Unlike a lot of medical professionals he took down my entire history and listened to me (imagine?). It's not that complicated but as we all know doctors often just get to the exact reason you're sitting there and move you along. He asked if I had low stomach acid. I said not it's high that's why I take prevacid every day for 10 years. He said in reviewing my history he had a hunch that the prevacid had done too much for too long... that my stomach acid was low and that the low stomach acid is causing my hives. What???????!!!!!!!!!! He did a basic baking soda and water stomach acid test.. which revealed excessively low stomach acid levels. OH MY GOD! When the body's stomach acid is low, it panics and creates high histamines to trigger stomach acid production. The high histamines (if combined with already high histamines like in a low carb diet...) can then cause hives since the levels are so high. Can you imagine if this one person has solved the hives reason just by actually listening ?????? I emailed my doc asking the best way to wean off the prevacid. I'll keep you all updated. Has anyone ever heard of this? OR could this be something you should consider as well? 0 likes, 12 replies "

I've had hives for 4 months. Every. Single. Day. Giant welts. Here's what I've tried that didn't work: I went to the ENT on Monday. He told me to stop all of that with a very good point... Why am I doing all this when there's no change?  Well, because I'm an action oriented person and want to try everything. He prescribe me Pepcid AC and Xyzal. Both of which you can get over the counter.  Xyzal is a non-drowsy antihistamine. They have no idea why but the combo of these two is particularly effective with CHRONIC uticaria. Not sure what to think at this point, but I started taking them at 1pm on Monday. It's not 11am on Wednesday and I have not had one hive since Monday at 2pm. 0 likes, 7 replies "

The rashes are very raised welt-like bumps/circles and most of them itch like crazy.  He has booked me in for a blood test on Monday and I have to also provide a urine sample. For those who have experienced this, will a blood test tell me what is causing them?  I have never suffered with allergies before and have no idea where to start to try and figure out what has caused it.  I haven't changed my washing powder, eaten anything new, etc. etc. so am stumped as to why this is happening. He's told me to take Cetirizine  for this which will hopefully help, and I have been putting on Calamine lotion to the worst affected itchy bits to try and calm it down.  So far, they have been on my inner arm underneath my armpit, on my hips, wrists and sides of my stomach plus a bit on my legs. Does steroid cream work at all?  Any help at all would be so much appreciated, or any tried and tested methods please let me know. Happy to provide photos if needed! Thanks in advance. 0 likes, 5 replies "

(I have a red mark on my right heel that has always been extremely painful), and it wasn't until my left heel started giving me exactly the same pain, but had no red marks, that I realised this pain could be part of the Raynaud's. It's a cross between burning and stabbing. Having done some research I understand that stress can bring on an attack. So I'm assuming that an attack is when the pain is at its worst? I am by no means asking for a medical opinion, just to hear from someone who has gone through this as well. If it's not something that is common with Raynaud's, I know I need to have further investigation. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my post and you really do have my sympathies!

Two years ago he started experiencing shoulder pain and swelling, and it would cause his entire arm to swell and turn almost purple. It was extremely painful. After seeing several specialists, having steroid injections done and trying medications, he was finally referred to a Rheumatologist. They didn't even care to see him once they saw how young he is. They basically told him they didn't want to waste their time on him because anyone in their 20s wouldn't be having RA or severe arthritis issues. Cut to current time, and his knee has swollen up, pops out of joint and causes his lower leg to swell. Every single doctor he has seen has no clue what's wrong with him, and a different RA doctor brushed him off again. He's now having back issues, his other knee is starting to have pain and he's extremely tired all of the time.  His father has M.S., and has plenty of relatives who have RA and other similar medical conditions.  I guess my question is, for those of you who are in your 20s or 30s, how did you get a doctor to take you seriously? And a question for everyone is what do you do to help cope with the joint pain?  I'm not dead set on him having any form of arthritis, but he has so many of the symptoms that I don't want to rule it out. Thanks in advance for any help.  2 likes, 5 replies "

It all started 3 1/2 years ago with urethritis and all the classic symptoms that go with an STD after a one night stand. I went in to urgent care 3 different times over many months and was treated with azithromycin (1g oral) and ceftazidime (injections). Each time the tests for GC would be negative and the same symptoms would return within about 2 weeks.  I lived with this for many months until i went to my primary physician. He said that because the tests for STDs were negative that I needed to go to a urologist. So i made an appointment for the urologist. I go to the urologist and tell her my story. She orders many lab tests over many different visits, UA/UC, GC, CBC, ESR, CRP, mycoplasma, lymes, etc. to all of which came back negative.   I was put on Bacterim for a month, that didnt provide any results. I was put on Doxycycline for a month, that did nothing. She insisted that i see a different urologist. I go to the other urologist and was told that there is nothing wrong with me and that the symptoms are all in my head. He said that if there is something there, there is not a test for it and we cannot treat for it and that throwing different antibiotics at it was not the way to treat me. I was very upset about this becasue i have been getting the 'its all  in your head' line from 2 other doctors. But they dont know how it feels. So now it has been over three years of living with the constant urethrits symptoms (urgency, drainage, constant wet feeling, prickly, uncomfortable) which has made my life aweful. I figure that i will have to live like this for the rest of my life, increasing depression and diminishing thoughts of having a normal social and personal relationships. About three months ago, i started to develop early morning back pain. I was waking up 2-3 in the am and unable to lay down any longer. I would  get up and sleep sitting up on the couch or chair. I got to the point of going to see a chiropracter to se what was going on. It felt like there was a tendon that crossed my spine and needed to be put back where it needed to be. My back has been very tight and tender for a long time. Chiropracter saw me for 3 sessions and told me that there was no misallignment of my back and that he didnt feel further care would be benificial and that he couldnt help me. He told me to go to the doctor. So i make an appointment to go see the doctor this was a month ago. The day before I go into the doctor, my knee was aching. The next day it is swollen up a balloon. I have never had anything like this before. I went to my doctors appointment, just a random doctor, and she takes xrays of my knee and back. She says that these came back normal and that i should see my normal doc for a follow up. In the mean time to ice and elevate my knee. So a week later, i go to my doctor. He orders a bunch of rehmatology tests, crp, esr, lymes, rf, ccp, ana, and also another GC test. Also, a MRI was scheduled for my knee. I am already a known HLA B27 positive. MRI of knee was negative. all the other tests were negative (crp and esr were slightly elevated). But i was positive for chylamidia. At this point I was excited to finally have a positive for something!!! Doc puts me on 1g azithromycin and 7 days doxycycline. He says that I have reiters syndrome or reactive arthritis. its been 2 weeks now, and im not sure the antibiotics have worked at all. I still feel like i can feel the urethritis lingering around. Back to my knee. My left knee has been swollen since that day 1 month now. I had the fluid drained off of it and steroid injected, and it swelled back up the next day. Since then my 3rd toe on the left foot has been swollen up and is very sensitive. Makes it almost unbearable to walk. I try to keep stretching by legs as much as posible as they have become increasingly stiff, mostly the tendons behind my knee. I have my good days and bad days for sure. This is a very dehabiliitating disease as i am a very active person and i like to keep busy. I have never sat around on the couch as much as i have this past month. I am trying to stay positive, but it is difficult. I have missed out on many activities that i enjoy doing already, and fear I will miss more throughout the winter. Its hard enough to even go to work. And now, my other knee is starting to ache. But that is my story. It has been one month since my 3 likes, 23 replies "

Before last November I was a very physically active 34-year-old woman with a stressful career and busy social life.  It took 6 weeks to get a conclusive diagnosis, during which time I was the most ill I had ever been in my life with what I now know to be classic Reactive Arthritis symptoms - pain in all my joints and tendons from the hips down making walking more than 10 steps very difficult, extreme fatigue, inflammatory temperatures, mind fogs, sensation of a UTI, bloodshot red raw but weeping eyes, extreme dry mouth, trouble breathing etc. etc.   During those weeks, and once I received a diagnosis, I was terrified.  Terrified I'd never get better.  Terrified I'd never walk normally again. Terrified I'd never be able to go back to work.  Terrified I'd never be able to swim, or run, or dance again.  Terrified I'd never be able to have children.  The list went on.   I spent quite a lot of time in bed on the internet looking for answers, my faith in my doctors having been severely shaken by my experiences in the weeks without diagnosis of constantly being sent away, at best being told to rest and come back if things failed to improve, or at worse being looked at almost as if my symptoms were psychosomatic. I wanted to know:  Why had this happened to me?  (Answer, doctors never did establish the infection that triggered my immune system's inappropriate response.)  What was my prognosis? And what could I do to make myself better, as nothing doctors were giving me (anti-inflammatories and steroids) were doing much good?      I wanted to tell you all that, a year on, I am better.   It been a long road.  You'll all know how Reactive Arthritis works so as you can imagine there's been lots of ups and downs.  I was discharged by the consultant after 6 months but I'd say it's only the past few months I've started to feel 100%. Everyone is different and so what worked for me may not be the same for you but I thought I would share what I found helpful.   I read online that some people had found acupuncture helpful.  I've never held too much truck with alternative therapies, and was scared of needles.  But I was so desperate to try anything to get back to ""normal"" I booked an appointment with a Traditional Chinese Medicine Acupuncturist.  When the first needle went into my foot I felt a pleasant rushing sensation down my leg. Where there had been pain and discomfort was suddenly energised and I was converted.  I went weekly for months and I believe, along with time, and other changes detailed below, it has helped me to recover.    Once the flare ups started to get further apart, and I had a bit more energy between flares, I bit the financial bullet and joined a gym with a sauna and steam room.  I found the heat of the sauna especially helpful, both with the dreadful cold aches in my bones I had almost continually and with loosening the tendons in my legs.   About 3 months in I went to see a hydrotherapist and got a set of exercises I could do in the gym pool myself, which I tried to do once a week for just 10 minutes.   When I felt like I had more energy, about 4 months in, I cautiously started aqua aerobics classes once a week.  I told the instructor about my condition and she was brilliant and stopped me from overdoing it.  (The temptation to push myself too hard in an attempt to feel like I was normal again was something I have battled with during my recovery.)  Even though I struggled, had to take a lot of rests during the class, and hobbled out of the pool at the end, the sensation of having done something physical, however minor compared to what I used to do, was such a psychological boost. As my energy levels increased, I started to go to aqua aerobics a couple of times a week.  And then I found a very gentle   class, and started going to that too.  Although I had to block out the fact that I was clearly much, much less physically able than other people in the class that were more than twice my age, stretching the tendons in my legs seemed to help with my mobility a lot.  The yoga classes also helped me to quiet down the terror I felt. I read a lot about diet, and, although I didn't follow the strict elimination diet recommended by some, I did find there were certain things that did increased my inflammation: mainly red meat, sugar (both natural and processed) and caffeine so I avoided them (although wasn't puritanical).  Now having given up caffeine, I'm not going back!

I have been suffering from ReA in my left knee for approximately 2 months now with only minor improvements. The knee had swollen up to a huge size and I was forced onto crutches for about 4 weeks. After numerous hospital visits I was eventually kept in for 2 days for blood tests, MRIs, rheumatology appointments and physio. They came to the conclusion I must have developed ReA after a throat infection. I also had my knee drained of fluid twice and injected with steroids, which relieved nearly all symptoms for about a week. I left hospital 2 weeks ago and I am able to walk but the pain is constant and a return to sport is seeming quite far away. If anyone who has experienced similar could shed some light on how long this might last and any treatments I could try that would be great. 0 likes, 10 replies "

I have all the classic symptoms of ReA and I have been in and out of the doctors and specialist offices  for which I’m not able to get much resolution or a definite diagnosis.  Symptoms have been on and off for over six months, however this month has been the absolute worst as the constant neck pain along with the random rotation of joint pains in my fingers, toes, knees, elbows, prostate, blader, chest, abdomen... which comes and goes with a vengeance.  Obviously as most of you all, I have tested negative for any bactaerias or infections.  Currently I am on Cipro again and Hydrocodone for the pain. I was also taking Meloxicam for the inflammation however that amplified all the different pains. I was reading about a study that University of Southern California done where they found fasting for 3 -4 days resets the immune system. I was curious if anyone here has tried this or not as this seems it would help many of us here if fasting will actually reset our immune systems and make it stop attacking our bodies.  Thanks ~ JC  0 likes, 11 replies "

My Dr didn't really know what to do or know anything about ReA. She just gave me omazerpole to stop ibuprofen giving stomach ulcers. About 3 months after the original infection it then got bad.... the toes got in on the game properly along with the soles of the feet.

Though the first naproxen dose made me fall asleep within 45 minutes of taking it, and I think caused a mild 2 hour long euphoric mania, it worked like magic on the ReA. A week on and I no longer have foot pain when I wake up, and though I can feel the ReA lurking in the background, I've just spent a week in a forest retreat walking 5 plus miles a day without any issues. The ReA is not gone, but it's definitely managed by the naproxen, and I can do almost everything again.

Though the first naproxen dose made me fall asleep within 45 minutes of taking it, and I think caused a mild 2 hour long euphoric mania, it worked like magic on the ReA. A week on and I no longer have foot pain when I wake up, and though I can feel the ReA lurking in the background, I've just spent a week in a forest retreat walking 5 plus miles a day without any issues. The ReA is not gone, but it's definitely managed by the naproxen, and I can do almost everything again. I just take one dose of 500mg in an evening and it's enough to stave off the overnight inflammation. Currently awaiting the blood test results to see if there is a long term solution. The lactose intolerance also seems here to stay as a reminder of the gastroenteritis. I miss breakfast cereal with propper milk the most, and sometimes risk a vanilla slice then suck up the consequences because life's not worth living without the odd vanilla slice. 0 likes, 4 replies "

My main discomfort is in both knees. (constant tension that is helped with knee compression sleeves) and the head turmoil of not knowing if this will ever end. will i have to wear these daft compression things forever over my knees. I have a fear is the trigger still hidden in my body somewhere. Scared any sort of sexual activity will be another trigger even if i do get over these symptoms will it all come back again at the small nice gesture of a girlfriend giving me a handjob or me going down on her spike all the REA off again 😦 im taking doxy now to try and help as it helped for a while but now doesnt seem to be working. My next option might be for immuno suppresants. Does anyone have similar experience and fears about having a normal sex life ?

Being a Naturopathic Dr. myself, I couldn't allow myself to wallow in misery and do nothing to help myself. I hauled out my old textbooks to see what course of action might be advised. I knew that certain foods increased inflammation and immune reactivity. I decided to start off with an old-school water fast to help calm down the inflammatory cytokine activity. I'm used to intermittent fasting for about 19 hours per day, which helps increase one's tolerance. It also helps to eat ketogenically for a couple of days beforehand to get your body accustomed to burning your fat instead of glucose. First attempt, I managed 52 hours. 12 hours after eating, the pain came roaring back. I next managed a 5 1/2 day fast with some electrolytes ( potassium, magnesium,  and sea salt) in water. My body hit a wall at that point, so I broke the fast for 2 days. the pain increased again, so I did one final fast. The idea is to fast until 1-2 days after resolution of symptoms. I made it another 5 1/2 days. That seems to be the maximum my body can tolerate, and I was feeling very weak. The electrolytes were no longer helping. Time to stop. My pain was considerably better and stayed so this time as I carefully reintroduced foods. I researched the Autoimmune Paleo diet (AIP) to come up with a plan. I wanted to avoid any foods which were known to increase inflammation. I also saw a traditional Chinese (TCM) doc, who checked me over and declared that my case was no longer very severe,  but that I needed to build up my strength ( Kidney Qi in TCM language). Not really a surprise,  considering all the fasting. I had lost about 20 lbs in 2 weeks. It really helped the inflammation,  but it comes at a cost. I began eating the following foods: homemade bone broth with some organic bouillon mixed in for flavor. Well-cooked broccoli, kale, cauliflower, asparagus, steamed sweet potatoes, cinnamon, turmeric,  coconut oil. Canned health food store wild salmon. Fresh juices from beets, ginger, lemon, grapefruit together, or cucumber lemon kale ginger sometimes. Aroy-D coconut milk in tetrapaks mixed with chia seeds and frozen wild blueberries. Symptoms really improved and stabilized. I also added some chicken liver paté to help rebuild Qi, and raw walnuts. I also got 3 home visits from an RMT who does myofascial work. Helped a lot. On the last visit he used a Dolphin Neurostim on my back and neck acupuncture points. Amazing! I now only take ibuprofen at bedtime. I can walk around my neighborhood and do errands. If I eat inflammatory foods, I feel it. I still feel more fatigue than usual. I try to take it easy. But I'm functional again.

She thought it was a virus but did a swab anyway.  Over the next few days I noticed weakness, pain and swelling in my hands and knees, worse on the right side of my body.  The pain got so severe I could not stand or use my hands.  I went back to the GP and was told my swab tested positive for strep.  I was given a course of penicillin and told to take ibuprofen and co-codamol for the pain.  I was also given omeprazole to protect my stomach as I had gastritis a few years ago. The pain continued for 2 weeks, I had another course of antibiotics but it wasn't helping so I was admitted to hospital where I was diagnosed with Post Streptococcal Reactive Arthritis.  I was given stronger antibiotics and painkillers and a steroid injection (kenalog) and discharged.  I gradually improved over the next few weeks but then in October I got a chest infection and another throat infection.  3 weeks later the Reactive Arthritis flared up again.   I was referred to a rheumatologist who examined me and said there was nothing wrong with my joints.  He did lots of blood tests but they all came back negative except for a borderline strep count.  I was discharged back to my GP as the rheumatologist couldn't help me because my arthritis was caused by infections.  He said I needed investigations to find out why I was getting so many strep infections.  I went to see my GP but she said there is nothing they can do.  She said there is nothing wrong with my immune system because my blood tests are normal. I had another throat infection in January and another in March, both of which lead to reactive arthritis flare ups.  I am very fed up of being ill and in pain all the time.  The doctors don't seem to be taking me seriously at all and the only treatment I've been given is codeine and paracetamol for the pain. I would very much appreciate any help or advice.  Surely the medical profession can do more than just give me painkillers?  Thank you! Clair 2 likes, 10 replies "

I was refered to a Rhematologist , advised initial appoint ment could be up to a year so went private! The rhemy was a bit vague and thought it was Reactive Arthritis and sent me away with an anti inflamatory  drug and reduction plan for the pred. He said it should all settle down in about 6 months! when it didnt went back to see him ( NHS)had blood tests for various things , all negative. He did say I have fluid in my left leg. He was still a bit vague on the dx.  long story short. He discharged me a year later with no definitive dx. without telling me!

I was on omeperzole which was like the magic cure for 2 years after getting diagnosed, but when I had the flare up the medication stopped working... so I was put on 40 mg pantrozole which ended up working for awhile up until now. It’s like my body starts to become immune to the medications.. Currently I’ve had a flare up for 5 weeks. Coughing up lots of mucous, chest pressure, feel out of breath, sore throat and chest pain. Diet alone doesn’t make a change for me. I’m wondering if there any natural remedies or herbs anyone has taken that has helped them? I prefer not to be on these anti acid meds forever especially if they stop working. I’d rather find the root of the problem. I know stress and anxiety can act it up for me.. I just can’t keep going through these miserable flare ups that last months at a time, only to have my meds increased or changed which may or may not work. There’s gotta be something better that’s out there. I’m trying to do my research the best I can, but if anyone has gone through this and found relief please share. My symptoms are constant 24/7.

Sorry for the lengthy post. During September 2016 (4 months ago), I notice that my right Submandibular nodes (below right jaw, salivary gland) was swollen. It was painless and it is movable. I've had acid reflux since I was still in junior high school (currently 23 years old) and when I notice this lump, I instantly panicked and start searching on google (not a good idea). Since then I have went to 2 different ENT, 1 oncologist, and 2 different gastroenthologist. All of them said that it is not a concern. All of them is not concerned at all, however they also do not give me a clear expalantion. One of them said that perhaps the reflux may cause irritation on my throat that then cause mini infection that I may not feel. One of them said that perhaps it is due to my past tonsilitis infection (I have suffered from 8 bouts of tonsilitis on 2016-should probably get my tonsil removed ASAP). My acid reflux is not that bad. I seldom gets any heartburn; all that I feel is the globus / feeling like there's a lump in the base of my throat (since October 2016) and that whenever I want to burp / belch, the acid and some food contents comes back up to my throat. I also have constat post nasal drip and have to clear my throat all the time. My tongue is white but my throat and tongue seldom got burns from the acid reflux.  What drives me crazy is that 2 weeks ago I notice there's yet another lymph node pops up on the right side of my neck. It is also painless and movable, and it is rougly 1 - 1.5 cm. I am in full panic mode now and have think about bad case scenario (lymphoma, etc.).  I will go back to my gastro and oncologist doctor, but it will be around early February 2017. Can you guys please share if you have also encountered this problem with painless lymph node swelling with acid reflux / LPR?  Thanks guys! 4 likes, 25 replies "

It’s usually worse after eating and comes and goes. Burping doesn’t reallt relieve it. I’m just trying to figure out if this is just acid reflux or something more like a motility issue where my food isn’t going down properly. It started a two months ago just in my diaphragm and slowly moved up to my throat as well. The pressure is no longer as bad in my diapraghm but is still there at times especially after eating. My diet had been very bland this whole time but I am Able to eat more then I could in the beginning. I occasionally have heartburn but this feeling is different just a lump in the throat or pressure in the diaphragm like a trapped burp.  I also experience a lot of phlegm and pressure in my ears when I feel the lump in my throat. I just want to make sure it’s not something more the acid reflux so I don’t get back on a ppi unnecessarily.  0 likes, 26 replies "

Please help!,"Hello, This would be my second post on this website. I hope to get some advice as I am not sure what is wrong with me! For the past week, I have been experiencing this really strange pain in the breastbone area. It is extremely uncomfortable and sometimes very sharp. I feel like a lump in my throat however, I can still swallow food and drink. But my main concern is this very uncomfortable pain in the breastbone area. I have been to the Dr but he was not exactly sure what it is. He said it could be acid and gave me medicine. I am not too sure if it is acid. I really hope this pain goes away. If someone have similar experience or could advice me something, I would be extremely grateful. 0 likes, 5 replies "

I am a male, 57 yrs of age. I have had heartburn/indigestion on and off for years. For the past 6 months to a year I have regular bouts of severe burping/belching and acid reflux. I often feel bloated/uncomfortable in the upper stomach area even though I am not a heavy/big eater ( except on occasions when going out for meals - when the bloating/burping is worse ) I have just been diagnosed with a hiatus hernia after having an endoscopy, and am waiting to see my gp for medication. I have previously had a blood test for the Hpylori bug which came back negative, though the doctor took a biopsy during the endoscopy to check for it again. The doctor who carried out the endoscopy seemed to think that the hernia would not be the cause of my burping/belching - does anyone have any similar symptoms and possible remedies ? Prior to having the endoscopy I was on Omneprazole ( 20mg twice a day ) which had little, if any effect. This burping/belching/bloatedness is really getting me down - any advice/ remedies would be much appreciated, thanks. 5 likes, 67 replies "

I have had  5 gastroscopies over the years and several ENT scopes. I am awaiting manometry which has now been cancelled. I have tried several PPIs and H2RAs and had adverse effects from all of them ranging from burning stomach, erosive  , food sitting in my stomach for longer and causing reflux to shoot up the gullet and burn my throat  and the usual  , severe nausea etc The rebound from chopping and changing drugs has undone any good the medications could have done. Life is a daily struggle and has become unbearable recently because Gaviscon Advance which has been the only medicine to help me along with the Acid Watchers Diet has started burning my throat and my gullet. I thought at least a Rennie would help but even those have started to burn my gullet and cause heartburn. The pain has been so severe that it has made me cry.   and   very high. It is difficult to get a proper appointment with a doctor for obvious reasons and I am reluctant to go to A and E for the same reasons. I have been given Lansoprazole 30 mg to try again even though they caused my throat to get very sore and dry last time and caused ulcers in my mouth and I am worried this will exacerbate the problems I have with swallowing which are significant. Has anyone else had OTC  / alginates cause severe burning in throat and gullet or been in a similar situation as me? I am pretty desperate,  I feel that I have exhausted all forms of help and feel very frightened. Thank you. 0 likes, 12 replies "

It seems to go away when I lay down. It feels like an air bubble or burp is stuck in my throat. I’ve been on nexium for six weeks due to acid reflux but it doesn’t help with these symptoms. I also get pressure in my ears when this happens. Also this all started four months ago when I woke up with extreme pressure below my breastbone that caused me a lot of panic and I was unable to eat anything because of the discomfort. The pressure isn’t as bad in chest now but the lump in throat is bad and I don’t know if they are related like the pressure moved up into my throat. I also get burning pains and tenderness in my upper back and shoulder blades and sometimes feel it while I’m eating and drinking not afterwards. Has anyone had these symptoms and was it something other then acid reflux and did it finally go away? I’m really feeling depressed and hopeless that I will have to live like this for the rest of my life.  0 likes, 37 replies "

From April to Aug this year, my FT3 hovered around 7 (ref. 3.9 to 6.7) and FT4 was around 17 (ref 12 - 22). I didn't notice any symptoms at the time. I was on 150mg of ERFA thyroid. In Sept, my FT3 was 7.27 and FT4 was 18.1, and I started having some symptoms: trouble falling asleep, feeling very spacey, tight muscles, couldn't stop my brain from going round and round, dizziness. I reduced my ERFA to 142.5mg (reduced by one-quarter of a 30mg pill) on Sept 9. In October, I had to use an old supply of ERFA (due to the ERFA shortage in Canada), and got my last set of results on Oct 22. My FT3 is now 4.49 and my FT4 is now 14.3. Both are now too low in my opinion, and I still don't feel well. I guess my questions are: how can such a small drop in NDT make such a huge difference?  Could it have been because I had to use an old supply (it was about a year old).  I've been two weeks with new meds and now it feels as if I have both hyper and hypo symptoms depending on the time of day - hypo in the morning and hyper by early afternoon.  Is that possible? Any thoughts on what I should do? Also, has anyone tried desiccated PLUS a little synthetic, and did that work? 0 likes, 0 replies "

Paid privately to see a specialist who was happy to take my money and tell me I was going to have this for the rest of my life so ""Get used to it"" I felt SO BAD!!! depressed, looking for a miracle, prayed a lot! I really thought it was going to be the end of me. Anxious, unable to enjoy my life anymore knowing that this pain was going to be with me forever. The alternative medicine did help ease my pain but it didn't get rid of it. At the end of everyday my throat would be so sore. I've mentioned the probiotics and I was taking these for around 3-4 weeks before I started to notice a slight improvement. I was taking 2 x 3 billion good bacteria in tablet form about 30 minutes before my evening meal. I continued on this dose for months until a friend came over just before Xmas and handed me an un opened bottle of Acidophilus 20 billion. It may sound silly but in all the hours of research conducted It didn't dawn on me that I could up the strength. I started taking just one tablet before my main evening meal since Xmas. Gradually all  my symptoms have subsided, so much so I had 2 cans of a Cola yesterday and no issues at all. I had one just to test it and then another as I couldn't believe I wasn't experiencing any pain!! I'm not saying that this will be the silver bullet for everyone but for me by upping the strength has made such a MASSIVE IMPACT. I'm still in shock that I no longer have a sore throat, any feeling of swelling or difficulty swallowing. I wanted to share my findings as I know exactly what hell looks and feels like. Its not a quick fix and has taken several weeks to to get to this stage but they have really helped me. If you stumble by this post I hope that this information may assist. Good luck and if I experience any changes I'll come back and post again. 2 likes, 46 replies "

I don't know if anyone will see this but i thought i'd give it a shot anyways, as it has been worrying me.  I'll just get right into it.  I have had depression for the past few years, but over the past 6 months i've noticed it's been a lot worse, along with being unusually irritable.  More recently, over the past 5 days maybe, my symptoms have gotten a lot worse.  I've had sore and tense shoulders and hips, along with some cramps and weakness in my legs and knees, and a bit dizzy with headaches.  On top of this, my anxiety has been through the roof and i've been feeling very sluggish.  I finally saw a doctor today and she told me this all sounds like it could be caused by hypothyroidism.  Does that sound about right though ?  That seems like a bit much for hypothyroidism, I never thought it could cause that many problems !! If anyone has any thoughts i'd love to hear them, as this whole experience has been very frightening for me !!!  Thanks 😃) 0 likes, 9 replies "

I'm a 26 year old female who was diagnosed with Hashimoto's just a few years ago. Before I started out on 25mg of Levothyroxine, I was prescibed Zoloft for depression and health anxiety. I eventually started taking 50mg of Levo and then this past April I was upped to 75mg and was told to increase my iodine intake because I had gained weight and was lacking the iodine in my diet. All was good until October of this year. (I stopped taking Zoloft in August by the way) Two months after quitting Zoloft I found myself short of 12lbs in one week and ended up in the ER for palpitations, muscle spasms, and facial flushing. They said everything was fine and to check with my doctor. So I did. Doctor said I was having relapse of my depression and anxiety and I need to go back on Zoloft. A month later (being now) I have noticed that my mood is better but I'm still suffering from hightened anxiety, palpitations, a heartbeat that I can feel all day long (not fast but noticable beating), muscle spasms, joint pain in elbow and shoulder, insomnia most nights, no weight gain, indigestion, heartburn, dry mouth, weak muscles, and loose bowels. I also sweat at random times and feel cold too. So I went back to the doctor and they orderd an echo and all was normal. I have recently noticed that my thyroid is more swollen than usual and so I mentioned this to the doctor but she said my labs were all in normal range and put it to my anxiety.

So no need to try to warn me or make me feel any worse! Please respect my asking of this. Thank you. A few years ago I stumbled into a new doctors office after being prescribed Zoloft from another doctor  because I was having health anxiety and depression. I had new lab work done and was tested for my thyroid because he believes everyone should be tested. I was 23 years old and weighing at 110 when I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's. I thought this was crazy because I didn't have any weight gain or water retention, but I do remember being tired all the time and noticing clumps of hair in the shower. So started me off at 25mg of Levo along with Zoloft and said I could come off the anti-depressant once my thyroid levels were in normal range. So I agreed. A year passed and I found myself at 50mg of Levo. Everything was fine and I never suffered symptoms and that could be because of Zoloft numbing every part of me. Which I was okay with because Zoloft saved me from a dark hole. I was thriving in all aspects of life because of a happy pill. Another year goes by and I'm weighing 135. I was okay with this but my doctor suggested I go on 75mg of Levo because my periods became more lighter and my thyroid was a little swollen. So I did. That was April of this year. All went well until August when I stopped my Zoloft. I started noticing how I was losing weight but I thought it was the Levo working. Then I started getting anxiety, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, loose bowels, muscle spasms, elbow and shoulder joint pain, hand tremors, warm body temperature, no appetitie, and insonmia. I'm now down to weighing 110 while being in and out of the doctors office with normal thyroid levels. This can't be real because my periods are lighter again, my hair is falling out, I have acne, and my thyroid is swollen again. AND I LOST 25lbs  IN A MONTH. So I begged my doctor to listen to me because the heart palpitations were being an every night thing and when I didn't have them I could still feel my heart beating, a strong pulse in my chest, not fast but strong, which I also hear in my ears at night when I try to sleep. I told him I started a multivitamin a couple of months ago that I didn't notice had iodine in it and he said I was overmedicating myself and brought me down to 50mg of Levo. Has someone experienced being overmedicated before and for this long? I started the 50mg a few days ago and I'm wondering the pounding heart and loose bowels will go away? I'm struggling keeping anything in my stomach as it's constantly going straight through me and I don't want to lose anymore weight. I'm afraid my body is attacking my insides and burning fat instead. I've noticed I get dehydrated easier and constantly drinking water. Someone help and send positive my way! 0 likes, 11 replies "

I had new lab work done and was tested for my thyroid because he believes everyone should be tested. I was 23 years old and weighing at 110 when I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's. I thought this was crazy because I didn't have any weight gain or water retention, but I do remember being tired all the time and noticing clumps of hair in the shower. So started me off at 25mg of Levo along with Zoloft and said I could come off the anti-depressant once my thyroid levels were in normal range. So I agreed. A year passed and I found myself at 50mg of Levo. Everything was fine and I never suffered symptoms and that could be because of Zoloft numbing every part of me. Which I was okay with because Zoloft saved me from a dark hole. I was thriving in all aspects of life because of a happy pill. Another year goes by and I'm weighing 135. I was okay with this but my doctor suggested I go on 75mg of Levo because my periods became more lighter and my thyroid was a little swollen. So I did. That was April of this year. All went well until August when I stopped my Zoloft. I started noticing how I was losing weight but I thought it was the Levo working. Then I started getting anxiety, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, loose bowels, muscle spasms, elbow and shoulder joint pain, hand tremors, warm body temperature, no appetitie, and insonmia. I'm now down to weighing 110 while being in and out of the doctors office with normal thyroid levels. This can't be real because my periods are lighter again, my hair is falling out, I have acne, and my thyroid is swollen again. AND I LOST 25lbs  IN A MONTH. So I begged my doctor to listen to me because the heart palpitations were being an every night thing and when I didn't have them I could still feel my heart beating, a strong pulse in my chest, not fast but strong, which I also hear in my ears at night when I try to sleep. I told him I started a multivitamin a couple of months ago that I didn't notice had iodine in it and he said I was overmedicating myself and brought me down to 50mg of Levo. Has someone experienced being overmedicated before and for this long? I started the 50mg a few days ago and I'm wondering the pounding heart and loose bowels will go away? I'm struggling keeping anything in my stomach as it's constantly going straight through me and I don't want to lose anymore weight. I'm afraid my body is attacking my insides and burning fat instead. I've noticed I get dehydrated easier and constantly drinking water. Someone help and send positive my way! 0 likes, 11 replies "

Several visits to my GP later and I'm still not much further forward. I'm a 43 year old female. In October 2013 I was diagnosed hypothyroid and began treatment of 50mg levothyroxine per day. Because the bitter taste started relatively soon after beginning the medication, I put 2 and 2 together and thought it was causing the taste. But, no, I took myself off the medication for 3/4 weeks over Christmas and still had the bitter taste. I've drastically altered my diet as I thought certain foods made it worse but can't pinpoint one particular allergy or sensitivity....... I've changed toothpaste, tried mouthwash, cut out tea, milk, all dairy, and mainly eat very healthily - fruit, veggies and chicken. My GP suggested LPR (silent acid reflux) but it doesn't taste like 'acid' - it's just bitter/sour. I've been on Gaviscon after every meal for over a month and Ranitidine for almost 2 weeks. The symptoms persist still  My mouth can get quite dry, and the bitter taste seems to be on my tongue and/or the roof of my mouth or around a wisdom tooth on one side. I can't cope with this for much longer. It only eases up when either sleeping or eating. Anyone know what it is or has experiences anything similar please? Thank you xx  0 likes, 6 replies "

I am having abdominal pain because of the meds and the side effects later seem scary (e.g. preeclampsia, etc). They are also sending me to a high risk specialist which I am unsure about.

Weight gain, can't lose weight, dry skin etc etc. My question, does anyone have a problem with bleaching your hair. I have brown hair and have it stripped down to blonde with foils (highlighted). I can't get the color to bleach down to blonde anymore. I've tried 3 different times and its just not working anymore. I'm so very fustrated. It looks blonde right after done but as soon as I wash it, it looks brownish color. Does anyone have this problem? Does anyone think levo medication or thyroid problems could be the cause of this. I know your hair can thin out due to this condition but would it affect the highlighting or coloring your hair. Its bad enough I feel like crap about myself dealing with hypo now I have to deal with looking in the mirror and hating my hair. I know sounds vain and insignificant huh?

","So it all started in late December/early January. My roommates and I got flu-like symptoms. Fever, cough, mucus etc. Eventually we got over it. Or so I thought. Fast forward to the tail end of January (27-28th). Started developing slight vertigo. It would come and go throughout the day (I mostly noticed it in closed corridors or whenever I showered). The vertigo eventually went away however after a few days. Weird. Fast forward a week later, maybe the 8th of February. I started developing ear fullness, and crackling. It was dull but constant . Eventually I got slight facial tension on my cheeks as well. No paralysis but almost like a sunburn or my face being pulled back. I spoke to my mother in law who's a nurse. She checked my ears and noticed they were swollen but no fluid. She suggested Motrin and Sudafed. Maybe it was sinus issue? I used it for one week straight. Didnt work. Eventually the vertigo came back. And now it came back even stronger. This was like the 14th of February. I started freaking out. I would get lightheaded out of nowhere and feel like passing out. My head felt so swollen. Almost as if someone wrapped a belt around my head. So I go to urgent care thinking Im dying. They checked my blood sugar. It was fine. Hemoglobin. Okay. Blood pressure? A little high due to panic attack. The urgent care doctor runs a basic neuro test on me...my finger following her finger, eyes following her finger etc. She checked my eyes and ears and her conclusion was... Migraine. Migraine...I've had migraines before. This did not feel like it. She prescribed me Sumatriptan for headaches and Zofran for nausea. It did not help so a few days later I went to the physician (17th of February). Physician ran the same test as urgent care doctor however he concluded I had middle/inner ear infection due to a virus that stuck around since January. He prescribed me ear drops, Meclizine for vertigo and Ibropufen. Now its been a few weeks since my appointment.  My facial tension has slightly diminished.  My vertigo feels like its gone.  My eyes arent spinning anymore however I still have ear fullness and crackling.  Also i still have swollen swollen head feeling. That being said, the odd thing is even though some symptoms are diminishing, I feel like I'm developing new symptoms. It almost feels like I am drowsy, drunk. I get tired very easily. Like I need to put my head down during the day. Also my heart rate would spike randomly. I could be resting at 60bpm then all of a sudden it can go to 90bpm as soon I start thinking about it. The best way to describe the feeling is like I have low blood sugar with high blood pressure. Secondly, most dramatically I would get a throbbing sensation in hands and feet accompanied by cold sensations in my body with pins and needles.  Theyre dull sometimes but painful other times.  Almost like peripheral neuropathy or parenthesia. Also, I feel like I can hear my heartbeat at times and it feels like its pumping harder. Lastly I do have some slight back pain that comes and goes. So odd. I'd like to note that all these symptoms come and go throughout the day. Some hrs are better than others but still constant every day. Doctor likes to say that its my anxiety due to panic attacks. He says it put a lot of pressure on my nerves. But I'm not sure.  They 100% feel real. Its just so odd. I was perfectly fine leading up to the new year (working out 4 out of 7 days a week) then all of a sudden I'm having all these odd symptoms. Is the doctor right in saying this is an inner ear infection mixed with anxiety? Vestibular neuritis? Labyrinthitis?  Bad thyroid? Its on my mind everyday. Maybe thats why I feel so fatigued? 5'7 male 29 years old 175 lbs Filipino Mexican I'd like to note they did give me a blood test and I got a letter saying abnormal results but I didnt receive a phone call to come in.  In the letter they stated to just come in April, which is my follow up appointment.  I'm assuming if it was really bad they would have contacted me a while back Any advice would be amazing.

So odd. I'd like to note that all these symptoms come and go throughout the day. Some hrs are better than others but still constant every day. Doctor likes to say that its my anxiety due to panic attacks. He says it put a lot of pressure on my nerves. But I'm not sure.  They 100% feel real. Its just so odd. I was perfectly fine leading up to the new year (working out 4 out of 7 days a week) then all of a sudden I'm having all these odd symptoms. Is the doctor right in saying this is an inner ear infection mixed with anxiety? Vestibular neuritis? Labyrinthitis?  Bad thyroid? Its on my mind everyday. Maybe thats why I feel so fatigued? 5'7 male 29 years old 175 lbs Filipino Mexican I'd like to note they did give me a blood test and I got a letter saying abnormal results but I didnt receive a phone call to come in.  In the letter they stated to just come in April, which is my follow up appointment.  I'm assuming if it was really bad they would have contacted me a while back Any advice would be amazing.

Fast forward to the tail end of January (27-28th). Started developing slight vertigo. It would come and go throughout the day (I mostly noticed it in closed corridors or whenever I showered). The vertigo eventually went away however after a few days. Weird. Fast forward a week later, maybe the 8th of February. I started developing ear fullness, and crackling. It was dull but constant . Eventually I got slight facial tension on my cheeks as well. No paralysis but almost like a sunburn or my face being pulled back. I spoke to my mother in law who's a nurse. She checked my ears and noticed they were swollen but no fluid. She suggested Motrin and Sudafed. Maybe it was sinus issue? I used it for one week straight. Didnt work. Eventually the vertigo came back. And now it came back even stronger. This was like the 14th of February. I started freaking out. I would get lightheaded out of nowhere and feel like passing out. My head felt so swollen. Almost as if someone wrapped a belt around my head. So I go to urgent care thinking Im dying. They checked my blood sugar. It was fine. Hemoglobin. Okay. Blood pressure? A little high due to panic attack. The urgent care doctor runs a basic neuro test on me...my finger following her finger, eyes following her finger etc. She checked my eyes and ears and her conclusion was... Migraine. Migraine...I've had migraines before. This did not feel like it. She prescribed me Sumatriptan for headaches and Zofran for nausea. It did not help so a few days later I went to the physician (17th of February). Physician ran the same test as urgent care doctor however he concluded I had middle/inner ear infection due to a virus that stuck around since January. He prescribed me ear drops, Meclizine for vertigo and Ibropufen. Now its been a few weeks since my appointment.  My facial tension has slightly diminished.  My vertigo feels like its gone.  My eyes arent spinning anymore however I still have ear fullness and crackling.  Also i still have swollen swollen head feeling. That being said, the odd thing is even though some symptoms are diminishing, I feel like I'm developing new symptoms. It almost feels like I am drowsy, drunk. I get tired very easily. Like I need to put my head down during the day. Also my heart rate would spike randomly. I could be resting at 60bpm then all of a sudden it can go to 90bpm as soon I start thinking about it.

It did not help so a few days later I went to the physician (17th of February). Physician ran the same test as urgent care doctor however he concluded I had middle/inner ear infection due to a virus that stuck around since January. He prescribed me ear drops, Meclizine for vertigo and Ibropufen. Now its been a few weeks since my appointment.  My facial tension has slightly diminished.  My vertigo feels like its gone.  My eyes arent spinning anymore however I still have ear fullness and crackling.  Also i still have swollen swollen head feeling. That being said, the odd thing is even though some symptoms are diminishing, I feel like I'm developing new symptoms. It almost feels like I am drowsy, drunk. I get tired very easily. Like I need to put my head down during the day. Also my heart rate would spike randomly. I could be resting at 60bpm then all of a sudden it can go to 90bpm as soon I start thinking about it. The best way to describe the feeling is like I have low blood sugar with high blood pressure. Secondly, most dramatically I would get a throbbing sensation in hands and feet accompanied by cold sensations in my body with pins and needles.  Theyre dull sometimes but painful other times.  Almost like peripheral neuropathy or parenthesia. Also, I feel like I can hear my heartbeat at times and it feels like its pumping harder. Lastly I do have some slight back pain that comes and goes. So odd. I'd like to note that all these symptoms come and go throughout the day. Some hrs are better than others but still constant every day. Doctor likes to say that its my anxiety due to panic attacks. He says it put a lot of pressure on my nerves. But I'm not sure.  They 100% feel real. Its just so odd. I was perfectly fine leading up to the new year (working out 4 out of 7 days a week) then all of a sudden I'm having all these odd symptoms. Is the doctor right in saying this is an inner ear infection mixed with anxiety? Vestibular neuritis? Labyrinthitis?  Bad thyroid? Its on my mind everyday. Maybe thats why I feel so fatigued? 5'7 male 29 years old 175 lbs Filipino Mexican I'd like to note they did give me a blood test and I got a letter saying abnormal results but I didnt receive a phone call to come in.  In the letter they stated to just come in April, which is my follow up appointment.  I'm assuming if it was really bad they would have contacted me a while back Any advice would be amazing. Thank you so much.* 0 likes, 8 replies "

Levels were in range but on the low end. Then they decided to switch me to Synthroid, saying I may be able to absorb it better..( more potent?) so i was on that for 7 weeks, I was feeling better... not needing to sleep so much ( 10-12 hrs i was and still tired ) i started exercising 3-5x a week, biking and then more cardio once i got home and strength workouts ( light weights, squats etc)- TSH around 2, but my T3 was 2.3... still kinda low... so they increased it to 88mcg. 2 weeks later- first signs of  . lowered back to 75.  Symptoms got way worse... horrible panic attacks,- heart rate went up to 135 just from waking up from a nap! went to ER everything was fine.. happened again and went to ER 3 more times.. had they checked thyroid levels each time and said it's fine because I'm in range. but my tsh went from 2- 0.59 in about 1 month!? How is that fine? I feel like they changed everything to quickly....i had red flushing in my face, horrible anxiety and panic attacks... thyroid felt like it was so inflamed and swelling, nauseous, couldn't sleep for about a week and was also constipated, shaking tremors going out of my mind and I thought I was dying! I was so desperate I went to the psych unit at the hospital and they prescribe me Klonopin so I could go to sleep. they lured me back down to the original dos I was on and back on generic levothyroxine 50 micrograms. symptoms have gotten a lot better but I am far from normal, I have this weird feeling still in my thyroid like it's tightening up and my heart rate is still elevated. my resting heart rate was always in the 60s and now it's in the 80s sometimes 90s. And when I stand up it goes up to 120. today it went up to 1 30 just from going into the kitchen and continue to go up to the 140s and even 150. I find the more I move around and try to do the worse my heart rate gets and I have chest tightness can anyone help me please! 0 likes, 2 replies "

I literally signed up to this site to tell everyone.  I used an oil called taramera oil which my mum bought me. It’s a seed oil which is usually used for the scalp. I tried it on my anal itch and for the first time.. NO ITCHING DURING THE NIGHT!!!  For 3 godddd damnnn years I’ve itched every single day! Tried daktacort, hydrocortisone, and betamethasome  - which kind of made it more itchy on application and did nothingggg.  I’m absolutely amazed. I recommend this. Just try it once. It stings/tingles on application and smells reallly bad but it wears off after around 30 minutes.  I’ll update you guys on how long it lasts or if I need to keep putting some more on. But it’s been a day. I’m so happy!!! PLEASE TRY!!!  1 like, 1 reply "

I learned a few things during my journey that I wish I had read about when I was on this site seeking information when I leaned about my prostate cancer. I am here to share and hopefully make other’s journeys easier. I was diagnosed with very early stage cancer eighteen months ago. First thing I learned was during the biopsy. They numb the area on the colon where the procedure occurs, but that is not where you feel it. In hind sight it makes complete sense, but at the time I was freaked out when it hurt on the end of my junk. It’s not bad – just an awkward surprise. I did my research about treatments and the proton beam therapy seemed right for me – comfortable, not too invasive and minimizing collateral damage. A major hospital in my city was building one to open in the spring of the next year, and I focused on that. My urologist was not impressed by the procedure, emphasizing that it was no more effective than other options. He did not care about my reasoning (comfortable, not too invasive and minimizing collateral damage), perhaps because his practice and associated hospital did not offer it. Second lesson – get a second opinion. I am sooooo glad I did, but that happened later. At my request, he did give me a referral to a practice associated with the other hospital; they verified that I was a candidate for the proton beam and referred me to that team for when they were open for business. I stayed with my original urologist for the time being. Next step on the monitoring of my early stage cancer was the MRI and I had no problem with that. The results came back and my urologist was focused on the fact that I had bladder stones, and he can take of that. I read up on that and every line made me cringe. Next meeting, “don’t worry, you will be asleep.” I relented, and agreed to schedule it. Then he sprang it on me that he would need to go up and take a ‘look see’ first just to verify, and I would not be asleep for that. Says I – “you can tell me the size of these things, down to the centimeter. You need to verify?” “Yes.” He says, “I have to have a secondary verification before any procedure. We could do that with an ultrasound if you like.” Third lesson – there are options, you just have ask. Ultra sound and the procedure were scheduled. And then my world changed. I woke up one morning and I could not pee. That had happened three times before and I found that if I moved around, had some coffee and even a hot bath, things eased up. Not this time. Emergency room, Foley catheter and they took out a liter and a half of urine. There was a big nurse dude in the room and I found out later he was there to hold me down if need be. He was not needed – trust me, if you can’t pee and have to, you can put up with anything. They sent me back to my urologist who announced that it was a spasm, removed the cath and as I was able to void, sent me home. Three days later I was back in the emergency room, this time with the hospital that was building the proton beam. Fourth lesson – there are options for catheter tips. The first time it was a blunt tube being shoved through an impacted prostate (pain of childbirth), this second time it was a twisted tip that gently worked its way through (not pleasant but not as bad). Having been referred to that other urology group, I made an appointment to discuss. This time I was talking to a very different type of doctor. He is chief of both urology and non-invasive surgery at the hospital as well as being chair of urology at the medical school. He looked at my records and quickly identified a significant difference in prostate size from the biopsy to the MRI six months later. Three minutes digging into the MRI and he identified what my first urologist had missed – my prostate was not just getting larger and denser, it was growing an appendage up into my bladder. He gave me options – 1) he could go up through my junk and make things right, but probably have to do that again in a few years as it grows back, or 2) have the prostate removed with the DaVinci procedure.   Knowing that there was cancer to address, bladder stones to remove and not wanting to live in fear of future impacted prostate issues it was easy for me to decide – remove the prostate. Up to that point I had been scared away by chances of long term incontinence or needs for self-catheterization, but that possibility was not as bad as the certainty I was living. Fifth lesson – do your research to find the best possible doctor. I was shocked by how quickly I healed after the surgery. There were four small incisions spread out across my abdomen, and a smaller incision for drain tube. The surgery was over six hours (reconstructing the bladder and repairing an umbilical hernia), and I was sent home the next day after they got me up and walking. They tell you about Keagle exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles that need to replace the bladder control muscles that are removed with the prostate – do them! I wore a catheter for a week post-surgery, and within a week after that was removed I gave up the big boy pull-ups for pads, and within three weeks I no longer needed the pads. I bet most guys avoid prostate removal because of the fear of no more sex; I know that had been a concern of mine. Things are different – the prostate controls ejaculation and that will never happen again. My junk is smaller – the urethra goes through the prostate; they cut it above and below the prostate and stretch the urethra up to reattach it to the bladder. That length has to come from somewhere. The little blue pill can create an erection (I was prescribed a small dose of this daily after the operation to help blood vessels reattach). Sixth lesson to share – you can still have an orgasm; it’s different and better. It’s called a dry orgasm and it’s great. With a prostate, ejaculation ends it; without a prostate, it goes on and on and on. One of the few hopeful comments I read last year when I was here was a short one: “Guys, I am six months out from having the prostate removed. It is all good! Hang in there!” At eight months out, I agree. If you are here looking for answers, I hope my sharing has helped. I wish you all the best for the solutions that work for you. 1 like, 11 replies "

I have been taking propranolol 3x a week for 4 years at 20mg for each morning I go to work. I take it for social anxiety and panic attacks that I would have without them in the mornings I go to work and have meetings. At first it did wonders for me and the only side effects were my concentration was a bit down but I was relaxed and in no way anxious. As of the last two months the drug has really been wearing me down and I have been having really bad side effects such as shortness of breath, my body is tense, I feel like I’m about to cry and I can’t concentrate on a single thing and I am in no way relaxed as I was before. Honestly I am way more anxious on them but I don’t have a panic attack or go red in the face but just feel like a zombie on them now. I went to the doctor about this and I was persistent about changing to something else but all they said was it’s the safest drug out of them all and the best way to approach it was to lower down to 10mg that has done nothing and the side effects are at the same level of intensity. On some days the side effects won’t be that bad maybe 10% of the time but the other 90% I feel like the whole world is collapsing on me. Has anyone experienced this? I have tried many ways in taking it and can’t find a way to lessen the side effects or know how. I.e taking before breakfast , taking after breakfast none makes a difference. Is it possible taking it as soon as I wake up isn’t good for me? Also isn’t the shortness of breath symptom something to worry about ? 0 likes, 1 reply "

A trip  back in time. ,"As many here know, I am a big fan of the Coloplast Speedicath, a single use hydrophillic catheter. That said, I recently ordered some red rubber samples to try out.  The idea was that if I ever ran out of Speedicath's, it might be a good idea to have some red rubbers at home, since they are reusable. I'm not a stranger to red rubbers, since they were the ones my first cath PA gave me. But it's been awhile. It's actually been quite awhile, so long awhile that after awkwardly lubing the tip, I tried a ""dive bomb"" only to remember that red rubbers don't dive bomb, not stiff enough. Me bad. So that catheter went into the sink for future cleaning. Then I remembered that unlike with the Speedicath's I needed to thread the red rubbers in using my hand. Hand washing should be sufficient, but after using a no-touch dive bomb for all these years, the idea of touching the catheter didn't sit well, so I hunted around for a pair of surgical gloves and fortunately found a few in the back of my supply case. They were not in a sterile pack, so I generously doused them in hand sanitizer, probably not the best idea since alcohol can sting, but that's what I did. So then I tried again, and things finally worked as they should, just a lot slower with a lot more steps, and of course with external lube. I definitely will keep some red rubbers around for the eventuality that one day I might run out of the single use Speedicaths, perhaps not packing enough in a travel situation, but I don't look forward to using them at all. The stiffer single use hydrophillic catheters like Speedicath have spoiled me. That said, practice makes perfect, and I'm sure if I kept at it, things would go smoother and faster with the red rubbers. And if I didn't have insurance to cover the hydrophilics, red rubbers might become my first choice. Jim 2 likes, 11 replies "

In other words, I have constant urinary urges 24/7... It has been this way for one week. I don't have any pain or discomfort in my pelvic area, and there is no burning sensation during urinating. However, I feel as if the urine is at the tip of my penis - that is where the urge sensation is most prevalent. If I hold it for a long time and it accumulates, there is quite a lot of urine. However, most of the time (especially in the middle of the night) hardly anything comes out even though it feels so urgent. I can't sleep since it feels like I have to urinate constantly... last night I was going every 5 minutes, and most of the time only a few drops came out. I am having   now because of this. I went to the urologist last Tuesday (2 days in). Urinanalysis showed no UTI and bladder ultrasound was okay. However, during the rectal exam, he said my prostate was ""off"" and did a test of the urine that came out after the exam. At that point, I was told that I had a prostate infection and that the enlarged/inflamed prostate was causing the frequency. In other words, there was bacteria. I was given 500 mg of Levaquin to take once a day for 30 days. However, it has not helped after 6 doses. I'm trying Motrin (ibuprofen) to no avail. I was told it takes a while for the antibiotic to reach the prostate. I have no  , and no chills. I am terrified that I have the chronic pelvic pain (CPP) form of prostatitis. However, I don't know if I do, since (1) there WERE bacteria present upon running the urine after the rectal exam and (2) I have ZERO PAIN. The only symptom is the 24/7 need to urinate. Any ideas on this? I hope I have the acute prostitiis form since this is cured with more antibiotics, but if I have the lifelong CPP form I don't know what to do... I feel like I will have to quit my job since I can't sleep with the need to urinate. Please help! 4 likes, 280 replies "

Has this happened anyone else or is this just me, I thought all the side effects would have left long ago! 0 likes, 4 replies "

Started a 3rd oral antibiotic on the 22nd that showed bacterial sensitivity.  By this time, my right testicle had swelled up to the size of a grapefruit, very painful.  On the 24th I woke up with a 101.6 F fever.  The infection was so advanced, I had to go into the ER (right in the middle of CIVID-19 outbreaks) at 4:00 am.  They started me on IV antibiotics, and I spent 4 days and 3 night in the hospital to get the infection under control.  3rd day in the hospital, the x-ray tech put in a PICC line (right arm catheter through a vein to just above the right ventricle) so that I could be discharged and get IV antibiotics daily at home. While in the hospital, the urologist wanted to do a pee test.  Out comes the 4th catheter.  I can pee about 100 ml every 15 minutes, but my retention is still about 300 ml.  Urologist wants to cath me again. 2 nurses try to get a cath in, no luck.  The urologist comes in to ""install"" the cath.  He had to use what looked like a stainless steel coat hanger in the catheter to get past my prostate into the bladder.  My worst experience in 63 years, So, I am home now with the urinary cath in. I have my PICC line to get IV antibiotics.  I'll go in to the urologist's office at 35 days post op to try and pee again, probably.  If I need cathing, I'll ask about intermittent self cathing to get away from constant catheter and more infections. Anybody else had similar experiences with Rezum? 0 likes, 2 replies "

I am concerned that I am experiencing heart problems. ,"I am 18 years old. Ive been taking birth control for about 3 months and just about 4 weeks ago i began taking the medication without water, that is until i noticed i felt discomfort in my throat. Feeling anxious (i have diagnosed anxiety), i decided to visit an urgent care down the road (8/21) because i was concerned that the birth control pills, in which i had failed to take with water, had gotten lodged in my esophageal lining. The PA suggested that i had acid reflux so he prescribed Omeprazole  for 10 days and had also determined during questioning that i was not allergic to it. So, as soon as i picked up my prescription from the pharmacy i took one pill, then ate a little something with it. Because of my anxiety, i tend to read into the precautions and side effects of medications and thats what i did with the pamphlet for the Omeprazole. I also, as many hypochondriacs would, researched online the side effects of this drug. About 15 min after taking the medication, i began to feel a numbing on the left side of my neck and face. I didnt think much of it at all, although i did look into the pamphlet and didnt see this as a severe reaction because i did not have a rash. Later that night i was at work (at Dunkin' where im on my feet) and while i was closing up i began to feel shortness of breath and back pain. Shortness of breath was mentioned as a severe reaction to Omeprazole in pamphlet and back pain i saw somewhere online. Of course i was very concerned but i thought the back pain was just the 3 1/2 shift i had just worked. Every night since Sunday 8/18 ive felt overwhelming anxiety in which i had shortness of breath and a feeling of a lump in my throat so maybe the difficulty breathing was just that. The next day (8/22)  i still felt nervous about my condition. I was feeling shortness of breath, heart palpitations, and my upper back hurt. Again, i went to urgent care and explained my symptoms but also mentioned that i have anxiety and it was determined that i should stop the Omeprazole, probably because it would make me feel better to know i had stopped what was causing me to worry. After I got home my left arm began to hurt so my first thought was, ""Great, am i going to have a heart attack?"" I had read some study in which it was found that patients taking PPI's had an increased risk of having a heart attack. I guess i am wondering if its from prolonged use of PPI's or if its possible that one dose could do this. Some of the symptoms ive been feeling too Im hoping to be just my anxiety working agaisnt me and that i am making myself think i have it bad. Even that night at work i felt my stomach hurt in a way and i thought something was wrong and i instantly thought i was possibly having a heart attack so my breathing became heavy and short, my heart began racing, i had difficulty swallowing, and i felt nauseous. It did however go away after a bit when i kind of forgot about it. That is why i think its my anxiety. Even today (8/23) i was driving with my best friend and i all of a sudden felt shortness of breath and a racing heart. I was on the expressway so i can see why that would make me stressed but i also drive on the expressway all the time and i normally feel fine. Though, when we parked, i began to calm down and walking around the store made me feel a bit better. I only felt the same panic when i got back to driving.

About a year ago, I had my first really bad experience of symptoms associated with GERD and my sleep became absolutely terrible. The extreme symptoms subsided after two or so weeks, but the bad sleep lasted for months. My doctors kept telling me it was just my anxiety. After three months, I started pepcid to manage symptoms for about a month, and was eventually switched to pantoprazole because the pepcid wasn't quite cutting it. I also had a stomach ultrasound and EDG. Ultrasound revealed a mildly enlarged prostate, EDG revealed mild GERD. Because the GERD was ""mild"" at the time, I was told to wean off of pantoprazole and started taking one every other day, before wiping it out completely. I lasted about a month before symptoms started getting severe again, and sleep issues came back. I am now back on pantoprazole daily, but now I fear it's affecting my prostate as prostatitis/BPH symptoms are getting worse. I too have really bad anxiety and am somewhat of a hypochondriac, as I've discovered many on this site experience as well. I found this NIH article online   and now I'm worried that the pantoprazole is negatively affecting my prostate. As for IBS - I've experienced some symptoms, but I've found that its largely dependent on what I eat. When it's more of a meat-filled diet, no IBS. When I eat a high fiber, veggie diet, super IBS. I do need to be more strict with my diet and will go back to totally wiping out alcohol and my GERD triggers, and once again wean off of pantoprazole.

I have taken Lansoprazole in the past when my GERD has flared up and had no problems with it. My GERD started to flare badly about a month ago, probably because I hadn't been taken so much care with my diet and been a bit indulgent, which was my own fault. When my symptoms started to flare (feeling of something stuck in my throat, difficulty swallowing), I whipped out the Lansoprazole and started taking 30mg a day as the symptoms were quite bad. This usually settles everything down after a few days. After about a week things did start to ease but on about day 10 of taking it my mouth suddenly became extremely dry to the point i was struggling to talk and eat. I spoke to my GP and he didn't seem to think it would be the Lansoprazole. Anyway, it got so bad I decided to stop taking it altogether. The dry mouth gradually improved but my GERD symptoms returned with vengence so I decided to start taking the Lansoprazole again but at the lower dose of 15mg. My GERD symptoms again started to improve but on day 8 of taking it the severe dry mouth has returned and its so bad. I spoke to a different GP and they also didn't think it could be the Lansoprazole, even though its listed as one of the common side effects on the medication leaflet. I really don't know what to do as have never experienced this in the past when taking Lansoprazole but I cant see what else it would be as I've changed nothing else and no other medications.

I didn't even have a problem with acid reflux prior to this medication, I was put on it because the doctor thought it might help for undiagnosed stomach pains! I stopped the drug after just 2 weeks because it didn't help the pains. Ironically after I stopped the drug is when I started having acid reflux (approx. 4-5 days after I stopped it). I didn't taper off because the doctor said there is no risk for acid rebound as I wasn't on it long enough. Well now it's over 6 months since I initially stopped it and I still have reflux (chronic). It's always best when I wake up in the morning, then the more I eat / drink, the worse it gets. By bedtime it's unbearable. In desperation I have went back on it briefly for 1-2 weeks at a time, a couple of times during this 6-7 months time frame in hope for some relief but it never fully removes the reflux. I was told rebound lasts usually 2-3 weeks, but no more than 3 months and I was completely off it for 3-4 months, and only took Pepcid, and I still had the reflux. I just cannot get rid of it and I believe Omeprazole caused it to start. I should never have been put on this medication but I trusted the doctor (big mistake!). Now someone has told me there have been extreme cases where the rebound stuck around for 6 months, even after short term use. Is that really true? I cannot find any info on it. So the doctor forced me to go try the medication again, or he would not let me undergo any further diagnostic tests (my country uses public healthcare so I cannot just pay for the tests, I have to just take what I'm offered). He told me try to up the dose to 40 mg. At this time I had been off it for about 4 months and only managed by taking Pepcid. So I went on it for 2 weeks and then he said since it's not helping, you can either stop it or up it to 80 mg a day. I refused to increase it further as I think it was already a mistake to go back on it at all, so I started to taper off the medication slowly. So after eating 40 mg a day for 2 weeks, I've been eating 20 mg for one week. As of today I am trying one week where I open the capsule and remove approx. half of the contents (if I can stand it, the reflux was terrible last night). I also don't fit the criteria for people suffering from reflux due to poor lifestyle. I'm not overweight (actually the opposite), I never drank alcohol, never smoked, I don't eat spicy foods or greasy fried foods. Since the reflux started I have also removed all acidic foods like citrus fruits, tomatoes, etc. Nothing helps. I have had nearly every test under the sun. Been probed from top to bottom, three upper endoscopies, two colonoscopies, capsule endoscopy, CT scan, 24 hour impedance pH reading, Heidelberg acid test, EKGs, countless blood tests, several fecal tests, biopsied for h. pylori and celiac's disease on three separate EGDs (all came back negative), Crohn's disease, IBD, etc etc. Nothing that could be tied to acid reflux has been found. The only test remaining is a SmartPill motility test which is supposed to record the pH levels of the stomach and I am having that at the end of March, so I have to be completely off Omeprazole by then anyways. Do you think this is acid rebound, just a very extreme case of it? Why else would it start right after I initially stopped the drug? Like I said I never had acid reflux before this! What should I do?? This has to stop, I cannot go on like this! Should I try to stop the PPI completely and be off it for 6 months, and maybe it will finally go away? What else can I do? Is going around with this for 6 more months a bad idea? How do I manage? I've tried antacids like Pepto Bismol, Gaviscon (doesn't work at all plus gives me terrible stomach pains and diahrrea), Ranitidine, etc. Also natural remidies like apple cider vinegar doesn't work. The only thing that has worked somewhat is Pepcid but now I have to take the stronger one (Pepcid AC, 20 mg) for any kind of relief.  Will reduce the chances of the rebound to ever go away? In other words, is taking Pepcid every day counterproductive for the rebound to finally go away? Even when I take Pepcid AC, I still have reflux but not quite as strong. I am worried about what harm this does to my esophagus if I don't do anything to protect my throat from the acid. This has to stop and to me it seems it must be an extreme case of rebound, why else would it start right after stopping the medication, when I never had reflux in my entire life before starting this med? Please any suggestions are welcome, this is living hell for me.

In desperation I have went back on it briefly for 1-2 weeks at a time, a couple of times during this 6-7 months time frame in hope for some relief but it never fully removes the reflux. I was told rebound lasts usually 2-3 weeks, but no more than 3 months and I was completely off it for 3-4 months, and only took Pepcid, and I still had the reflux. I just cannot get rid of it and I believe Omeprazole caused it to start. I should never have been put on this medication but I trusted the doctor (big mistake!). Now someone has told me there have been extreme cases where the rebound stuck around for 6 months, even after short term use. Is that really true? I cannot find any info on it. So the doctor forced me to go try the medication again, or he would not let me undergo any further diagnostic tests (my country uses public healthcare so I cannot just pay for the tests, I have to just take what I'm offered). He told me try to up the dose to 40 mg. At this time I had been off it for about 4 months and only managed by taking Pepcid. So I went on it for 2 weeks and then he said since it's not helping, you can either stop it or up it to 80 mg a day. I refused to increase it further as I think it was already a mistake to go back on it at all, so I started to taper off the medication slowly. So after eating 40 mg a day for 2 weeks, I've been eating 20 mg for one week. As of today I am trying one week where I open the capsule and remove approx. half of the contents (if I can stand it, the reflux was terrible last night). I also don't fit the criteria for people suffering from reflux due to poor lifestyle. I'm not overweight (actually the opposite), I never drank alcohol, never smoked, I don't eat spicy foods or greasy fried foods. Since the reflux started I have also removed all acidic foods like citrus fruits, tomatoes, etc. Nothing helps. I have had nearly every test under the sun. Been probed from top to bottom, three upper endoscopies, two colonoscopies, capsule endoscopy, CT scan, 24 hour impedance pH reading, Heidelberg acid test, EKGs, countless blood tests, several fecal tests, biopsied for h. pylori and celiac's disease on three separate EGDs (all came back negative), Crohn's disease, IBD, etc etc. Nothing that could be tied to acid reflux has been found. The only test remaining is a SmartPill motility test which is supposed to record the pH levels of the stomach and I am having that at the end of March, so I have to be completely off Omeprazole by then anyways. Do you think this is acid rebound, just a very extreme case of it? Why else would it start right after I initially stopped the drug? Like I said I never had acid reflux before this! What should I do?? This has to stop, I cannot go on like this! Should I try to stop the PPI completely and be off it for 6 months, and maybe it will finally go away? What else can I do? Is going around with this for 6 more months a bad idea? How do I manage? I've tried antacids like Pepto Bismol, Gaviscon (doesn't work at all plus gives me terrible stomach pains and diahrrea), Ranitidine, etc. Also natural remidies like apple cider vinegar doesn't work. The only thing that has worked somewhat is Pepcid but now I have to take the stronger one (Pepcid AC, 20 mg) for any kind of relief.  Will reduce the chances of the rebound to ever go away? In other words, is taking Pepcid every day counterproductive for the rebound to finally go away? Even when I take Pepcid AC, I still have reflux but not quite as strong. I am worried about what harm this does to my esophagus if I don't do anything to protect my throat from the acid. This has to stop and to me it seems it must be an extreme case of rebound, why else would it start right after stopping the medication, when I never had reflux in my entire life before starting this med? Please any suggestions are welcome, this is living hell for me. I am really, really desperate and the doctors are now telling me I just have to live with this, they refuse to help me. 0 likes, 8 replies "

I am wondering if I am cleaning too much though? I have 2 questions: I saw a dermatologist a few weeks back who gave me pretty decent advice. She advised me to 'calm things down a bit'. She told me to never wipe 'inside' the anus (beyond the external sphincter), and after a bowel motion to apply an emollient  cream after gently washing with water.

Ive been to 3 gastros, had a   (all fine) , 2 anoscopys and 1 high resolution anoscopy. Ive been using corticosteroids for the itch, which has helped, but the pressure remains. My anus is red, which is probably relatively normal, but the pressure feeling remains despite doctors all telling me its nothing. To try and rid myself of this pressure, i put hydrocortisone 2.5 on and inside my anus to see if reducing the swelling from internal hemorrhoids were the culprit, that just resulted in an extreme burning sensation for at least 20 minutes. What is going on? Should i just eat more fiber and leave them alone? Could it be a skin cancer or something not visible through anoscopy or colonoscopy? My urologist said my PSA prostate levels are fine, so I can probably rule out prostate trouble. Maybe its just pelvic floor pain from all the stress?

For 5 days I had diarrhoea and vomiting non-stop, to the point, that all I had left was some strange mucus passing through my bowels. During this period of sickness, I visited the doctors for help, and they prescribed an anti-biotic, which 4 years later i’ve discovered was the worst possible thing for me. I appreciate that what caused my Pruritus Ani might be different to others, but the way I overcome it might work for many of you sufferers. What I tried Soon after my sickness bug I started getting a burning sensation and pain after every bowel movement, which was really uncomfortable for a few hours after.  At the time I was wearing skinny jeans all the time, which didn’t help the situation as there was no air getting into the area and I was causing friction as I was moving. Over time the burning and pain became worse, but then the itching started, which is where I really struggled. I cant begin to tell you how this has affected my life.  I love playing golf and football, but found I could only play these sports at 5pm when the pain and itching had calmed down.  The only positive that came with this condition for me was around 10 hours after a bowel movements it became bearable again, but if I had 2-3 movements a day it would ruin the whole day for me. Above all simple games, tasks and walks with my young children was hard to enjoy and that started making me depressed, because I couldn’t be the father I wanted to be for them. My biggest problem was all of my bowel movements were slimy or soft, which meant I could never get clean, I had to return to the toilet 2-3 times to clean myself, which is hard work when your out and about. So in the last 4 years I have tried this….. Cotton wool balls in the area to keep dry and stop friction Wearing shorts EVERY day Wearing lose underwear Portable Bidets Showering after the toilet (not easy out and about) Anti fungal Talc About 5 anti fungal creams 2-3 Pro biotic creams Anti biotic creams About 8-9 steroid creams (always made it worse) Operation to remove fissures Operation to band haemorrhoids About 10 other creams (I promise this is not exaggerated) Excercise Change of diet at least 10 times Ice baths Warm baths Hot baths Bath salts Ice Packs Pain Killers Anti fungal tablets - terbanifine Keffer Milk Pro biotic supplements Fibre drinks Physlium husk and about 5 other types of supplements I’ve probably tried other things to destroy this hideous condition, and I’m sure there were times when I was trying about 5 of the above at the same time Frustratingly none of them worked, so about 3 months ago I accepted my fate and gave up.  I continued using Aveeno cream, as this was the only natural cream that gave me a tiny bit of relief. I decided my lifestyle would have to accommodate Pruritus Ani I.e. exercise, sports and activities with my children would be really difficult but I would try and do them in the evening when things were a bit calmer.  The itching, burning and pain was just part of me now and so be it. The cure About 3 weeks ago, the condition got much much worse, bleeding, pain, constant itching.  Now i’ve always suspected my diet was a contributor as you will see above, I tried multiple diets and it was diet!!! After seeing 4 specialists in gastro, bowels etc I was always ending up at dermatology, who kept prescribing creams. So during this particularly nasty period, it just dawned on me that I had a couple of beers and quite a bit of carbonated drinks (Coke Zero) and coffee along with 2 take aways. I would usually drink water throughout the day and wine was usually my choice of alcoholic drink and I rarely eat take aways. This prompted me to see a nutritionist, as in the back of my mind i’ve always known my diet was causing this, but didn’t want to accept it as it would mean a big change, especially with wine, which I love. This is by far the best £140 I have spent in my life (£90 for my consultation and £50 for supplements) The challenge for me is I like fried food, processed food, wine, bread, cheese all the amazing things.  So if you want to try what i’ve done, then you need to commit to saying goodbye to all of these to start with. So in a nutshell, the nutritionist straight away diagnosed  an inflammable gut, more than likely caused by all the bacteria leaving my system in 2014 after my sickness bug and then the anti biotic killing off any remaining bacteria, which has caused a massive imbalance, which i’ve never repaired. This has been a complete miracle.  All i’ve done in the last 5 days is change my diet to an anti inflammatory diet and I’m 100% completely cured IN 5 DAYS!!!! I will of course have to maintain this diet, and it can be a bit challenging at times, especially as I’m writing this on a Friday evening in the sunshine about to go home to the garden and watch my wife have a glass of wine without me. I will re-introduce some naughty foods and drinks (wine) in a couple of months, but only in moderation. The foods that the nutritionist told me to eat were…. Canned Oily Fish Olive Oil Coconut oil Berries (blueberries, strawberries etc) Green Leaves (spinach, kale etc) Tomatoes Beetroots Walnuts/Almonds These all combat inflammation. So I’m incorporating all of the above into my meals with other anti inflammatory foods.  Here is a typical day for me now Breakfast - Plain porridge with flax seeds, crushed walnuts and blueberries OR Scrambled egg with tomatoes and spinach Snack - Peanut butter and apple and a natural yogurt Lunch - Salad with oily fish or Vegetable soup (home made) Snack - orange, plum, peach Dinner - Turkey/Chicken/Salmon with carrots, sweetcorn, peas, broccoli etc I’ve done that for 5 days and I have zero symptoms and even a knee problem i’ve had for 3 months has completely disappeared (also historically inflamed) I walked out of the nutritionists at first complaining to myself that I cant stick to this, I don’t have time to make soups and prepare food for work or eat every 3 hours and not snack past 9pm, its too difficult.  I work 12 hours a day and have a busy family home as well.  However I didn’t give up this time,  I’ve found the time and if I can anyone can. Im sure some of you will read this and think, its not my diet and even if it is I cant make these changes they are too difficult.  Take it from someone who has tried that huge exhausted list above and gave up multiple times trying to cure this, I cant stop smiling now. I have been to the toilet three times today and wiped with normal tissue paper and used NO creams, I took a 2 mile walk in the baking sun and I have no itching or burning. If anyone wants to ask me any questions please feel free.  2 likes, 13 replies "

The cure About 3 weeks ago, the condition got much much worse, bleeding, pain, constant itching.  Now i’ve always suspected my diet was a contributor as you will see above, I tried multiple diets and it was diet!!! After seeing 4 specialists in gastro, bowels etc I was always ending up at dermatology, who kept prescribing creams. So during this particularly nasty period, it just dawned on me that I had a couple of beers and quite a bit of carbonated drinks (Coke Zero) and coffee along with 2 take aways. I would usually drink water throughout the day and wine was usually my choice of alcoholic drink and I rarely eat take aways. This prompted me to see a nutritionist, as in the back of my mind i’ve always known my diet was causing this, but didn’t want to accept it as it would mean a big change, especially with wine, which I love. This is by far the best £140 I have spent in my life (£90 for my consultation and £50 for supplements) The challenge for me is I like fried food, processed food, wine, bread, cheese all the amazing things.  So if you want to try what i’ve done, then you need to commit to saying goodbye to all of these to start with. So in a nutshell, the nutritionist straight away diagnosed  an inflammable gut, more than likely caused by all the bacteria leaving my system in 2014 after my sickness bug and then the anti biotic killing off any remaining bacteria, which has caused a massive imbalance, which i’ve never repaired. This has been a complete miracle.  All i’ve done in the last 5 days is change my diet to an anti inflammatory diet and I’m 100% completely cured IN 5 DAYS!!!! I will of course have to maintain this diet, and it can be a bit challenging at times, especially as I’m writing this on a Friday evening in the sunshine about to go home to the garden and watch my wife have a glass of wine without me. I will re-introduce some naughty foods and drinks (wine) in a couple of months, but only in moderation. The foods that the nutritionist told me to eat were…. Canned Oily Fish Olive Oil Coconut oil Berries (blueberries, strawberries etc) Green Leaves (spinach, kale etc) Tomatoes Beetroots Walnuts/Almonds These all combat inflammation. So I’m incorporating all of the above into my meals with other anti inflammatory foods.  Here is a typical day for me now Breakfast - Plain porridge with flax seeds, crushed walnuts and blueberries OR Scrambled egg with tomatoes and spinach Snack - Peanut butter and apple and a natural yogurt Lunch - Salad with oily fish or Vegetable soup (home made) Snack - orange, plum, peach Dinner - Turkey/Chicken/Salmon with carrots, sweetcorn, peas, broccoli etc I’ve done that for 5 days and I have zero symptoms and even a knee problem i’ve had for 3 months has completely disappeared (also historically inflamed) I walked out of the nutritionists at first complaining to myself that I cant stick to this, I don’t have time to make soups and prepare food for work or eat every 3 hours and not snack past 9pm, its too difficult.  I work 12 hours a day and have a busy family home as well.  However I didn’t give up this time,  I’ve found the time and if I can anyone can. Im sure some of you will read this and think, its not my diet and even if it is I cant make these changes they are too difficult.  Take it from someone who has tried that huge exhausted list above and gave up multiple times trying to cure this, I cant stop smiling now. I have been to the toilet three times today and wiped with normal tissue paper and used NO creams, I took a 2 mile walk in the baking sun and I have no itching or burning. If anyone wants to ask me any questions please feel free.  2 likes, 13 replies "

For 5 days I had diarrhoea and vomiting non-stop, to the point, that all I had left was some strange mucus passing through my bowels. During this period of sickness, I visited the doctors for help, and they prescribed an anti-biotic, which 4 years later i’ve discovered was the worst possible thing for me. I appreciate that what caused my Pruritus Ani might be different to others, but the way I overcome it might work for many of you sufferers. What I tried Soon after my sickness bug I started getting a burning sensation and pain after every bowel movement, which was really uncomfortable for a few hours after.  At the time I was wearing skinny jeans all the time, which didn’t help the situation as there was no air getting into the area and I was causing friction as I was moving. Over time the burning and pain became worse, but then the itching started, which is where I really struggled. I cant begin to tell you how this has affected my life.  I love playing golf and football, but found I could only play these sports at 5pm when the pain and itching had calmed down.  The only positive that came with this condition for me was around 10 hours after a bowel movements it became bearable again, but if I had 2-3 movements a day it would ruin the whole day for me. Above all simple games, tasks and walks with my young children was hard to enjoy and that started making me depressed, because I couldn’t be the father I wanted to be for them. My biggest problem was all of my bowel movements were slimy or soft, which meant I could never get clean, I had to return to the toilet 2-3 times to clean myself, which is hard work when your out and about. So in the last 4 years I have tried this…..
