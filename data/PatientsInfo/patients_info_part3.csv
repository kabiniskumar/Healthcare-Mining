I am slowly titrating off of Trazodone (down to 200mg) because I was tired of hearing myself complain that the regimen wasn't helping much(I got a little more sleep 5-6 hrs, but no slight boost w/  and  .) The meds were prescribed for a bad bout with anxiety/insomnia which tripped into depression.  I feel pretty bad, hard to concentrate, less sleep, spacey, depressed. I don't have much energy to improve my life. I  want to hide, but uncomfortable not knowing what to do with myself which makes everything worse. I want to feel good again!

I also get a few itchy red spots on my legs in different places sometimes but these don't look like mollescum - I'm wondering if   as I know this can look similar but I am a bit concerned. I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced symptoms of this for 10 years or more?

It started as a few tiny bumps on her stomach, and I didn't think much of them. Everything I read said to just leave them alone and let them go away on their own, so I tried to be patient. After month 3, with no improvement, and now about 15-20 bumps, I decided to dig deeper and try to find a way to get rid of these before they spread even more. I found Conzerol online, and read tons of glowing reviews, so we decided to try it.  We started it over 2 weeks ago, and my daughter now has huge scabs on her stomach (see photos). About a week after starting the Conzerol, her MC spread into what looked like huge clusters of bumps, and now (17 days in) they are really big scabs that look just awful! I included the following photos: Day 3 on Conzerol (bumps turning red) Day 10 - spreading into clusters of bumps Day 17 - today- huge scabs Has anyone had this experience with Conzerol? From what I've read, scabs are a good thing, and it means they are healing... but after searching through tons of photos online, I can't find any with scabs quite this big. I guess I just need some peace of mind that this is normal, and not causing any  harm to my daughter. Also, should I be putting anything else on these scabs? Like tea tree oil? Aquaphor? Anything? I've been giving her baths every other day, but don't want to scrub these too hard because I don't want them to bleed and spread more. Please send any tips my way. This has been such a nightmare.

So I decided to visit a sexual health clinic, the nurse confirmed that it was just folliculitis or blocked glands. I was not so sure about the diagnosis, so I booked an appointment with my GP and I was told the same thing, almost instantly. I even asked if they might be molluscum, but they denied it to be the case. Still wasn’t convinced as they didn’t look normal, and they didn’t offer any further explanation. I booked with a different doctor an appointment, the doctor told me they suspect it to be molluscum, and didn’t offer any treatment option. The doctor even told me to go on with my sex life as per-usual, which confused me a lot as I know MC is contagious. So I am not sure what to do anymore, my next step is to see a dermatologist, but I’ll be put on a waiting list of six months (UK healthcare). I’ll be more than happy to receive any opinions/tips on what they might be and what I should do next. Thanks! 0 likes, 5 replies "

The thing is that without vitamin d3 at correct levels, you are not absorbing calcium and the body will shut down without those two working together!

I say did because I haven't had an episode with dystonia since before I was pregnant with my daughter three and a half years ago. It started when I was 23 and I was teaching pre-school. We would have story time and I would sit in the floor to read to the kids and when I would get up my right arm would draw up toward my face, my hand would draw up so much at times that I felt like it was going to break my hand, and my mouth would open and make my jaw draw to one side. It was weird and would happen any time I would get up and down out of the floor or when I would get out of my car. I didn't worry too much because at that age I pretty much still thought I was invincible and just saw it as more of a nuisance than anything. One day I was talking to two of my brothers and they described the things happening to them and we all were shocked because we had the exact same thing going on. My oldest brother went to the doctor and was diagnosed with mild dystonia. Mine never got any worse through the years since it first started 14 years ago, and actually went away 3 1/2 years ago but both of my brothers continue to have it. My question is, has anyone had their dystonia go into remission and if so, do you still have any symptom from time to time?

I am copy and pasting from a Word document so I do not know if the formatting will come out ok: 1.        Head/neck dystonia type movements (not diagnosed) – mild a.        Uncontrollable head/neck movement - pulls to one side and periodically has as a mild to moderate “jerk” to one side                                                                 i.      not a tremble or shake that goes back and forth (like a shaky hand when held out) but more of a pull                                                               ii.      Happens when I am laying in bed trying to sleep at night – literally driving me crazy                                                              iii.      happens infrequently when standing/sitting                                                               iv.      Happens more frequently when laying down on my sides then when just sitting or standing 1.        The head jerks/pull happen more frequently when I lay on my left side then right a.        Head jerks seem to be less when I lay on my right side b.        Head jerks seem to be less when laying on back                                                               v.       Happens at rest or with movement 1.         exacerbated by turning neck completely to the side – especially right side                                                              vi.      Occurs more frequently during above average emotional state (angry, anxious, sad, center of attention etc.)                                                            vii.      Happens more frequently when trying to do a “fine motor movement” or to hold still 1.        Head usually wants to pull/jerk to the left in these cases a.        For example: -           drinking from a glass/cup -           hold head still during a dental exam or MRI -           Brushing teeth b.        this has been occurring for about 2 years and has been slowly but progressively getting worse                                                                i.      My initial concern and reason for first initial visit to Neurologist years ago – and continued follow ups                                                               ii.      It is progressing to the point where getting to sleep is incredibly hard and have considered  1.        – other symptoms listed below have started happening since Other Symptoms 2.        Various random muscle pains, tingling, irregular movements  – no loss of muscle strength a.        Nerves and muscles seem more irritated then in all my life b.        Mild uncontrolled muscle fasciculation s in both of my calves that is can now be visibly seen, not just felt by me                                                                i.      Started off non painful 1.        progressed to the point of discomfort - has to be addressed with pain or muscle relaxer meds                                                               ii.      In  addition to the uncontrolled movement – it feels mildly like pins and needles at times – uncomfortable                                                             iii.      Walking in general, walking down steps and some other movement sometimes feels of c.        Extremities (legs/arms) seem to “fall asleep” and tingle” faster than usual just by laying or sitting d.        Muscles in general seem abnormally and unusually achy and tired after just moderate (not severe) exercise 3.        Multiple symptoms specifically on the right side of my body a.        Pain on both sides of upper butt (mostly right) and pain down both right leg – Piriformis Syndrome? b.        Muscles in right side of neck feel stiff                                                                i.      Muscles in right side of neck ache and feel tight when I turn my head c.        Thoracic spinal muscles on the right side of spine ache and feel stiff d.        Mild ache on upper/outer right foot  – has now moved over to the left foot at times as well e.        Right hand sometimes seems to feel as if it has fallen asleep when I wake up  even if I am not sleeping on that side f.         Right hand feels “off” and thumb tip is sometimes mildly numb - thumb movement seems stiff and jerky when moving g.        Right eyelid sometimes twitches 4.        Unusual high levels of restlessness, agitation and mood swings – unusual depression and significant anxiety/panic attacks 5.        Neck “grinds” and “pops” when I turn it 6.        Sleep issues that occur more frequently now and have really never been an issue for me before a.        Sometimes takes unusually long time falling asleep – head keeps pulling and/or anxiety b.        Wake up  multiple times throughout the night to use restroom c.        Sometimes hard time going back to sleep d.        These things are reduced when I take Gabapentin and/or Klonopin (.5 mg) 7.        All of these things have been occurring for over a year now and seem to be slowly but progressively getting worse a.        All of these symptoms seem to be worse at night when laying in bed and trying to sleep ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Tests done and possible things to investigate: MRI results: See MRI report, EMG tests – all blood tests came back normal 1.        Cervical spine – no disc is pushing on spinal cord in images a.        Left C6 – C7 left perineural cyst b.        Mild cerebellar ectopia on the left 2.        Thoracic Spine – no disc is pushing on spinal cord in images a.        Tiny disc protrusions at:                                                                i.      T4 – T5                                                               ii.      T5 – T6                                                             iii.      T6 – T7                                                              iv.      T8 – T9 3.        Lumbar spine - no disc is pushing on spinal cord in images a.        Laminectomy and fusion at L5 – S1 – performed in 2011 b.        Mild buldging of the L4 – L5 disc EMG and NCV results See EMG and NCV results 4.        1st nerve test - Impression/results – by 1st Neurologist a.        Mild axonal – demyelinating sensory polyneuropathy b.        Denervation potentials right S1 innervated muscles consistent with ongoing S1 nerve root irritability c.        Reinnervation potentials bilateral S1 and L5 innervated muscles consistent with chronic polyradiculopathy 5.        2nd nerve test – Impression/results – by second neurologist a.        Said  “no ALS - no nerve disease” although haven’t seen results – no demylination b.        Doesn’t know what’s causing symptoms – said I should return to Primary Care doctor Things to ask doctor – further areas to investigate to get to source of pain Let’s get to the bottom of what is going on 1.        Physical therapist also said he thought I had periformis syndrome a.        This was confirmed by me doing periformis exercises and stretches and my sciatic symptoms and pain becoming significantly worse later that night and the next day b.        Could we get a neurography (MRI that specifically sees nerves) ordered – Texas  ? 2.        Perinueral cyst in neck cause of pain and muscle tightness? 3.        Narrowing of the foramen space in cervical or lumbar spine pressing on a nerve? 4.        Facet joint issue? 5.        Physical therapist recently said one hip and one shoulder is noticeably higher than the other a.        Is there a way to test for one leg being longer then another? b.        One hip being higher then another? 6.        A way to test for a degree of scoliosis? 7.        Any of the disc or buldging discs causing pain even though not significantly pressing on spinal cord in images? 8.        Sacroiliac joint dysfunction? 9.        Anything else? 10.     Gabapentin, Ibuprofen and muscle relaxers help with muscle discomfort, sciatic pain – sometimes pain powers through 11.     Benzodiazepines such as Klonopin help with anxiety and the irregular muscle movements - leads me to believe  there is issue with the brain a.        Is either the brain sending sporadic signals to the muscles and nervous system because its hyper excitatory or are the muscles not communicating effectively with the brain leading to fasciculations, muscle tightness, discomfort?

When it kept twitching until late last August, I went to a neurologist and he did an EMG/nerve conduction that came out normal. He also had me get a brain, t-spine, and c-spine MRI (each of them w/o contrast), all of which came out normal (I did a closed, 1.5T machine for all three of the MRIs). We're waiting the results of my blood test, but a few weeks ago, before I had the MRIs, a couple of the toes on my left foot started to tingle/buzz/get a creepy crawly sensation a few times a day. It has typically been after I've been walking for a bit, then it stops.  Now I'm very, very concerned about this tingly/buzzing sensation across my left foot and am afraid it could be MS. I wish I had gotten my MRIs on a 3T as now I'm afraid there are lesions that just didn't show up on the 1.5T. I have no other symptoms, otherwise, such as numbness, dizziness, or visual symptoms. I'm just really at a loss as to what else it could be. Thanks so much in advance for any guidance you could give. I'm just so worried. 0 likes, 0 replies "

After just graduating high school, symptoms which had mostly disappeared, came back with a vengeance. I have been very discouraged because my symptoms are inhibiting my ability to preform even normal everyday tasks, and while I am supposed to be excited about starting my life, I'm frustrated as my doctors visits continue to be unsuccessful. For about six years now I've been having multiple bizarre symptoms. It started all the way back in 6th grade with back pain. My back was very achy and sometimes I'd sit down and a sharp pain would shoot through my spine. The pain persisted and months later I began experiencing extreme fatigue. If I was lucky enough to sleep the night before (I also began having sleeping problems) I still woke up feeling exhausted, and by afternoon it was so bad I could barely do anything and would usually leave school early, go home, and lay down the rest of the day. Somewhere around this point I began experiencing multiple new symptoms. I had stomach pain, nausea, headaches, bad earaches, frequent dizziness, chest pain (usually a burning sensation) chronic pain (my whole body was always achy) and my lower back began to hurt so bad I had trouble walking more than a few minutes at a time. I also had constipation and trouble peeing every once in a while which was quite painful (It would just drip). I also infrequently had problems with muscle spasms. I had issues with all of this consistently for a few years and had many visits to the doctors office.  By the end of these visits my doctor decided my diagnosis was anxiety!! Yes, I had anxiety but I knew there was no way thats what was causing my symptoms and was in fact convinced the opposite, that my symptoms were causing my anxiety. I continued to pursue a diagnosis and got so discouraged after so many negative tests I gave up and stopped even really talking about it (mostly blood tests ad x-rays, did get a full back MRI once though.) Eventually, (around sophomore year) a lot of my symptoms disappeared or became less painful or frequent. I still struggled with back pain, ear and headaches, occasional fatigue, and dizzy spells but I was able to function and get through the day okay. I began to ignore my symptoms and even entered into denial, convincing myself everyone was right and my poor health was due to mental illness and bad lifestyle choices. So I started eating right and exercising frequently, and honestly felt pretty damn good for a couple years, that is until second semester of senior year (February) when I ended up in the ER. I woke up feeling very strange, exhausted, and my mind was super foggy. When I tried to stand up it was very difficult and I was extremely dizzy. I began experiencing bad chest pain similar to my prior experience, a burning sensation, the difference is it was much worse. I also noticed my heat beat was extremely irregular and was jumping for 60bpm to 115bpm within seconds. The ER, of course, was a dead end. Images came back with nothing. Again I ignored it and moved on. My symptoms persisted but have usually not been as bad as the first time. I began having problems with my ears again, also worse than before. They hurt constantly everyday, never stop ringing, and keep plugging (like when you enter a high altitude and have to swallow or chew gum) but they get stuck like that and make it very difficult to hear everything including myself speak. This has been occurring everyday to present. In July my fatigue returned, not too bad though until recently and is now back to how it was, making it difficult to function. By now I have been experiencing all my old symptoms, many much worse than before, but heres where it gets even worse. Over the last few weeks I've had new symptoms. It started with a burning sensation in my feet, legs, arms, and hands. At first I only noticed it at night, then it began to happen 24/7. I tried to ignore it for awhile and eventually it went away. However, shortly after, I began having issues with spasticity. Muscle spasms all over my body (face, stomach, back,etc) stiffness, and now joint pain. The burning in my arms and legs now comes back every once in awhile and I've been having tingling in my hands, feet and lips. I am now again having trouble using the bathroom and my stomach hurts bad all the time (and also constantly makes weird noises) and I've been getting hit with random waves of nausea. My mind is foggy all the time and I have been extremely irritable as well. I could go on and on but I've already wrote a whole essay lol so back to the point. Do you think it could be MS? Should I continue going to the doctor? Do you have any advice on what I should do or say? I could really use your opinions, unfortunately I have not had much support, with my family telling me I'm overreacting or even straight up lying. They've been better recently but its still been hard, and it would be very helpful to hear someone tell me I'm not crazy lol. 0 likes, 11 replies "

If I was lucky enough to sleep the night before (I also began having sleeping problems) I still woke up feeling exhausted, and by afternoon it was so bad I could barely do anything and would usually leave school early, go home, and lay down the rest of the day. Somewhere around this point I began experiencing multiple new symptoms. I had stomach pain, nausea, headaches, bad earaches, frequent dizziness, chest pain (usually a burning sensation) chronic pain (my whole body was always achy) and my lower back began to hurt so bad I had trouble walking more than a few minutes at a time. I also had constipation and trouble peeing every once in a while which was quite painful (It would just drip). I also infrequently had problems with muscle spasms. I had issues with all of this consistently for a few years and had many visits to the doctors office.  By the end of these visits my doctor decided my diagnosis was anxiety!! Yes, I had anxiety but I knew there was no way thats what was causing my symptoms and was in fact convinced the opposite, that my symptoms were causing my anxiety. I continued to pursue a diagnosis and got so discouraged after so many negative tests I gave up and stopped even really talking about it (mostly blood tests ad x-rays, did get a full back MRI once though.) Eventually, (around sophomore year) a lot of my symptoms disappeared or became less painful or frequent. I still struggled with back pain, ear and headaches, occasional fatigue, and dizzy spells but I was able to function and get through the day okay. I began to ignore my symptoms and even entered into denial, convincing myself everyone was right and my poor health was due to mental illness and bad lifestyle choices. So I started eating right and exercising frequently, and honestly felt pretty damn good for a couple years, that is until second semester of senior year (February) when I ended up in the ER. I woke up feeling very strange, exhausted, and my mind was super foggy. When I tried to stand up it was very difficult and I was extremely dizzy. I began experiencing bad chest pain similar to my prior experience, a burning sensation, the difference is it was much worse. I also noticed my heat beat was extremely irregular and was jumping for 60bpm to 115bpm within seconds. The ER, of course, was a dead end. Images came back with nothing. Again I ignored it and moved on. My symptoms persisted but have usually not been as bad as the first time. I began having problems with my ears again, also worse than before. They hurt constantly everyday, never stop ringing, and keep plugging (like when you enter a high altitude and have to swallow or chew gum) but they get stuck like that and make it very difficult to hear everything including myself speak. This has been occurring everyday to present. In July my fatigue returned, not too bad though until recently and is now back to how it was, making it difficult to function. By now I have been experiencing all my old symptoms, many much worse than before, but heres where it gets even worse. Over the last few weeks I've had new symptoms. It started with a burning sensation in my feet, legs, arms, and hands. At first I only noticed it at night, then it began to happen 24/7. I tried to ignore it for awhile and eventually it went away. However, shortly after, I began having issues with spasticity. Muscle spasms all over my body (face, stomach, back,etc) stiffness, and now joint pain. The burning in my arms and legs now comes back every once in awhile and I've been having tingling in my hands, feet and lips. I am now again having trouble using the bathroom and my stomach hurts bad all the time (and also constantly makes weird noises) and I've been getting hit with random waves of nausea. My mind is foggy all the time and I have been extremely irritable as well. I could go on and on but I've already wrote a whole essay lol so back to the point. Do you think it could be MS? Should I continue going to the doctor? Do you have any advice on what I should do or say? I could really use your opinions, unfortunately I have not had much support, with my family telling me I'm overreacting or even straight up lying. They've been better recently but its still been hard, and it would be very helpful to hear someone tell me I'm not crazy lol. 0 likes, 11 replies "

This went away for a few hours but by the night i was tingling all over including my face. These tingling feelings happened on and off for a few days and then my left leg and arm had a numb feeling to it and some slight weakness. this happened on and off for a few days. i went to the doctor about a week later, she did some strength tests and said she couldn't detect any weakness (that day my left leg was very numb and had a dull ache and my left arm felt weak). She ordered some blood tests to check for B12 deficiency and thyroid problems. i felt somewhat reassured as it could be something simple as by this point i was shaking from the anxiety of these symptoms. The GP surgery rang me to say i need to see the doctor to go over my results, so i was feeling better for a few days thinking that theyd found B12 or  a thyroid problem and i booked an appointment. However i checked my online notes and found my blood results and i was devastated to find my TSH and B12 serum levels normal. The reason my doctor wanted to see me was slightly raised liver function levels and slightly raised eosinophil levels. which don't explain my symptoms and i'm terrified now that its MS to the the point where i've been in tears and very anxious. im a 27 year old male.

Fast forward a week later, maybe the 8th of February. I started developing ear fullness, and crackling. It was dull but constant . Eventually I got slight facial tension on my cheeks as well. No paralysis but almost like a sunburn or my face being pulled back. I spoke to my mother in law who's a nurse. She checked my ears and noticed they were swollen but no fluid. She suggested Motrin and Sudafed. Maybe it was sinus issue? I used it for one week straight. Didnt work. Eventually the vertigo came back. And now it came back even stronger. This was like the 14th of February. I started freaking out. I would get lightheaded out of nowhere and feel like passing out. My head felt so swollen. Almost as if someone wrapped a belt around my head. So I go to urgent care thinking Im dying. They checked my blood sugar. It was fine. Hemoglobin. Okay. Blood pressure? A little high due to panic attack. The urgent care doctor runs a basic neuro test on me...my finger following her finger, eyes following her finger etc. She checked my eyes and ears and her conclusion was... Migraine. Migraine...I've had migraines before. This did not feel like it. She prescribed me Sumatriptan for headaches and Zofran for nausea. It did not help so a few days later I went to the physician (17th of February). Physician ran the same test as urgent care doctor however he concluded I had middle/inner ear infection due to a virus that stuck around since January. He prescribed me ear drops, Meclizine for vertigo and Ibropufen. Now its been a few weeks since my appointment. My eyes arent spinning anymore however I still have ear fullness and crackling. That being said, the odd thing is even though some symptoms are diminishing, I feel like I'm developing new symptoms. It almost feels like I am drowsy, drunk. I get tired very easily. Like I need to put my head down during the day. Also my heart rate would spike randomly. I could be resting at 60bpm then all of a sudden it can go to 90bpm as soon I start thinking about it. The best way to describe the feeling is like I have low blood sugar with high blood pressure. Secondly, I would get a throbbing sensation in hands and feet accompanied by cold sensations and pins and needles. Lastly, I feel like I can hear my heartbeat and it feels like its pumping harder. I'd like to note that all these symptoms come and go throughout the day. Some hrs are better than others but still constant every day. Doctor likes to say that its my anxiety due to panic attacks. He says it put a lot of pressure on my nerves. But I'm not sure. Its just so odd. I was perfectly fine leading up to the new year (working out 4 out of 7 days a week) then all of a sudden I'm having all these odd symptoms.

My roommates and I got flu-like symptoms. Fever, cough, mucus etc. Eventually we got over it. Or so I thought. Fast forward to the tail end of January (27-28th). Started developing slight vertigo. It would come and go throughout the day (I mostly noticed it in closed corridors or whenever I showered). The vertigo eventually went away however after a few days. Weird. Fast forward a week later, maybe the 8th of February. I started developing ear fullness, and crackling. It was dull but constant . Eventually I got slight facial tension on my cheeks as well. No paralysis but almost like a sunburn or my face being pulled back. I spoke to my mother in law who's a nurse. She checked my ears and noticed they were swollen but no fluid. She suggested Motrin and Sudafed. Maybe it was sinus issue? I used it for one week straight. Didnt work. Eventually the vertigo came back. And now it came back even stronger. This was like the 14th of February. I started freaking out. I would get lightheaded out of nowhere and feel like passing out. My head felt so swollen. Almost as if someone wrapped a belt around my head. So I go to urgent care thinking Im dying. They checked my blood sugar. It was fine. Hemoglobin. Okay. Blood pressure? A little high due to panic attack. The urgent care doctor runs a basic neuro test on me...my finger following her finger, eyes following her finger etc. She checked my eyes and ears and her conclusion was... Migraine. Migraine...I've had migraines before. This did not feel like it. She prescribed me Sumatriptan for headaches and Zofran for nausea. It did not help so a few days later I went to the physician (17th of February). Physician ran the same test as urgent care doctor however he concluded I had middle/inner ear infection due to a virus that stuck around since January. He prescribed me ear drops, Meclizine for vertigo and Ibropufen. Now its been a few weeks since my appointment. My eyes arent spinning anymore however I still have ear fullness and crackling. That being said, the odd thing is even though some symptoms are diminishing, I feel like I'm developing new symptoms. It almost feels like I am drowsy, drunk. I get tired very easily. Like I need to put my head down during the day. Also my heart rate would spike randomly. I could be resting at 60bpm then all of a sudden it can go to 90bpm as soon I start thinking about it. The best way to describe the feeling is like I have low blood sugar with high blood pressure. Secondly, I would get a throbbing sensation in hands and feet accompanied by cold sensations and pins and needles. Lastly, I feel like I can hear my heartbeat and it feels like its pumping harder. I'd like to note that all these symptoms come and go throughout the day. Some hrs are better than others but still constant every day. Doctor likes to say that its my anxiety due to panic attacks. He says it put a lot of pressure on my nerves. But I'm not sure. Its just so odd.

(The chiropractor was very gentle and didn't try to crack my neck or anything). I had a random funny turn one evening where i thought I was going to pass out, felt very dizzy was seeing stars, legs went like jelly, my neck was really sore, and my right arm went numb and tingly. Went to the docs who arranged   (which came back fine). The numbness and tingling has persisted ever since. The same thing happened the next night and i went to a&e - more blood tests and an ECG both came back fine. Since then, i have been experiencing more and more symptoms daily which come and go randomly and are all over my body. I have attached my ongoing list. I was referred to see a neurologist, all his physical tests for reflexes, vision, gait, strength etc. were normal and just had an MRI of my brain and cervical spine on Saturday, so nervously awaiting the results. I have found this site very helpful and informative over the past couple of months and in the mean time was wondering if anyone else had experienced similar symptoms to my list, or has any advice?

I'm a 37yr old male, not in the best shape but far from out of shape.  I'm active, I go to the gym, I race dirt bikes, hike, and you normal every day guy.  Since my 20's I've had a left knee that has steadily been getting worse.  Last year diagnosed as Patella Pain Syndrome.  In 2014 I had a bad skydiving landing (tandem) and the instructor made us land on our butts, needless to say my tailbone took the weight of both of us and I spent a year going to a chiropractor for lower pack pain and neck pain.  I stopped going in fall '15.  In Oct 2015 I did a very rough dirt bike race which left me beat up, my hands were buzzing, sore back and wrists.  This wasn't abnormal and I know I'm getting older so I didn't think anything of it however over a month later my right wrist was still sore and then at night I started waking up with my hands and feet feeling numbish (that feeling as your limb is falling asleep but not fully pins and needs asleep).  I never had the pins and needles feeling, just the numbing type feeling.  It extended to my mid forearms and upper calves.  I saw my PCP who told me it was probably stress related (panic or anxiety disorder) and gave me some xanax.  I hate taking pills so I never took them and instead followed up with a neurologist.   My neuro did the in office quick evaluation and said it probably wasn't ALS or MS because the symtoms would disappearing and reoccuring and sure enough around Dec, the symptoms disappeared while I was gone on vacation.  In January I resumed work and the numbing feeling returned in my right food and right hand.  Again, no pins and needles but a numbing feeling. When it would get really bad the tips of my pinky and second last finger would go cold and really hurt.  I was also experiencing concentration issues. This lasted about 6 weeks til mid-Feb when it went away.  About a month later it occurred again in early March.  I got tired of my PCP saying it was anxiety so I took the xanax and while I felt relaxed and it help with the concentration issues it did nothing for the tingling/numbing feeling.  Mid march the numbing stopped altogether however what's persisted is a feeling of my calves and forearms being tight and lightly cramped.  When I wake up in the morning I feel like my calves ran a marathon the night before and they do ease up as I stretch and move thru the day.  My calves fatigue very quickly especially on stairs.  and... I continue to have twitching in my calves (this has been going on since Oct.).  My forearms.... similar. Tight fatigued feeling which makes for stiff hands and sometimes weak hands gripping things, like weights at the gym. As of May (today), I still don't get the numbing feelings however I still get the tight fatigued feeling in my calves and forearms.  The twitching continues 24/7 and now includes the arches of my feet. This twitching is very light and hard to see but it is observable.  I can feel it in the muscle.  Lately in the evenings when I finally sit down after a long day I've started feeling my quad muscles near the connection to the knee spasm very hard 3-4 times. This has been occuring daily and lately in the last 2-3 days I get this feeling in my right thigh of a very fast pulsation (feels very deep in the muscle) in my right thigh side (it can't be seen and only felt).  I still have concententraion issues.  My right eye has apparently started to get lazy since Oct ('15) so I'm having issues focusing and glasses won't fix it.  I'm tired all the time even though I still force myself to the gym to lift weights and cardio daily.  But I have to say its really starting to weigh down on my. I try to ignore it and just go on with my every day life becuase I'm tired of my Dr (GP) telling me he can't find anything wrong with me and constantly repeats anxiety/stress.  I've dealt with stress all my life I know this isnt' stress related.  I just don't know what to do or where to go to come up with answers. LOL why can't the healt system be like on TV where you whizz in, blab your symptoms and an hour later they have a cure.  Anyone else experience anything like this?   1 like, 13 replies "

In addition to the atrohy, all the joints on my right side are having problems and are compromised (tear in the shoulder, hip now locking up if I sit a long time, tear in my right meniscus).  I've had 3 EMGs, several MRIs,  and extensive blood work performed at the finest medical facilities.  There is a spot on my spinal cord, but just one.  They say if I had several, it would indicate MS.  The damage to the spinal cord was not there in 2014 but showed up in 2017 in different MRI.  I am a female of 60 years, and have always exercised regularly and enjoyed the outdoors.  I have herniated C 4, 5 in my neck, which fused itself without surgery.  The pain began in my arm, right above my elbow, then into my wrist.  At first, I thought it was carpal tunnel.   I've been trying to find answers for the past 4 years.  Even my ears are no longer even. A few warnings:  I agreed to a MRI with contrast at Mayo  and developed a severe headache the next morning before getting off the elevator at the hotel the following day.  For six weeks, I had headaches, could not process my thoughts well, etc.  I believe the culprit, for me, was gadolinium, the contrast agent.  Be careful if you agree to an injection for imaging purposes and do your research first.  My symptoms were similar to a CSF leak. My last visit to Cleveland Clinic revealed some potential blood/oxygen flow questions.  A tilt table test to rule out POTS was inconclusive, so they are asking me to come back for another test.    I find the links others have brought up about having stints put in and CSF problems interesting. With regard to symptom relief, I've been too busy to get to my water aerobics class, but find that water exercise is one of my best options.  I've also started laying on some styro wedges (think looseleaf notebook).  My chiro used wedges years ago, so I knew they could be helpful.  By laying on the inclined wedge so that the higher side is under my shoulder and lower side near my spine, or by placing it under my hip for 5-45 minutes, it gives a gentle but solid stretch that offers some relief. Please keep writing.  I hope this is helpful. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I used to be fit (gym, tennis, swimming) but had to reduce my usual exercise routine to almost nothing. The main symptom is a burning feeling in my muscles (similar to the feeling you get when you try to lift a heavy weight). Lately, this happens even while doing simple tasks like doing the dishes. It slowly but surely is starting to affect my everyday life. I don't think that I have lost a noticeable amount of muscle power but I feel like there is no energy stored in my muscles.  I feel like an old battery, drained within a short time. After exercise my muscles are very sore and recovery is very slow. (So far I have tried warm baths with Magnesium salts and Ibuprofen.) I had some blood tests, full blood count, Vit D, Vit B12, creatine kinase level, but did not have a chance to talk to my doctor yet. I suspect, my levels are normal otherwise my GP would have contacted me by now. By posting this discussion I hope to connect to people with similar problems and hear about possible causes and what actions I should take. 0 likes, 6 replies "

Two years ago after the huge fire in Santa Rosa, I tripped and landed on the side of my dresser hurting my ribs. Didnt go to doc, wasnt all that bruised. 2 wks ltr i could feel sloshing in my abdom area. Went to Kaiser they saw i had internal bleeding. They put a drain tube in my side but the bleeding got worse. They had no Thoracic surgeon. i coulnt be transferred to SF because i was to critical. I went to Memorial Hospital in town. They did emergency surgery and fixed it. Prior to that i was in pretty good health, but it was obvious i was slowly losing weight. Losing weight was never easy for me. Two months ltr we were into the new year. we had dropped Kaiser after 32 years because they nearly killed me. In Feb last year i went to a new dr near Memorial because i just wasnt feeling well. I felt tired, and run down, not myself. And I was still losing weight. A lot of weight. im normally about 155 lbs. My new doc sent me to every specialist for the next year. Including Oncology. It wasnt cancer. A year went by and no diagnosis OR sense of urgency at all from all the docs. In NOV of that year out of no where, i was rushed to the hospital with an ulcerated colon. Aha! Could this be the culprit? I was in sepsis b4 they got me to surgery. Another complication. But i got through it. Im still healing from it. And the weight continued to plummet. I was eating, but still losing. At first I was slim and trim but now nearly my entire muscular system is so diminished i am a walking skeleton. No exaggeration. I am 5'4 and 106 lbs. No one knows what it is? I am desperate. I FEEL LIKE MY BODY HAS BEEN FEEDING OFF ITSELF. My drs are frustrating. I show them my bag of bones that used to be my body. No one seems worried. What has happened to me? This is going to kill me if the cause isnt discovered. Has anyone experienced this? Thanks. 0 likes, 2 replies "

So last Tuesday I think I slept with a thick memory foam pillow either under my leg or between my knees, upon waking I had a sore groin which I put down to the sleeping position. Went to work and it was quite sore. The next day same again, leg felt very locked up and sore to move around with. I decided to rest up on the Friday and see if it heeled. Over the weekend it started to feel good again so no worries. On Monday I get up feeling stiff again, in work moving around I the strain on my groin and like stress being putting on my backside muscles. I decided to give it up and rest again. Tuesday night was a real pain, it was hurting and I couldn't get into a position where it felt comfortable. It's been tough to walk in, can't twist my leg or move it side to side without a hard pain, seems to be on the inner thigh right up in the crease. It also gives me a throbbing almost toothache like pain. On Wednesday morning I woke up and it felt significantly better, I was walking about slightly more freely and the pain had drastically decreased so I thought great it's on the mend. Come night time lay in bed the groin started to ache again and this morning once again it feels very stiff, locked up and painful trying to move it around, lift up etc. Does it seem like a simple groin strain, am I giving it enough time to heal? How long does it normally take. I've sent someone to get me some Ibuprofen Gel to use today, hopefully that will help. Also apologies, didn't know what category to put this in. 0 likes, 7 replies "

Hot baths seem to help best. I'm afraid to start exercising and don't know what to do. Pain initially started the same day that I had a stomach bug. Not sure if it is a coincidence. I didn't really have a fever and the bug only lasted a day... Had a little arm soreness that lasted briefly but has subsided. The only connection I have found was experiencing some rhabdo (high CK levels) a year and half ago after a very vigorous exercise session. I peed brown and went to the doctor. Took Advil and Tylenol. Pain was experienced in same parts of legs (thighs, calves) and I could hardly walk for a week. After that,  I appeared to be fine (up until now). My GP recommended physical therapy for this most recent episode but I was worried so sought the advice of a Rheumatologist. Got EMG and long list of blood tests. All results were normal.

I had a knee replacement about 4 years ago which was fairly successful but during the last couple of weeks I have suffered more muscle aches around my knee. I think it may have been because I wore a pair of shoes one day which were basically too big and I think that they have caused the problem, but I am finding it quite depressing particularly as I was planning to have my second knee done in a few weeks time. Ice and heat seem to help but I do not seem to be able to completely get rid of these muscle aches. Does anyone have any suggestions? 0 likes, 0 replies "

I see a lot of taper / withdrawal threads on here explaining how bad it was for a lot of people but I wanted to share my experience with a relatively easy taper so those who google it don’t get completely terrified / hopefully it helps some people. I was on mirtazapine for GAD and Panic Disorder for four years, 30mg for three and 45g for the final year. It helped a great deal in the beginning but the last six months or so I felt I was getting no benefits, so I decided to come off. Here are my tips before I log my experience. BE FIRM with your doctor. For too long I was pressured to stay on or even maximise my dose when I was unhappy. Tell your doctor you want off and you want off now and come up with a GAME PLAN. GET ANTI-NAUSEA MEDS this one is simple, be prepared. I got a script for Maxolon from my doc to take twice a day during my withdrawal. It’s completely safe and non addictive and works wonders. SET YOURSELF UP FOR SUCCESS you can do this. I personally have been through Valium (diazepam) withdrawal and it was horrifying, so with that experience behind me I knew this would be do-able. HAVE FAITH in yourself and your inner strength. SYMPTOMS WILL PASS. The good thing is you know it is the withdrawal that is making your anxiety flare up or making you feel uneasy so you KNOW you can get through it and it will end. So here comes my experience. Had been on 45mg for a year (out of 4 on this med) and told my doctor I want off and I want off ASAP. They were aware of my success coming off diazepam so were supportive of me coming off this relatively quickly (I really earned my drug withdrawal stripes there haha). 45mg down to 30mg for five days. I took my anti-nausea pill when I woke up straight away and another in the evening if I needed. Honestly felt ZERO bad effects from this drop at all, if anything I felt better. Less violent anxiety, clearer head and happier mood. 30mg down to 15mg for five days. Kept taking those wonderful Maxolons and again this was a walk in the park!! Happier every day and really focussing on how much success I was having so far. 15mg down to 7.5mg for five days. Still on Maxolon every day to avoid the nausea. Had some days where anxiety would flare up quickly but that’s kind of normal for me anyway. Found on this low dose I was falling asleep so fast I had forgotten how sedating the low doses were! 7.5mg to 0 for the rest of my life. Still on Maxolon, have been noticing I still feel some nausea so I am grateful to have the anti-nausea meds to really minimise it. Have been taking 2 daily during this time. My sleep is becoming a bit more broken and less of a “coma” deep sleep now and I’ve been sweating bullets at random but DRINKING LOADS OF WATER.  STILL FEELING POSITIVE!! I am now 3 days into 0mg and honestly it’s nowhere near as bad as a lot of people experienced and for that I am extremely grateful. Will update if people are interested to read how the next few days / weeks go now that I’m down to no mirt in my system.  It has been so much easier than I was braced for. Mild Nausea despite taking the anti nausea meds Pooping more than usual Some sleep disruption once I came off completely Sweating Mild headache (easily fixed by ibuprofen) Flare ups of anxiety but NO PANIC ATTACKS caused by withdrawal, if anything my panic attacks are less frequent now Feeling a little foggy headed once I got down to zero, not a big deal Jitters. Just general fidgeting and struggling to sit still but that’s expected after being sedated big time for the last four years by a variety of meds now I’m on zero medications. (I’m not saying these don’t happen but merely they did not happen to me) Vomiting Diarrhoea Insomnia (I still sleep every night) Brain Zaps Migraines Panic attacks caused by withdrawal Suicidal thoughts / depression. I’m actually much happier. Dizziness / feeling faint. Again this is less frequent now than it was while I was on 45mg. Bad mood changes, being angry or crying for no reason. So to anyone who bothered to read this essay post. YOU CAN DO IT. Everyone will experience these things differently and I am not disputing that some people have a really rough time, it’s just that when someone has a good experience or an easy time they are less likely to write about it. When I was starting my taper I found so many awful stories and so few positive ones which made me extremely anxious in itself. So I wanted to write out a successful withdrawal story for those people who are about to start to see that they might not have a horrifying experience and there are ways you can prevent a lot of the symptoms SAFELY. Drink lots of water. Have faith in yourself. Be strong. Don’t put up with sh*t you don’t have to. I am more than happy to reply to any questions people have about my experience and will update how things go for the next few days if anyone is interested. Cheers and good luck.  12 likes, 126 replies "

SET YOURSELF UP FOR SUCCESS you can do this. I personally have been through Valium (diazepam) withdrawal and it was horrifying, so with that experience behind me I knew this would be do-able. HAVE FAITH in yourself and your inner strength. SYMPTOMS WILL PASS. The good thing is you know it is the withdrawal that is making your anxiety flare up or making you feel uneasy so you KNOW you can get through it and it will end. So here comes my experience. Had been on 45mg for a year (out of 4 on this med) and told my doctor I want off and I want off ASAP. They were aware of my success coming off diazepam so were supportive of me coming off this relatively quickly (I really earned my drug withdrawal stripes there haha). 45mg down to 30mg for five days. I took my anti-nausea pill when I woke up straight away and another in the evening if I needed. Honestly felt ZERO bad effects from this drop at all, if anything I felt better. Less violent anxiety, clearer head and happier mood. 30mg down to 15mg for five days. Kept taking those wonderful Maxolons and again this was a walk in the park!! Happier every day and really focussing on how much success I was having so far. 15mg down to 7.5mg for five days. Still on Maxolon every day to avoid the nausea. Had some days where anxiety would flare up quickly but that’s kind of normal for me anyway. Found on this low dose I was falling asleep so fast I had forgotten how sedating the low doses were! 7.5mg to 0 for the rest of my life. Still on Maxolon, have been noticing I still feel some nausea so I am grateful to have the anti-nausea meds to really minimise it. Have been taking 2 daily during this time. My sleep is becoming a bit more broken and less of a “coma” deep sleep now and I’ve been sweating bullets at random but DRINKING LOADS OF WATER.  STILL FEELING POSITIVE!! I am now 3 days into 0mg and honestly it’s nowhere near as bad as a lot of people experienced and for that I am extremely grateful. Will update if people are interested to read how the next few days / weeks go now that I’m down to no mirt in my system.  It has been so much easier than I was braced for. Mild Nausea despite taking the anti nausea meds Pooping more than usual Some sleep disruption once I came off completely Sweating Mild headache (easily fixed by ibuprofen) Flare ups of anxiety but NO PANIC ATTACKS caused by withdrawal, if anything my panic attacks are less frequent now Feeling a little foggy headed once I got down to zero, not a big deal Jitters. Just general fidgeting and struggling to sit still but that’s expected after being sedated big time for the last four years by a variety of meds now I’m on zero medications. (I’m not saying these don’t happen but merely they did not happen to me) Vomiting Diarrhoea Insomnia (I still sleep every night) Brain Zaps Migraines Panic attacks caused by withdrawal Suicidal thoughts / depression. I’m actually much happier. Dizziness / feeling faint. Again this is less frequent now than it was while I was on 45mg. Bad mood changes, being angry or crying for no reason. So to anyone who bothered to read this essay post. YOU CAN DO IT. Everyone will experience these things differently and I am not disputing that some people have a really rough time, it’s just that when someone has a good experience or an easy time they are less likely to write about it. When I was starting my taper I found so many awful stories and so few positive ones which made me extremely anxious in itself. So I wanted to write out a successful withdrawal story for those people who are about to start to see that they might not have a horrifying experience and there are ways you can prevent a lot of the symptoms SAFELY. Drink lots of water. Have faith in yourself. Be strong. Don’t put up with sh*t you don’t have to. I am more than happy to reply to any questions people have about my experience and will update how things go for the next few days if anyone is interested. Cheers and good luck.  12 likes, 126 replies "

Last april, i’ve got a suspicious that i’m pregnant.","Its been a week that i missed my period. But i have this spotting once a day. So i decided to used this Pregnancy Test last april27.  The second line seems faint, then that day i started bleeding like its a real monthly period.  This really confused me, I decided to take another PT last april 29, then it still says Two Line (which the other line is still faint). I’m still having these bleeding.. so i think i maybe mistaken with the PT’s result. Last May2, i decided to see a Dr. , i told her what happened Then she confirmed that im really pregnant for about4-5weeks. I also took an Ultrasound, but she told me there is nothing in my sac. She told me, i maybe having miscarriage already or ectopic pregnancy. I took the blood test that day, it said 1000miu/ml.  I then went back to her clinic last May4, for the blood test. Result was about 1400miu/ml.  Dr told me that its seems its really an ectopic pregnancy and that if i will have any cramps or severe pain on weekend, i must have go to ER immediately but if i wont have any cramps then i must have go to her clinic again to Do another ultrasound, and this is today. May7. We did the ultrasound, still there is nothing on my sac. I then, took another blood test, still waiting for the results. She told me that if it decreases then maybe, its miscarriage. But if it still increases then its ectopic. And i have to do the laparoscopy surgery.  I really dont know what to do now, i asked my Dr if there is any medicine for this, (if it’s really ectopic) she told me there isnt. Only the surgery.

Mum also has emphysema and a few other conditions! mum has been taking 20mg of MXT weekly since the start and still has to take prednisolone albeit a smaller does that beforehand the MXT was started. Mum has always been a bit breathless on exertion due to emphysema but this has got worse with dry cough and really quite breathless even on a low level of trying to move. Seeing the Consultant today, I asked if this could be due to the MXT rather than emphysema and having sounded mums chest, the Consultant said she could hear some crackles ( not there's 3 years ago and not then showing on CT scan ). Mum has now been told to stop MXT and increase steroids whilst awaiting another CT scan and then review. I'm now worried that the MXT could have caused damage and wonder if anyone's else has had this problem? If mums lungs are damaged by MXT, what happens next? Thanks for any experiences you can share. paula. 0 likes, 2 replies "

The morning after I felt a small discomfort on my left side just below my rib. The dr looked and felt but could see or feel nothing. Said it may just go away. Gradually the discomfort got worse and now is sometimes unbearable. It is always present and has indeed reduced my quality of life to a great degree. I have had CT scan, virtual colonoscopy, endoscopy, chest xray and ultrasound. All negative. I have seen a neurologist and 2 x gut consultants, again nothing. After all that NOBODY has the slightest idea what is wrong. (this is a time when everybody seems to give up on a patient!) The discomfort is just like as if someone is pushing their first firmy into the area immediately beneath my left lower rib and I tend to be automatically holding my hand, with some pressure on it, all day for somekind of relief. Is this a nerve or a gut problem, or anything else and perhaps npthing to do with my stroke after all? I now have to 'get out of my pram' to get any further tests done. Doctors switch off. Have you tried to push treacle through dry sand?! I am 67. Has anyone else suffered this problem please? James 6 likes, 216 replies "

In early 2018, after almost 2 years of increasing symptoms such as brain fog, fatigue, interrupted sleep, decreased sense of smell and taste, and burning feet accompanied with a sensation of wearing stockings to the knee and long gloves, I was told my B12 serum levels were 220 pmol/L and B12 active levels 41 pmol/L. My GP is proactive and commenced 1000 mcg IM methyl shots immediately with a schedule of 1 shot every 3  weeks for 9 weeks; then once a month. 4-5 months after my first shot I felt no real improvement had occurred and asked to have shots every 2 weeks, which my GP agreed to.  This continued for appx 6 weeks when I got sick of attending the surgery and requested they show me how to administer the shots myself, which they did. Thankfully I'm in Australia so can purchase ampules over the counter at a chemist, and can get free injecting equipment through a health organisation. I self administered every 10 days for 8 weeks. By then my B12 levels were well over 1000 pmol/L and have remained there. I subsequently stopped having the shots as I appear to be maintaining levels adequately. I was also taking 5000mcg of Methyl B12 sublingual tabs daily along with a B complex, fish oil, zinc and joint pain supplements (dodgy knees). I continue to supplement regularly although not to such high levels. In April 2018 I asked my doctor to review previous blood tests to check whether my B12  had ever been tested before as my symptoms had progressed considerably - it turns out it had been in Dec 2016 when I first went to get my issue of numb toes checked out. My levels back then were 198 pmol/L and 39 pmol/L for serum and active forms respectively. These results were never followed up by my GP at the time and I was completely unaware of them until April 2018 . At the time they had concerns it may have been MS as my sister suffers from the disease. I have also had my children tested as I was concerned that this may have been a dietary issue.  My youngest two tested in the low to mid 300's. I supplement them occasionally as a result as there is a chance they're not getting enough from their food. Over the last 3-4 weeks I've noticed a significant return of the burning feet and stockinged legs/arms sensation, particularly of a night time. I live in a tropical area of Australia and have noticed this seems to occur when the weather heats up. The brain fog is almost non-existent and my sleeping patterns have improved significantly. My memory however still has some gaping holes in it and I continue to struggle with retention of  information. I've also recently discovered I'm massively deficient in Vit D, which surprised me as I live in a place with almost constant sunshine (not as great as it sounds I might add!). It seems the Slip/Slop/Slap skin cancer campaigns have really paid off and we are a nation of increasingly Vit D deficient people. I have had 2 MRI's that were clear of MS, stroke, tumour, any form of demyelation disorder, spinal cord compression, and cauda equina. I saw two different neuro's who tried to convince me it was anxiety and wanted to treat me with anti depressants and then suggested I visit a psychologist. I went to see a psychologist who rejected the anxiety theory (as had I) but they suggested it could be fibromyalgia. My GP rejected this suggestion and frankly I'm dubious myself. I've had STI checks; urine protein checks; autoimmune checks for lupus, Sjogren syndrome, RA etc; diabetes; iron studies; MMA (after supplementation unfortunately); thyroid function; coeliac disease; intrinsic factor and routine bloods/chemistry checks. With the exception of a slightly abnormal liver function (ALT) test, all have been clear and normal. I'm not pre-menopausal. I am visiting my Dr again soon for follow up tests to check B12 & Vit D levels. I'm now also seriously considering environmental factors such as adult onset allergies, or some sort of contamination. The last I doubt is an issue as my children don't appear to be affected. So finally to my question(s) -  from the past experience of other B12 low/deficient patients: Hopefully someone is still reading this.... Many thanks in advance! 0 likes, 2 replies "

In early 2018, after almost 2 years of increasing symptoms such as brain fog, fatigue, interrupted sleep, decreased sense of smell and taste, and burning feet accompanied with a sensation of wearing stockings to the knee and long gloves, I was told my B12 serum levels were 220 pmol/L and B12 active levels 41 pmol/L. My GP is proactive and commenced 1000 mcg IM methyl shots immediately with a schedule of 1 shot every 3  weeks for 9 weeks; then once a month. 4-5 months after my first shot I felt no real improvement had occurred and asked to have shots every 2 weeks, which my GP agreed to.  This continued for appx 6 weeks when I got sick of attending the surgery and requested they show me how to administer the shots myself, which they did. Thankfully I'm in Australia so can purchase ampules over the counter at a chemist, and can get free injecting equipment through a health organisation. I self administered every 10 days for 8 weeks. By then my B12 levels were well over 1000 pmol/L and have remained there. I subsequently stopped having the shots as I appear to be maintaining levels adequately. I was also taking 5000mcg of Methyl B12 sublingual tabs daily along with a B complex, fish oil, zinc and joint pain supplements (dodgy knees). I continue to supplement regularly although not to such high levels. In April 2018 I asked my doctor to review previous blood tests to check whether my B12  had ever been tested before as my symptoms had progressed considerably - it turns out it had been in Dec 2016 when I first went to get my issue of numb toes checked out. My levels back then were 198 pmol/L and 39 pmol/L for serum and active forms respectively. These results were never followed up by my GP at the time and I was completely unaware of them until April 2018 . At the time they had concerns it may have been MS as my sister suffers from the disease. I have also had my children tested as I was concerned that this may have been a dietary issue.  My youngest two tested in the low to mid 300's. I supplement them occasionally as a result as there is a chance they're not getting enough from their food. Over the last 3-4 weeks I've noticed a significant return of the burning feet and stockinged legs/arms sensation, particularly of a night time. I live in a tropical area of Australia and have noticed this seems to occur when the weather heats up. The brain fog is almost non-existent and my sleeping patterns have improved significantly. My memory however still has some gaping holes in it and I continue to struggle with retention of  information. I've also recently discovered I'm massively deficient in Vit D, which surprised me as I live in a place with almost constant sunshine (not as great as it sounds I might add!). It seems the Slip/Slop/Slap skin cancer campaigns have really paid off and we are a nation of increasingly Vit D deficient people. I have had 2 MRI's that were clear of MS, stroke, tumour, any form of demyelation disorder, spinal cord compression, and cauda equina. I saw two different neuro's who tried to convince me it was anxiety and wanted to treat me with anti depressants and then suggested I visit a psychologist. I went to see a psychologist who rejected the anxiety theory (as had I) but they suggested it could be fibromyalgia. My GP rejected this suggestion and frankly I'm dubious myself. I've had STI checks; urine protein checks; autoimmune checks for lupus, Sjogren syndrome, RA etc; diabetes; iron studies; MMA (after supplementation unfortunately); thyroid function; coeliac disease; intrinsic factor and routine bloods/chemistry checks. With the exception of a slightly abnormal liver function (ALT) test, all have been clear and normal. I'm not pre-menopausal.

And one day I even had new stuff going on like burning wrists, feeling wiped out, etc... that didn't last more than one day. But through all this, even though I'm glad to at least feel SOMETHING is happening after the shots, I still can't say that I'm ""better."" I've read neurological symptoms can take the longest to improve and heal, and I'm hoping this is the case for me. Otherwise I'll start worrying all over again that this is NOT due to B12, and instead is something more sinister, like MS. Although at this point, my doctor doesn't think so.  Help! Does anyone have any insight on symptoms like mine when it comes to B12 deficiency, and how it all relates to B12 injections and improvement time? Thanks so much. 1 like, 74 replies "

And once I thought I felt better, started my normal activities and hurt myself again cleaning. I'd like to hear others experiences. 1 like, 2 replies "

I don't have trouble sleeping once i've had my injection it just always happens the few weeks running up to my next injection date.

I have two doses left on loading but i cant take any time off after them. one is on tuesday im working 16 hour days wed and thursday. im expecting to feel even worse with each dose. im unsure if its my immune system playing havoc or im generally reacting to the actual b12.  ITs Hydroxycobalamin im getting. any general idea of how yoru  meant to feel would be really appreciated thank you x 0 likes, 1 reply "

I was on monthly b12 injections of hydroxocobalamin. I have recently moved home and moved GP.  The practice nurse questioned why i need b12 injections for so long and I was sent for a blood test. My levels came back as b12 219 and folic acid was severely low at level 1... the doctor (always a different doctor) told me that my b12 level is fine at 219 but said my folic acid is the lowest level he has ever seen in all his years as a GP.  He put me on daily folic acid as well as vit D which was also very low. I am very concerned as I thought folic acid works alongside with b12 but my injections have been stopped. I do not think my b12 level is as high as it should be and I am so worried about the neurological effects of not having enough b12.  When i was diagnosed 10 years ago I was so very poorly, could hardly walk upstairs, had to crawl up, my memory was terrible, I was under neurology at my local hospital who put me on monthly b12 injections as I was so ill with it..... No one at this new surgery has explained why my folic acid is so low... could it be connected to the previous pernicious anemia? Any advice would be so great, so worried...thank you.

My two questions are: 1) My neurologist also said **you cannot have a TIA where your leg doens't fully collapse. He said if I had had a TIA, my leg would not have been able to hold me and I would have collapsed to the floor on that side.  Is it possible to not collapse all the way? If felt like I was collapsing slowly, but then I snapped out of it and was able to stand again.  He also said you can't hold a position like that parallel to the floor for a few seconds. I'm just not sure and wanted to see if anyone has had a TIA or stroke and had leg weakness and NOT collapsed.   2) He also implied you shouldn't be able to 'think' while having a stroke.

Something else?,"Hello. I'm a 66 year old female, diagnosed with CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) three years ago. I'm untreated, on ""watch and wait"", as my only symptoms have been my lymphocytes and white count. About 6 weeks ago, I noticed that I was having difficulty reading; it was hard to concentrate on the words, and it seeme as if the right side of the words were smudged or blurred. This scared me to death, so I looked in the mirror and did all the typical tests for stroke/TIA. There was no drooping, etc., but the right side of my face appeared blurred in the mirror. My husband took me to the hospital, where I stayed overnight and they did every test possible - CT, MRI, blood work, several neuro workups; nothing at all showed up. The doctor's best guess was that, due to my CLL, the viscosity of my blood might have caused a brief sluggishness and somehow kept blood/oxygen reaching the area of my optic nerve.  He put me on Plavix. My primary doctor sent me to a retina specialist; he found nothing wrong with my retina but believed that the problem was not ""viscosity"" but instead a tiny embolism.  My oncologist agreed, pointing out that cancer patients can be subject to blood clots, and I've stayed on the Plavix. Last night, I had another brief (a few minutes) similar spell; hard to concentrate on blurry words while reading. I didn't really notice the blurring while looking in the mirror, however. It seems to me that, just before I noticed the reading difficulty, I had a hard time enunciating a few words - again, vey brief. (In retrospect, I think this also happened very briefly the first time, though I attributed it to my fear.) I have a scheduled appointment tomorrow with my primary physician and will ask about this. I have been under pretty high stress this week over separate issues. Has anyone experienced anything like this? I wonder what it means that I'd have  the same odd symptoms (eye, possibly speech) twice. And, the second time, while on Plavix? Any and all opinions and experiences are welcomed! 0 likes, 5 replies "

My Uncle, who is/was a healthy 59 year old male, woke up the next morning after being the MC of a wedding, after coming out of the shower, he sat down on a chair after feeling light headed before passing out.  He was able to regain consciousness and walk down to an ambulance that was called for him. 12 hours later he was having brain surgery. As some background, he had been complaining of a headache that seemed to come and go for the last week, there was a sense this could be worse than your usual headache, but stubbornness and whatever got in the way and a doctors visit never eventuated. From what I could understand from the Stroke director and surgeon, the cause was a burst aneurysm, which was apparently a big one.  Somehow (i dont understand much from else from here) a clot formed.  WHen the aneurysm burst i dont understand either. But apparently when the surgeon when in to remove the blood clot they were unable to because it had hardened.  The clot had obviously formed a few days ago and travelled along until it couldnt go any further. But my uncle was admitted to hospital around 10am on Sunday morning but wasnt operated on until later Sunday night, so I guess my first question comes there, if it was a complete blockage wouldnt that warrant emergency surgery?  Would you be able to assume given surgery was put off til later that they wer able to get medication in there to reduce the blockage? Anyway,  so the surgeon had to improvise i suppose, given they were unable to remove the clot, so they cut off vessels surrounding the clot to force a rupture of the clot and that was successful.  THe blood was stopped here for roughly 5 minutes.  I guess that type of method would be  a last resort as who knows what type of damage and to how much of the brain that would have caused, but thats what needed to be done.   I assume only a neuro surgeon would have the right insights on this point, but if there are any of this forum, I would love to know and understand the medical science and methods behind that. So the surgery finished, in about 3 hours & he occupied the ICU for about 8 days. He was obviously heavily sedated until about day 4 or 5 and by day 6/7 he was opening his eyes and holding hands with family, but no talking and no movemnt at all on theright side. The right side of the brain was affected and the stroke director did comment that speech would be affected, but they were not sure by how much and that they were not sure how much impact there would be to the movement of his right side. The good news is that by day 8 he had been moved to the neuro ward, and out of the ICU. Today was day 9, and he seems to have come to some sense at this point, he recognises family, he has been crying and trying to talk, noises come out and you can see the frustration because he knows what he wants to say but just cant. So for the experts, what does that indicate so far? is this normal? Given that it seems he knows what he wants to say but cant, does he need to learn how to talk again? He understands what has happened and when the nurse writes things on a notepad, for eg. poke out your tongue or hold up your arm, he follows perfectly. It's such a shame that this can happen to a 59 year old, but thats life hey. Would love to see some insights and comments to help me understand a bit more. Thanks 0 likes, 2 replies "

The best way to start is usually at the beginning so here goes.  Over a month ago, September 18th, I had sudden strange symptoms that came on with no warning.  It started with an immense tightness and pain in my chest, followed by   and an inability to control thought and process.  after a while the pain dissipated but I was stilled plagued by the aftershock of symptoms that followed.  There was.no drooping of the face or limbs whatsoever, although I couldn't maintain steady thought process and my entire.personality seemed to have been changed.  Normally Im a very artistic and articulated person but that seemed to have vanished.  the awkwardness and fear has been overwhelming at times and although I have been to the ER and after an EKG, having a   done, and been told that no swelling or bleeding could.be found in my brain, I have.not been the same.  I still continue to work full time, but I am not the same person I was.  At the moment, I'm still waiting for results from blood labs that my regular physician recommended and I have had no real change in my symptoms.  Many of the hobbies which mostly include passing guitar and music and reading I can't enjoy any longer because of the lasting effects.  I will admit that I blame myself largely.because I have not been a very healthy person and I take full responsibility for that obviously.  But I am not sure what to expect from here on out and am intensely afraid that it may happen again.  I dont really have anyone to turn to and I appreciate anyone that can.give me their insight on this.  I apologize for such a long.topic.  I greatly thank and appreciate anyone who can help answer even a few questions.  Have a wonderful day!😁 0 likes, 1 reply "

I would appreciate some clarity on a) how 'vulnerable' is vulnerable - ie am I, with what I have mentioned above?  and b) is this 'herd immunity' really going to work in practice? 0 likes, 2 replies "

The metronidazole partly cleared the abscess and then the dentist lanced it. There were unpleasant side-effects from taking the metronidazole: I felt exhausted and had terrible dreams. Also, my mind felt as if it had been put through a shredder. After 3 days, I couldn't stand it any longer so I gave myself Kormanu ( dolphin energy) and after only 10 minutes all the side-effects disappeared.  Kormanu is similar to Reiki which I also practise. On awaking the next morning, I was again feeling shattered so I did 20 minutes of Kormanu and again all the side-effects disappeared. I just wish that I had started the Kormanu sooner. 0 likes, 3 replies "

On the 3rd day of the tablets I found that I just couldnt do anything but go to bed and go to sleep as I felt so absolutely dreadful. I stopped taking them but still 2 days later I am experiencing fatigue. One minute I`m fine and the next I just have to sit down I`m so tired and I cant think straight.  I`m hoping this is just going to wear off. Has anyone else had these after effcts as I`m really starting to worry there might be more to it.

It has been almost a month sonde I have taken the last pill. My BV infection went away however... I still have tingling feet and hands, slight bloat, sore throat, can't lose the weight I gained, abdomen pain. I do not feel normal. I stared to get off skin nodules too. These aren't pimples, they are deep in the skin. Again, not normal for me at al. My question is; is it possible that the antibiotic killed all my good bacteria and my body is now deficient in vital nutrients and vitamins? Also, it altered my metabolism? I also just got a year infection too. It's hard to swallow sometimes, overall throat issue. My symptoms have to be related to the antibiotic, they just have to. I have had more symptoms too. I read that candida is possible after an antibiotic treatment. PLEASE IF ANYONE HAS ANY INSIGHT.  0 likes, 7 replies "

I have never had any problems with Cipro but as I am already on   medication which my doctor knew and he put me on this horrible drug. I literally thought I was having a heart attack. I felt like I was going to jump out of my own skin.   Plus my left side which hurt anyway because of the diverculitis hurt 10 times worse.  I only took 3 of the Flagyl tablets and it has been over 3 months and I had to go up on my anxiety medication because I was having severe panic attacks and my hands shook all the time. I am a bartender at a Country Club and this did not look good. Luckily my doctor did agree it was the Flagyl and is actually helping me in a law suit. This drug needs to be outlawed. I feel so terrible some days and it is hard to even go to work but I have to and I hated having to up my dose of my anxiety medication just to keep my hands steady. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I get less pain, but I feel like I'm on the verge of an anxiety or panic attack. My palms will get really sweaty, I have a very fast heartbeat, I get nauseated, I have a surge of adrenaline, and my hands shake. I take Topamax and Maxalt for the migraines and Zoloft and Valium for my anxiety/panic disorder. My psychiatrist has recently suggested I do an intensive outpatient hospitalization for my anxiety. It appears to be helping, but when I get a migraine all of my anxiety symptoms just rush back. When I take 100mg of Maxalt the symptoms lessen greatly or go away all together. Now I'm just confused.

The very first time it happened I got an aura which started off as a small zig zag line in both eyes. I actually thought I had something in my eye at first and kept rubbing my eyes but it wouldn't go away. Over the next 10 minutes or so it got bigger and bigger until it filled my vision before finally going away. At no point did I get a headache. A few weeks later I got it again but then after I got a headache. I wouldn't call it a bad headache, I didn't really even need to take pain killers. The worst bit though was afterwards when I would feel 'out of it', like everything was too much effort and all I wanted to do was sleep and I would also get really bad neck pain that would last for days. I went to my GP who said it was probably a migraine with aura (I'd never even heard of such a thing). He didn't do any tests just said it was probably stress but I didn't really feel stressed before hand. That said the aura did freak me out so I totally accept I was stressed AFTER getting it. A few weeks passed and then I got another attack, again 1 every day for 3 days. This time I became very nauseous and was being sick whilst I had the aura. The headaches after were more pronounced but not the splitting/crushing feeling that I always thought a migraine was, just a reasonably bad headache. It's worth mentioning here that I was also diagnosed with high cholesterol around this time and already had raised blood pressure and so I decided to go on a diet as I was very overweight. Then they seemed to go away for several months and I thought that perhaps they had gone away. I've now lost over 4 stone (nearly 60lb) and my blood pressure had come down so much that I was taken off medication and now it's a steady 115/75. Then yesterday out of the blue I had another migraine. During the aura phase I took my BP and it had shot up to 150/100 but I kept taking it over and over and as the aura went away over a period of around 10 minutes and my BP came down each time until it was back to 120/80. Again after I got the headache, slight nausea and still neck and today I still feel wiped out, slight nausea and have a slight headache that won't go away and am constantly in fear that he aura will return. What freaks me out and worries me is why have I started getting them at 45 years of age when every Internet search says it's highly unusual to develop migraine in later life? Why do they last for days? Is the aura due to blocked/narrowed blood vessels due to my high cholesterol? Is it normal for BP to shoot up during an attack? Why hasn't my GP referred me for any tests? My GP did give me some medication, can't remember what it was called, and said to take one pill at the start of an attack but that if it didn't help NOT to take the second pill. When I looked up the side effects in the leaflet it said that one of them was death! So I've not taken them and really don't like the idea of trying them.

An MRI shows wear and tear and some disintegration of the cartilage between 3 vertebrae, quite common for my age. The pain actually comes from muscle pain at the back and the sides of my neck. Every now and again I am woken in the early hours with the worst pain in my forehead accompanied by vomiting that lasts most of the day. I have been taking Propranolol for several years for migraine but my usual migraines that started as a child begin with aura then vomiting and pain.

When I was pregnant I started to get migraines every single day, and my doctor wanted to prescribe amitriptyline-being hesitant I waited, but eventually thought I would try it as I was desperate. To my surprise, I did not have a single headache for the rest of my pregnancy, and not until I was 4 months post-partum when I started getting my period again. Now-I am back to the usual 1-2 migraines a week, and upwards of 4 around the time of ovulation & my period. I was on birth control in college (regular & low dose) hoping one of those would help them and it didn't seem to-however after I quit taking it they actually got better but it almost seems like they are worse again. I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and figured out what helped them. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I am a 23yr old Female, my   started March 2015, and ever since I havent had a moment without it. My headache feels like a very tight pressure all around my head - like my head is being squeezed hard. I have sore areas on my scalp. My face is numb + tingley(feels like little bugs are running across my face) and also my face can feel like its drooping when its physically not. I have all the symptoms of migraine - light/sound sensitivity, and also smells make me feel sick. My eyes constantly ache. I get a throbbing pressure in my gums and behind my nose and also feel pressure in my ears (like when you are on plane). I developed   a month after my headachend it hasnt stopped ever since. My neck, shoulders and top of my back constanly ache like hell to - which doesnt help when my job consists of sitting at a computer 8 hours a day!  I have seen 3 neurologists - one diagnosing me with chronic tension headache, the most recent 2 I have seen have told me chronic daily Migraine. I have tried Amytriptaline,Nortriptyline,Propranalol, and Candersartan (Apologies for the spellings)- these have had no effect at all. I have had the steroid injections in my head which gave me no relief. I have bought a mouth guard from the dentist as she said it sounds like I am grinding my teeth at night- after a few months of wearing this I didnt notice any difference.  I saw a Chiropractor who told me my neck is pushing forwards and blamed my headache on this, but after 4 months of attending 3 times a week I felt no different. I have recently payed to find out if i have any food intolerences - which came back that I had, but after cutting out the foods I felt no different. I really am sick of false hope and really am at my witts end. I am waiting on an appointment for my first botox injections. Im finding it so hard to lead a normal life with this and often have suicidal thoughts. The only thing that stops me if the thought of leaving my loved ones behind.  Its a nightmare trying to work full time with this, but also know if I claimed any disability allowences it would certainly make things easier by not having to be stressed at work, but would mean no money to pay bills - this would lead to more stress.  I feel so trapped and feel like im never going to feel ok again. I now suffer from anxiety + depression. It really effects my relationship with my boyfriend as I am always down and miserable, and we can never do things togther because of my head. I met him 10 months ago when I had the headache, so he has never really met the real me! I feel no one understands apart from the people I have been speaking to on this site, but everyones story is different. I really need some words of wisdom, and to know even though I feel so lonely, I am not alone. Can anyone out there please offer any advise or share anything that has helped you? I cannot bear the thought of living like this for the rest of my life, and refuse to!

Three days later, I woke up to a zig zag pattern which turned into a bright arch that made its way across my vision in about 20 minutes. Then, two days after the second, I had another zig zag only aura while in doctor's office waiting room. To be totally honest, I feel like I have PTSD. I am completely traumatized by the whole experience. I know it may seem silly to some of you, but I truly had no idea what was happening to me. I thought I was fainting due to a heavy perimenopausal period. I'm not sure how to get over this fear. I send every day worrying that it will happen again.

I don't feel anything during the aura, only panic, my hands starts to shake because I'm afraid.  I don't like seeing things disappearing. A week ago I did ecg: heart was ok. Blood pressure was bit high for a 27 yo like me but nothing scary. I'm in a good shape, although My sleep pattern is messed, I go to sleep at 4:00 am wakeup 2:00 pm. The thing is: since October last year I sort of got a panic attack when I was walking on streets, and I got afraid of walking alone. All this time I got secluded home, always anxious I never thought this aura thing would happen with me. It happens with both eyes . Headaches always happened to me before I experienced this aura for the first time. I remember going back home after work with throbbing  headaches allmost eveeryday, eyepain too.

If others are currently dieting, please add your experiences here. I would like to discover whether we gain weight on mirtazapine purely because it increases our appetite, or whether other factors are at play. I certainly gained weight quickly when I started on mirtazapine (around 1.5 stone). My appetite was revenous, especially for sugary foods. I tried to com off mirtazapine around 6 months in and failed. I lost half a stone in the week I waas off it, but most of that was due to severe nausea. When I went back on the drug I did not gain more than a couple of pounds, but I was being very careful what I ate. My weight has been steady now for two years. I am not happy carrying around the extra stone however, and so have decided to diet. I am on day 8 and it is VERY hard. But I have lost two pounds so far. This is with me still eating 1700 - 1800 calories a day. I have a very active physical job and so my daily calorie requirement is 2100.  I have also started taking raspberry ketones and green coffee bean extract as of this morning in the hope that it will help me to burn fat. The interesting thing is, the amouont of weight I have lost is the same as would be expected from a person who is not on mirtazapine. 2 likes, 199 replies "

Over 8 months I’d gone from 13st11 to a whopping 16st -I tried eating healthily exercising nothing changed - insatiable appetite - constantly grazing in the fridge - cramming food - not like me at all- weight just climbed I’ve been off Mirt now for6 days - of course I’m not expecting to get away with out side effects from cold turkey withdrawal -BUT I have to report I’ve had none so far - I feel fresher than I’ve felt in years - I don’t dread the day anymore which is so strange the fog has almost gone . The vivid dreams have gone  too - were amazing initially but as the months wore on - became exhausting -but now coming off them -I’m still sleeping well and I’m so thankful for that . Importantly - as this was itself adding to the downward spiral and fog - I’ve dropped 7lbs in weight. I started taking Magnesium  and vitamin B the day I stopped -  1 per day -  advice from others on this forum and the health shop Im only giving my experience here we are all different  I know others have had a terrible time withdrawing- but I just wanted to share a positive story - good luck to anyone thinking of or going through the same process I’m here if anyone wants to talk or pm me .  Maybe the Mirtdid it’s job - I still don’t know -maybe I’ll never know - i do know my character and life changed for the worse - it affected my family too - as a result of going on them and I’ll personally never use the drug again .

Let me tell you my story I am 30 years old social drinker(6 years I have been drinking) 2-3 packs on weekends. I used to drink with my friends , they have way more capacity they I do like 1/2 bottle per social event . I used to tell them , don't drink these much guys you may get liver diseases but latter unfortunately I was diagnosed with CP. One night I was with friends I drank beyond my capacity 5-6 packs drinks and when I came home I started puking very badly and some how I manage to sleep next morning I started again puking it went to 2-3 hours then I become sober. 6 months pass by I didn't notices significant change in my health but stool color become lighter and started experience little bit back pain. Then my annual check came all test were normal (lipase ,liver , pancreas , kidney function, cbc you named it ) . after few months I notice I was losing weight without trying and also stool started floating and never sink. I realize something wrong going on, then went to doctor and got diagnose with CP. These are common symptom I am seeing in many forum and article . 1.) stool color become lighter and start float 2.) back pain especially after eating because stomach start pressing pancreas against back bone and it has of lot nerves which trigger back pain. I may be wrong but if you see these sign for 1-2 months, go to your doctor and checkout. As you all, its very hard to accept this disease for me as well , especially at this point of my life where I am at top of my career and only bread earner at home and 2 kids to take care of. I felt very irresponsible . I seen lot of people around me who drink all their life without any issue. I felt regretful and ashamed. I read lot of CP patient going through pain . I am not afraid it now but only thing I am worried about my kids I have lot dream for them. Now when I see in their eyes my heart sank . At present my symptoms are floating stool , losing weight and back pain after eating. I never had acute pancreas and never hospitalize for any reason. All you have good night .

Let me tell you my story I am 30 years old social drinker(6 years I have been drinking) 2-3 packs on weekends. I used to drink with my friends , they have way more capacity they I do like 1/2 bottle per social event . I used to tell them , don't drink these much guys you may get liver diseases but latter unfortunately I was diagnosed with CP. One night I was with friends I drank beyond my capacity 5-6 packs drinks and when I came home I started puking very badly and some how I manage to sleep next morning I started again puking it went to 2-3 hours then I become sober. 6 months pass by I didn't notices significant change in my health but stool color become lighter and started experience little bit back pain. Then my annual check came all test were normal (lipase ,liver , pancreas , kidney function, cbc you named it ) . after few months I notice I was losing weight without trying and also stool started floating and never sink. I realize something wrong going on, then went to doctor and got diagnose with CP. These are common symptom I am seeing in many forum and article . 1.) stool color become lighter and start float 2.) back pain especially after eating because stomach start pressing pancreas against back bone and it has of lot nerves which trigger back pain. I may be wrong but if you see these sign for 1-2 months, go to your doctor and checkout. As you all, its very hard to accept this disease for me as well , especially at this point of my life where I am at top of my career and only bread earner at home and 2 kids to take care of. I felt very irresponsible . I seen lot of people around me who drink all their life without any issue. I felt regretful and ashamed. I read lot of CP patient going through pain . I am not afraid it now but only thing I am worried about my kids I have lot dream for them. Now when I see in their eyes my heart sank . At present my symptoms are floating stool , losing weight and back pain after eating. I never had acute pancreas and never hospitalize for any reason. All you have good night .

I think i may get into the surgeon next week which would be exactly 2 months from my wedding day. From your experiences, how serious are the lip and mouth drooping? Is it minor and something that only you could notice on yourself? Or should i be concerned and be waiting till after the wedding to have this done?

I have suffered with anxiety for years but the last 12 weeks have been terrible. It started with a neck injury that happened around then, I do believe this was an issue that was caused by injury as opposed to anything else even though I woke up with a sore neck suddenly one morning but it had obviously affected muscles in the area and i had worked out the night before. My anxiety has been through the roof ever since and have trouble sleeping, however I have had these symptoms for years. The neck has got better but still not right. Anyway over the weekend I woke up on Sunday with a lump in my throat on the right hand side. it literally came up over night. I felt like I was coming down with a cough or cold which my baby and girlfriend have had and my glands swelled up. They went back down mostly pretty quickly although a couple are still slightly raised. I've been to the doctor again and this was more in relation to my anxiety but she has referred me for blood and mentioned it could be thyroid issues. Since the lump appeared I have been very sensitive to heat and my insomnia has been much worse. The cold never really developed in to anything but I get occasional very light phlegm and a little cough. There could be very minor pressure transferring to my ear. It all seems to be on the right hand side. There is obviously a swelling somewhere and it seems to be coming from the thyroid area which is causing the swallowing sensation, it isn't getting better and might be getting slightly worse however it only flared up on Sunday. I have lost weight over the last few weeks however I have been super anxious and I just dont know if this potential thyroid issue is related or has just flared up over the weekend. The neck injury probably isnt related but thought it may be worth mentioning. I am male 32. Any responses are greatly appreciated. Thanks Adam 0 likes, 0 replies "

I'm struggling to type and write, as my cognitive abilities are straining, lacking. I feel as though I lost 40 IQ points in the last year. I struggle with memory, I'm very weak and extremely exhausted. I have had previous surgeries to have cysts removed. Hysterectomy at 28. Appendix at 16, Gall bladder removal at 38. which all made me very sick. Now that I'm 45, I can say I have never been so I'll. About 4 years ago, I went to the ER, as I was weak and very ill. Blood Tests confirmed mono, but I was told I had a node on my Thyroid which was very small and I shouldn't be concerned, most people have these and are fine. I was also told I had Deginerative disc disease at the same time. The Thyroid node was very concerning to me, as my mother passed away from her node, her node also metastasized into her lungs. she was scheduled for surgery to remove said node, the morning she passed away.  As you can see, the node bothered me. In the county I live in, there are only 3 Endocrinologists in my area and set up an appointment as soon as possible, which was 4 months away.  I finally went in, he performed an ultrasound and even though I stated my concerns over family history. He said there was no need to worry, no need for further testing, it was too small to remove, and so we are going to monitor ever 6 months. Each follow-up appointment, was the same discussion. No need to worry, it's growing, but growing slowly. no worries. No Testing, see you in 6 months. After my last appointment 13 months ago, he said I will see you next year. It's growing so slowly, we can now see each other once per year. After the first initial visit with the endocrinologist, I seemed to never get over mono it seemed. Constantly sick to my stomach, tachycardia episodes. Migraines, losing my vision, throbbing behind my eyes. Throbbing pain that would come and go. 6 months after meeting the Endocrinologist, started hospital stays. My triglycerides were high at 2600. My blood pressure was sky high. Potassium low, calcium high TSH 3.15. Testing was done throughout, stress tests, cardiograms, ultrasounds on my heart. I have boughts of diahrrea and constipation. Was diagnosed with IBD. Later with a hernia right side, upper stomach and hernia where my stomach is going into my lung area. Through the last 4 year's I've been treated like a hypochondriac, because I'm sick. Told I'm just depressed, side effect of IBD. All my doctors as of 6 months ago, I fired. I've started over again, but just recently because I quit my job, I'm truly I'll. Since last October, I'm on antinausea, I've lost 50 lbs and can't think my way out of a wet bag. I now have 3 golf ball size cysts on my thyroid, mid throat and under my tongue. I have a new baby cyst on my pancreas, but my Now doc says it's probably a fatty deposit, I have a small cyst in my liver and my pcp says it's probably just a blood clot. So let me get this straight. let's all assume, not eating, vomiting, Diaharrea, weakness, lethargic, extreme thirst, headaches, pain up my neck and now extends into my brain. coughing, chocking on water, I feel like I have a bone stuck on my throat. I want to stick a hanger down my throat to remove the blockage, I'm desperate for relief. I have horse voice, lose my voice and always clearing my throat, and I never ask for pain medication, because then I would be a drug attic. I did ask for prednisone but was denied. I have to have help to the bathroom, I never leave my home now and my consists of taking medicine and just keeping water down. I have another ultrasound on Thursday, but I feel like it's pointless. I'm tired of arguing with everyone. I use a walker to get around, but ready to use wheel chair full time, I'm so weak. I'm scared to death because I feel like I'm dying and I'm the only person fighting for me and now I'm too weak. my last TSH was 1.3. Any ideas? Anyone out there with thyroid cancer have the same symptoms? Anyone have any advice for me? Help! 0 likes, 5 replies "

The surgeon was very happy - PTH fell already during the operation and my calcium was normal when they discharged me. I have since developed pins and needles and have been taking calcium supplement.  The scar itself doesn't bother me at all and I don't need painkillers anymore, which is great. However, I am still very weak and still mostly in bed. Is it normal? Am I expecting too much too soon? Is it to do with calcium maybe falling too low? How many days should it take before I feel strong enough to even look after myself? When should I start to worry? Thanks 5 likes, 88 replies "

Extra info: Im 24 y/o female, had hashimotos with uncontrollable levels since i was 6 y/o, and i've had kidney stones since i was 12. (currently have one in each kidney that im trying to pass). Any opinions? Im at a loss. Im getting another ultrasound in 4 days. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I had my thyroid completely removed around this time last year at the age of 19, after suffering from an overactive thyroid due to Grave's disease since I was around 16. For those three years I'd been on varying doses of carbimazole and propranolol because my thyroid would return to normal for a couple of weeks, before relapsing to be even worse than it was before I went into remission. I couldn't take the back and forth anymore, on top of battling the side effects of such a high dosage of carbimazole (eventually 50mg, if I remember correctly). I had gotten into my top choice university, but my grades began to suffer terribly throughout all of this and i had to make the tough decision to 'drop out' temporarily due to illness, and repeat a year. This has been a truly painful journey. I thought it would all be over if I just removed my thyroid altogether...I was told at the time that i was pretty treatment-resistant to the carbimazole, since I kept getting worse whenever the dosage was changed. So I opted for the surgery instead of the radioactive iodine therapy, for fear that I could become overactive again, and potentially have to drop out of uni forever. In that time i was suffering tremendous pain all over, bulging gritty red eyes from  , inability to sleep longer than 3 hours at a time,   and suicidal ideation...it's difficult to recall all those painful memories. Since having my thyroid removed, I seem to have only replaced those problems with new ones. My bulging eyes are still there (though my TED seems to be inactive now, which I'm immensely relieved about), my weight is all over the place despite my appetite being low, my stomach is constantly distended to varying degrees (I always look pregnant) and i often find it difficult to keep meals down if they are too large (embarrassingly i am also quite constipated..) yet I am currently on 200mcg of Levothyroxine! The doctors all told me that I would be just like everyone else once I recovered from the surgery...but I feel terrible. I feel so defeated, like there's nothing else I can do...I have all these symptoms that sound suspiciously like I'm underactive, yet all my bloods are within normal range. Levothyroxine is the only drug available for this on the NHS, but it seems like it might be the culprit for all these issues...maybe my body can't process it well enough? I feel so hopeless. I tried to tell my endocrinologist about this a few weeks after my surgery, but he told me it was nothing and took me off of the register. Since then i've been going to the GP nearly every other week with the same problems, only to find that my old endocrinologist had responded to her emails saying that I must not be taking my medication...I'm at my wits end, and so, so hopeless.

I had my thyroid completely removed around this time last year at the age of 19, after suffering from an overactive thyroid due to Grave's disease since I was around 16. For those three years I'd been on varying doses of carbimazole and propranolol because my thyroid would return to normal for a couple of weeks, before relapsing to be even worse than it was before I went into remission. I couldn't take the back and forth anymore, on top of battling the side effects of such a high dosage of carbimazole (eventually 50mg, if I remember correctly).

I've recently been re-referred to my dermatologist who advised me to go back to the routine of using the Dermovate every day for a month, then twice a week for a month and repeat, until the inflammation clears.  I asked her about flareups and she said to still use that same routine.  I presume I stop once everything is clear.  I have been totally clear once and the dermatologist then discharged me, only for the LP to come back with a vengeance a few weeks later! Can others tell me how they use Dermovate?  If it flares, do you use it differently?  If I use the one month daily, then twice a week routine and it clears, then flares a few weeks later, do you think I then go back to following the same routine?  You'd think, after 4 years, I'd be more on the ball with this, but I do find the Dermovate use confusing, as I'm particularly aware of what a strong steroid it is.

Sorry in advance for TMI. I think I've probably got VLP & OLP.  For 3-4 months I've felt a bit of itch/irritation when washing down below, but didn't think much of it, and it seemed to improve. I'm 35 and not currently in a sexual relationship. Anyhow, I had a look with a mirror the other day and found two vulval lesions, one each side. One is very small and just inside labia majora, and on the other side its a bigger area, extending from labia minora outwards towards labia majora. Both lesions are kind of lilac/white colour, and I cant see any erosions. GP didn't seem too worried but suggested gynae assessment, and prescribed betamethasone cream. I'm seeing a gynae next week. I was worried about VIN but all smears have been clear, and GP said it might be LP. I've now looked in my mouth and can see white lacy patches inside both cheeks, mainly by my back teeth, but again no erosions and it isn't painful. The vulval lesions aren't sore, although with hindsight it does burn if I pee right after having a shower. The more I read about LP, the more terrified I am! Given the oral lesions, I'm guessing this will be the diagnosis, and I have been going  through a period of stress. I am wondering if it's possible to have a mild or non-erosive form of OLP/VLP? From what I can see, no erosions or loss of structures at the moment. Thanks in advance for any advice or support. Feel so alone and scared! 0 likes, 14 replies "

As per clockwork, I received a letter last month for a MRI scan, which I had.  Yesterday I received a call from the consultant who advised me that the scan came back normal on the area of where the tumour was, however, they noticed a abnormality of 8mm on my parotid. What does an abnormality actually mean?  He could give me no more information and said I would receive a letter for a ultrasound and fine needle aspiration biopsy appointment shortly. I pressed for more information and he said as he wasn't a specialist in this field, he couldn't comment on what the scan had found, and I would have an appointment with a specialist in the next few weeks. The only thing he did say is that it's good that it's only 8mm and it's been caught before it could grow. I am sick with worry, I have been going crazy on Google and am thinking the absolute worst. Is it a tumour? Is it a stone? Is it cancerous? I haven't slept or ate as I'm sick with worry, I don't know how to tell my parents or wife. I feel fine and can't feel any lumps around my jaw area. Has anyone had similar experiences? Will I need an operation and chemo? What's the process from here?

The only other Place that does that is the U.K.  I read alot of post on forums of people having alot of problems due to no drain. Well anyway after surgery I had alot of imflamation I went back and forth to my doctor to be checked almost 2 weeks later I knew something was wrong because I still had alot of pain n swelling so I went to the ER and ended up having a bad infection during to the inflammation they said I was in the hospital 4 days on heavy antibiotics and pain med. Thry did another scan and it turned out the stone in my duct wasn't removed and also showed another stone in my mouth I had an office procedure done last week but my doctor didnt know that the stones were so deep and he couldnt get them out  So now I'm having another surgery Jan 28th. I still have pain in my mouth when I eat or drink. and  the pain in my ear is back  once again. My neck is is swollen under my chin still till those 2 stones come out  I strongly recommend to anyone having problems dont wait too long to get the gland removed  I did and ended up with a cyst that burst when my doctor opened me and my vein started bleeding and wouldn't stop which I think made my oxygen level go very low  during surgery. U will have pain after surgery and pain in your ear and pain in the face which is the nerves coming back to life numbness on tour bottom lip which will all go away in time This surgery is a very delicate surgery. Also make sure u go home with pain meds because  will need them . Also my doctor gave me a low dosage of nerve med for the nerve pain in my face it helped alot. my incision  looks good no hard lumps at all bc I had the drainage. Make sure u get the drainage i had it for 2 days and then had it taken out by my doctor If anyone has any questions I would be happy to help Hope my post helps anyone who needs answers 1 like, 2 replies "

I figured it was just the weather and drank more water/tea/coffee etc.  The first few days it started happening water wasn't quenching my thirst, and I thought that was odd, but I drank coffee a few times and it actually coated my mouth and made my mouth feel wet enough to sleep. I wouldn't say it's gotten too much worse over the last week, but it's started to become an issue in my day to day life, I am constantly thirsty, I'll drink something and then 20-30 seconds later I'll water another drink, today I've already drank almost three 32oz gatorade bottles. I notice my mouth is extremely dry but then whenever I drink/eat something my mouth gets extremely moist as if the glands are being called to action but otherwise my mouth starts to dry up again. What is even weirder is,  most of the time I can produce saliva but it literally does nothing, my mouth still feels dry even when there's tons of saliva in my mouth, the only time my mouth feels really good is when I am eating or drinking.

But I've never had that extremely dry sensation before. That same day, I also noticed the top of my mouth was swollen and in slight pain, nothing unbearable. But it was definitely a pain on the top of my mouth, then I slept for 14 hours, I was hoping the dryness would just go away, so I just kept sleeping and hoping, I woke up and the dryness persisted but the top of my mouth is basically healed now, and now I have a new bump, it's on my tongue (which is in the picture) I can't imagine this being diabetes as I am pretty active even though I eat bad, and I'm only 29.

I will say my experience with these stones was fustrating and painful.  Although it can be excurcitingly painful, there is often no quick solution to it. The first time I experience the problem was about 3.5 years ago.  After eating, underneath my chin would swell for 45 minutes to a couple hours.  While the swelling was uncomfortable, I don't remember it as particularly painful.  I went to a number of ENT appointments and had an x-ray taken, but the ENT was never able to confirm the stone, although we both felt pretty confident it was the problem.   I was put on predisone.  I wish the doctor would have gone into more detail about how this medication can affect you.  I had horrible side effects, including: headaches, auditory hallucinations, extreme mood swings, chills and general discomfort.  The predisone did not seem to clear up the stones immediately, but a couple weeks after taking it the problem did go away.   The gland did not give me much of a problem the next 3 years.  It might swell with a single meal every 8-10 months, but nothing of note. This last weekend it began swelling after every meal like the old days.  On a Saturday, the fourth of July, the gland swelled and did not go down after eating.  I rarely drink and I was drinking that day, I'll personally say that I felt beer very much agravated the stone and was at least partially responsible for it getting infected.  Sunday the gland stays inflamed, over the next 48 hours the beginning of what would be excruciating soreness and pain began. It spread to the other side of my neck/chin, throat, jaw gone, teeth and even what felt to be my ear by the end of it.  I also had discomfort and pain when swallowing.  I have since come to understand that the lingering swelling was caused by the infection.  There was puss coming out of the gland underneath my tongue, which was one clue to the infection.  On Monday I went to the ER and then followed up with an ENT specialist.  I was placed on Keflex (antibiotic) and ibprofen, at that point I declined the predisone as I wasn't sure it had done much the last time and it caused horrible side-effects.  I was also instructured to suck on lemon drops, drink lots of water, apply a hot compress and massaged inside/outside of the mouth on the gland.  I did all of these things as religiously as I could.  My plan with the doctor was to regroup in a week after trying these things.  Monday night/Tuesday morning I had extreme pain and started to feel a lot of anxiety about feeling this way for an entire week.  I called the doctor Tuesday morning and told her what I just wrote (I was extremely emotional from the pain and lack of sleep).  I decided to try the prenisone again and she wrote a script for pain management.  I will say calling my doctor was a very good decision, if you experiencing worsening of your symtoms, even if it is mostly increased pain, please call your physician and find a better plan of care.  She ordered a CT for early the next week too.   I took the predisone around 2pm this afternoon.  I continued with the others instruction (lemon drops, warm compress, massaging gland, etc).  Pain seemed to get to a more managable level about 4 hours after taking the medication and another dose of ibprofen (600 mg), still a lot of discomfort though. Well about 6pm I begin pushing a LOT of pus out while massaging the gland, it just kept coming for about an hour.  At this point I could finally visualize the stone on the base of gland and was excited because I thought this meant the doctor would be able to remove it.  Luckily for me, it popped right out.  I could immediately feel the gland relieving some of the pressure and an hour later am experiencing  only some lingering swelling (much reduced) and tenderness on the outside of my neck/chin.  No pain when swallowing anymore.  No pain underneath the tongue.   If anyone is ever dealing with a similar situation, I'd love to answer questions about when helped me.  I feel like I was really scared and anxious through this process and I'd like to help others that might be going through it.  0 likes, 26 replies "

The first time I experience the problem was about 3.5 years ago.  After eating, underneath my chin would swell for 45 minutes to a couple hours.  While the swelling was uncomfortable, I don't remember it as particularly painful.  I went to a number of ENT appointments and had an x-ray taken, but the ENT was never able to confirm the stone, although we both felt pretty confident it was the problem.   I was put on predisone.  I wish the doctor would have gone into more detail about how this medication can affect you.  I had horrible side effects, including: headaches, auditory hallucinations, extreme mood swings, chills and general discomfort.  The predisone did not seem to clear up the stones immediately, but a couple weeks after taking it the problem did go away.   The gland did not give me much of a problem the next 3 years.  It might swell with a single meal every 8-10 months, but nothing of note. This last weekend it began swelling after every meal like the old days.  On a Saturday, the fourth of July, the gland swelled and did not go down after eating.  I rarely drink and I was drinking that day, I'll personally say that I felt beer very much agravated the stone and was at least partially responsible for it getting infected.  Sunday the gland stays inflamed, over the next 48 hours the beginning of what would be excruciating soreness and pain began. It spread to the other side of my neck/chin, throat, jaw gone, teeth and even what felt to be my ear by the end of it.  I also had discomfort and pain when swallowing.  I have since come to understand that the lingering swelling was caused by the infection.  There was puss coming out of the gland underneath my tongue, which was one clue to the infection.  On Monday I went to the ER and then followed up with an ENT specialist.  I was placed on Keflex (antibiotic) and ibprofen, at that point I declined the predisone as I wasn't sure it had done much the last time and it caused horrible side-effects.  I was also instructured to suck on lemon drops, drink lots of water, apply a hot compress and massaged inside/outside of the mouth on the gland.  I did all of these things as religiously as I could.  My plan with the doctor was to regroup in a week after trying these things.  Monday night/Tuesday morning I had extreme pain and started to feel a lot of anxiety about feeling this way for an entire week.  I called the doctor Tuesday morning and told her what I just wrote (I was extremely emotional from the pain and lack of sleep).  I decided to try the prenisone again and she wrote a script for pain management.  I will say calling my doctor was a very good decision, if you experiencing worsening of your symtoms, even if it is mostly increased pain, please call your physician and find a better plan of care.  She ordered a CT for early the next week too.   I took the predisone around 2pm this afternoon.  I continued with the others instruction (lemon drops, warm compress, massaging gland, etc).  Pain seemed to get to a more managable level about 4 hours after taking the medication and another dose of ibprofen (600 mg), still a lot of discomfort though. Well about 6pm I begin pushing a LOT of pus out while massaging the gland, it just kept coming for about an hour.  At this point I could finally visualize the stone on the base of gland and was excited because I thought this meant the doctor would be able to remove it.  Luckily for me, it popped right out.  I could immediately feel the gland relieving some of the pressure and an hour later am experiencing  only some lingering swelling (much reduced) and tenderness on the outside of my neck/chin.  No pain when swallowing anymore.  No pain underneath the tongue.   If anyone is ever dealing with a similar situation, I'd love to answer questions about when helped me.  I feel like I was really scared and anxious through this process and I'd like to help others that might be going through it.  0 likes, 26 replies "

To start, I am 53 years old now and am officially menopausal.  Over the last 10 years, I've had my one or two GYNs tell me they thought I had LS.  I had lots of burning symptoms, always thought I had an infection, etc.  When I was younger, I used to have noticeable discoloration.  As I got older, that sort of thing seemed to stop.   I've never in my life had any noticeable labia minora so I don't know if they fused/flattened when I was very young or I was born that way.  I always felt I was abnormal in that regard but who knows. As I entered  , the only thing I really noticed was that my clitoral area seemed to be shrinking and less pronounced.  This was really when I was feeling it, not visually--just not as plump as it used to be, but what is?  I never really looked at it.  Upon entering menopause, I actually started to feel better down there because I had much less natural discharge and I think that helped.  My GYN prescribed some Premarin cream and told me to ""use it when I felt like it."" At some point through all of this, I did have a vulvar   which came back negative,although I can't say I have a lot of faith in that biopsy or the pathology.  I just mean to say that I don't know if I have LS or not, but I have a problem. So last week, I noticed a sensation of a slight pinprick occasionally in the clitoral area.  It was extremely minor and with my lifelong irriations, it was barely a blip in my radar.  But after 3 days of it happening, I thought I should investigate. Upon palpation, I felt a hard nodule in my clitoral hood area (prepuce) that goes all the way up to where the labia majora join together at the top.  As you get close to the clitoris, it flattens and feels normal.  The lump does not hurt at all and is rubbery, but the clitoris is what the sensation comes from. On visual examination, the area with the lump is is normal looking.  However, I noticed that I can no longer actually see my clitoris (the hood won't pull back) and below the area, the skin is fused together.  Vaginal opening is normal.   Got into my doctor on Friday and he diagnosed with clitoral agglutination.  Gave me premarin cream to use everyday for two weeks, told me to manually ""work"" the area 2-3 times a day.  I am just sick over this.  I didn't even know it was happening.  As for the lump, he doesn't think it's anything and may be due to the clitoral hood not functiong/moving properly so it's swelling.  I can find NOTHING on the net about this sort of thing. I've been reading this site since yesterday.  Read all about the borax stuff, which I may try.  I also have clobetesol from awhile ago that I will use.One side of my clitoral hood is hardened and whitish. I guess I'm looking on de-fusion success stories or something.  I can't stop thinking about this and what it means for me lifelong. Thanks, Christine 1 like, 56 replies "

Results just came back today. As we thought, thyroid antibodies were high. No. was 12.9 on a range of 0 to 0 .9, so about 13 times higher than should have been. The good news was that the antinuclear antibody (ANA) and Sedimentation rate (Sed) were normal so no evidence of other AI illnesses which is good and tells me not to look there. That door is closed for now. But,  2 questions, why is the body attacking thyroid tissue? and how is it connected to LS/other stuff?    Back to the drawing board. Ya'll be well.    biscuit 0 likes, 16 replies "

I have over the past few months developed white crinkly patches that crater on my vulva and pubis. I have some circular soreless (they look like pock marks and did not ulcerate) craters and constant burning. I also developed an ulcer on my clitoral hood that looked slightly herpetic however, it was swabbed and negative and I haven't had one since so I was wondering if LS can cause this? It is driving me mad and I have been obsessing over whether I have herpes but these other patches and symptoms do not resemble herpes symptoms. I was just wondering if some people could advise whilst I wait to see a doctor. The patches do not show up well on camera. Thanks in advance. 1 like, 5 replies "

I am a 36 year old male and here is my story. In November 2018 I noticed a spot on the bottom of my glans penis  which was raised sightly and white in appeaeance. Went to GP who advised genital wart and to go to GUM clinic who diagnosed as genital wart and gave  Cyrotherapy and left me with cream to use if wound didnt heal. Used cream - terrible reaction left a gash where ""wart"" had been. Wound healed although ""wart"" re appeared and then took on a more flat appearance and began expanding in an oval shape. Back to GUM and more cyrotherapy. This did not really work and was obviously painful so i discontinued and left the area alone as was trying for baby with my wife. More of these areas began to develop on bottom of my glans and also foreskin. I am married and faithful so it was not great to declare warts to my wife. August 2019 I notice blisters inside my cheeks burst and leave white lacey patterns. Trip to dentist who says he thinks it is oral Lichen Planus. Biopsy was ordered (due at Dental hospital April 2020) athough surely will be pushed back due to current pandemic. At the time i made no colleration between the Oral LP and my penis situation.. Then at an appt with dermatologist to asses a rash on my ankle (discoid eczema apparently) the dermatologist looked inside my mouth and confirmed oral lp. Asked him to look at penis and he immediately confirmed it was not a wart but was also lichen planus. He then examined my fingernails and said i have early stages of LP in my nails too. Dermatology in UK is so busy i had 5 mins and was basically rushed out and told my GP would prescribe some dermovate cream for my penis, no follow up given with dermatologist. Only when i got out did I research penile lichen planus and began to freak..... Not sure whether i have penile lichen planus or lichen sclerosus or whether lichen sclerosus is just the name for penile lichen planus????

Are these conditions the same? I feel like no one is interested in following up with me or taking time to even review my situation. NB Just stared Dermovate today. NB. October 2018 I find out my mum has lung cancer, then discoid eczema and penile LP starts Nov/Dec 2018. Then July 2019 My wife has miscarriage while my mum is in hospital with Pneumonia.. August 2019 the oral LP appears.... Then Feb 2020 we get Advised my mum is terminal with months to live potentially. March 2020 more eczema appears on leg.   Before all this I had no noticeable symptoms of Eczema or Lichen Planus.... Surely the above is no co-incidence though.

I am a 36 year old male and here is my story. In November 2018 I noticed a spot on the bottom of my glans penis  which was raised sightly and white in appeaeance. Went to GP who advised genital wart and to go to GUM clinic who diagnosed as genital wart and gave  Cyrotherapy and left me with cream to use if wound didnt heal. Used cream - terrible reaction left a gash where ""wart"" had been. Wound healed although ""wart"" re appeared and then took on a more flat appearance and began expanding in an oval shape. Back to GUM and more cyrotherapy. This did not really work and was obviously painful so i discontinued and left the area alone as was trying for baby with my wife. More of these areas began to develop on bottom of my glans and also foreskin. I am married and faithful so it was not great to declare warts to my wife. August 2019 I notice blisters inside my cheeks burst and leave white lacey patterns. Trip to dentist who says he thinks it is oral Lichen Planus. Biopsy was ordered (due at Dental hospital April 2020) athough surely will be pushed back due to current pandemic. At the time i made no colleration between the Oral LP and my penis situation.. Then at an appt with dermatologist to asses a rash on my ankle (discoid eczema apparently) the dermatologist looked inside my mouth and confirmed oral lp. Asked him to look at penis and he immediately confirmed it was not a wart but was also lichen planus. He then examined my fingernails and said i have early stages of LP in my nails too.

I admit prior to this i had used some vinegar on my vulva in an attempt to remove vestibular papillomatosis overgrowth  that was bothering me, but i dont know how it is influencing this,over 3 months after. i did get 2 spots on my vaginal introitus/vestibule that are red and raw and still havent healed, i cant help wonder if my doctor had seen them before or if they appeared after from the vinegar,but they should have healed anyways,since its been so long and my doctor upon seeing them sent me home with a healing cream called cicalfate that is basically made of emolients such as zinc oxide. the red areas are now developing white spots and i dont know if it is a sign of healing or not. all i know is that i have to use this cream everyday on my vulva because it burns so much. even wearing pants and sitting for too long is painful. My doctor and my parents think all of this is from taking the antibiotic for the infection (flagyl). but its been almost 2 months after taking it and the red areas where probably there before. and what makes me think i have something else besides just possible chemical burns or irritation is these new areas that ive spotted a couple of days ago upon applying the cream (i use a mirror to do it). they are whitish but not too obvious,they feel smooth and look a bit shiny. they dont itch,but on the right labia minora they look the worst. there is a part in specific that worries me alot. the corner, closer to the urethra, ( as you will see in the photos) feels like its ""pulling""some sort of scarring happening that makes it feel and look different when i try to spread that side open. i dont know whatelse to do. i went to gyno ( last week,before even noticing the white spots) and she barely looked at me,she said it was a fungus due to the antibiotics and gave me fluconazole ( 2 pills) and a cream that has hydrocortisone  and miconazole that was to be applied for a week. I used it and it burnt so much with no improvement, i assume its because the red areas are wounds not just redness underneath the skin. I dont know what to do. Im 21 and a broke college student,my family is overprotective and has been going and paying for these appointments,but they have now given up. they say its just a side effect from the antibiotic and believe its all in my head. im going in to my family doctor again  in 2 days and i already know she will take a 3 second look at me and ignore what im going through. i just want a diagnosis and proper treatment.

481,C0085166,Bacterial Vaginosis,C0030193,Pain,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-journey-through-ls-732244,MY JOURNEY THROUGH LS,"My journey through LS I was diagnosed with LS about 2 and a half years ago. I was scared, horrified and couldn't believe what was going on ""down there"" and what I saw when I examined myself with the magnifying mirror for the first time. My vulva area was ulcerated and raw, the mucous membrane all over was full of white spots, my labia minora were white and dry and chapped and with hard skin, my clit was hidden by a thick white hood and I had lost definition through fusing of everything and the vaginal entrance was very small. The skin in these areas was very thin, and the entire area was very pale, thin and lifeless. The LS was in a figure 8 and had also affect the anal area as well.  A few days before this I started feeling a rough hard area during showering and it became incredibly itchy. I thought it was thrush and so treated it with thrush cream which eased the itch. The GP told me it was LS and simply prescribed some steroid cream and sent me on my way. I saw a gynae  who also just told me to use the steroid cream and come back for a regular annual visit. I felt as if I was leper as no one wanted to know or help me with my problem and they weren’t very interested at all. I was desperate. The doctor admitted that she didn't want to talk about it because she really did not know much about it. I began researching as I realised that I had to help myself to recover and beat this thing. The more I researched I realised that my body was lacking certain vitamins, minerals and trace elements for it to function properly. I also found an Holistic Medical Health Practitioner who I consulted along with his referred gynae who worked hand in hand to help me. I have reversed 95% of the labial fusing, my vaginal entrance and vulva area are looking very healthy and my clitoral hood is soft and pink and very healthy looking and I have no white spots, or shiny white membrane, no pain or itching. Everything is looking a lovely pinky, healthy and like new! The regular steps I take to maintain myself are: 1.Refer to Nancy-K-B's blogs regarding Vitamins and Minerals and trace element supplement and also her detoxing of the body. I researched and found similar articles and discovered that, as soon as I started taking those listed, my body started healing. I also take a spoon of Brewer's Yeast powder everyday with my food. It’s a rich natural source of VitaminB’s. 2.Emuaid First Aid Ointment ""Modern Homeopathic Medicine"" is the most wonderful ointment - thank God I discovered this. Initially I used it every morning, every evening and everytime I went to the toilet. I apply it with the tip of a cotton bud (so go through heaps of cotton buds as you only ever dip the tip in the jar once so the ointment remains sterile).  I like to use the cotton buds that have a paddle shape the one end and a pointy tip on the other end. Emuaid is very effective for treating Bacterial Vaginosis, Lichen Sclerosis, Lichen Nitidus, Lichen Planus and numerous other problems. It works, and works quickly to relieve symptoms and to heal. Once my ulcers had closed and healed along with the other areas I slowly and gradually with the pointy cotton bud tip started to apply pressure to regain my contouring and unfuse the labial skin and gradually stretched the cliteral hood skin. I spend a lot of time rubbing the Emuaid in to the entire area so it can soak deep into the skin layers to allow healing.As the areas healed I continued with the pointy end of the cotton bud applying pressure to stretch and infuse the skin. It all looks great now. 3.I use Eleuphrat 0.05% ointment (steroid) after applying the Emuaid - it mixes well with the Emuaid ointment which I believe helps it to penetrate deeper into the dermal layers of the affected areas. This steroid ointment is very strong and quite horrid so I only use a very small amount morning and night. Initially the gynae instructed me to use it morning and night for I would say at lease about  the first 9 months. Now I only use the steroid ointment about 2 or 3 nights a week. I only wear cotton underwear. I wear the cotton undies at night also as I figured that the warmth will assist the ointments to penetrate deeper into the dermal layers. 4.I am 63 years old so am post menopausal. I also had vaginal atrophy. I was prescribed Ovestin hormonal cream to apply 3 times a week - so I use it Monday, Wednesday and Friday nights. When I use this cream I use Eleuphrat 0.05% cream as it mixes well with the Ovestin. I allow the Emuaid to soak in for a while first before using the Ovestin and Eleuphrat cream. I also apply some Ovestin and the Eleuphrat cream on the outer areas of the vagina, labia, cliteros, hood, the anus, and the area between the anus and vulva. 5.The opening to my vagina had become very small. As the skin areas healed and softened with the Eumaid and Eleuphrat  I started gently to stretch it to dilate it. I used various size keggels - firstly starting with the smallest size and as the skin stretched I used larger sized keggels. I also do vaginal exercises with the keggels to strengthen the vaginal wall and also pelvic floor.  It is important also that the hormones and blood flow reach these areas to keep them healthy, as it would at the time of climaxing. Orgasms are an important part of women’s vaginal health maintenance. I hope I have been able to help you by sharing my experience of this LS journey with you and wish you well with your road to recovery. It is possible with determination and persistence. Good Luck.

I spend a lot of time rubbing the Emuaid in to the entire area so it can soak deep into the skin layers to allow healing.As the areas healed I continued with the pointy end of the cotton bud applying pressure to stretch and infuse the skin. It all looks great now. 3.I use Eleuphrat 0.05% ointment (steroid) after applying the Emuaid - it mixes well with the Emuaid ointment which I believe helps it to penetrate deeper into the dermal layers of the affected areas. This steroid ointment is very strong and quite horrid so I only use a very small amount morning and night. Initially the gynae instructed me to use it morning and night for I would say at lease about  the first 9 months. Now I only use the steroid ointment about 2 or 3 nights a week. I only wear cotton underwear. I wear the cotton undies at night also as I figured that the warmth will assist the ointments to penetrate deeper into the dermal layers. 4.I am 63 years old so am post menopausal. I also had vaginal atrophy. I was prescribed Ovestin hormonal cream to apply 3 times a week - so I use it Monday, Wednesday and Friday nights. When I use this cream I use Eleuphrat 0.05% cream as it mixes well with the Ovestin. I allow the Emuaid to soak in for a while first before using the Ovestin and Eleuphrat cream. I also apply some Ovestin and the Eleuphrat cream on the outer areas of the vagina, labia, cliteros, hood, the anus, and the area between the anus and vulva. 5.The opening to my vagina had become very small. As the skin areas healed and softened with the Eumaid and Eleuphrat  I started gently to stretch it to dilate it. I used various size keggels - firstly starting with the smallest size and as the skin stretched I used larger sized keggels. I also do vaginal exercises with the keggels to strengthen the vaginal wall and also pelvic floor.  It is important also that the hormones and blood flow reach these areas to keep them healthy, as it would at the time of climaxing. Orgasms are an important part of women’s vaginal health maintenance. I hope I have been able to help you by sharing my experience of this LS journey with you and wish you well with your road to recovery. It is possible with determination and persistence. Good Luck.

I was scared, horrified and couldn't believe what was going on ""down there"" and what I saw when I examined myself with the magnifying mirror for the first time. My vulva area was ulcerated and raw, the mucous membrane all over was full of white spots, my labia minora were white and dry and chapped and with hard skin, my clit was hidden by a thick white hood and I had lost definition through fusing of everything and the vaginal entrance was very small. The skin in these areas was very thin, and the entire area was very pale, thin and lifeless. The LS was in a figure 8 and had also affect the anal area as well.  A few days before this I started feeling a rough hard area during showering and it became incredibly itchy. I thought it was thrush and so treated it with thrush cream which eased the itch. The GP told me it was LS and simply prescribed some steroid cream and sent me on my way. I saw a gynae  who also just told me to use the steroid cream and come back for a regular annual visit. I felt as if I was leper as no one wanted to know or help me with my problem and they weren’t very interested at all. I was desperate. The doctor admitted that she didn't want to talk about it because she really did not know much about it. I began researching as I realised that I had to help myself to recover and beat this thing. The more I researched I realised that my body was lacking certain vitamins, minerals and trace elements for it to function properly. I also found an Holistic Medical Health Practitioner who I consulted along with his referred gynae who worked hand in hand to help me. I have reversed 95% of the labial fusing, my vaginal entrance and vulva area are looking very healthy and my clitoral hood is soft and pink and very healthy looking and I have no white spots, or shiny white membrane, no pain or itching. Everything is looking a lovely pinky, healthy and like new! The regular steps I take to maintain myself are: 1.Refer to Nancy-K-B's blogs regarding Vitamins and Minerals and trace element supplement and also her detoxing of the body. I researched and found similar articles and discovered that, as soon as I started taking those listed, my body started healing. I also take a spoon of Brewer's Yeast powder everyday with my food. It’s a rich natural source of VitaminB’s. 2.Emuaid First Aid Ointment ""Modern Homeopathic Medicine"" is the most wonderful ointment - thank God I discovered this. Initially I used it every morning, every evening and everytime I went to the toilet. I apply it with the tip of a cotton bud (so go through heaps of cotton buds as you only ever dip the tip in the jar once so the ointment remains sterile).

My GYNO said it looks like LS. It started off with small cuts with my husband and then he left for work for Basic Training for 2 months and I became itchy/dry/ burning, thats when i saw my gyno, i have used the steroid cream and coconut oil. I thought i was fine until i saw my husband recently and the pain was so intense/painful, i cried and we had to stop. I was convinced it was a yeast infection so i took a pill and the pain went away but im afraid when i see him again that will happen. These are recent pictures about one month after seeing my husband. I use steroid cream and coconut oil and it helps so so much. A couple days ago I pulled the skin down there and it tore. It is so thin. I invested in lube and Im going to try it next time i see him. i am only 19  and i cant live like this forever.

Don't know what to do.,"hi so ive had severe toothache for a few days, yesterday at around 3:50pm i took two panadol extra advance before i started work at 4pm. it made me a bit drowsy but that was to be expected. later that night at around 9:10pm i took another two but i had completely different symptoms, they made me dizzy, drowsy, they made everywhere other than my tooth numb and i was drooling, shaking and my heart was beating quite fast. I decided not to take anymore as those feeling made me extremely anxious. at around 11pm i took 1 ibuprofen and went to sleep. however today iI still have the shakes a d my hearts still beating fast (not sure if its anxiety from overthinking everything) I've had loose-ish stools and a tiny bit of lower abdominal pain (not sure if that could be linked in with the usual cramps i have from the coil). Im on rivaroxiban blood thinners, just thought id mention as that can be an important factor too. 0 likes, 0 replies "

So let me start with day one. In mid May, I got a really bad cramp in the left side of my abdomen below the rib cage. The cramp was so bad that I was basically in bed rest for the rest of the night, unable to get up from my bed. I didn't think anything of it so I decided to sleep it off. The next morning that same area felt like it had a really bad bruise. Days went by and this bruise feeling did not go away. After a week in a half of no improvements I became worried. The pain was fluctuating between soreness, burning sensations, and sharp pains. I did want to point out that this pain would go away when I was active or standing up. Also, the pain was more intense in the evenings after getting home from work (I have a desk job btw). It was when I was sitting down that the pain would bother me. At first I thought it was kidney stones. I started taking supplements to help pass them but after a CT scan (done in beginning of July) everything came out clean. After, I decided to give it some more days since my doctor told me maybe I passed them already or they were too small to see with CT scan. Days went by and nothing was getting better. I went to a new doctor towards the end of July since I felt that my previous doctor was no help and not pursuing other options for this issue I had. The new doctor asked me to get another CT scan done but with Contrast this time and also blood work. Everything came out clean. At his point the doctor said to rule out kidney stones or anything serious. That's when I was sent to a Gastro specialist. Now we are around late August. The specialist was no help either, had no idea what I was talking about when I explained my symptoms. He gave me some medicine to help with stomach acid fluctuation thinking that might be the issue. After weeks of taking the medicine there were no changes. At this point I felt desperate because I felt that I was going nowhere and this pain was lowering my quality of life and making work miserable for me. Towards the end of September the pain for some reason shifted from my abdomen to my back. The next step from the specialist was an endoscopy but I decided to pursue other options since the pain changed and didn't want to pay for an expensive procedure. And I do want to mention that occasionally through those past months I would feel light pain on my back parallel to the area that I was having pain on my front. This time the pain was more on my back than my front. So I decided to go to a Chiropractor to check me out. To my surprise the Chiropractor knew what I was talking about when I explained my symptoms. He told me that the initial cramp came from a muscle that is connected to my abdomen and wraps around to my back which is the reason the pains were parallel to each other. I have gained weight the past 2 years and haven't been much active that could have contributed to this issue.  Anyways, after some adjustments and physical therapy it has been improving! There's no more pain on my front and now it's mostly on my back. The intensity and frequency of the pains have gone down. Currently I am still in treatment but finally feel relieved to have answers and to see improvements.  Hopefully anybody going through the same situation finds this thread and can use this information to help themselves. Many doctors won't pursue other means to find a diagnosis so sometimes you just have to take it upon yourself to figure out what is wrong with you.  Good luck!!

I agreed. I got through the surgery and was discharged the next day. A few days after the surgery, I felt the worst possible pain ever: felt like a bunch of nerves being held together stabbed together. Using my stomach muscles was pure heck. I went back to him and he gave me neurotin. It helped and I thought things were going back to normal. 3 months after the surgery, I had to have my annual colonoscopy (unfortunately I get precancerous polyps and I am only 38). 2 days after the colonoscopy the pain returned at the incision site .....along with massive bloating now. I thought it was a GI issue but my GI Dr did every test, including an upper endoscopy,  and l tried every IBS  med he gave me. no difference. We then figured out that it must be nerve pain. Neurology Dr said it was a GI issue and to go back to GI Dr (there was nothing left to do!). I went to ER 4 times over this - supposedly CT scan and stay showed nothing. My blood pressure got super high due to pain so now I am on bp meds. I went to a pain clinic lately. They put pain shots about 1/8 inches up from the incision site. The pain and bloating stopped.

It's extremely painful and has put my life on hold for so long now. After trying quite literally every treatment for this chronic pain and several scans and blood tests, I have finally had discussions with a thoracic surgeon who specialises in rib malformations to discuss removing the cartilage from those two ribs where they join to my sternum. I was wondering if anyone has ever had this treatment or known someone who has?

I have a high pitched tone in my head all the time and it's annoying. When it first started (about ten years ago) it would be agonizing and torturously loud and would ruch on me the instant I fell asleep, catching me just before I lost conscoiousness, and I would feel stuck inside myself for a second, suffocating, being anihalated by that immense noise, struggling to wake up it felt like drowning but with a sound so loud I wished I was dead. Absolutely terrifying, but when it was that loud it wasn't a tone more a high pitched pulse maybe three pulses per second, like a fast high pitched sledge hammer pounding away on the inside of the head. The first night I couldn't sleep from this I thought I may never sleep again and die a horrible death, passing out into that tortue when I couldn't hold myself awake any longer, I ran from my house and just roamed the streets crying. After some time I came back home, and I managed to fall asleep. That's how it started, but that tone has never gone and it's always been there, it's there right now.The tone doesn't get like that anymore but it does get very loud and pulsing when im in bed or when my eyes are closed sometimes. Has anyone heard of anything like this? Any ideas what it might be? If it may be curable? I don't feel like I'm losing my hearing or anything like that. Any help appreciated, thanks. 1 like, 41 replies "

I saw the orthopedist on campus to review my neck x-ray and he said my neck didn’t have a normal C curve and I was probably having some spasms.

My GP did blood work, all was normal except for low vitamin D which I got prescription tablets for, and referred me to a neurologist. The neurologist did a nerve conduction test in both arms and it came back normal. The tingling in my left hand persists on and off through out the day, but nowhere near as severe as the day it onset. For about three months now I have pain in my left hand when I’m using it and sometimes that pain radiates up my forearm as well as my neck and shoulder, especially when I’m driving or have to hold my arm out for mire than a couple minutes.

History of anorexia (recovered ~ 1.5 years), anxiety. I know I have mild scoliosis but not much else on it. I was born 3 months premature. Mother has multiple sclerosis. Heart disease on my fathers side. I apologize in advanced fir the long post and formatting. I’ve always had some odd aches and pains I didn’t pay much attention to, they were just kind of annoying to start with. I’ve had pain coming and going in my left hip that feels almost like a pinch and I feel my hip pop as I step. But it went away for long enough periods of time where I wasn’t worried. My legs will occasionally feel heavy/numb when I stand up ~10 months. My left ankle is extremely weak, I sprained it in middle school and it healed but I’ve sprained it multiple times since then, some of the times not going to a doctor. I’ve had ~8 sprains in the past two years alone and that ankle will occasionally buckle while I’m walking. All of my joints feel stiff, especially on my left side my knee, hip, and ankle will pop frequently. This has been going on about a year and has gotten worse with time. Stretching doesn’t seem to help. And here’s where I really started to get concerned about my health. In late July of 2019 i woke up with tingling in my left hand and forearm. I initially ignored it and went to shower, assuming I just slept on it weird. The tingling got worse in the shower and wouldn’t go away. I ended up going to the student health center on campus where they did an EKG that came back normal and an x-ray of my neck. They still sent me to the ER to be sure it wasn’t a heart issue and there I was told it was just anxiety despite the tingling now going on for 11 hours and never having anxiety symptoms like that before. I saw the orthopedist on campus to review my neck x-ray and he said my neck didn’t have a normal C curve and I was probably having some spasms. He also did a quick exam of my back/spine and noticed winging of my left shoulder blade. This prompted him to send me to my go for a neurological referral. My GP did blood work, all was normal except for low vitamin D which I got prescription tablets for, and referred me to a neurologist. The neurologist did a nerve conduction test in both arms and it came back normal. The tingling in my left hand persists on and off through out the day, but nowhere near as severe as the day it onset. For about three months now I have pain in my left hand when I’m using it and sometimes that pain radiates up my forearm as well as my neck and shoulder, especially when I’m driving or have to hold my arm out for mire than a couple minutes. I have a pretty constant stiffness and ache in the left side of my neck and my left shoulder. My neck on that side often feels “caught” and cracks very frequently through out the day. I’ve started experiencing tingling in my right hand on about three occasions this past month. My GP said the tingling was a “freak thing” despite it still going on and referred me to another orthopedist for what she believes to be carpal tunnel syndrome in my left hand, but I feel like it’s more than just that. I feel like my pain and concerns aren’t being taken seriously due to my anxiety and I don’t know what to do next. What could this be? Could it just be anxiety? Thanks 0 likes, 1 reply "

But there have been random pain attacks now and then.  It's always on the right side, like right leg toes going numb of right hand  fingers going numb(especially pinky and ring fingers). Also, she always had trouble with her right ovary every alternate month she has trouble with her periods, alternate months her period is irregular and even when trying to get pregnant by IUI and IVF we always had trouble timing it correctly.  Recently we were pregnant (but had to terminate due to heart malformation detected after 6 months of pregnancy) and during the delivery they gave her epidural and even then she felt that left half of her body got numb quicker but right was always less numb(she felt less heaviness in right legs). Now 2 weeks after the delivery she started getting pain in right ear and in right side of neck(between throat and cheek - somewhere close to sub-mandibular gland). The house doctor suggested taking paracetamol but we have taken it already for more than 2 weeks, the pain goes away after paracetamol 1g but comes again in a few hours. The pain is similar to abdominal pain from 2 years back. It again feels like a wound, feels superficial excruciating pain when touching.

It's always the right side of the body and we have no clue what to do about it. Please please please suggest. PS:- I don't know if it is relevant or not, she always had a low iron, B12 and vitamin D. The GP suggested to take oral medication of vitamin D 25000 IU but it never helps in increasing the levels. One doctor suggested that it's possible she doesn't have carriers to absorb vitamin D  from food/medication. Then he gave her 6,00,000 IU via an injection on her bum and Iron by IV and that seems to raise the levels properly , he suggested we do this at least once an year. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Firstly it started as pain in my upper abdominal area (in my epigastrium to be more specific) and sometimes it feels like a burning sensation and then at the same time i was experiencing mid back pain and lower back pain. Then at times I have sharp sudden pains in my stomach and my stomach feels tender to touch. It feels full and as if something is inside pushing against everything. my upper abdominal pain feels as if something heavy has been places there and at times i have chest pains (left side) with the same heavy feeling.  I also have pain under my ribs and general discomfort in my flank area. I am so sorry this is a long message but i am so so scared that i have something sinister going on in my body. i know the chances of someone as young as me getting pancreatic cancer are very slim but i have researched and seen it is possible!!

I have Ibs so the doctors say it's that. I went back to the doctors on Thursday as on Wednesday night we ate out and I had a fatty meal of chips, gammon, fried egg and peas. The next morning I passed a fatty stool that did sink but lots of big air bubbles came from it. It was pale too. It didn't smell bad. I totally freaked out. I've had stools that float but never bubbles. Then I had an even softer stool an hour after again with bubbles. I felt sick too. My anxiety went into over drive and since then I can't think straight. The doctor said she didn't know what the bubbles are. She said I've not lost weight so not to worry!! I've only started with the floating stools the past couple of weeks. Before then  if not diarrhoea they were pale. I had a blood test being with an A to test my pancreas. Get the results hopefully Monday. I'm already scared about that. I did another stool test to check for inflammation. I asked if they could test the fat in the stool and she said no!!! She said if the bloods come back OK maybe have the camera up the bottom! Sorry can't remember what it's called. Pain wise I have pains all over the abdomen. But lately I've been getting pain under my left rib shooting  through to my back. But I can also get that on the right side too. I get pains in my hips and pelvis too. It's all so random. I also get pain in the upper back in my shoulder blades. I do have reflux too. My appetite before Thursday was good. I had no pain after  eating the fatty meal and no tummy pain. Just the fatty stool the next day. My stool  issues seem to be every morning. The only time I get relief is in the night! I can wake slightly and my tummy is calm. Within a minute of waking fully in the morning my stomach starts gurgling, I get gas pains and pass wind, I feel a little sick then I'll have to go the loo. I never normally go the loo after my tea. It makes no sense to me. I seem to be full of wind from the minute I wake up. My bowels movements are so random. I can have a normal colour stool then diarrhoea an hour after or a lighter stool. The only niggly  pain I've been getting lately is mid back behind my stomach. Some pains I get are relieved when my stomach churns and feels like a bubble has popped in my stomach. The only other thing after eating is sometimes I feel like I need a bowel movement but I don't go. This is immediately after eating and I get very windy! Since Thursday I have lost my appetite, feel sick and I'm on edgy. I dread having a bowel movement. I just can't see how this is ibs. I'm living on immodium. If I had steatorrhea would I have lost weight? My diet food wise hadn't changed but I've hardly excersied since November. My legs are weak and shake. I've got anxiety issues going on so and I know I'll lose weight now I've lost my appetite. I've had this before when I've worried about things. My stomach feels like it's on a fairground ride.

About 3 months ago my symptoms started with a dizzy/rushing feeling in my head which lasted for a few days on and off then went away. About 5 days later this returned along with a strange rushing sensation  going across my chest and what felt like heart palpitations. After 2 days this passed. I visited doctor who said I just had a nasty viral infection and this would pass. However 4 days later I woke up in the middle of the night with extreme abdominal pain, chills and shooting pains right up my back. It was horrid but I paced this put for the next 6hrs. Things haven't been the same since and been in and out of hospital several time-and ct scan, bloods,ultrasound and endoscopy. All clear apart from mild gastritis! Well it's now over 11 wks and the same symptoms still recurring-most nights I get no sleep due to abdominal pain, chills and uncomfortable dizzy/rushing feeling.

I'm coming here to seek advice on my next step. In December I was hospitalized for 5 days. I went in with stomach and back pain and while they took tests, they noticed my Lipase levels were elevated. They also found out I tested positive for H Pylori. I had many tests done, such as CT Scan, ultrasound, HIDA scan, upper endoscopy, urine tests and stool tests. I currently am taking the H Pylori treatment right now. I'm scared however that I do have pancreatic cancer and they missed it. I feel as though because I'm 23 years old they are over looking me. My stomach pain is in the upper middle and upper left area and still hurts. My back hurts when I lay on it in the middle of my spine. My GI dr promises me this is not pancreatic cancer but I cannot help but still worry. I've been having bowel issues, and lots of pain and anxiety. Do I go back to hospital to run more tests again or just trust what he says? I know I am young but and it is very rare but am starting to believe it is possible. 0 likes, 4 replies "

Just in the hospital last week. I went through a very painful episode only to find out my liapse levels were 261 and the test showed nothing else. I was prepared to be in the hospital for a while.

Dr has tested bloods, all normal. Had full cardiologist check, ecg etc all normal. The pain initially felt like a really uncomfortable ball under my ribs and I struggled with sitting for a couple of days. Standing, walking etc all ok. Lying down helped but not on my back as it felt like something was pulling at my ribs. Was put on lanzoprapole and felt not too bad. But after a small holiday, lots of food, moderate alcohol it niggled away but not so bad as first time and recently it's flared up horribly.  I had one day I had to stay in bed as the pain went all round lower left side and stabbing pain in the back. If I sneezed it was very very painful. I've got a gastroenterologist appt in over a week so should find out more but wondered if anyone else has had similar symptoms? I've no idea if this is related to pancreas but I have had multiple doses of   that I've discovered can cause this in pancreas. My pain is most definitely left side and right at the bottom of the ribcage.  0 likes, 28 replies "

Or is it something else? Struggling to find answers,"Hi everyone- like a lot of you on the forum, I am at my witts end trying to figure out what ailment and/or disease I have. To be brief, my symptoms started in August of 2014 when I started to notice upper abdominal pain and tenderness. This was on a weekend where yes, I had been consuming alcohol. I am a healthy 28 year old female and in my younger 20s I did drink more than is recommended. On the onset of symptoms, I went to a doctor who prescribed an anti-acid. I noticed over the next few months my symptoms came and went and I honestly thought nothing of it. I started noticing a change in my bowel movements in October/November (they started to become more loose, float and were more volumous). I have been into see multiple GI specialists who have run a million tests. I've had basic labs done (liver function tests, lipase/amylase, basic metabolic panel, IgA/IgG- celiac seriologies, Vitamin D/B12, Iron studies-- all came back good), an MRCP w/secretin (good), RUQ (good), EGD/EUS (good), fecal elastase > 500 (good)..... but heres he kicker.. a 9g fecal fat (normal is under 7g) with a fecal weight of ~470g (200g of stool is normal output from what I have read). To my knowledge there are only a few diseases that cause a high stool fat and CP is one of them.  My question is.. do any of you experience high fat stools and normal imaging? The doctors seem to think this is all IBS but from what I've read IBS  does not cause high fecal fat.  I am so desperate for answers... I wish they would just find what is causing my discomfort and abnormal stools-- even if that meant a diagnosis of CP.  Please help if any of you can shed some light here!!!!  1 like, 54 replies "

A bit confusing though as we were first told it was badly damaged? The Doctor them went on to say that Hubby can now go back to eating normally as we have been so careful as not to eat fat, milk etc. He then read the notes again and said 'this is interesting, you have sludge on your Gallbladder'. Apparently this was showing on the previous CT Scan when Hubby was admitted into Hospital, but we weren't told about this at the time? Surely this should have been brought to our attention? So the Doctor then said 'actually, don't change your diet, carry on with the low fat, dairy etc as I think we need to remove your Gallbladder so we have no repeats of your Acute Pancreatitis'. It was put down as an Urgent Operation. So we are now waiting for a date, but with everything that's going on at the moment, I think this could be a while. So for now, we are in limbo. Was the Pancreatitis caused by the Gallbladder? Why weren't we told about the sludge before? What does 'no evidence of Acute Pancreatitis' mean? One more thing, recently the last couple of weeks, my Hubby has been having extremely large stools and has trouble passing them sometimes. He's eating lots of food and has a great appetite. Does he still need to take his Creon if the Pancreas is OK? Unfortunately, 2 doctors I've spoken to don't seem to have the answers? Thanks in advance 0 likes, 5 replies "

The Doctor them went on to say that Hubby can now go back to eating normally as we have been so careful as not to eat fat, milk etc. He then read the notes again and said 'this is interesting, you have sludge on your Gallbladder'. Apparently this was showing on the previous CT Scan when Hubby was admitted into Hospital, but we weren't told about this at the time? Surely this should have been brought to our attention? So the Doctor then said 'actually, don't change your diet, carry on with the low fat, dairy etc as I think we need to remove your Gallbladder so we have no repeats of your Acute Pancreatitis'. It was put down as an Urgent Operation. So we are now waiting for a date, but with everything that's going on at the moment, I think this could be a while. So for now, we are in limbo. Was the Pancreatitis caused by the Gallbladder? Why weren't we told about the sludge before? What does 'no evidence of Acute Pancreatitis' mean? One more thing, recently the last couple of weeks, my Hubby has been having extremely large stools and has trouble passing them sometimes. He's eating lots of food and has a great appetite. Does he still need to take his Creon if the Pancreas is OK? Unfortunately, 2 doctors I've spoken to don't seem to have the answers? Thanks in advance 0 likes, 5 replies "

The next morning my face felt numb and my mouth was a bit droopy and felt like when you go to the dentist and the injection is wearing off. Within half an hour my face had dropped so my daughter took me to a Walk in Clinic who diagnosed Bell's Palsy. I wasn't given advise on how to treat it, just told it would go in time. I brought some eye drops the next day as my eye was hurting but still didn't realise what was going to happen.  By Tues I felt really worried as my face had dropped much more, my speech was slurred, I couldn't pronounce words starting with B, P or F. I kept biting my cheek, couldn't eat or drink properly and had such nerve pain around my ear and in my cheek area that I wanted to cry. I went to the doctors who gave me steriods for 5 days and told me it would be gone in a week and to put eye drops in. Oh and if I got pain in my eye to go to hospital.

It was a real challenge at night to keep my eye closed as the tape wouldn't stick properly because of the ointment. I even tried swimming goggles which did help but felt uncomfortable round my head.

I have had this ongoing pain on the BP side from the cheek to above the eyebrow, especially when I push on these areas. Most of the pain when I push or massage is right above the left temple area, then not as bad down the cheek, same side. It also seems as though the more Stressed I get the more pain i get! My eye on that side looks normal when looking in the mirror, but actually feels partially closed (muscle weakness I think) but again it looks ok. Does anyone have residual effects like this a year or two after the BP? It took me longer than most to heal up to the 70% and dragged on for months. maybe I have permanent nerve damage in those areas? Been doing the massages and taking certain supplements that I read about online for BP along with Vitamin B12. Then I got BP again last August, but healed a lot quicker overall. The only lingering problem on that one was my right eye, it got so Raw and had to see an eye doctor and he said the cornea was mildly scraped. gave me an antibiotic ointment and healed in 2 weeks. Did not get this problem this bad with the other side mentioned above! I did use lubricating eye drops constantly and patch both times as well. Don't seem to have no residual effects on this side only except it waters once in a while. Both times I got the BP, and know it's from stress because both times I had loved ones die in my family. Any help and thoughts about my first episode would help if you may still have the lingering problems. Thank You!  0 likes, 6 replies "

Just wanted to know really if anyone else had experienced the same and whether this is normal, as none of the doctors I have spoken to have been able to say whether it is or not? I haven't really had much actual pain, which I would have assumed I would if the body symptoms are caused by migraine?  Thanks  0 likes, 2 replies "

I got Bell Palsy on January 21st this year- left side- and within one hour I got the treatment in the hospital.. First move on the cheek after 2 weeks. I had physical therapy, acupuncture, acupressure etc... I have my full smile again, can not close the eye completely and until last week I was quite satisfied.  Ophthalmologist says since I have double vision that my eye turned upward for 2  degrees.... Last  week I experienced twitching on my left cheek and near the nose, and my left corner of the mouth always goes to the left ear, like I want to smile and I fell  in that area which makes me very nervous. Also, when I raise my eyebrows, I have a smile on the left side. My therapist says it is synkynesis after 3 months. Also, I am starting to fell pain on the affected side and pain behind ears on the both side... Any similar experience!? What else I should do? Thank you!!! 0 likes, 2 replies "

I was told that it was something that can go away in a week or last for 3-6 months, and time was not in my favor. As the weeks drew on i found myself getting more and more depressed. I felt helpless and rarely found any comfort in looking at support forums. But after 2 months I found a bit of movement returning. I surrounded myself with comfort and support from friends and family, and ate healthy.

I got Bell's palsy in early march of this year. I started to get pretty good movement back at the beginning of April and soon after regained I'd say 97% back. During I experienced severe nerve pain feeling as if someone had taken a baseball bat to the right side of my face. A day or two before the paralysis set in I felt a burning ripping sensation on the right side of my scalp and my tongue and lips felt weird on that side and it progressed from there. I have a very high tolerance for pain but the nerve pain I felt was awful. That mostly subsided aside from touching my face up until now has hurt but not nearly as terrible and slowly gotten better. Three days ago (Monday) my right eye and the surrounding area (eyebrow, lid, and the side of the bridge of my nose) started twitching quite a bit and hard twitches. I'm now experiencing more nerve pain and today have developed a burning sensation and constant pain in my forehead above the right eye. And as the day goes on I'm experiencing neck pain into my shoulder and back of head on right side and also had the burning sensation. As well as my scalp having that same feeling. Could this be a sign that I'm going to have a recurrence? If you had a recurrence, did you notice signs that ""told"" you it was going to happen?  0 likes, 11 replies "

After doing some   tests on myself I was confident I had Bell's Palsy. I went to hospital and was prescribed the typical treatment of  .  3 weeks later and I had full control of my face again. However I know that being able to move my face did not mean I had fully recovered. Recovery Recovery from Bell's Palsy can take months, depending on the severity of the nerve damage. My full recovery took 7 weeks (relatively fast) I know people who have taken 2 months to regain movement. After you regain movement there are a few things you can do to speed up the recovery process.  Apply a fairly warm compress to the effected side, focus on the area behind your ear and side of the face. Use gentle massage to stimulate the nerves. Reoccurring attacks are more likely during the recovery process so be sure to stay on the prescribed treatment until you have regained movement for at least 2 weeks.  Residual effects For those who have had Bell's Palsy the aftereffects can be mild to severe. In most cases the common problems that follow are twitching and localised weakness  (this may come and go) in some cases you may get synkinesis where you involuntary move one part of you face whil meaning to move another foe example, when you smile your eyebrow may move.  Some may get   towards bell's in a way that any twitching or weakness will depress and put the sufferer into a panic, calling for a doctor immediately.  Rest assured that Bell's Palsy is very common and the chance of a reoccurrence is slim, most sufferers will have to deal with Palsy once and only once however if there is going to be a  reoccurrence most will get the next attack in 5-10 years of the first. You can also experience  phantom Palsy  (not medically named) where past sufferers will cause weakness in the face due to constantly moving it to check if the illness has returned. 1 like, 41 replies "

Then I was eating soup and it tasted like I had burned my tongue really bad. Then my face started twitching on the left side EVERYWHERE. like my eyebrow, my nose, my lips, my chin, my cheek. Then I woke up on march 26th and couldn't keep water in my mouth while brushing my teeth on the left side.  I went to the er and they diagnosed me with Bell's palsy. They told me it was a mild case, but it just hadn't actually set in all the way yet. They gave me the anti virals and prednisone. They only gave me 20 mg prednisone that I took for 4 days only. Idk if they only gave me this much because of my weight (I weigh 140) or because they thought it was a mild case.  when I was reading online I saw ppl taking way higher doses for longer periods of time. Anyway it set all the way in and I could still close my eye a little bit it wasn't just open like some other ppl. I could still smile a little. But then it seemed like things were getting worse and I couldn't smile anymore at all.  I had a little droop. And instead of my eye being dry it just waters all day. I asked my doctor and he said steroids aren't good for you and they can do harm to other parts of your body. He was pretty much useless. So 3 weeks went by and I still wasn't getting any improvement. The taste in my toungue was coming back and it stopped hurting so bad. (At first I had shooting pains in my head and on the left side of my face). My hearing was hyper sensitive also and that went away too.  I still wasn't getting any movement and was getting discouraged because I seen some ppl recover in 3 to 4 weeks.  I saw some ppl did acupuncture and it worked for them so I decided to give that a try at 3 weeks. I hadn't been to a neurologist yet because I couldn't get an appointment soon enough the one my insurance covered was all booked up.  I did 6 sessions of acupuncture, with 3 regular sessions with just putting the needle in my face, and then 3 with electrostim. It seemed the acupuncture was working because I got some movement back in my cheek to where I could move part of my cheek by myself, and I was also getting twitching in some other places. I finally got a hold of a neurologist around 6 weeks and he told me there's no data on acupuncture working so I stopped going. By six weeks I had gained movement back in my neck, I could move my chin a little, I can raise my eyebrow a little, and I could move my ear... at 8 weeks now I can move the corner of my mouth just a little like its trying to smile. I also still have some twitching that goes on on my Bell's palsy side every now and then. But also, when I look in the mirror and try and smile and see what movements are coming back, my muscles feel kind of tight. Not when my face is at rest, but when I try and smile. I can see some other areas twitching in my cheek when I try to smile, like it's trying to work but it's to weak or something. My fear is that the electro stim and acupuncture made things worse and that's why It feels tight like that when I try to smile. Also when I move my lips a certain way or when I put hot water on my face I can feel my lips like pull upward on that side and there's a crease in my cheek like as if I'm smirking a little but I'm not. It's weird and only happens for a little Bit of time then goes back to normal. What is this? Also I can still only move that one part of my cheek and the the crease that comes when you smile still isn't moving yet... is this normal?

They told me it was a mild case, but it just hadn't actually set in all the way yet. They gave me the anti virals and prednisone. They only gave me 20 mg prednisone that I took for 4 days only. Idk if they only gave me this much because of my weight (I weigh 140) or because they thought it was a mild case.  when I was reading online I saw ppl taking way higher doses for longer periods of time. Anyway it set all the way in and I could still close my eye a little bit it wasn't just open like some other ppl. I could still smile a little. But then it seemed like things were getting worse and I couldn't smile anymore at all.  I had a little droop. And instead of my eye being dry it just waters all day. I asked my doctor and he said steroids aren't good for you and they can do harm to other parts of your body. He was pretty much useless. So 3 weeks went by and I still wasn't getting any improvement. The taste in my toungue was coming back and it stopped hurting so bad. (At first I had shooting pains in my head and on the left side of my face). My hearing was hyper sensitive also and that went away too.  I still wasn't getting any movement and was getting discouraged because I seen some ppl recover in 3 to 4 weeks.  I saw some ppl did acupuncture and it worked for them so I decided to give that a try at 3 weeks. I hadn't been to a neurologist yet because I couldn't get an appointment soon enough the one my insurance covered was all booked up.  I did 6 sessions of acupuncture, with 3 regular sessions with just putting the needle in my face, and then 3 with electrostim. It seemed the acupuncture was working because I got some movement back in my cheek to where I could move part of my cheek by myself, and I was also getting twitching in some other places. I finally got a hold of a neurologist around 6 weeks and he told me there's no data on acupuncture working so I stopped going. By six weeks I had gained movement back in my neck, I could move my chin a little, I can raise my eyebrow a little, and I could move my ear... at 8 weeks now I can move the corner of my mouth just a little like its trying to smile. I also still have some twitching that goes on on my Bell's palsy side every now and then. But also, when I look in the mirror and try and smile and see what movements are coming back, my muscles feel kind of tight. Not when my face is at rest, but when I try and smile. I can see some other areas twitching in my cheek when I try to smile, like it's trying to work but it's to weak or something. My fear is that the electro stim and acupuncture made things worse and that's why It feels tight like that when I try to smile. Also when I move my lips a certain way or when I put hot water on my face I can feel my lips like pull upward on that side and there's a crease in my cheek like as if I'm smirking a little but I'm not. It's weird and only happens for a little Bit of time then goes back to normal. What is this? Also I can still only move that one part of my cheek and the the crease that comes when you smile still isn't moving yet... is this normal? I'm going to see my neurologist again on Thursday but I am a major worry wart and I keep worrying I made this worse by doing acupuncture and the electro Stim. Am i recovering okay or is something wrong? I also now get some headache and face pain on that side again but it's not as bad as it was when I first got it. I am 24 years old and my job has everything to do with how you look and is very competitive so I haven't been at work for 2 months. Just been staying home. I will admit I have been fighting with my significant other way more but than ever before and probably am more stressed than I should be. I also smoke weed sometimes to sleep and noticed that sometimes when I smoke I get more twitching on that side. Is twitching good? Because my face was twitching when it started, so don't know if it is it seems like it is good though because for like 3 weeks I had no twitching no movement at all on that side of my face. I hate this so much I'm so sad because I loved my smile before and I am a very pretty girl. I feel I've lost my face and I'm praying it will come back.... is muscle tightness when trying to move that side normal or is this a sign of synkinesis?

I'm uncut and under the foreskin on the left side only, the skin close to the frenulum is a bit red. It never goes away and is a bit brighter after masturbating (I used to do it without lube before it appeared, now I'm not doing that anymore) or even just when waking up in the morning. Back in 2018 I've tried anti fungal cream for a few weeks but it hasn't changed anything, I've also tested negative for sexually transmitted diseases. I've also tried two dermo corticoids creams (the dermatologist has been giving me that and a few creams to ""repair skin"" for what he said is a posthitis) and even though I believe it helped reduce the redness a bit, it never fully disappeared. I've gone periods of weeks without masturbating but it's still here. The thing is right now I'm becoming paranoid about that and everytime I notice the skin is becoming a bit red (could be for no reason, just the humidity  or the temperature inside the house) I start panicking, wondering if the color is normal or not. I don't even know if it's normal for the foreskin to be a bit red after masturbation. As anybody experienced something like that ?

So to start, my penis glans did not look smooth since i was circumcized at about 11, now im 25, also you can notice on picture some weird bump on foreskin, this is from   the dr said ""it should smooth out with time"" which didnt but its ok now. My main target was always trying to get the ""uncircumcised"" look of glans which is the nice healthy looking smooth and 1 color. But due to friction i think its really hard to achieve such thing when your glans are out rubbing all around your underwear when you do daily tasks and who knows whats happening when i sleep on my stomach and have errection... Either way, recently i noticed that the tip of my penis (Around urethra) became sort of inflamed? As in a bit red and looking less smoother than other parts which are already not so smooth. It comes and goes, sometimes in mornings it looks more inflamed/bigger and sometimes it looks normal, not sure if its due to some allergy, diet, or friction or something else. It is only mainly visible when flacid, when errected im happy with its look but only when its flacid its not really good looking. No any symptom of pain, or tingling or any other sort of discomfort, maybe i feel really thirsty and my lips are dry but it was many months before that irritation occured so i dont think its related. If i have sexual activity its only with my GF and always with protection. Did anyone had touch with something similar? (Side note, I'm using also recently a rubber seal and shea butter, shea butter for my glans and then i pull foreskin and lock it up with rubber seal which makes it sort of forced foreskin to keep it smoother, it worked tiny bit when i started but now i see this, so not sure if its maybe fungi from keeping it moist ? or some wart or i dont know... thats why im asking for help guys) I would greatly appreciate if anyone could help me.

I have this problem which occured 2 years ago when i had sexual intercourse with a girl and she gave me a BJ without condom.  I got prescribed ketoconazole to combat the fungus, i didn't applied it everyday consistently so maybe that could be the case  and never have been to a dermatologist to not working to a full extend but it helped at least... The timeframe of when these symptoms started was quite late actually, i have pictures that where taken in the summer of 2018. Which shows flaky skin on the glans and definitely signs of a candida/yeast/fungi kind of problem.....it did not hurt when touching although the nerves receptors changed slightly more to pain when fine touching the glans since the bacterial composition has favoured this yeast kind of appearance. From what i could remember is that i had red spots around the glans and could morph into white dots(not sure about this order)  that where coming and going and where visible when i would mastrubate the glans with lube as seen in the pictures. Today i don't have these appearences anymore, but my current state is that my penis glans is very dry when i pull the foreskin back its sticked on to it and shiny kind of a wax texture but almost with smoothness of a waxy touch but still rough to the touch, and the smell alternates between a bittersweet kind of smell and a fishy smell, and does not hurt when touching the glans even the fine nerve touches. One thing that i notice too is that there is no noticable smegma production since this cream and overwashing it maybe caused it to dry up that much. But now i want to know if there are people out there that had this too, and what this possibly could be just a thrush, i don't think its herpes since i dont have any symptoms, during these last 2 years.

I got prescribed ketoconazole to combat the fungus, i didn't applied it everyday consistently so maybe that could be the case  and never have been to a dermatologist to not working to a full extend but it helped at least... The timeframe of when these symptoms started was quite late actually, i have pictures that where taken in the summer of 2018. Which shows flaky skin on the glans and definitely signs of a candida/yeast/fungi kind of problem.....it did not hurt when touching although the nerves receptors changed slightly more to pain when fine touching the glans since the bacterial composition has favoured this yeast kind of appearance. From what i could remember is that i had red spots around the glans and could morph into white dots(not sure about this order)  that where coming and going and where visible when i would mastrubate the glans with lube as seen in the pictures. Today i don't have these appearences anymore, but my current state is that my penis glans is very dry when i pull the foreskin back its sticked on to it and shiny kind of a wax texture but almost with smoothness of a waxy touch but still rough to the touch, and the smell alternates between a bittersweet kind of smell and a fishy smell, and does not hurt when touching the glans even the fine nerve touches. One thing that i notice too is that there is no noticable smegma production since this cream and overwashing it maybe caused it to dry up that much. But now i want to know if there are people out there that had this too, and what this possibly could be just a thrush, i don't think its herpes since i dont have any symptoms, during these last 2 years. I would really like your guidanceand help!!!! This is how it was in 2018 This is how it looks now 1 like, 18 replies "

It first appeared the day after I used a condom so I think I must have had a reaction to the latex or some other substance in the condom. The tip of the penis became super sensitive and noticeably hurt whenever it touched my underwear. The skin was and still is noticeably red close to and directly around the meatus. This redness gets worse and bigger after I've come out the shower or masturbated. An hour or so after ejaculation, I get a slight burn/irritation at the very end of the urethra when I urinate and this can last for a few days before subsiding. This has put me off from masturbating as much now. This has lasted for about 3 months now with no signs of improvement. I saw a doctor and was prescribed timodine/hydrocortisone cream and this didn't have much effect and am slightly worried it may just make things worse so have stopped using it for now. It almost seems as if the redness comes from within the skin rather than on the surface. I don't think its   as I haven't had that for over 12 years when I was a kid and that was with the usual smegma discharge etc, whereas this is just redness.  I've attached images to show how it looks straight after showering, which is when the redness is at its worst and the contrast between the normal skin colour and the redness can be clearly seen. 7 likes, 1241 replies "

I started Seroxat in 1995 and went from 20, to 30 to 40 mg over the years.  This year, as I was still suffering severe bouts of depression and OCD every year, I decided to come off it.  I cut down from 40, then one week at 30, one week at 20 and three months at 10 mg.  I was thinking of trying Sertraline to see if that worked better but am going to first try a mixture of St John's Wort with other adaptagens, prescribed by a medical herbalist. I felt fine cutting from 40 to 10 but have felt really terrible this week since quitting altogether.  Constant crying spells, shivering, severe anxiety, depression and OCD symptoms. I have also been assessed this year as being on the Aspergers/Dyspraxia spectrum although am awaiting confirmation on the NHS. Can anyone relate to this or tried a similar alternative route? Words of encouragement very helpful.  I run a business sole handed, so this is very disabling. When not affected, i am quite a strong, positive person who achieves quite a lot in terms of business and personal interests. 0 likes, 3 replies "

It's to the point where I am having trouble with my daily routines.  I can not walk through a store and shop without feeling like I could collapse because my muscles are so exhausted.  This started as episodes in my thigh muscles and spread to be episodes in the muscles all over to even the muscles in my face.   When I speak any louder than my normal voice my vocal chords get exhausted and my voice gets weak and raspy.  When I'm eating something that takes chewing the muscles in my jaw get fatigued.  I have no trouble swallowing thank God.  The episodes at the beginning of this were infrequent and didn't last long, maybe 15 minutes but progressed to happening to each muscle that was used every time it was used and taking much longer to recover. After seeing  a neurologist and having all different tests done for jyst about every muscle disease,  he has come to the conclusion it is the Paxil that is causing all of this.  He told me neurologists don't like Paxil and that I was on too high of a dose, 60mg a day.  He told me to cut down to 20mg a day and prescribed Zoloft to start in 2 weeks or sooner if the withdrawal effects get too bad. Big mistake taking that drastic drop in dosage advice!  The withdrawal effects have been horrible especially on top of how I've been feeling with the extreme muscle fatigue in the first place. Here is a list of my withdrawal symptoms: electric brain squeezing, flu like symptoms which include sweating one minute to freezing the next (I'm on day 17 of lower dose and still feeling hot/cold throughout the day), muscle pain like you get with the flu, stomach pain with semi loose bowel movements, big time anxiety episodes, irritable and overly emotional, trouble sleeping throughout the night and when sleepy because of this during the day I constantly wake up in a panic feeling like I'm on the verge of a severe anxiety attack. I contacted my regular physician to talk about these withdrawal symptoms and what would help ease them and she told me the drop in dosage was too fast and I should not be taking the Zoloft the same time I'm taking the Paxil even at the lower dose.  Yikes, it's hard to know what to do when the two Drs. you are relying on to help you contradict each others medical advice. At this time I am alternating 20mg and 10mg and not taking the Zoloft until I stop the Paxil.  I plan on calling my regular physician tomorrow to find out when to next lower the dose of the Paxil so that I can finally be off of it and find out if it is what has been causing the worsening, all over extreme muscle fatigue. My advice to anyone about to start taking Paxil, don't.  Ask your physician for an anxiety medication with less severe withdrawal symptoms.  Reading these symptoms on a list is nothing compared to actually experiencing them in real life.  I will try a low dose of Zoloft and look into cognitive behavior therapy to help me deal with my anxiety. If anyone else has had these extreme muscle fatigue episodes while on Paxil please let me know.  I'd really like to know if my neurologist is on the right track, I have had extremely low quality of life for the past year and am afraid of it becoming a permanent situation. Thanks for reading!

I am at my wits end with sex related pelvic pain. Let me start right at the beginning, when i was 17 (i am now 21) i had pelvic inflammatory disease and ended up in hospital to treat the infection it was so bad. Last year i started to experience extremely heavy and painful periods to the point where i couldnt go to work or leave the house when i was having my period. I was also experiencing a deep pain during intercourse. The pain felt as if it were in my stomach and sometimes back and rectum. This really had an impact on my life as you could imagine so after countless drs appointments i was taken to hospital for a laparoscopy. They found that i had a bicornuate uterus however this was no reason for pain. They found scar tissue from my previous infection that they managed to get rid of, they said this wasnt the reason for pain either. They found a fibral cyst which was removed and a polyp in my womb which was removed. They told me when i woke up that nothing they found would have caused the pain. I went home and healed and got back to my everyday life. I started to have sex again and was still experiencing pain. Periods are slightly more bearable but the pain during sex was there. I ignored it and thought i might just still be healing internally that is until i had sex lastnight 10 months after my op and experienced really awful pain. I dont know what else to do, im going to the drs tomorrow but im so sure theyll say theres nothing more they can do as theyve already investigated. I just dont know what im going to do i cant just be in pain for the rest of my sex life there has to be something causing it  i just need some advice. sorry its a long one but i dont know who else to turn to 0 likes, 0 replies "

Worried.","I really don't know which category to post this in, because I have no pain yet anyway, but please please help me! I'm so worried. I'm 24 years old btw. Okay so first of all, I've been under-eating for a few years now and this summer I decided to really get myself together and eat more healthy fats etc and gain weight. I also wanted to start eating more fats in the hopes that maybe balancing my hormones because I've had acne for a couple of years. My skin has cleared up a lot etc, and my last period came a week early. That period was really weird though. I usually have period cramps a day or two before the period comes. This time, I had NO pain AT ALL before, during or after my period! Once my period had ended (two weekends ago, around July 12-13 something) I noticed that my stomach looked really bloated, which is not unusual since I have IBS and am bloated a lot. But it was bloated in a weird kind of way. It looked more swollen on the right side so I looked further down and noticed that I'm swollen in the pelvic area on my right side. I don't know exactly WHERE to describe but yeah... Today it's still there, and I still look pregnant and bloated although I'm a virgin.  I also don't have any IBS symptoms but I still look bloated and I definitely see that it's more swollen to the right compared to the left. It's like a ""bump"". I called a gynecologist today but she seemed to not know what it could be, she even questioned whether it's actually gynecological! I told her I'm worried it might be a cyst, but she said that they usually hurt and that they are not seen on the outside. I haven't really noticed any significant pain in the swollen area so far... So now I'm worried that it might be a tumor or maybe a swollen lymph node that is related to some cancer?! She didn't have an appointment until next week, when I'm on vacation... So we agreed that I should call again when I get back from my vacation if it's still there. I'm still really worried though and I don't want to have to worry during my vacation. Earlier in June, I had a swollen lymph node on my neck. It's still there but a doctor has checked it and told me not to worry about it as long as it's not increasing in size, which it hasn't.  I also had really itchy skin back then so I was worried it was lymphoma or something. The itching stopped after around 1,5 months though. It only itches a normal amount nowadays, which means that it barely itches, at least not enough for me to be bothered by it. Has anyone has the same thing or know what it might be? I have read about girls around my age, or even younger who have gotten cervical/ovarian cancer, despite being virgins, so that's why I'm worried. And the reason why I mentioned my eating habits in the beginning of this post is because I figure that my increased fat intake may ave played a role in my hormone balance, and maybe has something to do with it? I don't know. 0 likes, 1 reply "

It is hard to explain how it feels. It seems like it started in my lower left abdomen and moved to the center and now it has moved down to the pelvic area. I am 50 yo male, reasonably active and have recently given up on soda, and have seriously cut back my sugar intake, to almost nothing. I thought I may have a UTI, or something like that. It has been this way for as I say about 3 weeks or so, thought it was a stomach issue at first but that seems not to be the case. Anyone have any advice, suggestions, etc...? 0 likes, 2 replies "

In six months I have put on a stone and my tummy is sticking out as if I'm pregnant.  I have been on various internet sites to find out why this is happening and I can't find the answers.  I believe it is the medication.  I spoke to someone from British Thyroid Foundation and she was very rude and unhelpful.  She insisted that it wasn't the medication.  Well, I had no problems with weight for 35 years and all of a sudden when taking Levothyroxine my weight shoots up, there is something going  wrong and I'm not at all happy. This is very depressing.  I feel are we all being tried out as guinea pigs and then in years to come they will admit to it!! Has anyone else had the same problem cos I'm at my wits end.  I want to come off this medication its made me feel a lot worse than before.

He said my TSH was a little off (tsh of 6) but my free t4 was normal so it was nothing to worry about). I had a follow up with my primary doctor who was convinced that it was hypothyroid because of my extreme fatigue following these episodes. She put me on 50 mcg of levothyroxine. My first day of the levothyroxine I had a panic attack that was the worst I ever had - it made my whole body go numb and I was shaking like crazy and my heart rate was over 100.

I stopped the fluoxetine after 6 days due to many hospital visits where they have said nothing was wrong. My labs in between this time said that my tsh was at a normal level (this being before the medicine could even get into my system- it had only been a week). I have now been on levothyroxine for 3 weeks and have had extreme anxiousness, excessive thirst (drinking over a gallon of water a day) and insomnia and restlessness. I went back to my doctor and she took me off of the levothyroxine to see if my labs would stay consistent and normal since there was so much fluctuation the past 4 weeks.

Hello All, I am reaching out in pure desperation in hopes someone can shed some light on whatever is going on with my body. I am a 37 year old male who has had GI issues the majority of my life, however the past two years have been a nightmare battling constipation.  I know the basics regarding what causes constipation, etc.  This is more so an anatomy issue, at least I think. Basically my body will not allow me to empty out.  Gas feces, etc. collects in my lower abdomen- mainly my lower left side or under my bellybutton and just stays there. No matter what I do I can not get my body to relax and pass things.  I’ve taken Linzess, Trulance, Motegrity, etc. and nothing changes the problem, in fact it gives me the urge to go and the pain builds up. This happens with gas too so I know it’s an issue with my body.  It’s as if one part is turned off while the other is on.  If I take laxatives before bed I’m able to wake up and go a bit.  I have also taken Valium, Xanax, and Lorazepam and they too help a bit.  I was also given prednisone for inflammation and that doesn’t help. I have been to a ton of doctors and no one seems to get what is going on. 0 likes, 10 replies "

I had blood tests and stool tests done, which came back normal and was told I may have IBS. I was prescribed peppermint tablets, which didn't really help, and my symptoms weren't too severe so i didn't worry. About 2 months ago i was prescribed NSAIDs for an unrelated condition, along with medication to protect my stomach to prevent ulcers. Within 2 doses i was having bad stomach cramps, and booked an emergency GP appointment. The GP noticed abdominal tenderness, a borderline fever, and was concerned, so sent me to the SAU. My bloods cane back normal, with borderline high white blood cell levels. The next day i was given an ultrasound which was normal, and a faecal calprotectin test, which came back inconclusive (52 ug/g?? i think), so they ordered a repeat in 6 weeks it took me about a month to recover from this, with severe nausea and loss of appetite, diarrhea, extreme fatigue (I was exhausted however much i slept). I was really affected by whatever it was. I had a flexi sigmoidoscopy for suspected IBD which i found very painful, so they had to stop before they got past my rectum, but they found inflammation that i have been told is proctitis. They didn't manage to get to the area where I actually have the pain, which is what I am worried about. I had the follow up calprotectin test, which came back as 166 (ug/g???), which I am told is abnormal. I am still having some pain on my left side. I am seeing a gastroenterologist in a few weeks, but I want to know what to expect - will i need another endoscopy? Has anyone else had a similar experience? Does this sound like IBD? thanks 😃 0 likes, 4 replies "

About 2 months ago i was prescribed NSAIDs for an unrelated condition, along with medication to protect my stomach to prevent ulcers. Within 2 doses i was having bad stomach cramps, and booked an emergency GP appointment. The GP noticed abdominal tenderness, a borderline fever, and was concerned, so sent me to the SAU. My bloods cane back normal, with borderline high white blood cell levels. The next day i was given an ultrasound which was normal, and a faecal calprotectin test, which came back inconclusive (52 ug/g?? i think), so they ordered a repeat in 6 weeks it took me about a month to recover from this, with severe nausea and loss of appetite, diarrhea, extreme fatigue (I was exhausted however much i slept). I was really affected by whatever it was. I had a flexi sigmoidoscopy for suspected IBD which i found very painful, so they had to stop before they got past my rectum, but they found inflammation that i have been told is proctitis. They didn't manage to get to the area where I actually have the pain, which is what I am worried about. I had the follow up calprotectin test, which came back as 166 (ug/g???), which I am told is abnormal. I am still having some pain on my left side. I am seeing a gastroenterologist in a few weeks, but I want to know what to expect - will i need another endoscopy? Has anyone else had a similar experience? Does this sound like IBD? thanks 😃 0 likes, 4 replies "

729,C0009319,Colitis,C0011991,Diarrhea,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/strategy-for-nightly-enema-699053,Strategy for nightly enema,"Following a recent sigmoidoscopy  which revealed colitis was prolonging my diarrhoea, i was proscribed  octasa tablets and a salofalk enema. Following my 2nd go with the enema last night , i have realised that a degree of experimentation is needed to make the most of this treatment. My daily routine is normally 5 am to  8 pm so i administered my first dose at 8 am, waited 30 minutes before relaxing and then thought,to my cost,  i could go about my evening as usual. But alas no. I soon had to use the loo to let it out. Last night i waited till 9 pm and managed to stay the course till midnight when i was woken from my sleep for the loo. My question is just this.  Since the  package leaflet is not too revealing is there a way to take these that can maximise the benefit and minimise the disruption to my sleep for the next 26 days. Tonight i am going back to administering at 8 pm to see if this helps. 0 likes, 8 replies "

Last week added to the discomfort I passed blood, then evacuated everything in my body numerous times within the morning then for the next few days had fever and chills, whole body aches and pains etc. is this what to expect of a real flare up and is the usual discomfort I have had for months the remission part or can I expect some better. 0 likes, 7 replies "

I've been taking 90 mcq. of compounded levothyroxine 4 about a month.  For the past 5 days I've reduced the dose 2 88 mcq. as I felt I was getting way 2 much thyroid meds.  Now I'm totally confused to what the half life is and how to calculate how my levothyroxine I'm actually getting as I'm feeling absolutely horrible with chronic insomnia, adrenaline surges,  /panic attacks, depersonalization/derealization etc.  Can anybody please help me with this as I'm going out of my mind with the ongoing lack of sleep. I'm also suffering at the present time with severe protracted withdrawal from psych meds which I should never have been on and know that this could also be affecting the thyroid meds.  I was on Gabapentin (for 14 years off for 4 years), Zoplicone (on for 7 months off for 4 years), Seroquel (on for about 3 /2 years off for 3 1/2 years) and Remeron (on for 14 years off for 28 months).

I  later started noticing i was getting ringing//fullness/pulsation  in my left ear would also come with a weird vibration in my body . Sometimes I would think my Bp was high but it was  been normal . In addition, I would feel as if my stomach/chest was vibration/pulsating .  I would also get  a pulling feeling in chest and stomach especially epigastric area . Because of all these feelings it is difficult to sleep .  People tell you about common symptoms of peri/menoupause  like hot flashes but  never these symptoms .  Because of  these symptoms, i  feel as if i am developing   .

I'm new here.  I have not received a formal diagnosis yet, but am in the testing process.  It's a little unnerving because I have virtually all the symptoms and signs.   The ""allergy attacks"" started on 6/28.   I had a ten day span where I had anaphylactic reactions scout four or five times, even without exposure to what we thought triggered the first one, and was in the hospital 8 of those ten days.  I even had an anaphalytic reaction to solumedrol, they steroid they use to treat anaphylaxis!   I was released on July 8.  Following my release from the hospital, I went to an allergist who suspected that I had a mast cell problem and sent me to this specialist about an hour and a half away.  He has brought up the mast cell thing as well and is currently reviewing my records and running tests.   I was discharged from hospits on Zyrtec and Singulair at night.  The specialist bumped up the Zyrtec to twice a day.   Since being out of the hospital on July 8, I've had to more attacks in this 14 day period.  The first I was able to manage with Benadryl.  It happened after a kid got into my car smelling like a ash try.  I got a bit lightheaded, headache, and that AWFUL burning and stinging sensation all over my body.  The second one started on Thursday of this week.  I could feel light burning and tingling but it wasn't unmanageable.  Friday, after exercising for a few minutes, when I stopped, the burning and tingling started getting severe.   I was also a little short of breath and started coughing.  I took my rescue inhaler and Benadryl.   After a while I thought I was in the clear.  But like two and a half hours later, I was driving and it hit me full on.   Chest pain, unbearable burning/stinging, couldn't swallow, getting dizzy.  I was taken by ambulance to hospital from the side of the highway.  My heart rate was hitting 150s, nauseated, blood pressure extremely elevated.   I overheard the paramedic telling the nurse that besides the Benadryl he had given me a placebo to lower my heart rate to see if I was faking I guess?

I'm new here.  I have not received a formal diagnosis yet, but am in the testing process.  It's a little unnerving because I have virtually all the symptoms and signs.   The ""allergy attacks"" started on 6/28.   I had a ten day span where I had anaphylactic reactions scout four or five times, even without exposure to what we thought triggered the first one, and was in the hospital 8 of those ten days.  I even had an anaphalytic reaction to solumedrol, they steroid they use to treat anaphylaxis!   I was released on July 8.  Following my release from the hospital, I went to an allergist who suspected that I had a mast cell problem and sent me to this specialist about an hour and a half away.  He has brought up the mast cell thing as well and is currently reviewing my records and running tests.   I was discharged from hospits on Zyrtec and Singulair at night.  The specialist bumped up the Zyrtec to twice a day.   Since being out of the hospital on July 8, I've had to more attacks in this 14 day period.  The first I was able to manage with Benadryl.  It happened after a kid got into my car smelling like a ash try.  I got a bit lightheaded, headache, and that AWFUL burning and stinging sensation all over my body.  The second one started on Thursday of this week.  I could feel light burning and tingling but it wasn't unmanageable.  Friday, after exercising for a few minutes, when I stopped, the burning and tingling started getting severe.   I was also a little short of breath and started coughing.  I took my rescue inhaler and Benadryl.   After a while I thought I was in the clear.  But like two and a half hours later, I was driving and it hit me full on.   Chest pain, unbearable burning/stinging, couldn't swallow, getting dizzy.  I was taken by ambulance to hospital from the side of the highway.  My heart rate was hitting 150s, nauseated, blood pressure extremely elevated.   I overheard the paramedic telling the nurse that besides the Benadryl he had given me a placebo to lower my heart rate to see if I was faking I guess?

I want to live so badly but I cant see a way out and living like this is complete hell. So heres the details... I was diagnosed with marfans clinically at age 16 but showed variant on the genetic test. I possibly could have eds but the geneticist diagnosed me anyways in order to get me into the losartan marfans clinical trial.  I had a pleurodesis on the left side at age 18 at ucla by a thorascic surgeon due to recurrent pneumothoraxes I have had a border line aorta of 32 mm that never bothered me since I was 18 and now im 28.  I had an small pneumothorax on the left on dec 2016 at ucla hosipital but I went home hoping it would heal on its own. In march 2017 I had a similar air leak sensation and tried to wait it out  by taking percocet and codeine. Since then my life went to complete hell i started getting this horrible swelling in left neck and burning sensation like my blood was on fire, I couldnt swallow too well and developed a high pulse of 100 with a blood pressure of 100 top number. I went the ucla er fearing cardiovascular collapse then they took an iodine contrast ct and found nothing and sent me home. The next morning I woke up with the worst heart pain and swelling in my neck. This led to more percocet and more iodine ct er trips. Since then Ive had drenching night sweats every night with the worst sun burn sensation that wakes me up like 5 in the morning. In mid May I had numbness all over my fingers and feet and thought it was clots so i took some aspirin in case but it caused even more er trips because i would wake up with this painful burning sensation like heart failure or something then if i stayed awake i would just pass out and be instantly woken up by pain. My blood pressure dropped to 70 with a pulse of 105. I rushed to ER and they did another iodine ct scan and found squat. Ive gone to so many specialist and got placed on anxiety meds. Ive seen the cardiologist, pulmonoligist, ENT, endocrinologist, rheumatologist, dermatologist, and pain management but everything checks out. Ive even gotten so desperate with how sick i am every day that I even went to the psychiatrist and took the lexapro and klonopin for a while. Those made it horrible. I was mentally ok even though the flare ups were horrible and never went away but after the psych meds I got super emotional and twitchy. I got off them and dealt with the withdrawal painfully, but now recently Ive developed hives that just come and go anywhere between 5mins to a few hrs all over my body. I found out about mast cells from looking up allergies recently and realized that when I wake up to cold sweat and swelling my eyes are super puffy and my esophagus is super dried out like I used to get allergies and take benedryl. Ive become hyper sensitive to heat  and flush with a pulse that gets higher by the day. Every day that passes by my pulse consistently rises with a dull chest pain that I have no idea how to lower. Im taking benedryl, zertec and claritin and histablock within the last few days. My doctors refuse to see me anymore. They pretty much have forsaken me because its in the system that I have anxiety and been sent to a psychiatric ward. Its just happened so drastically I cant cope too well. I was a normal person that didnt have have any of these issues and now i cant stabilize my debilitating condition especially my heart and no one believes me because they think its anxiety disorder. I am struggling but thats because I cant get any treatment or help for 4 months of a nameless illness that randomly flares and wont get any better. Ive looked into the cancers but my cbcs are all normal and all the cts Ive had are so recent and show no tumors or anything. I feel like my blood is poison everyday because it spreads an inflammatory pain throughout my body causing me to sweat cold sweat and wear my heart out. I cant stabilize because no doctor seems to take me seriously enough to help me manage this. My last hope is that someone from the community can help me through this I dont know who to turn to anymore. My parents are sick of my crying and endless pain. Im so sick of this I just want to go back to how a was a few months ago. Is that even possible? Sorry for ranting things are beyond rough and Im so lost and the condition keeps worsening.

Im going to be completely honest in hope that someone in the community can save me. Im on the verge of possibly commiting   because I can no longer see the light at the end of this horrid tunnel. I want to live so badly but I cant see a way out and living like this is complete hell. So heres the details... I was diagnosed with marfans clinically at age 16 but showed variant on the genetic test. I possibly could have eds but the geneticist diagnosed me anyways in order to get me into the losartan marfans clinical trial.  I had a pleurodesis on the left side at age 18 at ucla by a thorascic surgeon due to recurrent pneumothoraxes I have had a border line aorta of 32 mm that never bothered me since I was 18 and now im 28.  I had an small pneumothorax on the left on dec 2016 at ucla hosipital but I went home hoping it would heal on its own. In march 2017 I had a similar air leak sensation and tried to wait it out  by taking percocet and codeine. Since then my life went to complete hell i started getting this horrible swelling in left neck and burning sensation like my blood was on fire, I couldnt swallow too well and developed a high pulse of 100 with a blood pressure of 100 top number. I went the ucla er fearing cardiovascular collapse then they took an iodine contrast ct and found nothing and sent me home. The next morning I woke up with the worst heart pain and swelling in my neck. This led to more percocet and more iodine ct er trips. Since then Ive had drenching night sweats every night with the worst sun burn sensation that wakes me up like 5 in the morning. In mid May I had numbness all over my fingers and feet and thought it was clots so i took some aspirin in case but it caused even more er trips because i would wake up with this painful burning sensation like heart failure or something then if i stayed awake i would just pass out and be instantly woken up by pain. My blood pressure dropped to 70 with a pulse of 105. I rushed to ER and they did another iodine ct scan and found squat. Ive gone to so many specialist and got placed on anxiety meds. Ive seen the cardiologist, pulmonoligist, ENT, endocrinologist, rheumatologist, dermatologist, and pain management but everything checks out. Ive even gotten so desperate with how sick i am every day that I even went to the psychiatrist and took the lexapro and klonopin for a while. Those made it horrible. I was mentally ok even though the flare ups were horrible and never went away but after the psych meds I got super emotional and twitchy. I got off them and dealt with the withdrawal painfully, but now recently Ive developed hives that just come and go anywhere between 5mins to a few hrs all over my body. I found out about mast cells from looking up allergies recently and realized that when I wake up to cold sweat and swelling my eyes are super puffy and my esophagus is super dried out like I used to get allergies and take benedryl. Ive become hyper sensitive to heat  and flush with a pulse that gets higher by the day. Every day that passes by my pulse consistently rises with a dull chest pain that I have no idea how to lower. Im taking benedryl, zertec and claritin and histablock within the last few days. My doctors refuse to see me anymore. They pretty much have forsaken me because its in the system that I have anxiety and been sent to a psychiatric ward. Its just happened so drastically I cant cope too well. I was a normal person that didnt have have any of these issues and now i cant stabilize my debilitating condition especially my heart and no one believes me because they think its anxiety disorder. I am struggling but thats because I cant get any treatment or help for 4 months of a nameless illness that randomly flares and wont get any better. Ive looked into the cancers but my cbcs are all normal and all the cts Ive had are so recent and show no tumors or anything. I feel like my blood is poison everyday because it spreads an inflammatory pain throughout my body causing me to sweat cold sweat and wear my heart out. I cant stabilize because no doctor seems to take me seriously enough to help me manage this. My last hope is that someone from the community can help me through this I dont know who to turn to anymore. My parents are sick of my crying and endless pain. Im so sick of this I just want to go back to how a was a few months ago. Is that even possible? Sorry for ranting things are beyond rough and Im so lost and the condition keeps worsening.

I've read, with dubious authority that blurred vision may generally just be an MCAS etc. issue.  I've also had eye discomfort but never this degree of idiopathic pain.  I saw an ophthalmologist who could find no discernible issue on examination (but didn't do like tear tryptase stuff etc.).  So two tangential questions - 1)  Does anyone have experience with tear tryptase tests?  Where do you go to have that done - allergist?  Ophthalmologist? 2)  Does anyone have any experience with these symptoms - severe almost foreign object pain and acute blurring without any other discernible symptoms like fainting or dizziness?  (I concede the possibility this may just be the most recent peak severity of my other eye symptoms... but the blurriness isn't really tenable.) To the original question, it seems all commercial preparations of cromolyn and ketotifen eye drops have benzalkonium chloride.  I can't find for-sale single-use vials, which allegedly don't use the preservative.  But whether or not this is my issue (and I suspect it is not), how do MCAS patients who react to benzalkonium chloride get around this issue? 0 likes, 3 replies "

I have an appointment with Dr. Akin but not until September. My allergist is trying to help me, but he is at a loss. My ENT doesn't know what to do either. Forget the resident I see. I was supposed to a TKR but they say it's too risky. Has anyone had problems with plastics or replacements? I am bummed as I hate being so deaf. I'd like to hear my grandson talking to me. Is there hypoallergenic hearing aids? I have been reduced to only being able to eat about 8 foods. My nails are splitting, and I know I'm not getting nutrition. What vitamins are safe, probiotics? I have to be gf, dairy free, etc. What a life. I'm itching right now. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I am having a really bad degranulation event. I can't seem to get it under control. It has been going for almost a month. I went to the allergist, saw his new NP, and she had no answers. They want me to try Allegra, but I am leery of trying another med as I had reactions to Nexium and Zyrtec. I think I have mastocytosis as my tryptase was over 20 even without reactions. Been in the ER 3 times, but they don't help. Yesterday I took my Vitamin D3 and calcium and had a reaction. I am talking about sudden feeling of doom, low bp, and I grabbed the benadryl. It pulled me out of it, but now I don't know if it was that or if my histamine levels are not being controlled by the meds. She wouldn't order any blood work. My urinalysis is showing a high pH and I'm going into ketosis, slight for now. I am limited to only a few foods I can tolerate and they are bothering me now. I am on cromolyn, Zantac, Claritin, Flonase, eye drops, and Benadryl as needed. The benadryl really helps, but don't want to use it all time. The NP said if it continues they might have to consider a food line. I said no. It is in my GI tract. I have had polyps removed that were full of lymphatic tissue and other cells, but at the time they didn't test for mastocytosis. The Immunologist is pretty sure I have it in the gut. Joy. I have constant heartburn (helped by benadryl! That's why they think the mast cells are everywhere), terrible abdominal pain, diarrhea, and now blood. I am existing on bone broth. I can't eat anything not organic. It is getting expensive. I can't take any antibiotics, antifungals, etc. I have to avoid people, even my grandchildren for fear of catching something. I see Dr. Akin at U of M in September. I am trying to stay alive until then. Any suggestions would be appreciated. My PCP just won't even consider discussing this and says go to the specialist. My gastro's office says the same thing! I am hoping Dr. Akin can suggest a good PCP and gastro who will work with him. BTW, I had a bone biopsy that just showed low ferritin, which I didn't know is a sign of mastocytosis too. I really don't want another one done, but the doctor said sometimes they miss the spot. Joy! I really want some decent blood work done. I have swollen lymph glands and a tender spleen, but they just keep passing me off to the next doctor to try to find an answer. The NP just held me hand and told me there's nothing she can do! 0 likes, 3 replies "

The NP just held me hand and told me there's nothing she can do! 0 likes, 3 replies "

I want to explore why doctors often misdiagnose people who have MCAS or pass them off as hypochondriacs. I want to interview people with this syndrome, and focus on educating the public. I am writing to you because I would like to know if you are interested in sharing your story for my podcast. I know that the more people that I interview, the fuller picture I’ll be able to give of what it’s like to live with MCAS. I want to educate myself as well as the public so that hopefully more people with MCAS can receive help sooner (it took me over 10 years to finally get a diagnosis). If you're interested, please message me and let me know!  🙂 By the way: if you want, I can include written stories anonymously. Or you could record your story in your own words, written or spoken. Thank you in advance for your time and help! Sincerely,  -Madison  3 likes, 2 replies "

Ive been really struggling with coping with my symptoms and diagnosis journey for MCAS. Not really medically (although that has been difficult as well) but coping mentally has been hard. I wanted to start this discussion to meet other people going through the same thing because I feel like my family, and even my doctors, dont really understand what Im going through right now and Im just super confused about everything since I dont know anyone with this condition to compare it to. I first started with symptoms when I was 15, I ate ice cream and suddenly started feeling like someone was sitting on my chest and restricting my breathing. I went to three different allergists – all of which said that I was not allergic to dairy. I kept eating dairy (despite the fact that it usually did not turn out well for me) mostly because I was in denial about suddenly having any type of limitation. Finally, when I was 17 I decided to give up dairy all together because my symptoms were starting to get really scary. Over time I have developed an allergy to many more foods (dairy, egg, gluten, peanuts, cashews, sesame, shellfish, coffee, peas, green beans, certain strong smells, chemicals, etc). Typically what I think to be allergic reactions present themselves through shortness of breath, chest tightness, coughing, lightheartedness, dizziness, flushing/hot flash, itchy skin (but never a rash or hives), nausea or a variation of said symptoms which (if they get really bad) are typically resolved by using an epipen. Recently I have also had a lot of trouble eating since I get full very quickly and start feeling super nauseous afterwards. The thing is: I have never had hives so what if its all in my head? Could these be caused by panic attacks, although its gotten to a point when Im not even worried when I get a reaction, my thought is usually something along the lines of ""dang it, there goes my streak""? I saw an allergist who told me that it might be MCAS, but all of the tests we have done keep coming back negative: we did a test for the kit mutation as well as a 24 hr urine histamine test. My doctor decided to put me on medication for mast cell to see what happens and they have really helped. They have slightly helped reduced the amount of reactions (I went from a reaction once to twice a week to going two weeks without a reaction at times) and they have made my reactions less severe in terms of symptoms and the amount of time it takes for it to go away. I was just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? Has anyone else had episodes where its just one symptom? Sometimes I will randomly have chest tightness but no flushing or dizziness, which I dont know if thats typical of an allergic reaction, if that is an allergic reaction. I would appreciate any advice anyone could give me on this, thanks! 0 likes, 1 reply "

I'm not in a relationship and no plans any time soon since college takes up my time, but I'd like to have a more normal cycle length. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Here are my questions: I've had a chronic cough for years, and occasionally my throat and nose will close up completely so I cannot breathe at all during a coughing spell.

It is dark like old blood and crumbly, not like the flowing bright red stuff I usually have. Usually I have a heavyish period for a few days and then it tapers off for the last few days. It has been consistent since I started when I was 14 (I'm 25 now). I even did a pregnancy test last month because I read blood like that could be implantation bleeding, it was negative, it was unlikely anyway as I have a copper IUD. I'm also experiencing vaginal dryness (I can get wet but it takes a while, and isn't as much as it was before. I also have low libido when in the past I've always had a high one. I will have sex if my boyfriend initiates it, but otherwise I just don't feel horny, and I don't masturbate when he's not there, like I used to. Everything I've found on google suggests premature menopause. None of the other explanations fit me, I don't have an eating disorder, I'm fit but not an athlete, I don't take hormonal birth control and I'm not breastfeeding. My mum had the menopause at a normal age in her 50s, and I presume my grandmother did. But the internet says 60% of cases are idiopathic anyway, 1/1000 women under 30 have this condition and I feel like it would be just my luck to have it. One of the symptoms is even weak bones and I broke a bone in my pelvis a few months ago that the doctor said is rare in young people (however he commented saying the bone density looked fine on the xrays.) I also have discomfort in my lower abdomen and vulva most of the time, my physiotherapist also told me to ask for a blood test from my doctor as I have sore joints all over my body. I've also been having digestive issues over a similar time frame. I've dreamed my whole life of having children and I'm so so anxious about these symptoms, I can't stop crying thinking I can't have children and my boyfriend will leave me as he wants them too. I feel so depressed. I had a kind of stressful time around 4 months ago as I had exams, however I've been through much more stressful events in my life such as relatives passing away and that never affected my cycle. Plus I've finished studying now and it hasn't gone back to normal. I will go to the doctor tomorrow but I can't think of any other cause 😦 feel so depressed and hopeless 0 likes, 0 replies "

I am 15, 16 this July. My family has a history of uterine fibroids on my mothers side and I believe my grandma on my dads side had breast cancer. My last period was hell for me, I have noticed the pain getting stronger over the course of my last few periods, but the most recent one just had me curled up on my bed waiting to die. Cramps and back pain so bad I couldn't walk downstairs. I also couldn't eat, as the very thought of it made me want to vomit (ended up drinking some tomato soup). The pain went away after I somehow forced myself asleep, but I decided to take pain medication from then on as I NEVER want to experience that ever again. I started getting cramps a little more than a week after my period ended, and now it has escalated to bleeding, which is more than spotting. I am also producing brown discharge along with the blood which may just be blood. I am on day 23 of my on average 36 day cycle (length varies a lot, least I had was 29 days and most was 47 days, 60 day missed period too) Can anyone tell me what this might be?

I am awaiting to book another appointment in with the doctor but  I am wondering if anyone on here has a similar condition and if their is any clarification on what this all could mean.

I think? So, at least seven years. My periods have always been heavy, sometimes seeming too heavy, which I thought was strange because I always heard when you're on birth control, your periods become lighter or could stop completely. My last two periods were really light. My first light period didn't concern me too much because I thought maybe it was stress but then my period I just had, was a lot lighter. It was so light I only wore a tampon to bed and if I went out in public but even when I had a tampon in, there was barely any blood or none at all. I'm not consistent with my pills and I never take them at the same time so I'm more concerned now because I'm wondering if it's possible I could be pregnant even on the pill. I've also been experiencing period-like cramps even though I rarely ever have cramps before, after, or during my period and I've felt super bloated lately. Even after I have a bowel movement I still feel bloated, usually even more bloated than before. This morning I work up feeling really nauseous and light headed. My body also really hurts and I feel so tired and really weak. Should I be concerned? 0 likes, 0 replies "

As I am writing this my entire body is weak and shaking, and I am nauseated with pain. This has been happening every month or so on my period for about 6 years (since I got my first, I am 18). Over these 6 years, I have had probably 6 or 7 different gynecologists and 4 different primary care doctors. No one has been able to give me an answer and gynecologists in particular have not taken me seriously. First, let me describe the pain itself. Over the last few years it has gotten significantly worse. I experience intense ovulation pain and cramps a week BEFORE my period (My periods were super irregular for a few years while my system recovered from the various birth controls, which I'll get to later, but are now back to a consistent 30-40 days between each one). During the period, I have medium to heavy bleeding, and for the first few days the cramps are so intense at times that I cannot walk, move, sleep, or in some cases breathe. I end up holding my breath for over a minute with each cramp because even the slight movement of air going in and out of my lungs worsens them. The pain also wakes me up in my sleep sometimes and I am unable to go back to bed. The cramps come and go repeatedly, similar to how labor contractions have been described to me. I self treat this pain with the maximum dose of Ibuprofen for someone my size, which I believe is 800mg every 6 to 8 hours (6 if I cannot handle the pain any longer). This takes about an hour to take effect and wears off about 4 hours after I take it. But during those 4 hours I am able to suppress the pain enough to function at least. (Note: over the years, my bleeding has not increased, but the pain has). I'm very worried that this repeated use of Ibuprofen every month (sometimes paired with the maximum dose of Acetaminophen if I have it) is dangerous for my kidneys and liver. One doctor recommended that I aim for 400mg instead of 800mg, but this is literally the ONLY semi-solution to my pain. Now to my story. I have been prescribed several different birth control pills, the shot, and the IUD in an attempt to stop my periods. All of these resulted in extreme side effects such as a long period of severe depression, anxiety, 50+ lb weight gain, insomnia, and suicidal thinking and ultimately self harm (all of which were misdiagnosed as being actual health conditions of mine, and I was given sleep medication, antidepressants, and therapy. Turns out they could all be linked back to birth control). The IUD itself caused one long period with non-stop intense cramping, which didn't end until I had it removed. I KNOW that these were side effects of brith control and side effects only. I have educated myself on mental health over these years for this exact reason, and I am the most calm and positive person I know, and that depression and anxiety are NOT something I would normally experience. On top of this, no doctor ever warned me of any birth control side effect before I took it. In fact, I was even cautioned against Googling the side effects because they would quote just scare me and only are experienced in extreme cases. Turns out I'm an extreme case, in every case. Because of this, I am unwilling to try any of these traditional birth controls or other hormonal medications ever again. When I tell gynecologists that my body does not react well to hormonal medications and I refuse to take them, they seem to be personally offended and can't offer me much advice after that, then I switch to another and the cycle continues. I even had to leave school, and all of my friends, because of the extreme side effects of birth control. The depression, anxiety, lack of sleep, and intense pain mixed together resulted in me having to enroll in an online academy and stay at home. My entire high school years have been online. While I enjoy my freedom in an online acadeny, my loneliness has negatively impacted my mental health. I am also seriously concerned about going off and starting my career and living life. Am I just supposed to stay home from work for a week every month? I am also considering enlisting in the military, which has been a life long dream of mine and is now compromised because I have been misdiagnosed with mental health conditions and birth control resulted in seriously disqualifying side effects such as self harm. I can only hope and pray that an exception will be made because of the complicatedness of this situation. I have been examined for endometriosis and tested for hormonal conditions that could be resulting in the pain, but the gynecologist that did this testing was only concerned that I wasn't getting pregnant and did not take my pain seriously, constantly mentioning birth control options. She seemed honestly bewildered when I stated that I would not consider birth control. I have had more than one gynecologist like this whos' only solutions to my pain were to sell me birth control or tell me to ""pop an Ibuprofen"". I am at a point in my life where if there was any long-lasting side effects of the birth controls I was given, they should now be gone (besides the massive weight gain, which I am still trying to shed to this day). There were no anomalies found in the scan of my uterus for endometriosis. There seems to be no explanation for my pain. I can say now that I was raised by a very tough woman and I have an extremely high pain tolerance. I recovered from surgeries and had a few accidents resulting in serious injury. I can handle pain, I know what real pain feels like and I know my periods are still the most painful thing I have ever felt and continue to get worse. I continuously see on online health forums that if my pain is interfering with my ability to function in normal life, I need to seek medical help. I have been now for 5 or 6 years. Either my pain is not being taken seriously because I am a teenage girl, or no doctor truly knows what is going on. I believe I should be able to go to work, go to school, and live my life without damaging my liver/kidneys, and being unable to move from unbearable pain. I eat extremely healthy organic food and I exercise every single day. I keep sugar low and get good fiber and other nutrients (I do not have a magnesium deficiency). I really do believe there is something underlying going on here. I am at a total loss. I have no idea what to do or who to ask for help. I am seeing another new doctor soon who hopefully isn't just trying to sell me birth control. I'm sorry if this sounds aggressive, but I am truly exhausted with the obsession of gynecologists for preventing pregnancy. I am not sexually active and never have been. This is about relieving my pain that is only getting worse, and as I lay here typing this I am literally nearing my breaking point of pain I can handle. I have yet to pass out from pain, but sometimes I wish I would so I didn't have to feel it anymore. I'm writing this because I have no answers, and after years now of researching my situation and scouring the internet for others with this exact problem, I have found very little promising information.

As I am writing this my entire body is weak and shaking, and I am nauseated with pain. This has been happening every month or so on my period for about 6 years (since I got my first, I am 18). Over these 6 years, I have had probably 6 or 7 different gynecologists and 4 different primary care doctors. No one has been able to give me an answer and gynecologists in particular have not taken me seriously. First, let me describe the pain itself. Over the last few years it has gotten significantly worse. I experience intense ovulation pain and cramps a week BEFORE my period (My periods were super irregular for a few years while my system recovered from the various birth controls, which I'll get to later, but are now back to a consistent 30-40 days between each one). During the period, I have medium to heavy bleeding, and for the first few days the cramps are so intense at times that I cannot walk, move, sleep, or in some cases breathe. I end up holding my breath for over a minute with each cramp because even the slight movement of air going in and out of my lungs worsens them. The pain also wakes me up in my sleep sometimes and I am unable to go back to bed. The cramps come and go repeatedly, similar to how labor contractions have been described to me. I self treat this pain with the maximum dose of Ibuprofen for someone my size, which I believe is 800mg every 6 to 8 hours (6 if I cannot handle the pain any longer). This takes about an hour to take effect and wears off about 4 hours after I take it. But during those 4 hours I am able to suppress the pain enough to function at least. (Note: over the years, my bleeding has not increased, but the pain has). I'm very worried that this repeated use of Ibuprofen every month (sometimes paired with the maximum dose of Acetaminophen if I have it) is dangerous for my kidneys and liver. One doctor recommended that I aim for 400mg instead of 800mg, but this is literally the ONLY semi-solution to my pain. Now to my story. I have been prescribed several different birth control pills, the shot, and the IUD in an attempt to stop my periods. All of these resulted in extreme side effects such as a long period of severe depression, anxiety, 50+ lb weight gain, insomnia, and suicidal thinking and ultimately self harm (all of which were misdiagnosed as being actual health conditions of mine, and I was given sleep medication, antidepressants, and therapy. Turns out they could all be linked back to birth control). The IUD itself caused one long period with non-stop intense cramping, which didn't end until I had it removed. I KNOW that these were side effects of brith control and side effects only. I have educated myself on mental health over these years for this exact reason, and I am the most calm and positive person I know, and that depression and anxiety are NOT something I would normally experience. On top of this, no doctor ever warned me of any birth control side effect before I took it. In fact, I was even cautioned against Googling the side effects because they would quote just scare me and only are experienced in extreme cases. Turns out I'm an extreme case, in every case. Because of this, I am unwilling to try any of these traditional birth controls or other hormonal medications ever again. When I tell gynecologists that my body does not react well to hormonal medications and I refuse to take them, they seem to be personally offended and can't offer me much advice after that, then I switch to another and the cycle continues. I even had to leave school, and all of my friends, because of the extreme side effects of birth control. The depression, anxiety, lack of sleep, and intense pain mixed together resulted in me having to enroll in an online academy and stay at home. My entire high school years have been online. While I enjoy my freedom in an online acadeny, my loneliness has negatively impacted my mental health. I am also seriously concerned about going off and starting my career and living life. Am I just supposed to stay home from work for a week every month? I am also considering enlisting in the military, which has been a life long dream of mine and is now compromised because I have been misdiagnosed with mental health conditions and birth control resulted in seriously disqualifying side effects such as self harm. I can only hope and pray that an exception will be made because of the complicatedness of this situation. I have been examined for endometriosis and tested for hormonal conditions that could be resulting in the pain, but the gynecologist that did this testing was only concerned that I wasn't getting pregnant and did not take my pain seriously, constantly mentioning birth control options. She seemed honestly bewildered when I stated that I would not consider birth control. I have had more than one gynecologist like this whos' only solutions to my pain were to sell me birth control or tell me to ""pop an Ibuprofen"". I am at a point in my life where if there was any long-lasting side effects of the birth controls I was given, they should now be gone (besides the massive weight gain, which I am still trying to shed to this day). There were no anomalies found in the scan of my uterus for endometriosis. There seems to be no explanation for my pain. I can say now that I was raised by a very tough woman and I have an extremely high pain tolerance. I recovered from surgeries and had a few accidents resulting in serious injury. I can handle pain, I know what real pain feels like and I know my periods are still the most painful thing I have ever felt and continue to get worse. I continuously see on online health forums that if my pain is interfering with my ability to function in normal life, I need to seek medical help. I have been now for 5 or 6 years. Either my pain is not being taken seriously because I am a teenage girl, or no doctor truly knows what is going on. I believe I should be able to go to work, go to school, and live my life without damaging my liver/kidneys, and being unable to move from unbearable pain. I eat extremely healthy organic food and I exercise every single day. I keep sugar low and get good fiber and other nutrients (I do not have a magnesium deficiency). I really do believe there is something underlying going on here. I am at a total loss. I have no idea what to do or who to ask for help. I am seeing another new doctor soon who hopefully isn't just trying to sell me birth control. I'm sorry if this sounds aggressive, but I am truly exhausted with the obsession of gynecologists for preventing pregnancy. I am not sexually active and never have been. This is about relieving my pain that is only getting worse, and as I lay here typing this I am literally nearing my breaking point of pain I can handle. I have yet to pass out from pain, but sometimes I wish I would so I didn't have to feel it anymore. I'm writing this because I have no answers, and after years now of researching my situation and scouring the internet for others with this exact problem, I have found very little promising information. One thing I repeatedly see online are doctors saying that if your periods are so intense that you cannot function correctly in your daily life, you have a right to seek medical attention. My situation is complicated and my story is long but I hope I can find some answers. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I had 7mg but I don't remember the name of the steroids injections(once I get the letter from the GP I will update it). I was given a general anesthesia before the injection and the procedure was done in a theatre. I guess the procedure only lasted about 20-30 mins. I had a slightly vertigo attack after the injection and vomiting as well. However I was discharged from the day care unit about 8pm with co-codamol and anti sickness medicine. I still have a stinging sensation to my ear slight headache and slight tinnitus ( they are quiet bearable). I am still on the betahistine 32mg 3 times daily which my consultant asked me to continue with. I still have a feeling like the vertigo might trigger back with some activity and movement with my head. I have a follow up appointment with my consultant in 2 months time and he said that gentamicin injections would be next if the steroids didn't work. So basically only one steroids injection and that's it, I am waiting for it to kick in, hopefully it works and my vertigo attacks don't come anymore. 0 likes, 6 replies "

Only yesterday I had another episode where I ended up on the floor of my bathroom at 3.30pm and never managed to get up from the floor until nearer 9pm. The symptoms I get are, dizziness, vomiting, tiredness, ringing in the ear, lack of sleep, frustration and sometimes the odd headache. I've been to the doctors, had an MRI, went to ENT, prescribed histamines and anti sickness tablets but still it persists. I feel like it's starting to take over my life, I'm worried about going away for work,days out, holidays etc. I'm wondering if any of you who are going through something similar can give me advice for ways to handle these symptoms, especially the dizziness.

As well as the sense of imbalance, nausea, tinnitus and occasional dizziness, loss of balance and orientation. I'm not sure if all of those are Menieres symptoms though -??? I'd be very interested to hear if other people have any or all of the above. 0 likes, 3 replies "

Of a level I might usually associate with a virus. I don't think I have a virus, as lack typical other symptoms and, after catching up on lost sleep, just have a sore stomach.

Worse still was going to my regular doctor to get tested for estrogen and Dr. and nurses coughed on me and I'm pretty sure I got Covid 19... not a joke.   Very busy regular doctors office.   Had a bad feeling going on there heard all the coughing and I thought don't go don't go but I was wanting to know my estrigen levels because of the bleeding issues.  ugh.   My body is torturing my and no one should have to go through all these symptoms year after year.   I don't want to do HRT and don't want to do the IUD with progesterone.   I tried the natural cream progesterone and HOLY GOD I was so messed up.   Didn't stop the bleeding but it gave me terrible side effects heart racing dizzy low blood pressure and low blood sugar couldn't hardly stand up.   Took 3 days to get out of my system so no thanks I'll just keep my own s****y symptoms bad enough   I would wake up and lose half a cup of blood.   Misery.  450 ml of blood in one period?   Try 1600 ml!!  And now with the stress of this lockdown just adds to the misery. 0 likes, 1 reply "

","Hi,  this is my first post on here, and im hoping to find some sort of answer to my truly debilitating symtoms which have been effecting me for the past 6 months. I'm 23, male and from the UK. When these symtoms came on I was a third year undergraduate student. Apologies if this is't written very well, I really struggle writing stuff nowerdays.  During January I realised I was not thinking as clearly as I once could, and was not as quick wittet as I was before. completing an assessment started to take considerably longer as I was finding it much harder to write my essays than in previous years. This was not related to the difficulty, rather that my ability to write was diminishing. I struggled through and managed to get it completed. However, the 'brain fog' was getting gradually worse as the weeks went by into feb/mar. I as also experiencing extremely painful muscle pain in my back which had no identifiable cause. During this time admittedly I was incredible anxious about my   and all other pieces of work as I felt my abilties were becoming more and more limited. It was no only my cogntive function that was suffering at the time. I was also suffering from constipation which led to (sorry this is gross) after every movement after wiping there would be a clear mucus like liquid on the paper. I tried to put my health worries to the back of my mind and crack on with my assessments which were due in the following month. This was until I was sat in the library working and then realised that there was dandruff like flakes all over my arms. This is when I began to worry something really wasn't right, and after a google search i thought I may be suffering from 'candida' so I decided to change my diet. I ate clean and drank plenty of lemon water for a few days. Two days following this 'new diet' I began to feel incredibly unwell, with a pulsating headache which left me in bed all day. The following day when in between being alseep and still awake I had racing thoughts which could not be shifted, I have no idea how long this lasted all I know is that it was a scary experience. The following day I felt really rough, and at noon I suddenly became 'zoned out' and just not with it. I was struggling as it was before this but this changed everything.  It was at this moment I was thrown into a zombie like state where I feel nothing, but yet cannot function. I was only able to get 3 hours of sleep a night and just felt completely gone. My ears felt full, I became cold even when the heating was on  and I became incredibly worried about completing my course.  At one point I decided that attempting to complete the 20,000 words needed to pass was futile, so I returned home and tried to accept that I had failed uni. Strangely, the zombie like state lifted that evening, only to return again upon waking up from a sleep. This happened a few times where I would snap out of it for a few hours, go to sleep only to wake up back in the 'funk'. Of course I couldnt fail my course and waste all that money so I continued to plough on despite my abilities being severely limited. with some help of friends, I managed to get 3/5 of the assessments done before I chucked in the towel and realised that completing the year without getting any sort of extension was impossible.  By this point I was trying to find any cause for this zoned out brain fogg state and thought it may relate to the ear fullnes. I convinced myself it must be some kind of problem with my ears initially, and began constantly pop my ears by holding my nose. This didnt solve anything, and has given me tinitus. god knows why I did that but I did.  By this point I had been to the drs and tried as best I could explain what had happened. He thought it was a anxiety related and prescibed some proprodomol, which had no effect. I also had blood tests done including  a thyroid blood test, a full blood count, and vitamins checked. All frustratingly normal. I have been in this state for just over 3 months now. I've had to quit my part time work, and drop out from the work I was planning to undertake in the summer. I've lost my girlfriend because of it as despite her being pateint theres only so much you can support and wait around for your bf to be anything near normal. I also dont want to do anything with friends as i wouldnt enjoy it and id just feel embarassed and zoned out. I was a very very sociable guy before all of this.  I have no clue what this could be, I dont feel I can work as my mind is blank and I am unable to process and remember information. Ive spent the last few months literally sat wondering wtf has happened and how to get out of this state, time completely wasted. I have managed to submit the remaining pieces of work for the course so I should pass my degree but the whole thing is very embarassing.  has anyone got any idea what this is? if this is just a stress response do people eventually come around? what advice would you give? could it be something physical? Its in the title but my hair is also much thinner than it used to be and doesnt grow anywhere near as quick??  I'm lost, this is ruining my life. Ive tried getting back into the things I used to enjoy like football but when I play I just feel zoned out and drunk. I get zero enjoyment from doing anything or talking to anybody in this state. Im so confused. If anyone could give some advice it would be greatly appreciately, as my life has quite simply stopped being worth living. I will just add that I was happy with everything I had in my life prior to this coming on so I dont believe it to be depression.   Sorry for the poor structure of this post.  2 likes, 14 replies "

","Hi,  this is my first post on here, and im hoping to find some sort of answer to my truly debilitating symtoms which have been effecting me for the past 6 months. I'm 23, male and from the UK. When these symtoms came on I was a third year undergraduate student. Apologies if this is't written very well, I really struggle writing stuff nowerdays.  During January I realised I was not thinking as clearly as I once could, and was not as quick wittet as I was before. completing an assessment started to take considerably longer as I was finding it much harder to write my essays than in previous years. This was not related to the difficulty, rather that my ability to write was diminishing. I struggled through and managed to get it completed. However, the 'brain fog' was getting gradually worse as the weeks went by into feb/mar. I as also experiencing extremely painful muscle pain in my back which had no identifiable cause. During this time admittedly I was incredible anxious about my   and all other pieces of work as I felt my abilties were becoming more and more limited. It was no only my cogntive function that was suffering at the time. I was also suffering from constipation which led to (sorry this is gross) after every movement after wiping there would be a clear mucus like liquid on the paper. I tried to put my health worries to the back of my mind and crack on with my assessments which were due in the following month. This was until I was sat in the library working and then realised that there was dandruff like flakes all over my arms. This is when I began to worry something really wasn't right, and after a google search i thought I may be suffering from 'candida' so I decided to change my diet. I ate clean and drank plenty of lemon water for a few days. Two days following this 'new diet' I began to feel incredibly unwell, with a pulsating headache which left me in bed all day. The following day when in between being alseep and still awake I had racing thoughts which could not be shifted, I have no idea how long this lasted all I know is that it was a scary experience. The following day I felt really rough, and at noon I suddenly became 'zoned out' and just not with it. I was struggling as it was before this but this changed everything.  It was at this moment I was thrown into a zombie like state where I feel nothing, but yet cannot function. I was only able to get 3 hours of sleep a night and just felt completely gone. My ears felt full, I became cold even when the heating was on  and I became incredibly worried about completing my course.  At one point I decided that attempting to complete the 20,000 words needed to pass was futile, so I returned home and tried to accept that I had failed uni. Strangely, the zombie like state lifted that evening, only to return again upon waking up from a sleep. This happened a few times where I would snap out of it for a few hours, go to sleep only to wake up back in the 'funk'. Of course I couldnt fail my course and waste all that money so I continued to plough on despite my abilities being severely limited. with some help of friends, I managed to get 3/5 of the assessments done before I chucked in the towel and realised that completing the year without getting any sort of extension was impossible.  By this point I was trying to find any cause for this zoned out brain fogg state and thought it may relate to the ear fullnes.

So, i started on 10mg alternate days and built up slowly. i am now at the point of going from 15mg/20mg alternate days to 20mg each day (i have taken 20mgs each day for 4 days now). i have had a few decent-ish days. yesterday and today i feel uneasy again. could this be due to the increase from 15mg to 20mg? would this small increase cause this even though ive been taking the drug for a while? i have feelings of heart skipping beats still (which i had before i started the citalopram) which have been checked out.  i go to the gym and walk kids to school each day. im just starting to get fed up of these up and down feelings. i start to feel that im getting there and then i feel horrible again. i just want me back!! Sorry if this sounds a rant but im feeling disheartened by it all. 0 likes, 7 replies "

I have had many concerns with my own ideas of whether or not I have some type of disorder or mental health problem. Going on forums like this isn't the best idea and I understand that, but since my resources/budget cannot make room for therapy, I want to collect a list of ideas before I finally have the chance to go to an appointment. Please read with caution, this gets a little extreme fast. There's been a lot of happenings in my life. I remember having troubles with my anger starting at a younger age, like when I threw my bike and helmet down when my friends picked on my training wheels. The anger was dormant for a while until I experienced an increased amount of problems with my male guardian who had a drinking problem. It never directly affected me. I began fearing/hating him way before that (when I was around the age of 2-4 ish), so to watch him harm my female guardian only fueled that. Once he threatened to ""hurt"" her, I stepped in to stop it. After that, every argument would leave me huddled in a corner, rocking back and forth, panicking, hyperventilating, crying, etc. It was an ugly sight. Both my fear of their fights and my fear of being sick (I think the term is hypocondriac) have caused me to be called crazy by my female guardian. Anyway, there was one time where she and I went to bed and his continued to drunkenly berate and name-call her for hours. Eventually, I got upset enough to punch a wall. After that, every time I got angry, I would hit a wall or door to relieve my anger. The numbing then stinging pain felt good. Starting in elementary school, I found comfort in playing pretend, whether alone or with friends. I mostly did it alone, it felt more comfortable. However, I could never get out of it. It was a habit I couldn't break. Up to my late teens, I still did it to some extent. If I didn't, I would be irritable. If I had the urge to, I felt like I needed to drop everything and do it. For a while, I could just forget my surroundings existed and I could picture the world I imagine as if it were completely real. Once I was older, it was a little harder, but I could encourage it by using music. I have self-esteem issues where I'll think negatively about myself. It ranges from being stupid, annoying, worthless, fat, mean, and more. I think it stems from my female guardian berating me for messing up chores or messing up activities I just learned to do. It did get bad enough that I took it out on myself. I couldn't get myself to use a knive, so I used my fingernails to claw across my arms. Once I had an income, it changed to using an X-acto knife to make little marks down my arm that would heal after a few days. I enjoyed doing it and I thought of it as little ""works of art"", something beautiful to my eye. Other forms of this included both starving myself for days or purposefully filling myself with food until I'm sick. I'll have moments where my emotions feel numb/nonexistent and I'll feel too distant to do anything, even what I used to enjoy. Family has said I have anxiety, because I tend to panic and overthink very easily. It is easy to overload my senses, especially if I'm not in a good mood. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be normal, but every once in a while, I'll get voices. Just someone who shows up and tells me to do odd things and I'll get this strong urge to do it that I can barely fight. Examples would be how I can't hold sharp knives for long, because it will tell me to bring it to my neck, or remove my clothes in public. This may be related a may not be, but I have memories of someone yelling suddenly from behind a doorframe when I was the only one home or someone whispering my name as I'm trying to sleep. I have a bad memory. I usually can't remember things like what was for dinner the night before. I think this is normal, though, so I don't pay much attention to it. This is a lot for you all to take in, but I just wanted help brainstorming ideas of things I could have. My thought process is that having a list may make it easier for me to talk to someone and could help quicken a diagnosis. Thank you so much for reading all of this. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Please help ,"Hi, I’m not sure if this is the right place to talk about this but I’m getting desperate for any advice or just someone who understands what I’m talking about because no one seems to. Basically, I’m very very obsessed with how I look. I know that sounds really vain, but it’s not like that, I don’t wanna be perfect or look perfect, I just wanna feel comfortable with myself? If that makes any sense? I have this big insecurity particularly with my jaw and chin, as I believe its severely weak, but others say they don’t see it that way. Recently I got work done on it, I had chin and jawline filler and it’s something I’ve wanted since I was 16 years old (I’m 18 now) so you can imagine how relieved I felt knowing this feeling  was gonna be fixed. its been a few days now and i feel like its made me obsess over it more, I see absolutely LITTLE difference sometimes then other times I’ll see a nice shape but I keep seeing it as “it’s disappeared and gone back to its old shape” (I’ve only had it since Friday.) but it constantly changes, while others say they see a great change although I “didn’t need it”. Now I’m obsessing with how I’m gonna keep up with the filler, and it’s driving me crazy. A similar thing happens with my body, for example I have a jacket that Used to fit me nicely but it’s too big on me now which made me feel great but when I look in the mirror I see completely overweight. I walk around with a fake clip in fringe every single day because I’m concerned with how big my forehead is, I draw a fake hairline on with eyeshadow whenever I don’t wear the fringe (which is really rare) I know others may do this as it’s a common insecurity for some, but I will not leave the house unless I 1) have either a fake fringe to cover my head or colour in my hairline 2) heavily contour my jawline (and then I’m never satisfied and constantly trying to hide it while I’m out). I never realised how bad it was until I got my jaw done, I’m still not satisfied. I didn’t get too much filler as I went with what was recommended to me, and honestly I’m not the richest person in the world, I literally saved up everything I have in order to pay for this when others usually have it as a “treat”, I had it done because I just wanted to feel comfortable with myself. I’ve tried accepting myself for years, and it’s just not working. I go to college 4 days a week and there’s days where I have to leave early because I can’t handle sitting there knowing people can see me and how I look, I cant seem to relax without looking at myself and making sure it’s not gone or my forehead isn’t “exposed” . There’s a lot more I could explain but I don’t wanna make this too long lol I’m so sorry for the lengthy post, but does anyone have any experience with this type of stuff? should i talk to my gp? I’m terrified of my own mind cause I feel like it’s playing mind tricks on me, but im also scared to talk to someone just incase they also think im being vain and stupid. Its truly making me miserable. 0 likes, 4 replies "

Help wanted ,"Hello all, After a good little while being health anxiety free I'm in a bad health anxiety spiral at the moment. I'm hoping by putting this down I'll get others who are in the same boat and people can say nothing is seriously wrong with me! I‘m a 31 year old male, slightly overweight but generally ok (I hop On 29th Feb 2029 I was sick (throwing up) on a Saturday evening - through the nose and mouth. This was after a day drinking and eating fatty food. The next day I was fine until late afternoon when I started to get a tension/pressure   across my temples. I didn't worry too much and thought it would go by the next day. I've had this type of headache before, brain tumour worries before (about 6 years ago) and I got through it. Next day I woke up and it hadn't gone. It was a dull band type feeling, mainly on my temples and front of face around nose and eye sockets. This hasn't gone at all over these past 4 weeks - 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A nose feels a little stuffy but I've had a sinus infection before and it doesn't feel 100% like that. Last few days I've started to worry about my vision - blury/unfocused eyes when looking at something for a period of time, especially at a TV or PC, and it clears when a blink. I also have a slight sensitivity to bright light like the sun and eyes feel sore. I have also started to get a strange feeling in the right side of my face and body - not numb but like a weird tingle type feeling, mainly between my ear and jaw (cheek area). My ears have started to have the odd sharp pain. Headaches have been consistent with the odd pain or blocked feeling. I can exercise as normal, I don't have any balance etc issues or speech. The headache does seem to be worse in the morning (more pressure) when I wake up buy ok when laying down. I do feel more pressure, especially above the nose and around it when bending over. I've also had some muscle twitching which I've had before with MND/ALS fears. I've been (obviously) googling a lot, trying to get any answer that I'm ok. Due to the lockdown I'm unable to see a GP or get my vision tested (though I did have it tested about a month ago and nothing major came up - they took photo of eye and did pressure test a well). Is this anything to be seriously concerned about? My main worry is Brain tumour which makes me very anxious so anything that helps put my mind to rest on that front (why it isn’t) would be great. I keep trying to think I wouldn’t get all of these symptoms so quickly and at the same time. Anyone in the same boat or has had this type of thing before that can give me some advice/support that will help? Thanks as always forum! You've really helped me in the past. 0 likes, 2 replies "

The headache does seem to be worse in the morning (more pressure) when I wake up buy ok when laying down. I do feel more pressure, especially above the nose and around it when bending over. I've also had some muscle twitching which I've had before with MND/ALS fears. I've been (obviously) googling a lot, trying to get any answer that I'm ok. Due to the lockdown I'm unable to see a GP or get my vision tested (though I did have it tested about a month ago and nothing major came up - they took photo of eye and did pressure test a well). Is this anything to be seriously concerned about? My main worry is Brain tumour which makes me very anxious so anything that helps put my mind to rest on that front (why it isn’t) would be great. I keep trying to think I wouldn’t get all of these symptoms so quickly and at the same time. Anyone in the same boat or has had this type of thing before that can give me some advice/support that will help? Thanks as always forum! You've really helped me in the past. 0 likes, 2 replies "

Help wanted ,"Hello all, After a good little while being health anxiety free I'm in a bad health anxiety spiral at the moment. I'm hoping by putting this down I'll get others who are in the same boat and people can say nothing is seriously wrong with me! I‘m a 31 year old male, slightly overweight but generally ok (I hop On 29th Feb 2029 I was sick (throwing up) on a Saturday evening - through the nose and mouth. This was after a day drinking and eating fatty food. The next day I was fine until late afternoon when I started to get a tension/pressure   across my temples. I didn't worry too much and thought it would go by the next day. I've had this type of headache before, brain tumour worries before (about 6 years ago) and I got through it. Next day I woke up and it hadn't gone. It was a dull band type feeling, mainly on my temples and front of face around nose and eye sockets. This hasn't gone at all over these past 4 weeks - 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A nose feels a little stuffy but I've had a sinus infection before and it doesn't feel 100% like that. Last few days I've started to worry about my vision - blury/unfocused eyes when looking at something for a period of time, especially at a TV or PC, and it clears when a blink. I also have a slight sensitivity to bright light like the sun and eyes feel sore. I have also started to get a strange feeling in the right side of my face and body - not numb but like a weird tingle type feeling, mainly between my ear and jaw (cheek area). My ears have started to have the odd sharp pain. Headaches have been consistent with the odd pain or blocked feeling. I can exercise as normal, I don't have any balance etc issues or speech.

While using my computer, I suddenly felt like I was floating and everything was dream-like. I saw flashes of moments that I (at the time of writing this) believed happened sometime in Nov-Jan 2020, but they felt almost real in the moment. As I kinda of 'woke up' from it, the floating, dreamy feeling slowly dissipated. My first thoughts were ""What happened? What day is it?"" Thinking a little more, I determined these things: it is February 6th 2020, the time was most likely around late 5pm (when I get home and online), I was getting a YouTube video pulled up, I need to make sure if people tried to message me. I opened my phone to find that it was actually around 2pm on March 30th, 2020. This completely threw me off. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't remember anything that actually happened during February and March. When opening my phone fully, I noticed an old, upsetting text message conversation was open that I don't remember going to. Later, I noticed I had a planner, so I opened it to the notes section at the end of each month (I opened to March), then immediately messaged my friends and family asking if there was anything important in the last two months I needed to remember. I wrote all answers down in that section. Usually, I am pretty forgetful, but not this bad. During this whole time, I'm panicking very, very hard. In between messages, I'd have to get up and pace around the bedroom to control my breathing. I felt incredibly nauseous. At some point, I'd lose balance or forget how I normally write. I went to the doctor where they performed different upfront exams on me. Stuff like mental evaluations and the ones where you follow their finger with your eyes and such. I remember having a hard time speaking and my train of thought kept getting lost. At some point, hearing myself talk felt foreign, as if I couldn't recognize it was my own voice, like it was a stranger's. Though, over time, I was slowly getting back certain memories from the past two months. Not everything, but a few things. They didn't think it could be anything physically hurting me or my nerves, which led to the only two remaining options to be either something mentally wrong or something chemically wrong. They drew blood, and I have not heard from them yet. I'm very curious as to what this could have been. This is the first happening of it. I have already been looking into therapists since I believe I might have  /  caused by childhood issues, so I will bring this up with whoever I can find. I'm posting this up so I might be able to have some ideas or sense of closure while I continue to search for true help. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I consider it a massive cover-up because they all  know that route Canals fail, and mercury amalgam causes disaster in the jawbones. If you have the misfortune of mercury amalgam filled roots then you are on a course for jawbone infection.   has anyone noticed how a dentist will fob you off and not investigate.  If this well-known infection got out Amongst the general public there would be an epidemic of  cases needing treatment: earache sore throat swollen glands, eye orbit pain, temporal headaches.  Chronic fatigue Night sweats fever malaise ...  Dentistry is actually alchemy. have you noticed how dentists  are reluctant to: Extract, fill, or root fill a tooth... I firmly believe that dentistry IS medicine and they can't decapitate you and treat your jaw as a separate form/ entity  of medicine.   If you are a victim of dentistry and unlucky enough to have jawbone  infection you will know that it affects your whole body constitutionally .    The dentist has told me to see my doctor and my doctor has told me to see my dentist !!!  The dentist says oh I'm an NHS dentist I don't clean out the jaw.  After an extraction:  but yes I've taken your tooth out and you have dry socket which means an infection.  I have referred you. Then reader it is a wing and a prayer because nobody wants to know about jawbone infection in the UK NH system ... I wonder why.. you have been warned.  Jawbone infection is the next thalidomide.. a result of root filling  incompetence and ignorance .

I have had osteomyelitis in my spinal cord and it's been almost two years since. I still have very bad pain in my back .  I just had an MRI done , the third and my doctor says it very much improved . I spent almost a year where I could hardly walk and had a pic line in for almost four months.  Just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and does anyone know the long term prognosis ? It feels like my spine is being pulled apart . I'm 59 years old and worked my whole life. I filed for disability because I'm losing everything I worked my whole life to build. Am I alone? Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thx 1 like, 4 replies "

I can feel two hard tinytiny balls in the side of my tongue and theyre not painful unlesss i squeeze them hard. I saw a GP and he said it could be thrush, gave me some tablets to suck on and said come back in 3 weeks.. I'm worried this is something far more sinister and I dont want to wait 3 weeks if people here can give me a reason to go back and demand I get a referral to the ENT.

I wouldn’t say it hurts or aches because that would imply that I felt it if I were sitting still, which I do not. But touching the area is very sensitive.  There may be slight swelling but I cannot confirm. There is no blood in urine or semen, and no pain when urinating or ejaculating.

If you don't like long reads, you can jump to the questions in the end. I used to suffer from severe pain due to a large Varicocele in my left side. I noticed it usually became worse when sitting a lot. As I work at the computer, I started standing and laying down instead, which eased the variocele and pain somewhat, but never really healed it. And who wants to avoid sitting for the rest of your life anyway? I did ton of research on the topic and tried everything I could find. I found lots of interesting posts online about how imbalance in the pelvic floor and stomach spasm could lead to varicocele. After trying out yoga and certain stretches for months without results, I ended up throwing in the towel and went with varicocelectomy surgery. A few months after surgery, I felt better and I could sit again without any pain and with little to no discomfort. I started going back to the gym and daily routines, although I avoided sitting as much as possible. The only time I could feel the varicocele come back a little and cause pain was when I had sex (fast and hard thrusting) or when squeezing/holding the penis during masturbation (how is this even possible?). One day at the gym, I did crunches/situps to the sides and the next day, my varicocele was almost as bad as prior to operation. Right now my pain is really bad in the side of the stomach near the hip and same altitude as the belly button. It hurts sitting again, but it's worse in the stomach than in the scrotum. I did have an ultrasound to rule out kidney cancer etc, and the doctors now just seem to shrug off my problem. I haven't heard about this anywhere, so perhaps someone can shed some light in here. I am otherwise young and perfectly healthy and I eat only lean meat, lots of vegetables and some fruits. Questions I would love to have answered by a professional/experienced patient: 1. Can a varicocele happen due to constant spasm/contractions in pelvic/abdomen? 2. How can squeezing the penis shaft result in a painful varicocele? The veins are not directly connected are they? 3. Any alternative treatment options other than embolization? In case it's spasm-related, no surgery would really help right? 0 likes, 3 replies "

I went to my family medicine and diagnosed as epididymitis (I wasn't sexually active). So my doctor prescribed a doxycycline (antibiotic) and 600 mg of ibuprofen.  After taking this medicine somehow the pain went away.  Every time, pain comes back randomly, I got a same prescription, but the pain started to spread into my left leg, inner thigh, and center of my left bottom foot.

Additional extreme sharp pain occurred within the right testicle during the moment of ejaculation/climax.  I visited my Primary Care Physician for blood work and thorough physical.  Initial diagnosis was Prostatitus (prostate infection).  Long term antibiotics were provided as prostate infections are resistant to antibiotics.  There was a brief improvement on the antibiotics however the pain quickly resurfaced.  Blood work showed no signs of a medical issue.  Full Pelvic and Abdominal CT scan was performed with no abnormal results. PCP referred me to a Urologist.  Urologist evaluated CT and added Ultrasound of testicles, again with no abnormal results.  Urologist prescribed FLOMAX which provided some reduction, although not elimination, of the pain however contained undesirable side effects.  Subsequently the Urologist prescribed ALFUZOSIN ER 10MG which like FLOMAX provided some reduction in the pain however did not eliminate the pain while still incurring severe pain during ejaculation with less negative side effects.  After nearly 9 months of ongoing treatment by the Urologist, the Urologist prepared me for the likelihood this could be a non-bacterial Prostatitus which may not be able to be treated effectively.   I had delayed a umbilical hernia repair until the testicular/Pelvic/Abdominal pain was resolved.  Facing the reality the Urologist had exhausted the investigation with no significant improvement and being prepared the pain could be a pain I would have to accept as the new normal, I conveyed to the urologist that I would proceed to meet with a surgeon to have the Umbilical Hernia repaired.  In doing so, it triggered a long shot potential cause from the Urologist that I may possibly have an inguinal hernia which may not have shown up in the CT scan.  The Urologist recommended I ask the surgeon to investigate for an Inguinal Hernia while performing the Umbilical Hernia Repair. Upon meeting with the Surgeon, the Surgeon immediately suspected the pain was that of a Inguinal Hernia.  The Surgeon performed a physical exam and found no evidence of an Inguinal Hernia however indicated they are easily missed and ordered a MRI of the Pelvis in an attempt to discover if there was in fact an Inguinal Hernia.  The MRI of the Pelvis did not indicate the presence of Inguinal Hernia.  During the prep of the Umbilical Hernia surgery, the surgeon and I discussed the possibility that there was a slim chance the MRI missed an Inguinal Hernia.  The Surgeon elected to investigate while performing the Umbilical Hernia repair and in fact found not one but two Inguinal Hernia's (one one the right and one on the left side of the pelvis where the testicular vesicles penetrate the abdominal wall).  The result was a second hernia repair surgery to repair the two Inguinal Hernia's (missed by both a CT and MRI scan).  Nearly immediately there was a significant (80+%) reduction in testicular/pelvis/abdominal pain.  The surgeon indicated the pain may fully go away however prepared me for the reality that the pain may not be fully eliminated.  Within two months post surgery the pain is 99% gone (rarely will I encounter a mild flanking soreness in the abdominal area.  Testicular pain 100% eliminated) I am posting this to aid others whom may be experiencing the same conditions as I was diligently searching for the cause of my pain and a treatment to resolve.  I consider myself fortunate as had I not had the Umbilical Hernia where the surgeon could poke around to investigate if other hernia(s) existed despite negative findings on both the CT and MRI scans, I may not have ever been properly diagnosed nor reached successful treatment.  If you are experiencing these symptoms I truly understand the pain and the effect on ones relationship with spouse/significant other.  It took me almost a year to find the cause and have the Inguinal Hernias corrected via hernia mesh surgeries and my hope is this posting will help others whom may be dealing with a similar pain caused by an Inguinal Hernia. 0 likes, 3 replies "

It went well but I am still having a lot of testes discomfort (they hurt to the touch)and my bag of worms on the left testicle has not improved. I was wondering what the recovery has been like for other guys who have had this procedure. Am I expecting good things too quickly? How can you tell if it has in fact worked? Thank you.
