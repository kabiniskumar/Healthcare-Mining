I am slowly titrating off of Trazodone (down to 200mg) because I was tired of hearing myself complain that the regimen wasn't helping much(I got a little more sleep 5-6 hrs, but no slight boost w/  and  .) The meds were prescribed for a bad bout with anxiety/insomnia which tripped into depression.  I feel pretty bad, hard to concentrate, less sleep, spacey, depressed. I don't have much energy to improve my life. I  want to hide, but uncomfortable not knowing what to do with myself which makes everything worse. I want to feel good again!

I also get a few itchy red spots on my legs in different places sometimes but these don't look like mollescum - I'm wondering if   as I know this can look similar but I am a bit concerned. I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced symptoms of this for 10 years or more?

It started as a few tiny bumps on her stomach, and I didn't think much of them. Everything I read said to just leave them alone and let them go away on their own, so I tried to be patient. After month 3, with no improvement, and now about 15-20 bumps, I decided to dig deeper and try to find a way to get rid of these before they spread even more. I found Conzerol online, and read tons of glowing reviews, so we decided to try it.  We started it over 2 weeks ago, and my daughter now has huge scabs on her stomach (see photos). About a week after starting the Conzerol, her MC spread into what looked like huge clusters of bumps, and now (17 days in) they are really big scabs that look just awful! I included the following photos: Day 3 on Conzerol (bumps turning red) Day 10 - spreading into clusters of bumps Day 17 - today- huge scabs Has anyone had this experience with Conzerol? From what I've read, scabs are a good thing, and it means they are healing... but after searching through tons of photos online, I can't find any with scabs quite this big. I guess I just need some peace of mind that this is normal, and not causing any  harm to my daughter. Also, should I be putting anything else on these scabs? Like tea tree oil? Aquaphor? Anything? I've been giving her baths every other day, but don't want to scrub these too hard because I don't want them to bleed and spread more. Please send any tips my way. This has been such a nightmare.

So I decided to visit a sexual health clinic, the nurse confirmed that it was just folliculitis or blocked glands. I was not so sure about the diagnosis, so I booked an appointment with my GP and I was told the same thing, almost instantly. I even asked if they might be molluscum, but they denied it to be the case. Still wasn‚Äôt convinced as they didn‚Äôt look normal, and they didn‚Äôt offer any further explanation. I booked with a different doctor an appointment, the doctor told me they suspect it to be molluscum, and didn‚Äôt offer any treatment option. The doctor even told me to go on with my sex life as per-usual, which confused me a lot as I know MC is contagious. So I am not sure what to do anymore, my next step is to see a dermatologist, but I‚Äôll be put on a waiting list of six months (UK healthcare).

The thing is that without vitamin d3 at correct levels, you are not absorbing calcium and the body will shut down without those two working together!

I say did because I haven't had an episode with dystonia since before I was pregnant with my daughter three and a half years ago. It started when I was 23 and I was teaching pre-school. We would have story time and I would sit in the floor to read to the kids and when I would get up my right arm would draw up toward my face, my hand would draw up so much at times that I felt like it was going to break my hand, and my mouth would open and make my jaw draw to one side. It was weird and would happen any time I would get up and down out of the floor or when I would get out of my car. I didn't worry too much because at that age I pretty much still thought I was invincible and just saw it as more of a nuisance than anything. One day I was talking to two of my brothers and they described the things happening to them and we all were shocked because we had the exact same thing going on. My oldest brother went to the doctor and was diagnosed with mild dystonia. Mine never got any worse through the years since it first started 14 years ago, and actually went away 3 1/2 years ago but both of my brothers continue to have it. My question is, has anyone had their dystonia go into remission and if so, do you still have any symptom from time to time?

Its driving me crazy, literally. When you have time, I would greatly appreciate it if you could review the presented information and present me with some suggestions and answers.

Its driving me crazy, literally. When you have time, I would greatly appreciate it if you could review the presented information and present me with some suggestions and answers.

Its driving me crazy, literally. When you have time, I would greatly appreciate it if you could review the presented information and present me with some suggestions and answers.

Its driving me crazy, literally. When you have time, I would greatly appreciate it if you could review the presented information and present me with some suggestions and answers.

Its driving me crazy, literally. When you have time, I would greatly appreciate it if you could review the presented information and present me with some suggestions and answers.

Its driving me crazy, literally. When you have time, I would greatly appreciate it if you could review the presented information and present me with some suggestions and answers.

Its driving me crazy, literally. When you have time, I would greatly appreciate it if you could review the presented information and present me with some suggestions and answers.

When it kept twitching until late last August, I went to a neurologist and he did an EMG/nerve conduction that came out normal. He also had me get a brain, t-spine, and c-spine MRI (each of them w/o contrast), all of which came out normal (I did a closed, 1.5T machine for all three of the MRIs). We're waiting the results of my blood test, but a few weeks ago, before I had the MRIs, a couple of the toes on my left foot started to tingle/buzz/get a creepy crawly sensation a few times a day. It has typically been after I've been walking for a bit, then it stops.  Now I'm very, very concerned about this tingly/buzzing sensation across my left foot and am afraid it could be MS. I wish I had gotten my MRIs on a 3T as now I'm afraid there are lesions that just didn't show up on the 1.5T. I have no other symptoms, otherwise, such as numbness, dizziness, or visual symptoms. I'm just really at a loss as to what else it could be. Thanks so much in advance for any guidance you could give. I'm just so worried. 0 likes, 0 replies "

After just graduating high school, symptoms which had mostly disappeared, came back with a vengeance. I have been very discouraged because my symptoms are inhibiting my ability to preform even normal everyday tasks, and while I am supposed to be excited about starting my life, I'm frustrated as my doctors visits continue to be unsuccessful. For about six years now I've been having multiple bizarre symptoms. It started all the way back in 6th grade with back pain. My back was very achy and sometimes I'd sit down and a sharp pain would shoot through my spine. The pain persisted and months later I began experiencing extreme fatigue. If I was lucky enough to sleep the night before (I also began having sleeping problems) I still woke up feeling exhausted, and by afternoon it was so bad I could barely do anything and would usually leave school early, go home, and lay down the rest of the day. Somewhere around this point I began experiencing multiple new symptoms. I had stomach pain, nausea, headaches, bad earaches, frequent dizziness, chest pain (usually a burning sensation) chronic pain (my whole body was always achy) and my lower back began to hurt so bad I had trouble walking more than a few minutes at a time. I also had constipation and trouble peeing every once in a while which was quite painful (It would just drip). I also infrequently had problems with muscle spasms. I had issues with all of this consistently for a few years and had many visits to the doctors office.  By the end of these visits my doctor decided my diagnosis was anxiety!! Yes, I had anxiety but I knew there was no way thats what was causing my symptoms and was in fact convinced the opposite, that my symptoms were causing my anxiety.

I still struggled with back pain, ear and headaches, occasional fatigue, and dizzy spells but I was able to function and get through the day okay. I began to ignore my symptoms and even entered into denial, convincing myself everyone was right and my poor health was due to mental illness and bad lifestyle choices. So I started eating right and exercising frequently, and honestly felt pretty damn good for a couple years, that is until second semester of senior year (February) when I ended up in the ER. I woke up feeling very strange, exhausted, and my mind was super foggy. When I tried to stand up it was very difficult and I was extremely dizzy. I began experiencing bad chest pain similar to my prior experience, a burning sensation, the difference is it was much worse. I also noticed my heat beat was extremely irregular and was jumping for 60bpm to 115bpm within seconds. The ER, of course, was a dead end. Images came back with nothing. Again I ignored it and moved on. My symptoms persisted but have usually not been as bad as the first time. I began having problems with my ears again, also worse than before. They hurt constantly everyday, never stop ringing, and keep plugging (like when you enter a high altitude and have to swallow or chew gum) but they get stuck like that and make it very difficult to hear everything including myself speak. This has been occurring everyday to present. In July my fatigue returned, not too bad though until recently and is now back to how it was, making it difficult to function. By now I have been experiencing all my old symptoms, many much worse than before, but heres where it gets even worse. Over the last few weeks I've had new symptoms. It started with a burning sensation in my feet, legs, arms, and hands. At first I only noticed it at night, then it began to happen 24/7. I tried to ignore it for awhile and eventually it went away. However, shortly after, I began having issues with spasticity. Muscle spasms all over my body (face, stomach, back,etc) stiffness, and now joint pain. The burning in my arms and legs now comes back every once in awhile and I've been having tingling in my hands, feet and lips. I am now again having trouble using the bathroom and my stomach hurts bad all the time (and also constantly makes weird noises) and I've been getting hit with random waves of nausea. My mind is foggy all the time and I have been extremely irritable as well. I could go on and on but I've already wrote a whole essay lol so back to the point. Do you think it could be MS? Should I continue going to the doctor? Do you have any advice on what I should do or say?

I have noticed that for some reason my bladder is worse in the morning. About nine years ago I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue and IBS. I have been back and forth to gp, had blood tests, for liver, kidneys, and urine dips but all fine. I have had sharp pains right side under ribs, but again tests were negative for gallbladder problems. I also have blurred vision, brain fog, tingling in hands, legs and feet, and occasionally I trip.

This went away for a few hours but by the night i was tingling all over including my face. These tingling feelings happened on and off for a few days and then my left leg and arm had a numb feeling to it and some slight weakness. this happened on and off for a few days. i went to the doctor about a week later, she did some strength tests and said she couldn't detect any weakness (that day my left leg was very numb and had a dull ache and my left arm felt weak). She ordered some blood tests to check for B12 deficiency and thyroid problems. i felt somewhat reassured as it could be something simple as by this point i was shaking from the anxiety of these symptoms. The GP surgery rang me to say i need to see the doctor to go over my results, so i was feeling better for a few days thinking that theyd found B12 or  a thyroid problem and i booked an appointment. However i checked my online notes and found my blood results and i was devastated to find my TSH and B12 serum levels normal. The reason my doctor wanted to see me was slightly raised liver function levels and slightly raised eosinophil levels. which don't explain my symptoms and i'm terrified now that its MS to the the point where i've been in tears and very anxious. im a 27 year old male.

My roommates and I got flu-like symptoms. Fever, cough, mucus etc. Eventually we got over it. Or so I thought. Fast forward to the tail end of January (27-28th). Started developing slight vertigo. It would come and go throughout the day (I mostly noticed it in closed corridors or whenever I showered). The vertigo eventually went away however after a few days. Weird. Fast forward a week later, maybe the 8th of February. I started developing ear fullness, and crackling. It was dull but constant . Eventually I got slight facial tension on my cheeks as well. No paralysis but almost like a sunburn or my face being pulled back. I spoke to my mother in law who's a nurse. She checked my ears and noticed they were swollen but no fluid. She suggested Motrin and Sudafed. Maybe it was sinus issue? I used it for one week straight. Didnt work. Eventually the vertigo came back. And now it came back even stronger. This was like the 14th of February. I started freaking out. I would get lightheaded out of nowhere and feel like passing out. My head felt so swollen. Almost as if someone wrapped a belt around my head. So I go to urgent care thinking Im dying. They checked my blood sugar. It was fine. Hemoglobin. Okay. Blood pressure? A little high due to panic attack. The urgent care doctor runs a basic neuro test on me...my finger following her finger, eyes following her finger etc. She checked my eyes and ears and her conclusion was... Migraine. Migraine...I've had migraines before. This did not feel like it. She prescribed me Sumatriptan for headaches and Zofran for nausea. It did not help so a few days later I went to the physician (17th of February). Physician ran the same test as urgent care doctor however he concluded I had middle/inner ear infection due to a virus that stuck around since January. He prescribed me ear drops, Meclizine for vertigo and Ibropufen. Now its been a few weeks since my appointment. My eyes arent spinning anymore however I still have ear fullness and crackling. That being said, the odd thing is even though some symptoms are diminishing, I feel like I'm developing new symptoms. It almost feels like I am drowsy, drunk. I get tired very easily. Like I need to put my head down during the day. Also my heart rate would spike randomly. I could be resting at 60bpm then all of a sudden it can go to 90bpm as soon I start thinking about it. The best way to describe the feeling is like I have low blood sugar with high blood pressure. Secondly, I would get a throbbing sensation in hands and feet accompanied by cold sensations and pins and needles. Lastly, I feel like I can hear my heartbeat and it feels like its pumping harder. I'd like to note that all these symptoms come and go throughout the day. Some hrs are better than others but still constant every day. Doctor likes to say that its my anxiety due to panic attacks. He says it put a lot of pressure on my nerves. But I'm not sure. Its just so odd. I was perfectly fine leading up to the new year (working out 4 out of 7 days a week) then all of a sudden I'm having all these odd symptoms. Is the doctor right in saying this is an inner ear infection mixed with anxiety? Vestibular neuritis? Labyrinthitis? MS? Its on my mind everyday.

(The chiropractor was very gentle and didn't try to crack my neck or anything). I had a random funny turn one evening where i thought I was going to pass out, felt very dizzy was seeing stars, legs went like jelly, my neck was really sore, and my right arm went numb and tingly. Went to the docs who arranged   (which came back fine). The numbness and tingling has persisted ever since. The same thing happened the next night and i went to a&e - more blood tests and an ECG both came back fine. Since then, i have been experiencing more and more symptoms daily which come and go randomly and are all over my body. I have attached my ongoing list. I was referred to see a neurologist, all his physical tests for reflexes, vision, gait, strength etc. were normal and just had an MRI of my brain and cervical spine on Saturday, so nervously awaiting the results. I have found this site very helpful and informative over the past couple of months and in the mean time was wondering if anyone else had experienced similar symptoms to my list, or has any advice?

In addition to the atrohy, all the joints on my right side are having problems and are compromised (tear in the shoulder, hip now locking up if I sit a long time, tear in my right meniscus).  I've had 3 EMGs, several MRIs,  and extensive blood work performed at the finest medical facilities.  There is a spot on my spinal cord, but just one.  They say if I had several, it would indicate MS.  The damage to the spinal cord was not there in 2014 but showed up in 2017 in different MRI.  I am a female of 60 years, and have always exercised regularly and enjoyed the outdoors.  I have herniated C 4, 5 in my neck, which fused itself without surgery.  The pain began in my arm, right above my elbow, then into my wrist.  At first, I thought it was carpal tunnel.   I've been trying to find answers for the past 4 years.  Even my ears are no longer even. A few warnings:  I agreed to a MRI with contrast at Mayo  and developed a severe headache the next morning before getting off the elevator at the hotel the following day.  For six weeks, I had headaches, could not process my thoughts well, etc.  I believe the culprit, for me, was gadolinium, the contrast agent.  Be careful if you agree to an injection for imaging purposes and do your research first.  My symptoms were similar to a CSF leak. My last visit to Cleveland Clinic revealed some potential blood/oxygen flow questions.  A tilt table test to rule out POTS was inconclusive, so they are asking me to come back for another test.    I find the links others have brought up about having stints put in and CSF problems interesting. With regard to symptom relief, I've been too busy to get to my water aerobics class, but find that water exercise is one of my best options.  I've also started laying on some styro wedges (think looseleaf notebook).  My chiro used wedges years ago, so I knew they could be helpful.  By laying on the inclined wedge so that the higher side is under my shoulder and lower side near my spine, or by placing it under my hip for 5-45 minutes, it gives a gentle but solid stretch that offers some relief. Please keep writing.  I hope this is helpful. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I used to be fit (gym, tennis, swimming) but had to reduce my usual exercise routine to almost nothing. The main symptom is a burning feeling in my muscles (similar to the feeling you get when you try to lift a heavy weight). Lately, this happens even while doing simple tasks like doing the dishes. It slowly but surely is starting to affect my everyday life. I don't think that I have lost a noticeable amount of muscle power but I feel like there is no energy stored in my muscles.  I feel like an old battery, drained within a short time. After exercise my muscles are very sore and recovery is very slow. (So far I have tried warm baths with Magnesium salts and Ibuprofen.) I had some blood tests, full blood count, Vit D, Vit B12, creatine kinase level, but did not have a chance to talk to my doctor yet. I suspect, my levels are normal otherwise my GP would have contacted me by now. By posting this discussion I hope to connect to people with similar problems and hear about possible causes and what actions I should take. 0 likes, 6 replies "

Two years ago after the huge fire in Santa Rosa, I tripped and landed on the side of my dresser hurting my ribs. Didnt go to doc, wasnt all that bruised. 2 wks ltr i could feel sloshing in my abdom area. Went to Kaiser they saw i had internal bleeding. They put a drain tube in my side but the bleeding got worse. They had no Thoracic surgeon. i coulnt be transferred to SF because i was to critical. I went to Memorial Hospital in town. They did emergency surgery and fixed it. Prior to that i was in pretty good health, but it was obvious i was slowly losing weight. Losing weight was never easy for me. Two months ltr we were into the new year. we had dropped Kaiser after 32 years because they nearly killed me. In Feb last year i went to a new dr near Memorial because i just wasnt feeling well. I felt tired, and run down, not myself. And I was still losing weight. A lot of weight. im normally about 155 lbs. My new doc sent me to every specialist for the next year. Including Oncology. It wasnt cancer. A year went by and no diagnosis OR sense of urgency at all from all the docs. In NOV of that year out of no where, i was rushed to the hospital with an ulcerated colon. Aha! Could this be the culprit? I was in sepsis b4 they got me to surgery. Another complication. But i got through it. Im still healing from it. And the weight continued to plummet. I was eating, but still losing. At first I was slim and trim but now nearly my entire muscular system is so diminished i am a walking skeleton. No exaggeration. I am 5'4 and 106 lbs. No one knows what it is? I am desperate. I FEEL LIKE MY BODY HAS BEEN FEEDING OFF ITSELF. My drs are frustrating. I show them my bag of bones that used to be my body. No one seems worried. What has happened to me? This is going to kill me if the cause isnt discovered. Has anyone experienced this? Thanks. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I (21 M) had anorexia when I was 15 years old which had hit me pretty hard (I got dangerously underweight, hospitalized, my growth stopped) but it only lasted 3 months and I fully recovered from it.  Then I started exercising in the gym, i had put on some weight and eventually started cycling, which I enjoyed a lot and I was sure I had found a hobby for life. Then, by the time I was 16 something happened to me. I was cycling to much and I didn't let my muscles to fully recover and one day my body just said ""enough"". My leg muscles (all muscles on my body really) hurt and i felt tired all the time and I couldn't make it stop.  If I went on a run or go cycling, my performance was really bad and it felt that way too.  It affected my mood as well and for some time I was depressed and was having hard time falling asleep. When I woke up in the morning, I still felt very tired. I thought it would go away if I give it a rest, but when the tiredness and muscle soreness was still here I went a doctor. He didn't found any abnormalities in the blood and I decided to stop with all activities (except some light walks) for half a year.  After that, my legs still felt heavy, tired, as I would just complete a hard training. Eventually I  started running/cycling/gym again and every activity I previously enjoyed just seemed like a complete torture. So, its been 5 years and lately i felt somehow better and decided to start running again. I didn't do to much runs but every week, instead of improving my muscles were more and more sore and heavy until I decided that it is pointless for me to continue. So, what is going on with my body?

It's been tough to walk in, can't twist my leg or move it side to side without a hard pain, seems to be on the inner thigh right up in the crease. It also gives me a throbbing almost toothache like pain. On Wednesday morning I woke up and it felt significantly better, I was walking about slightly more freely and the pain had drastically decreased so I thought great it's on the mend. Come night time lay in bed the groin started to ache again and this morning once again it feels very stiff, locked up and painful trying to move it around, lift up etc. Does it seem like a simple groin strain, am I giving it enough time to heal? How long does it normally take. I've sent someone to get me some Ibuprofen Gel to use today, hopefully that will help. Also apologies, didn't know what category to put this in. 0 likes, 7 replies "

The final exam season is over and I have been on break since 3 weeks now so I don't think it's from the stress as doctors assumed but it's very worrying as they didn't have other explanation.

He also agreed that i should see a few specialists, an allergist, a arthritis doctor, a gastroenterologist and a neurologist. All of which i have appointments with for the next three months. Since the Gp visit I've suffered my first massive panic attack, had new burning pain spread into my quads and a feeling of my right foot not always moving as i would expect it to. For which my gp has given me a low grade muscle relaxers and anxiety med that i take daily. After which he believes its anxiety causing the pain and not a nerve pinch. Has anyone any idea what might be going on? Or has anyone been subject to similar pains? 0 likes, 0 replies "

It has been 2 weeks since i started to feel this little pain delocalized in my right upper back. I couldn't precisely say what muscle is involved, but i can tell you the symptoms: i can't well contract my right latissimus in vertical pull movements, but no problem in horizontal pull; weakness and problem in vertical push and horizontal push so i can't use 100% of my shoulder and chest; then some little problems on the right  even in other exercises like biceps curl or triceps ext. I noticed watching myself in the mirror that my right scapula is always sharp: not adducted, abducted or anything. It is sharp, something is contracted and blocking it from doing normal movements. You can see it the most when i front raise my arm: on the left my scapula is abducted and relaxed, while on the right you can clearly see the sharpness of the scapula. Please help me!! I live in italy, i can't leave my home right now and i can't even workout well! I'm in panic! 0 likes, 0 replies "

I see a lot of taper / withdrawal threads on here explaining how bad it was for a lot of people but I wanted to share my experience with a relatively easy taper so those who google it don‚Äôt get completely terrified / hopefully it helps some people. I was on mirtazapine for GAD and Panic Disorder for four years, 30mg for three and 45g for the final year. It helped a great deal in the beginning but the last six months or so I felt I was getting no benefits, so I decided to come off. Here are my tips before I log my experience. BE FIRM with your doctor. For too long I was pressured to stay on or even maximise my dose when I was unhappy. Tell your doctor you want off and you want off now and come up with a GAME PLAN. GET ANTI-NAUSEA MEDS this one is simple, be prepared. I got a script for Maxolon from my doc to take twice a day during my withdrawal. It‚Äôs completely safe and non addictive and works wonders. SET YOURSELF UP FOR SUCCESS you can do this. I personally have been through Valium (diazepam) withdrawal and it was horrifying, so with that experience behind me I knew this would be do-able. HAVE FAITH in yourself and your inner strength. SYMPTOMS WILL PASS. The good thing is you know it is the withdrawal that is making your anxiety flare up or making you feel uneasy so you KNOW you can get through it and it will end. So here comes my experience. Had been on 45mg for a year (out of 4 on this med) and told my doctor I want off and I want off ASAP. They were aware of my success coming off diazepam so were supportive of me coming off this relatively quickly (I really earned my drug withdrawal stripes there haha). 45mg down to 30mg for five days. I took my anti-nausea pill when I woke up straight away and another in the evening if I needed. Honestly felt ZERO bad effects from this drop at all, if anything I felt better. Less violent anxiety, clearer head and happier mood. 30mg down to 15mg for five days. Kept taking those wonderful Maxolons and again this was a walk in the park!! Happier every day and really focussing on how much success I was having so far. 15mg down to 7.5mg for five days. Still on Maxolon every day to avoid the nausea. Had some days where anxiety would flare up quickly but that‚Äôs kind of normal for me anyway. Found on this low dose I was falling asleep so fast I had forgotten how sedating the low doses were! 7.5mg to 0 for the rest of my life. Still on Maxolon, have been noticing I still feel some nausea so I am grateful to have the anti-nausea meds to really minimise it. Have been taking 2 daily during this time. My sleep is becoming a bit more broken and less of a ‚Äúcoma‚Äù deep sleep now and I‚Äôve been sweating bullets at random but DRINKING LOADS OF WATER. ¬†STILL FEELING POSITIVE!! I am now 3 days into 0mg and honestly it‚Äôs nowhere near as bad as a lot of people experienced and for that I am extremely grateful. Will update if people are interested to read how the next few days / weeks go now that I‚Äôm down to no mirt in my system. ¬†It has been so much easier than I was braced for. Mild Nausea despite taking the anti nausea meds Pooping more than usual Some sleep disruption once I came off completely Sweating Mild headache (easily fixed by ibuprofen) Flare ups of anxiety but NO PANIC ATTACKS caused by withdrawal, if anything my panic attacks are less frequent now Feeling a little foggy headed once I got down to zero, not a big deal Jitters. Just general fidgeting and struggling to sit still but that‚Äôs expected after being sedated big time for the last four years by a variety of meds now I‚Äôm on zero medications. (I‚Äôm not saying these don‚Äôt happen but merely they did not happen to me) Vomiting Diarrhoea Insomnia (I still sleep every night) Brain Zaps Migraines Panic attacks caused by withdrawal Suicidal thoughts / depression. I‚Äôm actually much happier. Dizziness / feeling faint. Again this is less frequent now than it was while I was on 45mg. Bad mood changes, being angry or crying for no reason. So to anyone who bothered to read this essay post. YOU CAN DO IT. Everyone will experience these things differently and I am not disputing that some people have a really rough time, it‚Äôs just that when someone has a good experience or an easy time they are less likely to write about it. When I was starting my taper I found so many awful stories and so few positive ones which made me extremely anxious in itself. So I wanted to write out a successful withdrawal story for those people who are about to start to see that they might not have a horrifying experience and there are ways you can prevent a lot of the symptoms SAFELY. Drink lots of water. Have faith in yourself. Be strong. Don‚Äôt put up with sh*t you don‚Äôt have to. I am more than happy to reply to any questions people have about my experience and will update how things go for the next few days if anyone is interested.

I see a lot of taper / withdrawal threads on here explaining how bad it was for a lot of people but I wanted to share my experience with a relatively easy taper so those who google it don‚Äôt get completely terrified / hopefully it helps some people. I was on mirtazapine for GAD and Panic Disorder for four years, 30mg for three and 45g for the final year. It helped a great deal in the beginning but the last six months or so I felt I was getting no benefits, so I decided to come off. Here are my tips before I log my experience. BE FIRM with your doctor. For too long I was pressured to stay on or even maximise my dose when I was unhappy. Tell your doctor you want off and you want off now and come up with a GAME PLAN. GET ANTI-NAUSEA MEDS this one is simple, be prepared. I got a script for Maxolon from my doc to take twice a day during my withdrawal. It‚Äôs completely safe and non addictive and works wonders. SET YOURSELF UP FOR SUCCESS you can do this. I personally have been through Valium (diazepam) withdrawal and it was horrifying, so with that experience behind me I knew this would be do-able. HAVE FAITH in yourself and your inner strength. SYMPTOMS WILL PASS. The good thing is you know it is the withdrawal that is making your anxiety flare up or making you feel uneasy so you KNOW you can get through it and it will end. So here comes my experience. Had been on 45mg for a year (out of 4 on this med) and told my doctor I want off and I want off ASAP. They were aware of my success coming off diazepam so were supportive of me coming off this relatively quickly (I really earned my drug withdrawal stripes there haha). 45mg down to 30mg for five days. I took my anti-nausea pill when I woke up straight away and another in the evening if I needed. Honestly felt ZERO bad effects from this drop at all, if anything I felt better. Less violent anxiety, clearer head and happier mood. 30mg down to 15mg for five days. Kept taking those wonderful Maxolons and again this was a walk in the park!! Happier every day and really focussing on how much success I was having so far. 15mg down to 7.5mg for five days. Still on Maxolon every day to avoid the nausea. Had some days where anxiety would flare up quickly but that‚Äôs kind of normal for me anyway. Found on this low dose I was falling asleep so fast I had forgotten how sedating the low doses were! 7.5mg to 0 for the rest of my life. Still on Maxolon, have been noticing I still feel some nausea so I am grateful to have the anti-nausea meds to really minimise it. Have been taking 2 daily during this time. My sleep is becoming a bit more broken and less of a ‚Äúcoma‚Äù deep sleep now and I‚Äôve been sweating bullets at random but DRINKING LOADS OF WATER. ¬†STILL FEELING POSITIVE!! I am now 3 days into 0mg and honestly it‚Äôs nowhere near as bad as a lot of people experienced and for that I am extremely grateful. Will update if people are interested to read how the next few days / weeks go now that I‚Äôm down to no mirt in my system. ¬†It has been so much easier than I was braced for. Mild Nausea despite taking the anti nausea meds Pooping more than usual Some sleep disruption once I came off completely Sweating Mild headache (easily fixed by ibuprofen) Flare ups of anxiety but NO PANIC ATTACKS caused by withdrawal, if anything my panic attacks are less frequent now Feeling a little foggy headed once I got down to zero, not a big deal Jitters. Just general fidgeting and struggling to sit still but that‚Äôs expected after being sedated big time for the last four years by a variety of meds now I‚Äôm on zero medications. (I‚Äôm not saying these don‚Äôt happen but merely they did not happen to me) Vomiting Diarrhoea Insomnia (I still sleep every night) Brain Zaps Migraines Panic attacks caused by withdrawal Suicidal thoughts / depression. I‚Äôm actually much happier. Dizziness / feeling faint. Again this is less frequent now than it was while I was on 45mg. Bad mood changes, being angry or crying for no reason. So to anyone who bothered to read this essay post. YOU CAN DO IT. Everyone will experience these things differently and I am not disputing that some people have a really rough time, it‚Äôs just that when someone has a good experience or an easy time they are less likely to write about it. When I was starting my taper I found so many awful stories and so few positive ones which made me extremely anxious in itself. So I wanted to write out a successful withdrawal story for those people who are about to start to see that they might not have a horrifying experience and there are ways you can prevent a lot of the symptoms SAFELY. Drink lots of water. Have faith in yourself. Be strong. Don‚Äôt put up with sh*t you don‚Äôt have to. I am more than happy to reply to any questions people have about my experience and will update how things go for the next few days if anyone is interested. Cheers and good luck.¬† 12 likes, 126 replies "

In early 2018, after almost 2 years of increasing symptoms such as brain fog, fatigue, interrupted sleep, decreased sense of smell and taste, and burning feet accompanied with a sensation of wearing stockings to the knee and long gloves, I was told my B12 serum levels were 220 pmol/L and B12 active levels 41 pmol/L. My GP is proactive and commenced 1000 mcg IM methyl shots immediately with a schedule of 1 shot every 3  weeks for 9 weeks; then once a month. 4-5 months after my first shot I felt no real improvement had occurred and asked to have shots every 2 weeks, which my GP agreed to.  This continued for appx 6 weeks when I got sick of attending the surgery and requested they show me how to administer the shots myself, which they did. Thankfully I'm in Australia so can purchase ampules over the counter at a chemist, and can get free injecting equipment through a health organisation. I self administered every 10 days for 8 weeks. By then my B12 levels were well over 1000 pmol/L and have remained there. I subsequently stopped having the shots as I appear to be maintaining levels adequately. I was also taking 5000mcg of Methyl B12 sublingual tabs daily along with a B complex, fish oil, zinc and joint pain supplements (dodgy knees). I continue to supplement regularly although not to such high levels. In April 2018 I asked my doctor to review previous blood tests to check whether my B12  had ever been tested before as my symptoms had progressed considerably - it turns out it had been in Dec 2016 when I first went to get my issue of numb toes checked out. My levels back then were 198 pmol/L and 39 pmol/L for serum and active forms respectively. These results were never followed up by my GP at the time and I was completely unaware of them until April 2018 . At the time they had concerns it may have been MS as my sister suffers from the disease. I have also had my children tested as I was concerned that this may have been a dietary issue.  My youngest two tested in the low to mid 300's. I supplement them occasionally as a result as there is a chance they're not getting enough from their food. Over the last 3-4 weeks I've noticed a significant return of the burning feet and stockinged legs/arms sensation, particularly of a night time. I live in a tropical area of Australia and have noticed this seems to occur when the weather heats up. The brain fog is almost non-existent and my sleeping patterns have improved significantly. My memory however still has some gaping holes in it and I continue to struggle with retention of  information. I've also recently discovered I'm massively deficient in Vit D, which surprised me as I live in a place with almost constant sunshine (not as great as it sounds I might add!). It seems the Slip/Slop/Slap skin cancer campaigns have really paid off and we are a nation of increasingly Vit D deficient people. I have had 2 MRI's that were clear of MS, stroke, tumour, any form of demyelation disorder, spinal cord compression, and cauda equina. I saw two different neuro's who tried to convince me it was anxiety and wanted to treat me with anti depressants and then suggested I visit a psychologist. I went to see a psychologist who rejected the anxiety theory (as had I) but they suggested it could be fibromyalgia. My GP rejected this suggestion and frankly I'm dubious myself. I've had STI checks; urine protein checks; autoimmune checks for lupus, Sjogren syndrome, RA etc; diabetes; iron studies; MMA (after supplementation unfortunately); thyroid function; coeliac disease; intrinsic factor and routine bloods/chemistry checks. With the exception of a slightly abnormal liver function (ALT) test, all have been clear and normal. I'm not pre-menopausal. I am visiting my Dr again soon for follow up tests to check B12 & Vit D levels. I'm now also seriously considering environmental factors such as adult onset allergies, or some sort of contamination. The last I doubt is an issue as my children don't appear to be affected. So finally to my question(s) -  from the past experience of other B12 low/deficient patients: Hopefully someone is still reading this.... Many thanks in advance! 0 likes, 2 replies "

By then my B12 levels were well over 1000 pmol/L and have remained there. I subsequently stopped having the shots as I appear to be maintaining levels adequately. I was also taking 5000mcg of Methyl B12 sublingual tabs daily along with a B complex, fish oil, zinc and joint pain supplements (dodgy knees). I continue to supplement regularly although not to such high levels. In April 2018 I asked my doctor to review previous blood tests to check whether my B12  had ever been tested before as my symptoms had progressed considerably - it turns out it had been in Dec 2016 when I first went to get my issue of numb toes checked out. My levels back then were 198 pmol/L and 39 pmol/L for serum and active forms respectively. These results were never followed up by my GP at the time and I was completely unaware of them until April 2018 . At the time they had concerns it may have been MS as my sister suffers from the disease. I have also had my children tested as I was concerned that this may have been a dietary issue.  My youngest two tested in the low to mid 300's. I supplement them occasionally as a result as there is a chance they're not getting enough from their food. Over the last 3-4 weeks I've noticed a significant return of the burning feet and stockinged legs/arms sensation, particularly of a night time. I live in a tropical area of Australia and have noticed this seems to occur when the weather heats up. The brain fog is almost non-existent and my sleeping patterns have improved significantly. My memory however still has some gaping holes in it and I continue to struggle with retention of  information. I've also recently discovered I'm massively deficient in Vit D, which surprised me as I live in a place with almost constant sunshine (not as great as it sounds I might add!). It seems the Slip/Slop/Slap skin cancer campaigns have really paid off and we are a nation of increasingly Vit D deficient people. I have had 2 MRI's that were clear of MS, stroke, tumour, any form of demyelation disorder, spinal cord compression, and cauda equina. I saw two different neuro's who tried to convince me it was anxiety and wanted to treat me with anti depressants and then suggested I visit a psychologist. I went to see a psychologist who rejected the anxiety theory (as had I) but they suggested it could be fibromyalgia. My GP rejected this suggestion and frankly I'm dubious myself. I've had STI checks; urine protein checks; autoimmune checks for lupus, Sjogren syndrome, RA etc; diabetes; iron studies; MMA (after supplementation unfortunately); thyroid function; coeliac disease; intrinsic factor and routine bloods/chemistry checks. With the exception of a slightly abnormal liver function (ALT) test, all have been clear and normal. I'm not pre-menopausal. I am visiting my Dr again soon for follow up tests to check B12 & Vit D levels. I'm now also seriously considering environmental factors such as adult onset allergies, or some sort of contamination. The last I doubt is an issue as my children don't appear to be affected. So finally to my question(s) -  from the past experience of other B12 low/deficient patients: Hopefully someone is still reading this.... Many thanks in advance! 0 likes, 2 replies "

I was on monthly b12 injections of hydroxocobalamin. I have recently moved home and moved GP.  The practice nurse questioned why i need b12 injections for so long and I was sent for a blood test. My levels came back as b12 219 and folic acid was severely low at level 1... the doctor (always a different doctor) told me that my b12 level is fine at 219 but said my folic acid is the lowest level he has ever seen in all his years as a GP.  He put me on daily folic acid as well as vit D which was also very low. I am very concerned as I thought folic acid works alongside with b12 but my injections have been stopped. I do not think my b12 level is as high as it should be and I am so worried about the neurological effects of not having enough b12.  When i was diagnosed 10 years ago I was so very poorly, could hardly walk upstairs, had to crawl up, my memory was terrible, I was under neurology at my local hospital who put me on monthly b12 injections as I was so ill with it..... No one at this new surgery has explained why my folic acid is so low... could it be connected to the previous pernicious anemia? Any advice would be so great, so worried...thank you.

Something else?,"Hello. I'm a 66 year old female, diagnosed with CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) three years ago. I'm untreated, on ""watch and wait"", as my only symptoms have been my lymphocytes and white count. About 6 weeks ago, I noticed that I was having difficulty reading; it was hard to concentrate on the words, and it seeme as if the right side of the words were smudged or blurred. This scared me to death, so I looked in the mirror and did all the typical tests for stroke/TIA. There was no drooping, etc., but the right side of my face appeared blurred in the mirror. My husband took me to the hospital, where I stayed overnight and they did every test possible - CT, MRI, blood work, several neuro workups; nothing at all showed up. The doctor's best guess was that, due to my CLL, the viscosity of my blood might have caused a brief sluggishness and somehow kept blood/oxygen reaching the area of my optic nerve.  He put me on Plavix. My primary doctor sent me to a retina specialist; he found nothing wrong with my retina but believed that the problem was not ""viscosity"" but instead a tiny embolism.  My oncologist agreed, pointing out that cancer patients can be subject to blood clots, and I've stayed on the Plavix. Last night, I had another brief (a few minutes) similar spell; hard to concentrate on blurry words while reading. I didn't really notice the blurring while looking in the mirror, however. It seems to me that, just before I noticed the reading difficulty, I had a hard time enunciating a few words - again, vey brief. (In retrospect, I think this also happened very briefly the first time, though I attributed it to my fear.) I have a scheduled appointment tomorrow with my primary physician and will ask about this. I have been under pretty high stress this week over separate issues. Has anyone experienced anything like this? I wonder what it means that I'd have  the same odd symptoms (eye, possibly speech) twice. And, the second time, while on Plavix? Any and all opinions and experiences are welcomed! 0 likes, 5 replies "

My Uncle, who is/was a healthy 59 year old male, woke up the next morning after being the MC of a wedding, after coming out of the shower, he sat down on a chair after feeling light headed before passing out.  He was able to regain consciousness and walk down to an ambulance that was called for him. 12 hours later he was having brain surgery. As some background, he had been complaining of a headache that seemed to come and go for the last week, there was a sense this could be worse than your usual headache, but stubbornness and whatever got in the way and a doctors visit never eventuated. From what I could understand from the Stroke director and surgeon, the cause was a burst aneurysm, which was apparently a big one.  Somehow (i dont understand much from else from here) a clot formed.  WHen the aneurysm burst i dont understand either. But apparently when the surgeon when in to remove the blood clot they were unable to because it had hardened.  The clot had obviously formed a few days ago and travelled along until it couldnt go any further. But my uncle was admitted to hospital around 10am on Sunday morning but wasnt operated on until later Sunday night, so I guess my first question comes there, if it was a complete blockage wouldnt that warrant emergency surgery?  Would you be able to assume given surgery was put off til later that they wer able to get medication in there to reduce the blockage? Anyway,  so the surgeon had to improvise i suppose, given they were unable to remove the clot, so they cut off vessels surrounding the clot to force a rupture of the clot and that was successful.  THe blood was stopped here for roughly 5 minutes.  I guess that type of method would be  a last resort as who knows what type of damage and to how much of the brain that would have caused, but thats what needed to be done.   I assume only a neuro surgeon would have the right insights on this point, but if there are any of this forum, I would love to know and understand the medical science and methods behind that. So the surgery finished, in about 3 hours & he occupied the ICU for about 8 days. He was obviously heavily sedated until about day 4 or 5 and by day 6/7 he was opening his eyes and holding hands with family, but no talking and no movemnt at all on theright side. The right side of the brain was affected and the stroke director did comment that speech would be affected, but they were not sure by how much and that they were not sure how much impact there would be to the movement of his right side. The good news is that by day 8 he had been moved to the neuro ward, and out of the ICU. Today was day 9, and he seems to have come to some sense at this point, he recognises family, he has been crying and trying to talk, noises come out and you can see the frustration because he knows what he wants to say but just cant. So for the experts, what does that indicate so far? is this normal? Given that it seems he knows what he wants to say but cant, does he need to learn how to talk again? He understands what has happened and when the nurse writes things on a notepad, for eg. poke out your tongue or hold up your arm, he follows perfectly. It's such a shame that this can happen to a 59 year old, but thats life hey. Would love to see some insights and comments to help me understand a bit more. Thanks 0 likes, 2 replies "

The only thing I do have to be careful of is that with this amount of anti-platelet medication I bruise like a ripe peach. I look a bit like I am being beaten up. Quite embarrassing for my hubby but if this is the worst I have to face then I can handle it. I have a future to look forward to (thanks to the NHS). L 0 likes, 5 replies "

But...they never gave me a prescription for a blood thinner; & I read online that most TIA's are caused by clots; & that most people who experience them should be placed on blood thinners right away.  Is this true? Also...I still have a very slight numbness on the left side of my face, with a slight pain that occurs every now & then above my right ear.

The best way to start is usually at the beginning so here goes.  Over a month ago, September 18th, I had sudden strange symptoms that came on with no warning.  It started with an immense tightness and pain in my chest, followed by   and an inability to control thought and process.  after a while the pain dissipated but I was stilled plagued by the aftershock of symptoms that followed.  There was.no drooping of the face or limbs whatsoever, although I couldn't maintain steady thought process and my entire.personality seemed to have been changed.  Normally Im a very artistic and articulated person but that seemed to have vanished.  the awkwardness and fear has been overwhelming at times and although I have been to the ER and after an EKG, having a   done, and been told that no swelling or bleeding could.be found in my brain, I have.not been the same.  I still continue to work full time, but I am not the same person I was.  At the moment, I'm still waiting for results from blood labs that my regular physician recommended and I have had no real change in my symptoms.  Many of the hobbies which mostly include passing guitar and music and reading I can't enjoy any longer because of the lasting effects.  I will admit that I blame myself largely.because I have not been a very healthy person and I take full responsibility for that obviously.  But I am not sure what to expect from here on out and am intensely afraid that it may happen again.  I dont really have anyone to turn to and I appreciate anyone that can.give me their insight on this.  I apologize for such a long.topic.  I greatly thank and appreciate anyone who can help answer even a few questions.  Have a wonderful day!üòÅ 0 likes, 1 reply "

(No idea how long it will take for him to answer)  The pains I'm having in other parts of my body  I can just about put up with,   but the pains in my hips, thighs and lower legs are unbearable, much worse at night,  deep inside,  they hurt so much that I can't tell whether it's in my bones or nerves! There is absolutely no way to lay on my sides,   I can't find a comfortable way to lay in bed at all,  so I'm up and down like a yo yo,  lucky  to get an hour and a half sleep at a time,  I am so tired!   In the day the pains ease a little bit, it depends what I'm doing,  walking hurts,  lifting my legs in and out of the car hurt,  climbing stairs hurt,   getting up or down to a kneeling position hurts.      My knees, ankles and feet are the only part of my legs that don't hurt!!   I mentioned all this to my specialist during my last appointment but he said it was probably down to the statins that I was taking, so I stopped them for two months and it made no difference at all,  the pains are just getting worse and worse, I dread going to bed.    I was on predisolone for my PMR and as I was reducing the dose the leg pains started. The specialist told me to go back on them but I don;t want to mask the pain, I want to know what's causing it.   Has anyone else had the same experience?  Is it the Meth? Will it get better?  Someone help me, I'm begging?  I can't take it anymore. 0 likes, 5 replies "

Methotrexate Hair Loss at 24..,"Hello, I have been on and off of methotrexate for around 2 years due to changes in bloods and side effects etc. I came off it a couple of weeks ago due to my bloods and I was at more risk of infection, after getting my bloods done 2 weeks later and all was fine I was back on the methotrexate. About 3 weeks in my hair has started to come out in mass clumps, I have stopped taking it for around 2 weeks now and it won't stop coming out in clumps to which I have now got bald spots around my head. I am still taking the folic acid every day and I did during taking the methotrexate except the day of my injection. I have been to the hospital and they have told me methotrexate is out of the question for me now (Thank god!) I have had the yttrium-90 injection into my knee joint back in November as I am only effected in the one joint, so I am currently on no medication at all because I'm having no discomfort. My doctor has told me that it could possibly take over a month for the growth to start again and to see a dermatologist if there is no improvement. I was hoping someone has been through this before or could possibly give me some advice about the hair loss?  I am 24 years old and it is really starting to get me down, I am being told not to stress about it but I can't see how I can do that at the minute, I thankfully have thick hair but I don't know for how much longer.

The metronidazole partly cleared the abscess and then the dentist lanced it. There were unpleasant side-effects from taking the metronidazole: I felt exhausted and had terrible dreams. Also, my mind felt as if it had been put through a shredder. After 3 days, I couldn't stand it any longer so I gave myself Kormanu ( dolphin energy) and after only 10 minutes all the side-effects disappeared.  Kormanu is similar to Reiki which I also practise. On awaking the next morning, I was again feeling shattered so I did 20 minutes of Kormanu and again all the side-effects disappeared. I just wish that I had started the Kormanu sooner. 0 likes, 3 replies "

We also talked about SIBO as well, and instead of waiting ages for a test, he decided to just go ahead and give me a course of Metronidazole. My doctor seemed confident that this medication is really safe, quite a weak antibiotic and would be fine for me to take, with minimum, if not no side effects developing. He actually takes it himself when he goes on overseas travel, andhe's had no problem with it. However my anxieties got the better of me and I just had to look up the medication. I've now seen lots of comments from users of Metronidazole of how ill it made them feel, and some of the side effects are quite worrying. I really don't want to feel worse than I do right now, so have decided to delay taking them until the results of my vitamin B12 test comes through. If this proves to be ok, then I will have to decide whether I should take the Metronidazole or not. Why he couldn't have just put me in for the test I don't know, I wish he had! If anyone has any experiences, good or bad, they are willing to share with me, then I would be grateful to hear them. Obviously, the more good comments the better for me, that'll hopefully give me the confidence to take this medication should my B12 levels be ok. Many thanks in advance. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I also have an anxiety disorder/panic disorder. I know that these are comorbid conditions. However, I've recently noticed that my migraines have changed. I get less pain, but I feel like I'm on the verge of an anxiety or panic attack. My palms will get really sweaty, I have a very fast heartbeat, I get nauseated, I have a surge of adrenaline, and my hands shake. I take Topamax and Maxalt for the migraines and Zoloft and Valium for my anxiety/panic disorder. My psychiatrist has recently suggested I do an intensive outpatient hospitalization for my anxiety. It appears to be helping, but when I get a migraine all of my anxiety symptoms just rush back. When I take 100mg of Maxalt the symptoms lessen greatly or go away all together. Now I'm just confused. Anxiety attack or migraine? Has anyone experienced something like this? 1 like, 2 replies "

The very first time it happened I got an aura which started off as a small zig zag line in both eyes. I actually thought I had something in my eye at first and kept rubbing my eyes but it wouldn't go away. Over the next 10 minutes or so it got bigger and bigger until it filled my vision before finally going away. At no point did I get a headache. A few weeks later I got it again but then after I got a headache. I wouldn't call it a bad headache, I didn't really even need to take pain killers. The worst bit though was afterwards when I would feel 'out of it', like everything was too much effort and all I wanted to do was sleep and I would also get really bad neck pain that would last for days. I went to my GP who said it was probably a migraine with aura (I'd never even heard of such a thing). He didn't do any tests just said it was probably stress but I didn't really feel stressed before hand. That said the aura did freak me out so I totally accept I was stressed AFTER getting it. A few weeks passed and then I got another attack, again 1 every day for 3 days. This time I became very nauseous and was being sick whilst I had the aura. The headaches after were more pronounced but not the splitting/crushing feeling that I always thought a migraine was, just a reasonably bad headache. It's worth mentioning here that I was also diagnosed with high cholesterol around this time and already had raised blood pressure and so I decided to go on a diet as I was very overweight. Then they seemed to go away for several months and I thought that perhaps they had gone away. I've now lost over 4 stone (nearly 60lb) and my blood pressure had come down so much that I was taken off medication and now it's a steady 115/75. Then yesterday out of the blue I had another migraine. During the aura phase I took my BP and it had shot up to 150/100 but I kept taking it over and over and as the aura went away over a period of around 10 minutes and my BP came down each time until it was back to 120/80. Again after I got the headache, slight nausea and still neck and today I still feel wiped out, slight nausea and have a slight headache that won't go away and am constantly in fear that he aura will return. What freaks me out and worries me is why have I started getting them at 45 years of age when every Internet search says it's highly unusual to develop migraine in later life? Why do they last for days? Is the aura due to blocked/narrowed blood vessels due to my high cholesterol? Is it normal for BP to shoot up during an attack? Why hasn't my GP referred me for any tests? My GP did give me some medication, can't remember what it was called, and said to take one pill at the start of an attack but that if it didn't help NOT to take the second pill. When I looked up the side effects in the leaflet it said that one of them was death! So I've not taken them and really don't like the idea of trying them. Trying to remain calm and keep things in perspective but finding it really hard. Has any of this happened to anyone else? Am I over worrying? 0 likes, 5 replies "

I actually thought I had something in my eye at first and kept rubbing my eyes but it wouldn't go away. Over the next 10 minutes or so it got bigger and bigger until it filled my vision before finally going away. At no point did I get a headache. A few weeks later I got it again but then after I got a headache. I wouldn't call it a bad headache, I didn't really even need to take pain killers. The worst bit though was afterwards when I would feel 'out of it', like everything was too much effort and all I wanted to do was sleep and I would also get really bad neck pain that would last for days. I went to my GP who said it was probably a migraine with aura (I'd never even heard of such a thing). He didn't do any tests just said it was probably stress but I didn't really feel stressed before hand. That said the aura did freak me out so I totally accept I was stressed AFTER getting it. A few weeks passed and then I got another attack, again 1 every day for 3 days. This time I became very nauseous and was being sick whilst I had the aura. The headaches after were more pronounced but not the splitting/crushing feeling that I always thought a migraine was, just a reasonably bad headache. It's worth mentioning here that I was also diagnosed with high cholesterol around this time and already had raised blood pressure and so I decided to go on a diet as I was very overweight. Then they seemed to go away for several months and I thought that perhaps they had gone away. I've now lost over 4 stone (nearly 60lb) and my blood pressure had come down so much that I was taken off medication and now it's a steady 115/75. Then yesterday out of the blue I had another migraine. During the aura phase I took my BP and it had shot up to 150/100 but I kept taking it over and over and as the aura went away over a period of around 10 minutes and my BP came down each time until it was back to 120/80. Again after I got the headache, slight nausea and still neck and today I still feel wiped out, slight nausea and have a slight headache that won't go away and am constantly in fear that he aura will return. What freaks me out and worries me is why have I started getting them at 45 years of age when every Internet search says it's highly unusual to develop migraine in later life? Why do they last for days? Is the aura due to blocked/narrowed blood vessels due to my high cholesterol? Is it normal for BP to shoot up during an attack? Why hasn't my GP referred me for any tests?

When I was pregnant I started to get migraines every single day, and my doctor wanted to prescribe amitriptyline-being hesitant I waited, but eventually thought I would try it as I was desperate. To my surprise, I did not have a single headache for the rest of my pregnancy, and not until I was 4 months post-partum when I started getting my period again. Now-I am back to the usual 1-2 migraines a week, and upwards of 4 around the time of ovulation & my period. I was on birth control in college (regular & low dose) hoping one of those would help them and it didn't seem to-however after I quit taking it they actually got better but it almost seems like they are worse again. I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and figured out what helped them. 0 likes, 1 reply "

All I know is that I am afraid and no one I know in real life has ever experienced an aura. I feel very alone. 1 like, 90 replies "

Aura for 30 minutes then one sided pain for a day or so. I know I am very lucky on the severity of the timescale involved I have recently noticed that initial first symptom sign has changed to a vertigo type start as opposed to aura. I am now 59 and am curious to ask anyone who may know if this is normal? The aura I can cope with but I am concerned and frightened with this new scary symptom. I am assuming this is also another pre migraine about to happen sign but thought I would ask. I am currently on losartan and tildium daily for hbp. Thank you in advance. 1 like, 11 replies "

If others are currently dieting, please add your experiences here. I would like to discover whether we gain weight on mirtazapine purely because it increases our appetite, or whether other factors are at play. I certainly gained weight quickly when I started on mirtazapine (around 1.5 stone). My appetite was revenous, especially for sugary foods. I tried to com off mirtazapine around 6 months in and failed. I lost half a stone in the week I waas off it, but most of that was due to severe nausea. When I went back on the drug I did not gain more than a couple of pounds, but I was being very careful what I ate. My weight has been steady now for two years. I am not happy carrying around the extra stone however, and so have decided to diet. I am on day 8 and it is VERY hard. But I have lost two pounds so far. This is with me still eating 1700 - 1800 calories a day. I have a very active physical job and so my daily calorie requirement is 2100.  I have also started taking raspberry ketones and green coffee bean extract as of this morning in the hope that it will help me to burn fat. The interesting thing is, the amouont of weight I have lost is the same as would be expected from a person who is not on mirtazapine. 2 likes, 199 replies "

Currently on Brevinor which I have been on for about 8 years now Early Feb, I started to get severe pains in my lower abdomen  below my belly button. Went to the walk in centre a week after getting the pains and had a urine sample taken and discovered there was acute blood in there. Was diagnosed with a UTI and was given antibiotics and was told if symptoms of the pain don't go within 4 days - go to A&E. Still no change in the pain so I was taken to A&E and later transferred to another hospital's urology ward that night. Did an ultrasound and CT scans and found nothing. Ten days after taking the week of antibiotics, I was given another course of antibiotics and then repeated that ten days after that. Still acute blood (its yellow with a strong smell and white bits in it) and pains and was referred to see an urologist. Plus the frequency to visit the loo has increased. Got a cancellation to see one three days later and referred to have a cystoscopy - again got a cancellation. Was all clear and been advised to see my GP and get referred to gynecology. Since the pain, my period pains are worse and periods heavier. Normally, I just get a little lightheaded. Now I get the period cramps and pain two days before my period is due. My mum had fibroids removed when she was in her early 40s. My GP said on the scans my womb and ovaries were clear and fibroids are slow growing. Though I had the scan 8 weeks ago. I am getting rather down with the pain, inability to sleep and the general tiredness. Also from time to time, I get a twinge pain on the back on the right hand side.

I have suffered with anxiety for years but the last 12 weeks have been terrible. It started with a neck injury that happened around then, I do believe this was an issue that was caused by injury as opposed to anything else even though I woke up with a sore neck suddenly one morning but it had obviously affected muscles in the area and i had worked out the night before. My anxiety has been through the roof ever since and have trouble sleeping, however I have had these symptoms for years. The neck has got better but still not right. Anyway over the weekend I woke up on Sunday with a lump in my throat on the right hand side. it literally came up over night. I felt like I was coming down with a cough or cold which my baby and girlfriend have had and my glands swelled up. They went back down mostly pretty quickly although a couple are still slightly raised. I've been to the doctor again and this was more in relation to my anxiety but she has referred me for blood and mentioned it could be thyroid issues. Since the lump appeared I have been very sensitive to heat and my insomnia has been much worse. The cold never really developed in to anything but I get occasional very light phlegm and a little cough. There could be very minor pressure transferring to my ear. It all seems to be on the right hand side. There is obviously a swelling somewhere and it seems to be coming from the thyroid area which is causing the swallowing sensation, it isn't getting better and might be getting slightly worse however it only flared up on Sunday. I have lost weight over the last few weeks however I have been super anxious and I just dont know if this potential thyroid issue is related or has just flared up over the weekend. The neck injury probably isnt related but thought it may be worth mentioning. I am male 32. Any responses are greatly appreciated. Thanks Adam 0 likes, 0 replies "

I struggle with memory, I'm very weak and extremely exhausted. I have had previous surgeries to have cysts removed. Hysterectomy at 28. Appendix at 16, Gall bladder removal at 38. which all made me very sick. Now that I'm 45, I can say I have never been so I'll. About 4 years ago, I went to the ER, as I was weak and very ill. Blood Tests confirmed mono, but I was told I had a node on my Thyroid which was very small and I shouldn't be concerned, most people have these and are fine. I was also told I had Deginerative disc disease at the same time. The Thyroid node was very concerning to me, as my mother passed away from her node, her node also metastasized into her lungs. she was scheduled for surgery to remove said node, the morning she passed away.  As you can see, the node bothered me. In the county I live in, there are only 3 Endocrinologists in my area and set up an appointment as soon as possible, which was 4 months away.  I finally went in, he performed an ultrasound and even though I stated my concerns over family history. He said there was no need to worry, no need for further testing, it was too small to remove, and so we are going to monitor ever 6 months. Each follow-up appointment, was the same discussion. No need to worry, it's growing, but growing slowly. no worries. No Testing, see you in 6 months. After my last appointment 13 months ago, he said I will see you next year.

Potassium low, calcium high TSH 3.15. Testing was done throughout, stress tests, cardiograms, ultrasounds on my heart. I have boughts of diahrrea and constipation. Was diagnosed with IBD.

Told I'm just depressed, side effect of IBD. All my doctors as of 6 months ago, I fired. I've started over again, but just recently because I quit my job, I'm truly I'll. Since last October, I'm on antinausea, I've lost 50 lbs and can't think my way out of a wet bag. I now have 3 golf ball size cysts on my thyroid, mid throat and under my tongue. I have a new baby cyst on my pancreas, but my Now doc says it's probably a fatty deposit, I have a small cyst in my liver and my pcp says it's probably just a blood clot.

He said there was no need to worry, no need for further testing, it was too small to remove, and so we are going to monitor ever 6 months. Each follow-up appointment, was the same discussion. No need to worry, it's growing, but growing slowly. no worries. No Testing, see you in 6 months. After my last appointment 13 months ago, he said I will see you next year. It's growing so slowly, we can now see each other once per year. After the first initial visit with the endocrinologist, I seemed to never get over mono it seemed. Constantly sick to my stomach, tachycardia episodes. Migraines, losing my vision, throbbing behind my eyes. Throbbing pain that would come and go. 6 months after meeting the Endocrinologist, started hospital stays. My triglycerides were high at 2600. My blood pressure was sky high. Potassium low, calcium high TSH 3.15. Testing was done throughout, stress tests, cardiograms, ultrasounds on my heart. I have boughts of diahrrea and constipation. Was diagnosed with IBD. Later with a hernia right side, upper stomach and hernia where my stomach is going into my lung area. Through the last 4 year's I've been treated like a hypochondriac, because I'm sick. Told I'm just depressed, side effect of IBD. All my doctors as of 6 months ago, I fired. I've started over again, but just recently because I quit my job, I'm truly I'll. Since last October, I'm on antinausea, I've lost 50 lbs and can't think my way out of a wet bag. I now have 3 golf ball size cysts on my thyroid, mid throat and under my tongue. I have a new baby cyst on my pancreas, but my Now doc says it's probably a fatty deposit, I have a small cyst in my liver and my pcp says it's probably just a blood clot. So let me get this straight. let's all assume, not eating, vomiting, Diaharrea, weakness, lethargic, extreme thirst, headaches, pain up my neck and now extends into my brain. coughing, chocking on water, I feel like I have a bone stuck on my throat. I want to stick a hanger down my throat to remove the blockage, I'm desperate for relief. I have horse voice, lose my voice and always clearing my throat, and I never ask for pain medication, because then I would be a drug attic. I did ask for prednisone but was denied. I have to have help to the bathroom, I never leave my home now and my consists of taking medicine and just keeping water down. I have another ultrasound on Thursday, but I feel like it's pointless.

I'm struggling to type and write, as my cognitive abilities are straining, lacking. I feel as though I lost 40 IQ points in the last year. I struggle with memory, I'm very weak and extremely exhausted. I have had previous surgeries to have cysts removed. Hysterectomy at 28. Appendix at 16, Gall bladder removal at 38. which all made me very sick. Now that I'm 45, I can say I have never been so I'll. About 4 years ago, I went to the ER, as I was weak and very ill. Blood Tests confirmed mono, but I was told I had a node on my Thyroid which was very small and I shouldn't be concerned, most people have these and are fine. I was also told I had Deginerative disc disease at the same time. The Thyroid node was very concerning to me, as my mother passed away from her node, her node also metastasized into her lungs. she was scheduled for surgery to remove said node, the morning she passed away.

The surgeon was very happy - PTH fell already during the operation and my calcium was normal when they discharged me. I have since developed pins and needles and have been taking calcium supplement.  The scar itself doesn't bother me at all and I don't need painkillers anymore, which is great. However, I am still very weak and still mostly in bed. Is it normal? Am I expecting too much too soon? Is it to do with calcium maybe falling too low? How many days should it take before I feel strong enough to even look after myself? When should I start to worry? Thanks 5 likes, 88 replies "

I had my thyroid completely removed around this time last year at the age of 19, after suffering from an overactive thyroid due to Grave's disease since I was around 16. For those three years I'd been on varying doses of carbimazole and propranolol because my thyroid would return to normal for a couple of weeks, before relapsing to be even worse than it was before I went into remission. I couldn't take the back and forth anymore, on top of battling the side effects of such a high dosage of carbimazole (eventually 50mg, if I remember correctly). I had gotten into my top choice university, but my grades began to suffer terribly throughout all of this and i had to make the tough decision to 'drop out' temporarily due to illness, and repeat a year. This has been a truly painful journey. I thought it would all be over if I just removed my thyroid altogether...I was told at the time that i was pretty treatment-resistant to the carbimazole, since I kept getting worse whenever the dosage was changed. So I opted for the surgery instead of the radioactive iodine therapy, for fear that I could become overactive again, and potentially have to drop out of uni forever.

You'd think, after 4 years, I'd be more on the ball with this, but I do find the Dermovate use confusing, as I'm particularly aware of what a strong steroid it is.

Sorry in advance for TMI. I think I've probably got VLP & OLP.  For 3-4 months I've felt a bit of itch/irritation when washing down below, but didn't think much of it, and it seemed to improve. I'm 35 and not currently in a sexual relationship. Anyhow, I had a look with a mirror the other day and found two vulval lesions, one each side. One is very small and just inside labia majora, and on the other side its a bigger area, extending from labia minora outwards towards labia majora. Both lesions are kind of lilac/white colour, and I cant see any erosions. GP didn't seem too worried but suggested gynae assessment, and prescribed betamethasone cream. I'm seeing a gynae next week. I was worried about VIN but all smears have been clear, and GP said it might be LP. I've now looked in my mouth and can see white lacy patches inside both cheeks, mainly by my back teeth, but again no erosions and it isn't painful. The vulval lesions aren't sore, although with hindsight it does burn if I pee right after having a shower. The more I read about LP, the more terrified I am! Given the oral lesions, I'm guessing this will be the diagnosis, and I have been going  through a period of stress. I am wondering if it's possible to have a mild or non-erosive form of OLP/VLP? From what I can see, no erosions or loss of structures at the moment. Thanks in advance for any advice or support. Feel so alone and scared! 0 likes, 14 replies "

As per clockwork, I received a letter last month for a MRI scan, which I had.  Yesterday I received a call from the consultant who advised me that the scan came back normal on the area of where the tumour was, however, they noticed a abnormality of 8mm on my parotid. What does an abnormality actually mean?  He could give me no more information and said I would receive a letter for a ultrasound and fine needle aspiration biopsy appointment shortly. I pressed for more information and he said as he wasn't a specialist in this field, he couldn't comment on what the scan had found, and I would have an appointment with a specialist in the next few weeks. The only thing he did say is that it's good that it's only 8mm and it's been caught before it could grow. I am sick with worry, I have been going crazy on Google and am thinking the absolute worst. Is it a tumour? Is it a stone? Is it cancerous? I haven't slept or ate as I'm sick with worry, I don't know how to tell my parents or wife. I feel fine and can't feel any lumps around my jaw area. Has anyone had similar experiences? Will I need an operation and chemo? What's the process from here? What actually is an abnormality?If anyone out there can help reassure me and tell me their experiences I would appreciate it tremendously. I start a new job in a few weeks and just feel so anxious. 0 likes, 5 replies "

They kept accumulating in  the gland. I was advised that the whole gland had to be removed because if not The next time I could get cyst in the gland. Also could come back as cancer I did get a 2nd opinion before surgery. I did alot research on the surgery. My doctor in S.I was the only Doctor in New York that inserts a drain. The only other Place that does that is the U.K.  I read alot of post on forums of people having alot of problems due to no drain. Well anyway after surgery I had alot of imflamation I went back and forth to my doctor to be checked almost 2 weeks later I knew something was wrong because I still had alot of pain n swelling so I went to the ER and ended up having a bad infection during to the inflammation they said I was in the hospital 4 days on heavy antibiotics and pain med.

I still have pain in my mouth when I eat or drink. and  the pain in my ear is back  once again. My neck is is swollen under my chin still till those 2 stones come out  I strongly recommend to anyone having problems dont wait too long to get the gland removed  I did and ended up with a cyst that burst when my doctor opened me and my vein started bleeding and wouldn't stop which I think made my oxygen level go very low  during surgery. U will have pain after surgery and pain in your ear and pain in the face which is the nerves coming back to life numbness on tour bottom lip which will all go away in time This surgery is a very delicate surgery. Also make sure u go home with pain meds because  will need them .

I do eat bad, I admit that but I figure at 29 and being as active as I am, I should be okay physically at least until I was in my 60s-70s especially since I have really good genes. So about 8-9 days ago I noticed my mouth was feeling a bit dryer than usual. I figured it was just the weather and drank more water/tea/coffee etc.  The first few days it started happening water wasn't quenching my thirst, and I thought that was odd, but I drank coffee a few times and it actually coated my mouth and made my mouth feel wet enough to sleep. I wouldn't say it's gotten too much worse over the last week, but it's started to become an issue in my day to day life, I am constantly thirsty, I'll drink something and then 20-30 seconds later I'll water another drink, today I've already drank almost three 32oz gatorade bottles. I notice my mouth is extremely dry but then whenever I drink/eat something my mouth gets extremely moist as if the glands are being called to action but otherwise my mouth starts to dry up again. What is even weirder is,  most of the time I can produce saliva but it literally does nothing, my mouth still feels dry even when there's tons of saliva in my mouth, the only time my mouth feels really good is when I am eating or drinking. Doing a lot of the cardio I do, at times my mouth would get a little dry normally, but it has nothing gotten to the extreme as the other day, at one point I literally had to stop, I couldn't produce any saliva period, I drank water, took a break for 30 seconds and went back at it. But I've never had that extremely dry sensation before. That same day, I also noticed the top of my mouth was swollen and in slight pain, nothing unbearable. But it was definitely a pain on the top of my mouth, then I slept for 14 hours, I was hoping the dryness would just go away, so I just kept sleeping and hoping, I woke up and the dryness persisted but the top of my mouth is basically healed now, and now I have a new bump, it's on my tongue (which is in the picture) I can't imagine this being diabetes as I am pretty active even though I eat bad, and I'm only 29. I mean it could be? but I know it's not a  , I know it's not Alzheimers, I doubt it's Sjorgen's syndrome as I read it usually attacks women, and above 40.  So unless I'm missing something I'm really narrowing this down to diabetes, thrush(?!) or mouth cancer? but it's progressed so fast, literally from day 1 to day 8 already developing bumps? Anyway some serious advice would help on this to help ease my mind. Some small details that I'd like to add that might help are Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated.

It spread to the other side of my neck/chin, throat, jaw gone, teeth and even what felt to be my ear by the end of it. ¬†I also had discomfort and pain when swallowing. ¬†I have since come to understand that the lingering swelling was caused by the infection. ¬†There was puss coming out of the gland underneath my tongue, which was one clue to the infection.¬† On Monday I went to the ER and then followed up with an ENT specialist. ¬†I was placed on Keflex (antibiotic) and ibprofen, at that point I declined the predisone as I wasn't sure it had done much the last time and it caused horrible side-effects. ¬†I was also instructured to suck on lemon drops, drink lots of water, apply a hot compress and massaged inside/outside of the mouth on the gland. ¬†I did all of these things as religiously as I could. ¬†My plan with the doctor was to regroup in a week after trying these things.¬† Monday night/Tuesday morning I had extreme pain and started to feel a lot of anxiety about feeling this way for an entire week. ¬†I called the doctor Tuesday morning and told her what I just wrote (I was extremely emotional from the pain and lack of sleep). ¬†I decided to try the prenisone again and she wrote a script for pain management. ¬†I will say calling my doctor was a very good decision, if you experiencing worsening of your symtoms, even if it is mostly increased pain, please call your physician and find a better plan of care. ¬†She ordered a CT for early the next week too. ¬† I took the predisone around 2pm this afternoon. ¬†I continued with the others instruction (lemon drops, warm compress, massaging gland, etc). ¬†Pain seemed to get to a more managable level about 4 hours after taking the medication and another dose of ibprofen (600 mg), still a lot of discomfort though.

Had some small discharge amounts of white, but not cottage cheese like. Gyno diagnosed yeast again. -February, still treating for yeast. Tiny itches, sometimes redness. -March, asked about a biopsy for LS, but she seems confident my skin down there looks fine. I've tried Fluconozole, Terconazole, Monistat, Clotrimazole cream, and Clob (when we thought it was dermatitis). Nothing works. I haven't noticed white patches, nor tearing. And the yeast hasn't tested positive in my vagina, just on the labia. My perineum looks slightly shiny, but I haven't noticed changing and my gyno insists I don't need a biopsy yet. Long story short, can you describe your LS itching? Was it slight and inconstant, or constant and major? Should I push for a biopsy? I can't stand to spend another weekend alone and crying, please help! 0 likes, 6 replies "

To start, I am 53 years old now and am officially menopausal. ¬†Over the last 10 years, I've had my one or two GYNs tell me they thought I had LS. ¬†I had lots of burning symptoms, always thought I had an infection, etc. ¬†When I was younger, I used to have noticeable discoloration. ¬†As I got older, that sort of thing seemed to stop. ¬† I've never in my life had any noticeable labia minora so I don't know if they fused/flattened when I was very young or I was born that way. ¬†I always felt I was abnormal in that regard but who knows. As I entered  , the only thing I really noticed was that my clitoral area seemed to be shrinking and less pronounced. ¬†This was really when I was feeling it, not visually--just not as plump as it used to be, but what is? ¬†I never really looked at it. ¬†Upon entering menopause, I actually started to feel better down there because I had much less natural discharge and I think that helped. ¬†My GYN prescribed some Premarin cream and told me to ""use it when I felt like it."" At some point through all of this, I did have a vulvar   which came back negative,although I can't say I have a lot of faith in that biopsy or the pathology. ¬†I just mean to say that I don't know if I have LS or not, but I have a problem. So last week, I noticed a sensation of a slight pinprick occasionally in the clitoral area. ¬†It was extremely minor and with my lifelong irriations, it was barely a blip in my radar. ¬†But after 3 days of it happening, I thought I should investigate. Upon palpation, I felt a hard nodule in my clitoral hood area (prepuce) that goes all the way up to where the labia majora join together at the top. ¬†As you get close to the clitoris, it flattens and feels normal. ¬†The lump does not hurt at all and is rubbery, but the clitoris is what the sensation comes from. On visual examination, the area with the lump is is normal looking. ¬†However, I noticed that I can no longer actually see my clitoris (the hood won't pull back) and below the area, the skin is fused together. ¬†Vaginal opening is normal. ¬† Got into my doctor on Friday and he diagnosed with clitoral agglutination. ¬†Gave me premarin cream to use everyday for two weeks, told me to manually ""work"" the area 2-3 times a day.¬† I am just sick over this. ¬†I didn't even know it was happening. ¬†As for the lump, he doesn't think it's anything and may be due to the clitoral hood not functiong/moving properly so it's swelling. ¬†I can find NOTHING on the net about this sort of thing. I've been reading this site since yesterday. ¬†Read all about the borax stuff, which I may try. ¬†I also have clobetesol from awhile ago that I will use.One side of my clitoral hood is hardened and whitish. I guess I'm looking on de-fusion success stories or something. ¬†I can't stop thinking about this and what it means for me lifelong. Thanks, Christine 1 like, 56 replies "

The good news was that the antinuclear antibody (ANA) and Sedimentation rate (Sed) were normal so no evidence of other AI illnesses which is good and tells me not to look there. That door is closed for now. But,  2 questions, why is the body attacking thyroid tissue? and how is it connected to LS/other stuff?    Back to the drawing board.

I also developed an ulcer on my clitoral hood that looked slightly herpetic however, it was swabbed and negative and I haven't had one since so I was wondering if LS can cause this?

Used cream - terrible reaction left a gash where ""wart"" had been. Wound healed although ""wart"" re appeared and then took on a more flat appearance and began expanding in an oval shape. Back to GUM and more cyrotherapy. This did not really work and was obviously painful so i discontinued and left the area alone as was trying for baby with my wife. More of these areas began to develop on bottom of my glans and also foreskin. I am married and faithful so it was not great to declare warts to my wife. August 2019 I notice blisters inside my cheeks burst and leave white lacey patterns. Trip to dentist who says he thinks it is oral Lichen Planus. Biopsy was ordered (due at Dental hospital April 2020) athough surely will be pushed back due to current pandemic. At the time i made no colleration between the Oral LP and my penis situation.. Then at an appt with dermatologist to asses a rash on my ankle (discoid eczema apparently) the dermatologist looked inside my mouth and confirmed oral lp. Asked him to look at penis and he immediately confirmed it was not a wart but was also lichen planus. He then examined my fingernails and said i have early stages of LP in my nails too. Dermatology in UK is so busy i had 5 mins and was basically rushed out and told my GP would prescribe some dermovate cream for my penis, no follow up given with dermatologist. Only when i got out did I research penile lichen planus and began to freak..... Not sure whether i have penile lichen planus or lichen sclerosus or whether lichen sclerosus is just the name for penile lichen planus???? I have as far as i know at the moment no involvement of the meatus or tip of my glans....   But have some urinary symptons frequent urination, occasional weak flow and some discomfort after passing urine etc which i have had on and off for years. Do i have lichen Sclerosus? Are these conditions the same? I feel like no one is interested in following up with me or taking time to even review my situation. NB Just stared Dermovate today. NB. October 2018 I find out my mum has lung cancer, then discoid eczema and penile LP starts Nov/Dec 2018. Then July 2019 My wife has miscarriage while my mum is in hospital with Pneumonia.. August 2019 the oral LP appears.... Then Feb 2020 we get Advised my mum is terminal with months to live potentially. March 2020 more eczema appears on leg.   Before all this I had no noticeable symptoms of Eczema or Lichen Planus.... Surely the above is no co-incidence though. Also been getting hoarse and Occasional sore throat could i have it in throat too. Any opinions advice much appreciated ! 1 like, 0 replies "

481,C0085166,Bacterial Vaginosis,C0030193,Pain,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-journey-through-ls-732244,MY JOURNEY THROUGH LS,"My journey through LS I was diagnosed with LS about 2 and a half years ago. I was scared, horrified and couldn't believe what was going on ""down there"" and what I saw when I examined myself with the magnifying mirror for the first time. My vulva area was ulcerated and raw, the mucous membrane all over was full of white spots, my labia minora were white and dry and chapped and with hard skin, my clit was hidden by a thick white hood and I had lost definition through fusing of everything and the vaginal entrance was very small. The skin in these areas was very thin, and the entire area was very pale, thin and lifeless. The LS was in a figure 8 and had also affect the anal area as well.  A few days before this I started feeling a rough hard area during showering and it became incredibly itchy. I thought it was thrush and so treated it with thrush cream which eased the itch. The GP told me it was LS and simply prescribed some steroid cream and sent me on my way. I saw a gynae  who also just told me to use the steroid cream and come back for a regular annual visit. I felt as if I was leper as no one wanted to know or help me with my problem and they weren‚Äôt very interested at all. I was desperate. The doctor admitted that she didn't want to talk about it because she really did not know much about it. I began researching as I realised that I had to help myself to recover and beat this thing. The more I researched I realised that my body was lacking certain vitamins, minerals and trace elements for it to function properly. I also found an Holistic Medical Health Practitioner who I consulted along with his referred gynae who worked hand in hand to help me. I have reversed 95% of the labial fusing, my vaginal entrance and vulva area are looking very healthy and my clitoral hood is soft and pink and very healthy looking and I have no white spots, or shiny white membrane, no pain or itching. Everything is looking a lovely pinky, healthy and like new! The regular steps I take to maintain myself are: 1.Refer to Nancy-K-B's blogs regarding Vitamins and Minerals and trace element supplement and also her detoxing of the body. I researched and found similar articles and discovered that, as soon as I started taking those listed, my body started healing. I also take a spoon of Brewer's Yeast powder everyday with my food. It‚Äôs a rich natural source of VitaminB‚Äôs. 2.Emuaid First Aid Ointment ""Modern Homeopathic Medicine"" is the most wonderful ointment - thank God I discovered this. Initially I used it every morning, every evening and everytime I went to the toilet. I apply it with the tip of a cotton bud (so go through heaps of cotton buds as you only ever dip the tip in the jar once so the ointment remains sterile).  I like to use the cotton buds that have a paddle shape the one end and a pointy tip on the other end. Emuaid is very effective for treating Bacterial Vaginosis, Lichen Sclerosis, Lichen Nitidus, Lichen Planus and numerous other problems. It works, and works quickly to relieve symptoms and to heal. Once my ulcers had closed and healed along with the other areas I slowly and gradually with the pointy cotton bud tip started to apply pressure to regain my contouring and unfuse the labial skin and gradually stretched the cliteral hood skin. I spend a lot of time rubbing the Emuaid in to the entire area so it can soak deep into the skin layers to allow healing.As the areas healed I continued with the pointy end of the cotton bud applying pressure to stretch and infuse the skin. It all looks great now. 3.I use Eleuphrat 0.05% ointment (steroid) after applying the Emuaid - it mixes well with the Emuaid ointment which I believe helps it to penetrate deeper into the dermal layers of the affected areas. This steroid ointment is very strong and quite horrid so I only use a very small amount morning and night. Initially the gynae instructed me to use it morning and night for I would say at lease about  the first 9 months. Now I only use the steroid ointment about 2 or 3 nights a week. I only wear cotton underwear. I wear the cotton undies at night also as I figured that the warmth will assist the ointments to penetrate deeper into the dermal layers. 4.I am 63 years old so am post menopausal. I also had vaginal atrophy. I was prescribed Ovestin hormonal cream to apply 3 times a week - so I use it Monday, Wednesday and Friday nights. When I use this cream I use Eleuphrat 0.05% cream as it mixes well with the Ovestin. I allow the Emuaid to soak in for a while first before using the Ovestin and Eleuphrat cream. I also apply some Ovestin and the Eleuphrat cream on the outer areas of the vagina, labia, cliteros, hood, the anus, and the area between the anus and vulva. 5.The opening to my vagina had become very small. As the skin areas healed and softened with the Eumaid and Eleuphrat  I started gently to stretch it to dilate it. I used various size keggels - firstly starting with the smallest size and as the skin stretched I used larger sized keggels. I also do vaginal exercises with the keggels to strengthen the vaginal wall and also pelvic floor.  It is important also that the hormones and blood flow reach these areas to keep them healthy, as it would at the time of climaxing. Orgasms are an important part of women‚Äôs vaginal health maintenance. I hope I have been able to help you by sharing my experience of this LS journey with you and wish you well with your road to recovery. It is possible with determination and persistence. Good Luck.

I was scared, horrified and couldn't believe what was going on ""down there"" and what I saw when I examined myself with the magnifying mirror for the first time. My vulva area was ulcerated and raw, the mucous membrane all over was full of white spots, my labia minora were white and dry and chapped and with hard skin, my clit was hidden by a thick white hood and I had lost definition through fusing of everything and the vaginal entrance was very small. The skin in these areas was very thin, and the entire area was very pale, thin and lifeless. The LS was in a figure 8 and had also affect the anal area as well.  A few days before this I started feeling a rough hard area during showering and it became incredibly itchy. I thought it was thrush and so treated it with thrush cream which eased the itch. The GP told me it was LS and simply prescribed some steroid cream and sent me on my way. I saw a gynae  who also just told me to use the steroid cream and come back for a regular annual visit. I felt as if I was leper as no one wanted to know or help me with my problem and they weren‚Äôt very interested at all. I was desperate. The doctor admitted that she didn't want to talk about it because she really did not know much about it. I began researching as I realised that I had to help myself to recover and beat this thing. The more I researched I realised that my body was lacking certain vitamins, minerals and trace elements for it to function properly. I also found an Holistic Medical Health Practitioner who I consulted along with his referred gynae who worked hand in hand to help me.

A few days before this I started feeling a rough hard area during showering and it became incredibly itchy. I thought it was thrush and so treated it with thrush cream which eased the itch. The GP told me it was LS and simply prescribed some steroid cream and sent me on my way. I saw a gynae  who also just told me to use the steroid cream and come back for a regular annual visit. I felt as if I was leper as no one wanted to know or help me with my problem and they weren‚Äôt very interested at all. I was desperate. The doctor admitted that she didn't want to talk about it because she really did not know much about it. I began researching as I realised that I had to help myself to recover and beat this thing. The more I researched I realised that my body was lacking certain vitamins, minerals and trace elements for it to function properly. I also found an Holistic Medical Health Practitioner who I consulted along with his referred gynae who worked hand in hand to help me. I have reversed 95% of the labial fusing, my vaginal entrance and vulva area are looking very healthy and my clitoral hood is soft and pink and very healthy looking and I have no white spots, or shiny white membrane, no pain or itching. Everything is looking a lovely pinky, healthy and like new! The regular steps I take to maintain myself are: 1.Refer to Nancy-K-B's blogs regarding Vitamins and Minerals and trace element supplement and also her detoxing of the body. I researched and found similar articles and discovered that, as soon as I started taking those listed, my body started healing. I also take a spoon of Brewer's Yeast powder everyday with my food. It‚Äôs a rich natural source of VitaminB‚Äôs. 2.Emuaid First Aid Ointment ""Modern Homeopathic Medicine"" is the most wonderful ointment - thank God I discovered this. Initially I used it every morning, every evening and everytime I went to the toilet. I apply it with the tip of a cotton bud (so go through heaps of cotton buds as you only ever dip the tip in the jar once so the ointment remains sterile).  I like to use the cotton buds that have a paddle shape the one end and a pointy tip on the other end. Emuaid is very effective for treating Bacterial Vaginosis, Lichen Sclerosis, Lichen Nitidus, Lichen Planus and numerous other problems. It works, and works quickly to relieve symptoms and to heal. Once my ulcers had closed and healed along with the other areas I slowly and gradually with the pointy cotton bud tip started to apply pressure to regain my contouring and unfuse the labial skin and gradually stretched the cliteral hood skin. I spend a lot of time rubbing the Emuaid in to the entire area so it can soak deep into the skin layers to allow healing.As the areas healed I continued with the pointy end of the cotton bud applying pressure to stretch and infuse the skin. It all looks great now. 3.I use Eleuphrat 0.05% ointment (steroid) after applying the Emuaid - it mixes well with the Emuaid ointment which I believe helps it to penetrate deeper into the dermal layers of the affected areas. This steroid ointment is very strong and quite horrid so I only use a very small amount morning and night. Initially the gynae instructed me to use it morning and night for I would say at lease about  the first 9 months. Now I only use the steroid ointment about 2 or 3 nights a week. I only wear cotton underwear. I wear the cotton undies at night also as I figured that the warmth will assist the ointments to penetrate deeper into the dermal layers. 4.I am 63 years old so am post menopausal. I also had vaginal atrophy. I was prescribed Ovestin hormonal cream to apply 3 times a week - so I use it Monday, Wednesday and Friday nights. When I use this cream I use Eleuphrat 0.05% cream as it mixes well with the Ovestin. I allow the Emuaid to soak in for a while first before using the Ovestin and Eleuphrat cream. I also apply some Ovestin and the Eleuphrat cream on the outer areas of the vagina, labia, cliteros, hood, the anus, and the area between the anus and vulva. 5.The opening to my vagina had become very small. As the skin areas healed and softened with the Eumaid and Eleuphrat  I started gently to stretch it to dilate it. I used various size keggels - firstly starting with the smallest size and as the skin stretched I used larger sized keggels. I also do vaginal exercises with the keggels to strengthen the vaginal wall and also pelvic floor.  It is important also that the hormones and blood flow reach these areas to keep them healthy, as it would at the time of climaxing. Orgasms are an important part of women‚Äôs vaginal health maintenance. I hope I have been able to help you by sharing my experience of this LS journey with you and wish you well with your road to recovery. It is possible with determination and persistence. Good Luck.

My GYNO said it looks like LS. It started off with small cuts with my husband and then he left for work for Basic Training for 2 months and I became itchy/dry/ burning, thats when i saw my gyno, i have used the steroid cream and coconut oil. I thought i was fine until i saw my husband recently and the pain was so intense/painful, i cried and we had to stop. I was convinced it was a yeast infection so i took a pill and the pain went away but im afraid when i see him again that will happen. These are recent pictures about one month after seeing my husband. I use steroid cream and coconut oil and it helps so so much. A couple days ago I pulled the skin down there and it tore. It is so thin. I invested in lube and Im going to try it next time i see him. i am only 19  and i cant live like this forever. We were together 2 years and i recently started having these symptoms 6 months ago.  IS this LS? the pink skin use to be WAY worse and its covered in coconut oil in the pictures. someone give me some hope! 0 likes, 6 replies "

I decided not to take anymore as those feeling made me extremely anxious. at around 11pm i took 1 ibuprofen and went to sleep. however today iI still have the shakes a d my hearts still beating fast (not sure if its anxiety from overthinking everything) I've had loose-ish stools and a tiny bit of lower abdominal pain (not sure if that could be linked in with the usual cramps i have from the coil). Im on rivaroxiban blood thinners, just thought id mention as that can be an important factor too. 0 likes, 0 replies "

So let me start with day one. In mid May, I got a really bad cramp in the left side of my abdomen below the rib cage. The cramp was so bad that I was basically in bed rest for the rest of the night, unable to get up from my bed. I didn't think anything of it so I decided to sleep it off. The next morning that same area felt like it had a really bad bruise. Days went by and this bruise feeling did not go away. After a week in a half of no improvements I became worried. The pain was fluctuating between soreness, burning sensations, and sharp pains. I did want to point out that this pain would go away when I was active or standing up. Also, the pain was more intense in the evenings after getting home from work (I have a desk job btw). It was when I was sitting down that the pain would bother me. At first I thought it was kidney stones. I started taking supplements to help pass them but after a CT scan (done in beginning of July) everything came out clean. After, I decided to give it some more days since my doctor told me maybe I passed them already or they were too small to see with CT scan. Days went by and nothing was getting better. I went to a new doctor towards the end of July since I felt that my previous doctor was no help and not pursuing other options for this issue I had. The new doctor asked me to get another CT scan done but with Contrast this time and also blood work. Everything came out clean. At his point the doctor said to rule out kidney stones or anything serious. That's when I was sent to a Gastro specialist. Now we are around late August. The specialist was no help either, had no idea what I was talking about when I explained my symptoms. He gave me some medicine to help with stomach acid fluctuation thinking that might be the issue. After weeks of taking the medicine there were no changes. At this point I felt desperate because I felt that I was going nowhere and this pain was lowering my quality of life and making work miserable for me. Towards the end of September the pain for some reason shifted from my abdomen to my back. The next step from the specialist was an endoscopy but I decided to pursue other options since the pain changed and didn't want to pay for an expensive procedure. And I do want to mention that occasionally through those past months I would feel light pain on my back parallel to the area that I was having pain on my front. This time the pain was more on my back than my front. So I decided to go to a Chiropractor to check me out. To my surprise the Chiropractor knew what I was talking about when I explained my symptoms. He told me that the initial cramp came from a muscle that is connected to my abdomen and wraps around to my back which is the reason the pains were parallel to each other. I have gained weight the past 2 years and haven't been much active that could have contributed to this issue.  Anyways, after some adjustments and physical therapy it has been improving! There's no more pain on my front and now it's mostly on my back. The intensity and frequency of the pains have gone down. Currently I am still in treatment but finally feel relieved to have answers and to see improvements.  Hopefully anybody going through the same situation finds this thread and can use this information to help themselves. Many doctors won't pursue other means to find a diagnosis so sometimes you just have to take it upon yourself to figure out what is wrong with you.  Good luck!!

I have a high pitched tone in my head all the time and it's annoying. When it first started (about ten years ago) it would be agonizing and torturously loud and would ruch on me the instant I fell asleep, catching me just before I lost conscoiousness, and I would feel stuck inside myself for a second, suffocating, being anihalated by that immense noise, struggling to wake up it felt like drowning but with a sound so loud I wished I was dead. Absolutely terrifying, but when it was that loud it wasn't a tone more a high pitched pulse maybe three pulses per second, like a fast high pitched sledge hammer pounding away on the inside of the head. The first night I couldn't sleep from this I thought I may never sleep again and die a horrible death, passing out into that tortue when I couldn't hold myself awake any longer, I ran from my house and just roamed the streets crying. After some time I came back home, and I managed to fall asleep. That's how it started, but that tone has never gone and it's always been there, it's there right now.The tone doesn't get like that anymore but it does get very loud and pulsing when im in bed or when my eyes are closed sometimes. Has anyone heard of anything like this? Any ideas what it might be? If it may be curable? I don't feel like I'm losing my hearing or anything like that.

I‚Äôve always had some odd aches and pains I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to, they were just kind of annoying to start with.

My left ankle is extremely weak, I sprained it in middle school and it healed but I‚Äôve sprained it multiple times since then, some of the times not going to a doctor. I‚Äôve had ~8 sprains in the past two years alone and that ankle will occasionally buckle while I‚Äôm walking. All of my joints feel stiff, especially on my left side my knee, hip, and ankle will pop frequently. This has been going on about a year and has gotten worse with time. Stretching doesn‚Äôt seem to help. And here‚Äôs where I really started to get concerned about my health. In late July of 2019 i woke up with tingling in my left hand and forearm. I initially ignored it and went to shower, assuming I just slept on it weird. The tingling got worse in the shower and wouldn‚Äôt go away. I ended up going to the student health center on campus where they did an EKG that came back normal and an x-ray of my neck. They still sent me to the ER to be sure it wasn‚Äôt a heart issue and there I was told it was just anxiety despite the tingling now going on for 11 hours and never having anxiety symptoms like that before. I saw the orthopedist on campus to review my neck x-ray and he said my neck didn‚Äôt have a normal C curve and I was probably having some spasms. He also did a quick exam of my back/spine and noticed winging of my left shoulder blade. This prompted him to send me to my go for a neurological referral. My GP did blood work, all was normal except for low vitamin D which I got prescription tablets for, and referred me to a neurologist. The neurologist did a nerve conduction test in both arms and it came back normal. The tingling in my left hand persists on and off through out the day, but nowhere near as severe as the day it onset. For about three months now I have pain in my left hand when I‚Äôm using it and sometimes that pain radiates up my forearm as well as my neck and shoulder, especially when I‚Äôm driving or have to hold my arm out for mire than a couple minutes. I have a pretty constant stiffness and ache in the left side of my neck and my left shoulder. My neck on that side often feels ‚Äúcaught‚Äù and cracks very frequently through out the day. I‚Äôve started experiencing tingling in my right hand on about three occasions this past month. My GP said the tingling was a ‚Äúfreak thing‚Äù despite it still going on and referred me to another orthopedist for what she believes to be carpal tunnel syndrome in my left hand, but I feel like it‚Äôs more than just that. I feel like my pain and concerns aren‚Äôt being taken seriously due to my anxiety and I don‚Äôt know what to do next. What could this be? Could it just be anxiety? Thanks 0 likes, 1 reply "

Firstly it started as pain in my upper abdominal area (in my epigastrium to be more specific) and sometimes it feels like a burning sensation and then at the same time i was experiencing mid back pain and lower back pain. Then at times I have sharp sudden pains in my stomach and my stomach feels tender to touch. It feels full and as if something is inside pushing against everything. my upper abdominal pain feels as if something heavy has been places there and at times i have chest pains (left side) with the same heavy feeling.  I also have pain under my ribs and general discomfort in my flank area. I am so sorry this is a long message but i am so so scared that i have something sinister going on in my body. i know the chances of someone as young as me getting pancreatic cancer are very slim but i have researched and seen it is possible!!

Sorry to post again but I'm in such a bad place right now. I've written a post about my bowel movements, being paler, yellow and suffering with diarrhoea for months. I have Ibs so the doctors say it's that. I went back to the doctors on Thursday as on Wednesday night we ate out and I had a fatty meal of chips, gammon, fried egg and peas. The next morning I passed a fatty stool that did sink but lots of big air bubbles came from it. It was pale too. It didn't smell bad. I totally freaked out. I've had stools that float but never bubbles. Then I had an even softer stool an hour after again with bubbles. I felt sick too. My anxiety went into over drive and since then I can't think straight. The doctor said she didn't know what the bubbles are. She said I've not lost weight so not to worry!! I've only started with the floating stools the past couple of weeks. Before then  if not diarrhoea they were pale. I had a blood test being with an A to test my pancreas. Get the results hopefully Monday. I'm already scared about that. I did another stool test to check for inflammation. I asked if they could test the fat in the stool and she said no!!! She said if the bloods come back OK maybe have the camera up the bottom! Sorry can't remember what it's called. Pain wise I have pains all over the abdomen. But lately I've been getting pain under my left rib shooting  through to my back. But I can also get that on the right side too. I get pains in my hips and pelvis too. It's all so random. I also get pain in the upper back in my shoulder blades. I do have reflux too. My appetite before Thursday was good. I had no pain after  eating the fatty meal and no tummy pain. Just the fatty stool the next day. My stool  issues seem to be every morning. The only time I get relief is in the night! I can wake slightly and my tummy is calm. Within a minute of waking fully in the morning my stomach starts gurgling, I get gas pains and pass wind, I feel a little sick then I'll have to go the loo. I never normally go the loo after my tea. It makes no sense to me. I seem to be full of wind from the minute I wake up. My bowels movements are so random. I can have a normal colour stool then diarrhoea an hour after or a lighter stool. The only niggly  pain I've been getting lately is mid back behind my stomach. Some pains I get are relieved when my stomach churns and feels like a bubble has popped in my stomach.

Sorry to post again but I'm in such a bad place right now. I've written a post about my bowel movements, being paler, yellow and suffering with diarrhoea for months. I have Ibs so the doctors say it's that. I went back to the doctors on Thursday as on Wednesday night we ate out and I had a fatty meal of chips, gammon, fried egg and peas. The next morning I passed a fatty stool that did sink but lots of big air bubbles came from it. It was pale too. It didn't smell bad. I totally freaked out. I've had stools that float but never bubbles. Then I had an even softer stool an hour after again with bubbles. I felt sick too. My anxiety went into over drive and since then I can't think straight. The doctor said she didn't know what the bubbles are. She said I've not lost weight so not to worry!! I've only started with the floating stools the past couple of weeks. Before then  if not diarrhoea they were pale. I had a blood test being with an A to test my pancreas. Get the results hopefully Monday. I'm already scared about that. I did another stool test to check for inflammation. I asked if they could test the fat in the stool and she said no!!! She said if the bloods come back OK maybe have the camera up the bottom! Sorry can't remember what it's called. Pain wise I have pains all over the abdomen. But lately I've been getting pain under my left rib shooting  through to my back. But I can also get that on the right side too. I get pains in my hips and pelvis too. It's all so random. I also get pain in the upper back in my shoulder blades. I do have reflux too. My appetite before Thursday was good. I had no pain after  eating the fatty meal and no tummy pain. Just the fatty stool the next day. My stool  issues seem to be every morning. The only time I get relief is in the night! I can wake slightly and my tummy is calm. Within a minute of waking fully in the morning my stomach starts gurgling, I get gas pains and pass wind, I feel a little sick then I'll have to go the loo. I never normally go the loo after my tea. It makes no sense to me. I seem to be full of wind from the minute I wake up. My bowels movements are so random. I can have a normal colour stool then diarrhoea an hour after or a lighter stool.

I'm coming here to seek advice on my next step. In December I was hospitalized for 5 days. I went in with stomach and back pain and while they took tests, they noticed my Lipase levels were elevated. They also found out I tested positive for H Pylori. I had many tests done, such as CT Scan, ultrasound, HIDA scan, upper endoscopy, urine tests and stool tests. I currently am taking the H Pylori treatment right now. I'm scared however that I do have pancreatic cancer and they missed it. I feel as though because I'm 23 years old they are over looking me. My stomach pain is in the upper middle and upper left area and still hurts. My back hurts when I lay on it in the middle of my spine. My GI dr promises me this is not pancreatic cancer but I cannot help but still worry. I've been having bowel issues, and lots of pain and anxiety. Do I go back to hospital to run more tests again or just trust what he says? I know I am young but and it is very rare but am starting to believe it is possible. 0 likes, 4 replies "

Lying down helped but not on my back as it felt like something was pulling at my ribs. Was put on lanzoprapole and felt not too bad. But after a small holiday, lots of food, moderate alcohol it niggled away but not so bad as first time and recently it's flared up horribly. ¬†I had one day I had to stay in bed as the pain went all round lower left side and stabbing pain in the back. If I sneezed it was very very painful. I've got a gastroenterologist appt in over a week so should find out more but wondered if anyone else has had similar symptoms? I've no idea if this is related to pancreas but I have had multiple doses of   that I've discovered can cause this in pancreas.

Or is it something else? Struggling to find answers,"Hi everyone- like a lot of you on the forum, I am at my witts end trying to figure out what ailment and/or disease I have. To be brief, my symptoms started in August of 2014 when I started to notice upper abdominal pain and tenderness. This was on a weekend where yes, I had been consuming alcohol. I am a healthy 28 year old female and in my younger 20s I did drink more than is recommended. On the onset of symptoms, I went to a doctor who prescribed an anti-acid. I noticed over the next few months my symptoms came and went and I honestly thought nothing of it. I started noticing a change in my bowel movements in October/November (they started to become more loose, float and were more volumous). I have been into see multiple GI specialists who have run a million tests. I've had basic labs done (liver function tests, lipase/amylase, basic metabolic panel, IgA/IgG- celiac seriologies, Vitamin D/B12, Iron studies-- all came back good), an MRCP w/secretin (good), RUQ (good), EGD/EUS (good), fecal elastase > 500 (good)..... but heres he kicker.. a 9g fecal fat (normal is under 7g) with a fecal weight of ~470g (200g of stool is normal output from what I have read). To my knowledge there are only a few diseases that cause a high stool fat and CP is one of them.¬† My question is.. do any of you experience high fat stools and normal imaging? The doctors seem to think this is all IBS but from what I've read IBS ¬†does not cause high fecal fat.¬† I am so desperate for answers... I wish they would just find what is causing my discomfort and abnormal stools-- even if that meant a diagnosis of CP.¬† Please help if any of you can shed some light here!!!!¬† 1 like, 54 replies "

It started with tingling of my lips which spread to the right side of my face. I thought I was allergic to my new lipstick so didn't worry too much. The next morning my face felt numb and my mouth was a bit droopy and felt like when you go to the dentist and the injection is wearing off. Within half an hour my face had dropped so my daughter took me to a Walk in Clinic who diagnosed Bell's Palsy. I wasn't given advise on how to treat it, just told it would go in time. I brought some eye drops the next day as my eye was hurting but still didn't realise what was going to happen.  By Tues I felt really worried as my face had dropped much more, my speech was slurred, I couldn't pronounce words starting with B, P or F. I kept biting my cheek, couldn't eat or drink properly and had such nerve pain around my ear and in my cheek area that I wanted to cry. I went to the doctors who gave me steriods for 5 days and told me it would be gone in a week and to put eye drops in. Oh and if I got pain in my eye to go to hospital. That was all the advise I got from them. What sort of pain did they mean? My eye hurt so much sometimes and is the most worrying aspect of this whole experience. The wind and sun hurts my eye so I wear sunglasses every time I go out. I went to a supermarket and the air conditioning was so cold and strong that I had to leave as it dryed my eye out and caused much discomfort.  I went to Boots chemist who were very helpful. They advised intensive tear protective eye drops for the day (every hour), Lacri-Lube eye ointment for night time and tape to keep my eye closed. Plus pain killers for the nerve pain. It was a real challenge at night to keep my eye closed as the tape wouldn't stick properly because of the ointment. I even tried swimming goggles which did help but felt uncomfortable round my head. In the third week the swelling has gone down and my face is nearly back to normal. It only notices when I smile as my mouth is still droopy and my eye still doesn't shut properly. I still get nerve pain around my ear specially at night time. I find I can't sleep on my right side either as this makes me feel a bit dizzy and aches quite a bit.

I have had this ongoing pain on the BP side from the cheek to above the eyebrow, especially when I push on these areas. Most of the pain when I push or massage is right above the left temple area, then not as bad down the cheek, same side. It also seems as though the more Stressed I get the more pain i get! My eye on that side looks normal when looking in the mirror, but actually feels partially closed (muscle weakness I think) but again it looks ok. Does anyone have residual effects like this a year or two after the BP? It took me longer than most to heal up to the 70% and dragged on for months. maybe I have permanent nerve damage in those areas? Been doing the massages and taking certain supplements that I read about online for BP along with Vitamin B12. Then I got BP again last August, but healed a lot quicker overall. The only lingering problem on that one was my right eye, it got so Raw and had to see an eye doctor and he said the cornea was mildly scraped. gave me an antibiotic ointment and healed in 2 weeks. Did not get this problem this bad with the other side mentioned above! I did use lubricating eye drops constantly and patch both times as well. Don't seem to have no residual effects on this side only except it waters once in a while. Both times I got the BP, and know it's from stress because both times I had loved ones die in my family. Any help and thoughts about my first episode would help if you may still have the lingering problems. Thank You!¬† 0 likes, 6 replies "

Two weeks ago I started to get a tingling sensation in my mouth on the right side, didn't think much of it but the next morning woke up and the right side of my face between my upper lip and eye was tingly and numb. My face looks normal overall, my  right eye doesn't blink and  you can see my mouth doesn't move properly if you really look but otherwise can't tell so left it for a few hours.  I'd also had a headache on that side for a few days also at the back (top of my neck/bottom of my head).  Eventually called 111 (mainly because I'd previously had a DVT and pulmonary embolism - caused by being on the pill, I was 31/32 at the time - so thought might be linked) and was admitted to the stroke unit as upon testing me they found my arm and leg were also weak, which I hadn't really noticed but could tell they were when they were doing the tests. I was also getting double vision and dizziness, and feeling like the room was spinning when I would close my eyes.  Had a CT scan which showed no bleed, also had an MRI which showed a small lesion on the left frontal lobe but was told this wouldn't cause what I was having so not to worry about it. Was eventually seen by a neurologist at around 11pm on the ward and he diagnosed Bell's palsy. I asked about the arm and leg weakness and he said they didn't seem weak anymore so could have been a migraine (never had one before). I was put on 60mg steroids for 5 days, with tapering off for a further 5 days.  I still have double vision, it comes and goes but I get it several times every day, also had spots in my vision a couple of times and a feeling like there is 'cloudiness' or blurriness, like I'm looking at things through a filter on my right eye. Got new tingling in my mouth and in my bottom lip and lower jaw starting on two days after I commenced steroids, has come and gone in severity (had it all day this Weds for example) along with intermittent numbness.

One more thing that may be totally unrelated, I did have a very intense pain in my eye on the left side (opposite side to my current symptoms, but same side as the lesion) for 4 days in the week leading up to this all happening. The neurologist did ask if I had had any eye pain and I said no as was only thinking of the right side but realised the next morning I maybe should have mentioned it.

After doing some   tests on myself I was confident I had Bell's Palsy. I went to hospital and was prescribed the typical treatment of  .  3 weeks later and I had full control of my face again. However I know that being able to move my face did not mean I had fully recovered. Recovery Recovery from Bell's Palsy can take months, depending on the severity of the nerve damage. My full recovery took 7 weeks (relatively fast) I know people who have taken 2 months to regain movement. After you regain movement there are a few things you can do to speed up the recovery process.  Apply a fairly warm compress to the effected side, focus on the area behind your ear and side of the face. Use gentle massage to stimulate the nerves. Reoccurring attacks are more likely during the recovery process so be sure to stay on the prescribed treatment until you have regained movement for at least 2 weeks.  Residual effects For those who have had Bell's Palsy the aftereffects can be mild to severe. In most cases the common problems that follow are twitching and localised weakness  (this may come and go) in some cases you may get synkinesis where you involuntary move one part of you face whil meaning to move another foe example, when you smile your eyebrow may move.  Some may get   towards bell's in a way that any twitching or weakness will depress and put the sufferer into a panic, calling for a doctor immediately.  Rest assured that Bell's Palsy is very common and the chance of a reoccurrence is slim, most sufferers will have to deal with Palsy once and only once however if there is going to be a  reoccurrence most will get the next attack in 5-10 years of the first. You can also experience  phantom Palsy  (not medically named) where past sufferers will cause weakness in the face due to constantly moving it to check if the illness has returned. 1 like, 41 replies "

I was getting these weird migraines on the left side of my head in the temple region for like a month before it happened. A few days before it started, I noticed I couldn't open my mouth all the way. Then I was eating soup and it tasted like I had burned my tongue really bad. Then my face started twitching on the left side EVERYWHERE. like my eyebrow, my nose, my lips, my chin, my cheek. Then I woke up on march 26th and couldn't keep water in my mouth while brushing my teeth on the left side.  I went to the er and they diagnosed me with Bell's palsy. They told me it was a mild case, but it just hadn't actually set in all the way yet. They gave me the anti virals and prednisone. They only gave me 20 mg prednisone that I took for 4 days only. Idk if they only gave me this much because of my weight (I weigh 140) or because they thought it was a mild case.  when I was reading online I saw ppl taking way higher doses for longer periods of time. Anyway it set all the way in and I could still close my eye a little bit it wasn't just open like some other ppl. I could still smile a little. But then it seemed like things were getting worse and I couldn't smile anymore at all.  I had a little droop. And instead of my eye being dry it just waters all day. I asked my doctor and he said steroids aren't good for you and they can do harm to other parts of your body. He was pretty much useless. So 3 weeks went by and I still wasn't getting any improvement. The taste in my toungue was coming back and it stopped hurting so bad. (At first I had shooting pains in my head and on the left side of my face). My hearing was hyper sensitive also and that went away too.  I still wasn't getting any movement and was getting discouraged because I seen some ppl recover in 3 to 4 weeks.  I saw some ppl did acupuncture and it worked for them so I decided to give that a try at 3 weeks. I hadn't been to a neurologist yet because I couldn't get an appointment soon enough the one my insurance covered was all booked up.  I did 6 sessions of acupuncture, with 3 regular sessions with just putting the needle in my face, and then 3 with electrostim. It seemed the acupuncture was working because I got some movement back in my cheek to where I could move part of my cheek by myself, and I was also getting twitching in some other places. I finally got a hold of a neurologist around 6 weeks and he told me there's no data on acupuncture working so I stopped going. By six weeks I had gained movement back in my neck, I could move my chin a little, I can raise my eyebrow a little, and I could move my ear... at 8 weeks now I can move the corner of my mouth just a little like its trying to smile. I also still have some twitching that goes on on my Bell's palsy side every now and then. But also, when I look in the mirror and try and smile and see what movements are coming back, my muscles feel kind of tight. Not when my face is at rest, but when I try and smile. I can see some other areas twitching in my cheek when I try to smile, like it's trying to work but it's to weak or something. My fear is that the electro stim and acupuncture made things worse and that's why It feels tight like that when I try to smile. Also when I move my lips a certain way or when I put hot water on my face I can feel my lips like pull upward on that side and there's a crease in my cheek like as if I'm smirking a little but I'm not. It's weird and only happens for a little Bit of time then goes back to normal. What is this? Also I can still only move that one part of my cheek and the the crease that comes when you smile still isn't moving yet... is this normal? I'm going to see my neurologist again on Thursday but I am a major worry wart and I keep worrying I made this worse by doing acupuncture and the electro Stim. Am i recovering okay or is something wrong? I also now get some headache and face pain on that side again but it's not as bad as it was when I first got it. I am 24 years old and my job has everything to do with how you look and is very competitive so I haven't been at work for 2 months. Just been staying home. I will admit I have been fighting with my significant other way more but than ever before and probably am more stressed than I should be. I also smoke weed sometimes to sleep and noticed that sometimes when I smoke I get more twitching on that side. Is twitching good? Because my face was twitching when it started, so don't know if it is it seems like it is good though because for like 3 weeks I had no twitching no movement at all on that side of my face. I hate this so much I'm so sad because I loved my smile before and I am a very pretty girl. I feel I've lost my face and I'm praying it will come back.... is muscle tightness when trying to move that side normal or is this a sign of synkinesis? I am so scared and keep crying I just want someone who's had this and recovered to let me know I'm recovering the right way? I also take b12, zinc, magnesium, multi vitamins and b6.

I was getting these weird migraines on the left side of my head in the temple region for like a month before it happened. A few days before it started, I noticed I couldn't open my mouth all the way. Then I was eating soup and it tasted like I had burned my tongue really bad. Then my face started twitching on the left side EVERYWHERE. like my eyebrow, my nose, my lips, my chin, my cheek. Then I woke up on march 26th and couldn't keep water in my mouth while brushing my teeth on the left side.  I went to the er and they diagnosed me with Bell's palsy. They told me it was a mild case, but it just hadn't actually set in all the way yet. They gave me the anti virals and prednisone. They only gave me 20 mg prednisone that I took for 4 days only. Idk if they only gave me this much because of my weight (I weigh 140) or because they thought it was a mild case.  when I was reading online I saw ppl taking way higher doses for longer periods of time. Anyway it set all the way in and I could still close my eye a little bit it wasn't just open like some other ppl. I could still smile a little. But then it seemed like things were getting worse and I couldn't smile anymore at all.  I had a little droop. And instead of my eye being dry it just waters all day. I asked my doctor and he said steroids aren't good for you and they can do harm to other parts of your body. He was pretty much useless. So 3 weeks went by and I still wasn't getting any improvement. The taste in my toungue was coming back and it stopped hurting so bad. (At first I had shooting pains in my head and on the left side of my face). My hearing was hyper sensitive also and that went away too.  I still wasn't getting any movement and was getting discouraged because I seen some ppl recover in 3 to 4 weeks.  I saw some ppl did acupuncture and it worked for them so I decided to give that a try at 3 weeks. I hadn't been to a neurologist yet because I couldn't get an appointment soon enough the one my insurance covered was all booked up.  I did 6 sessions of acupuncture, with 3 regular sessions with just putting the needle in my face, and then 3 with electrostim. It seemed the acupuncture was working because I got some movement back in my cheek to where I could move part of my cheek by myself, and I was also getting twitching in some other places. I finally got a hold of a neurologist around 6 weeks and he told me there's no data on acupuncture working so I stopped going. By six weeks I had gained movement back in my neck, I could move my chin a little, I can raise my eyebrow a little, and I could move my ear... at 8 weeks now I can move the corner of my mouth just a little like its trying to smile. I also still have some twitching that goes on on my Bell's palsy side every now and then. But also, when I look in the mirror and try and smile and see what movements are coming back, my muscles feel kind of tight. Not when my face is at rest, but when I try and smile. I can see some other areas twitching in my cheek when I try to smile, like it's trying to work but it's to weak or something. My fear is that the electro stim and acupuncture made things worse and that's why It feels tight like that when I try to smile. Also when I move my lips a certain way or when I put hot water on my face I can feel my lips like pull upward on that side and there's a crease in my cheek like as if I'm smirking a little but I'm not. It's weird and only happens for a little Bit of time then goes back to normal. What is this? Also I can still only move that one part of my cheek and the the crease that comes when you smile still isn't moving yet... is this normal? I'm going to see my neurologist again on Thursday but I am a major worry wart and I keep worrying I made this worse by doing acupuncture and the electro Stim. Am i recovering okay or is something wrong? I also now get some headache and face pain on that side again but it's not as bad as it was when I first got it. I am 24 years old and my job has everything to do with how you look and is very competitive so I haven't been at work for 2 months. Just been staying home. I will admit I have been fighting with my significant other way more but than ever before and probably am more stressed than I should be. I also smoke weed sometimes to sleep and noticed that sometimes when I smoke I get more twitching on that side. Is twitching good? Because my face was twitching when it started, so don't know if it is it seems like it is good though because for like 3 weeks I had no twitching no movement at all on that side of my face. I hate this so much I'm so sad because I loved my smile before and I am a very pretty girl. I feel I've lost my face and I'm praying it will come back.... is muscle tightness when trying to move that side normal or is this a sign of synkinesis?

I'm uncut and under the foreskin on the left side only, the skin close to the frenulum is a bit red. It never goes away and is a bit brighter after masturbating (I used to do it without lube before it appeared, now I'm not doing that anymore) or even just when waking up in the morning. Back in 2018 I've tried anti fungal cream for a few weeks but it hasn't changed anything, I've also tested negative for sexually transmitted diseases.

So to start, my penis glans did not look smooth since i was circumcized at about 11, now im 25, also you can notice on picture some weird bump on foreskin, this is from   the dr said ""it should smooth out with time"" which didnt but its ok now. My main target was always trying to get the ""uncircumcised"" look of glans which is the nice healthy looking smooth and 1 color. But due to friction i think its really hard to achieve such thing when your glans are out rubbing all around your underwear when you do daily tasks and who knows whats happening when i sleep on my stomach and have errection... Either way, recently i noticed that the tip of my penis (Around urethra) became sort of inflamed? As in a bit red and looking less smoother than other parts which are already not so smooth. It comes and goes, sometimes in mornings it looks more inflamed/bigger and sometimes it looks normal, not sure if its due to some allergy, diet, or friction or something else. It is only mainly visible when flacid, when errected im happy with its look but only when its flacid its not really good looking. No any symptom of pain, or tingling or any other sort of discomfort, maybe i feel really thirsty and my lips are dry but it was many months before that irritation occured so i dont think its related. If i have sexual activity its only with my GF and always with protection. Did anyone had touch with something similar? (Side note, I'm using also recently a rubber seal and shea butter, shea butter for my glans and then i pull foreskin and lock it up with rubber seal which makes it sort of forced foreskin to keep it smoother, it worked tiny bit when i started but now i see this, so not sure if its maybe fungi from keeping it moist ? or some wart or i dont know... thats why im asking for help guys) I would greatly appreciate if anyone could help me.

It first appeared the day after I used a condom so I think I must have had a reaction to the latex or some other substance in the condom. The tip of the penis became super sensitive and noticeably hurt whenever it touched my underwear. The skin was and still is noticeably red close to and directly around the meatus. This redness gets worse and bigger after I've come out the shower or masturbated. An hour or so after ejaculation, I get a slight burn/irritation at the very end of the urethra when I urinate and this can last for a few days before subsiding. This has put me off from masturbating as much now. This has lasted for about 3 months now with no signs of improvement. I saw a doctor and was prescribed timodine/hydrocortisone cream and this didn't have much effect and am slightly worried it may just make things worse so have stopped using it for now. It almost seems as if the redness comes from within the skin rather than on the surface. I don't think its   as I haven't had that for over 12 years when I was a kid and that was with the usual smegma discharge etc, whereas this is just redness.¬† I've attached images to show how it looks straight after showering, which is when the redness is at its worst and the contrast between the normal skin colour and the redness can be clearly seen. 7 likes, 1241 replies "

I contacted my regular physician to talk about these withdrawal symptoms and what would help ease them and she told me the drop in dosage was too fast and I should not be taking the Zoloft the same time I'm taking the Paxil even at the lower dose.  Yikes, it's hard to know what to do when the two Drs. you are relying on to help you contradict each others medical advice.

My advice to anyone about to start taking Paxil, don't.  Ask your physician for an anxiety medication with less severe withdrawal symptoms.  Reading these symptoms on a list is nothing compared to actually experiencing them in real life.

This started as episodes in my thigh muscles and spread to be episodes in the muscles all over to even the muscles in my face.   When I speak any louder than my normal voice my vocal chords get exhausted and my voice gets weak and raspy.  When I'm eating something that takes chewing the muscles in my jaw get fatigued.  I have no trouble swallowing thank God.  The episodes at the beginning of this were infrequent and didn't last long, maybe 15 minutes but progressed to happening to each muscle that was used every time it was used and taking much longer to recover. After seeing  a neurologist and having all different tests done for jyst about every muscle disease,  he has come to the conclusion it is the Paxil that is causing all of this.  He told me neurologists don't like Paxil and that I was on too high of a dose, 60mg a day.  He told me to cut down to 20mg a day and prescribed Zoloft to start in 2 weeks or sooner if the withdrawal effects get too bad. Big mistake taking that drastic drop in dosage advice!  The withdrawal effects have been horrible especially on top of how I've been feeling with the extreme muscle fatigue in the first place. Here is a list of my withdrawal symptoms: electric brain squeezing, flu like symptoms which include sweating one minute to freezing the next (I'm on day 17 of lower dose and still feeling hot/cold throughout the day), muscle pain like you get with the flu, stomach pain with semi loose bowel movements, big time anxiety episodes, irritable and overly emotional, trouble sleeping throughout the night and when sleepy because of this during the day I constantly wake up in a panic feeling like I'm on the verge of a severe anxiety attack. I contacted my regular physician to talk about these withdrawal symptoms and what would help ease them and she told me the drop in dosage was too fast and I should not be taking the Zoloft the same time I'm taking the Paxil even at the lower dose.  Yikes, it's hard to know what to do when the two Drs. you are relying on to help you contradict each others medical advice. At this time I am alternating 20mg and 10mg and not taking the Zoloft until I stop the Paxil.  I plan on calling my regular physician tomorrow to find out when to next lower the dose of the Paxil so that I can finally be off of it and find out if it is what has been causing the worsening, all over extreme muscle fatigue. My advice to anyone about to start taking Paxil, don't.  Ask your physician for an anxiety medication with less severe withdrawal symptoms.  Reading these symptoms on a list is nothing compared to actually experiencing them in real life.  I will try a low dose of Zoloft and look into cognitive behavior therapy to help me deal with my anxiety. If anyone else has had these extreme muscle fatigue episodes while on Paxil please let me know.  I'd really like to know if my neurologist is on the right track, I have had extremely low quality of life for the past year and am afraid of it becoming a permanent situation. Thanks for reading!

My chemist is usually very good with my medications, however I have been without my seroxat and having the worst withdrawals. They failed to inform me it was out of stock and only found out today that there is no liquid form. I hate taking tablets as they make me gag and heave and even vomit. My tablets have just been delivered in place of the liquid. i was on 50mg liquid. the tablets are a box of 30mg and box of 20mg that says to crush it and mix with water. that tastes even worse. i also contacted GSK about it and they said there is a nationwide unavailability and will not be in stock until February 2020. if i end up vomiting will the tablets still work or would i need to take another dose? i hate being on seroxat and hate the withdrawals and side effects. im actually so angry and mad to be without the liquid form. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Worried.","I really don't know which category to post this in, because I have no pain yet anyway, but please please help me! I'm so worried. I'm 24 years old btw. Okay so first of all, I've been under-eating for a few years now and this summer I decided to really get myself together and eat more healthy fats etc and gain weight. I also wanted to start eating more fats in the hopes that maybe balancing my hormones because I've had acne for a couple of years. My skin has cleared up a lot etc, and my last period came a week early. That period was really weird though. I usually have period cramps a day or two before the period comes. This time, I had NO pain AT ALL before, during or after my period! Once my period had ended (two weekends ago, around July 12-13 something) I noticed that my stomach looked really bloated, which is not unusual since I have IBS and am bloated a lot. But it was bloated in a weird kind of way. It looked more swollen on the right side so I looked further down and noticed that I'm swollen in the pelvic area on my right side. I don't know exactly WHERE to describe but yeah... Today it's still there, and I still look pregnant and bloated although I'm a virgin.  I also don't have any IBS symptoms but I still look bloated and I definitely see that it's more swollen to the right compared to the left. It's like a ""bump"". I called a gynecologist today but she seemed to not know what it could be, she even questioned whether it's actually gynecological! I told her I'm worried it might be a cyst, but she said that they usually hurt and that they are not seen on the outside. I haven't really noticed any significant pain in the swollen area so far... So now I'm worried that it might be a tumor or maybe a swollen lymph node that is related to some cancer?! She didn't have an appointment until next week, when I'm on vacation... So we agreed that I should call again when I get back from my vacation if it's still there. I'm still really worried though and I don't want to have to worry during my vacation. Earlier in June, I had a swollen lymph node on my neck. It's still there but a doctor has checked it and told me not to worry about it as long as it's not increasing in size, which it hasn't.  I also had really itchy skin back then so I was worried it was lymphoma or something. The itching stopped after around 1,5 months though. It only itches a normal amount nowadays, which means that it barely itches, at least not enough for me to be bothered by it. Has anyone has the same thing or know what it might be? I have read about girls around my age, or even younger who have gotten cervical/ovarian cancer, despite being virgins, so that's why I'm worried. And the reason why I mentioned my eating habits in the beginning of this post is because I figure that my increased fat intake may ave played a role in my hormone balance, and maybe has something to do with it?

Worried.","I really don't know which category to post this in, because I have no pain yet anyway, but please please help me! I'm so worried. I'm 24 years old btw. Okay so first of all, I've been under-eating for a few years now and this summer I decided to really get myself together and eat more healthy fats etc and gain weight. I also wanted to start eating more fats in the hopes that maybe balancing my hormones because I've had acne for a couple of years. My skin has cleared up a lot etc, and my last period came a week early. That period was really weird though. I usually have period cramps a day or two before the period comes. This time, I had NO pain AT ALL before, during or after my period! Once my period had ended (two weekends ago, around July 12-13 something) I noticed that my stomach looked really bloated, which is not unusual since I have IBS and am bloated a lot. But it was bloated in a weird kind of way. It looked more swollen on the right side so I looked further down and noticed that I'm swollen in the pelvic area on my right side. I don't know exactly WHERE to describe but yeah... Today it's still there, and I still look pregnant and bloated although I'm a virgin.  I also don't have any IBS symptoms but I still look bloated and I definitely see that it's more swollen to the right compared to the left. It's like a ""bump"". I called a gynecologist today but she seemed to not know what it could be, she even questioned whether it's actually gynecological! I told her I'm worried it might be a cyst, but she said that they usually hurt and that they are not seen on the outside. I haven't really noticed any significant pain in the swollen area so far... So now I'm worried that it might be a tumor or maybe a swollen lymph node that is related to some cancer?! She didn't have an appointment until next week, when I'm on vacation... So we agreed that I should call again when I get back from my vacation if it's still there. I'm still really worried though and I don't want to have to worry during my vacation. Earlier in June, I had a swollen lymph node on my neck. It's still there but a doctor has checked it and told me not to worry about it as long as it's not increasing in size, which it hasn't.  I also had really itchy skin back then so I was worried it was lymphoma or something. The itching stopped after around 1,5 months though. It only itches a normal amount nowadays, which means that it barely itches, at least not enough for me to be bothered by it. Has anyone has the same thing or know what it might be?

The same thing with the hirsutism-- I was young and naive and actually liked looking more androgynous, so it never concerned me, even though my Mom was always concerned about a hormonal imbalance-- I just didn't listen and she didn't want to upset me. Now I'm having this bleeding and every day I'm panicking, thinking I have some sort of gynecological cancer. I'm Autistic and my anxiety levels are severe. I live with my Mom and she takes care of me. I love my Mom so very much. I'm going to get a transvaginal ultrasound even though I'm so afraid of anything going inside. I had 2 transabdominal ultrasounds, one last summer and the other one about 2 weeks ago when the bleeding started, because I went to the Emergency department then. They only found some small fibroids. I'm worried though because the transabdominal from the Emergency department couldn't see my endometrial stripe very clearly, though it was measured roughly at 7mm. Please help me. Is there anyone here with any expertise about this? I have panic attacks all the time throughout each day, worrying that I have cancer. I really need some insight about what's going on with me. I'm only 28 and I desperately want to live to be a ripe old age. 0 likes, 3 replies "

It is hard to explain how it feels. It seems like it started in my lower left abdomen and moved to the center and now it has moved down to the pelvic area. I am 50 yo male, reasonably active and have recently given up on soda, and have seriously cut back my sugar intake, to almost nothing. I thought I may have a UTI, or something like that. It has been this way for as I say about 3 weeks or so, thought it was a stomach issue at first but that seems not to be the case. Anyone have any advice, suggestions, etc...? 0 likes, 2 replies "

In six months I have put on a stone and my tummy is sticking out as if I'm pregnant.  I have been on various internet sites to find out why this is happening and I can't find the answers.  I believe it is the medication.  I spoke to someone from British Thyroid Foundation and she was very rude and unhelpful.  She insisted that it wasn't the medication.  Well, I had no problems with weight for 35 years and all of a sudden when taking Levothyroxine my weight shoots up, there is something going  wrong and I'm not at all happy. This is very depressing.  I feel are we all being tried out as guinea pigs and then in years to come they will admit to it!! Has anyone else had the same problem cos I'm at my wits end.  I want to come off this medication its made me feel a lot worse than before.

Hello All, I am reaching out in pure desperation in hopes someone can shed some light on whatever is going on with my body. I am a 37 year old male who has had GI issues the majority of my life, however the past two years have been a nightmare battling constipation.  I know the basics regarding what causes constipation, etc.  This is more so an anatomy issue, at least I think. Basically my body will not allow me to empty out.  Gas feces, etc. collects in my lower abdomen- mainly my lower left side or under my bellybutton and just stays there. No matter what I do I can not get my body to relax and pass things.  I‚Äôve taken Linzess, Trulance, Motegrity, etc. and nothing changes the problem, in fact it gives me the urge to go and the pain builds up. This happens with gas too so I know it‚Äôs an issue with my body.  It‚Äôs as if one part is turned off while the other is on.  If I take laxatives before bed I‚Äôm able to wake up and go a bit.  I have also taken Valium, Xanax, and Lorazepam and they too help a bit.  I was also given prednisone for inflammation and that doesn‚Äôt help. I have been to a ton of doctors and no one seems to get what is going on. 0 likes, 10 replies "

729,C0009319,Colitis,C0011991,Diarrhea,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/strategy-for-nightly-enema-699053,Strategy for nightly enema,"Following a recent sigmoidoscopy  which revealed colitis was prolonging my diarrhoea, i was proscribed  octasa tablets and a salofalk enema. Following my 2nd go with the enema last night , i have realised that a degree of experimentation is needed to make the most of this treatment. My daily routine is normally 5 am to  8 pm so i administered my first dose at 8 am, waited 30 minutes before relaxing and then thought,to my cost,  i could go about my evening as usual. But alas no. I soon had to use the loo to let it out. Last night i waited till 9 pm and managed to stay the course till midnight when i was woken from my sleep for the loo. My question is just this.  Since the  package leaflet is not too revealing is there a way to take these that can maximise the benefit and minimise the disruption to my sleep for the next 26 days. Tonight i am going back to administering at 8 pm to see if this helps. 0 likes, 8 replies "

In  January I turned fifty  and my whole life changed. I have never felt this in my  head and body  . About a year ago I would wake up in the middle of the night with my heart racing .  I attributed it to stress.  In  January when I turned fifty, I started to get Palpations and increased heart rate . My Blood pressure was a bit high even though i never had a BP issue  . I saw my Pcp . They did all these cardiac workups  which were all normal.   She later prescribed a beta blocker  to  help with my heart rate and  .  I  later started noticing i was getting ringing//fullness/pulsation  in my left ear would also come with a weird vibration in my body . Sometimes I would think my Bp was high but it was  been normal . In addition, I would feel as if my stomach/chest was vibration/pulsating .  I would also get  a pulling feeling in chest and stomach especially epigastric area . Because of all these feelings it is difficult to sleep .  People tell you about common symptoms of peri/menoupause  like hot flashes but  never these symptoms .  Because of  these symptoms, i  feel as if i am developing   . Anxiety because i don't know what is the cause of  all if this .  I  also saw my Ent  who stated that I had a   however the ear symptoms should  have gotten better already . I am now  scheduled for an Mri of  head focusing on my temporal bone to see if this is a middle  ear issue . After reading some of the the comments on this site  I am left wondering if hormonal changes can really cause all these feelings . I haven't reported any of this to my gynecologist  as yet because I wanted to rule out ear issue first .  Sometimes I feel like my family and friends may start to think I am crazy .  I have never felt like this in my life and just want some relief from all these weird symptoms . 0 likes, 15 replies "

Please help...,"Ok, I'm needing some advice here. This issue all started about 5 years ago, in 2012. I started to feel cold, almost feverish, but no temp. I broke out in a rash on my arms, chest, groin, legs...etc. I felt run down all the time, dizziness after eating.  Fast forward to today, I take a load of supplements as well as a daily Probiotic. My symptoms have came and gone, but I still don't feel well. I don't get the rash anymore, but I do get some slight hives when I scratch my skin. It turns red and raises. I feel tired and drained all the time. My blood pressure runs high, and I'm on Metoprolol, so I have that part under control. I just found out about Mast Cell Disorders a couple of days ago, so I've been doing research. I get dizzy and fatigued after most meals, I have symptoms of POTS, although they don't appear much because of the Metoprolol now. My left knee gets stiff and gives me issues.

I'm new here.  I have not received a formal diagnosis yet, but am in the testing process.  It's a little unnerving because I have virtually all the symptoms and signs.   The ""allergy attacks"" started on 6/28.   I had a ten day span where I had anaphylactic reactions scout four or five times, even without exposure to what we thought triggered the first one, and was in the hospital 8 of those ten days.  I even had an anaphalytic reaction to solumedrol, they steroid they use to treat anaphylaxis!   I was released on July 8.  Following my release from the hospital, I went to an allergist who suspected that I had a mast cell problem and sent me to this specialist about an hour and a half away.  He has brought up the mast cell thing as well and is currently reviewing my records and running tests.   I was discharged from hospits on Zyrtec and Singulair at night.  The specialist bumped up the Zyrtec to twice a day.   Since being out of the hospital on July 8, I've had to more attacks in this 14 day period.  The first I was able to manage with Benadryl.  It happened after a kid got into my car smelling like a ash try.  I got a bit lightheaded, headache, and that AWFUL burning and stinging sensation all over my body.  The second one started on Thursday of this week.  I could feel light burning and tingling but it wasn't unmanageable.  Friday, after exercising for a few minutes, when I stopped, the burning and tingling started getting severe.   I was also a little short of breath and started coughing.  I took my rescue inhaler and Benadryl.   After a while I thought I was in the clear.  But like two and a half hours later, I was driving and it hit me full on.   Chest pain, unbearable burning/stinging, couldn't swallow, getting dizzy.  I was taken by ambulance to hospital from the side of the highway.  My heart rate was hitting 150s, nauseated, blood pressure extremely elevated.   I overheard the paramedic telling the nurse that besides the Benadryl he had given me a placebo to lower my heart rate to see if I was faking I guess?  His words were ""to see if it was some kind of pseudo reaction.""  However when he gave me whatever it was he gave in the IV, I *did* have more burning in my chest.   When I get the Benadryl in the IV in the middle of the flair, it often feels like so much pressure in my chest I gasp for air.  Anyway the hospital kept me on Benadryl, zofran, Pepcid, and Ativan (to lower my heart rate) and let me go after like five hours instead of keeping me.  I also got copies of my medical records from the two prior hospital visits.  I noted on record says I ""have a lot of complaints even though I look fine"" and another says rule out allergies, anxiety, withdrawals, and that I was drug tested twice.  (Negative of course).  Between reading that and how the paramedic handled it yesterday, I'm hurt, irritated, and frustrated.   This isn't ""anxiety"" or some kind of psychological response.  I'm also afraid to eat anything or exercise now because there seems to be no consisten trigger.   After yesterday, hydroxyzine has now been added to the regiment.

I possibly could have eds but the geneticist diagnosed me anyways in order to get me into the losartan marfans clinical trial. ¬†I had a pleurodesis on the left side at age 18 at ucla by a thorascic surgeon due to recurrent pneumothoraxes I have had a border line aorta of 32 mm that never bothered me since I was 18 and now im 28.¬† I had an small pneumothorax on the left on dec 2016 at ucla hosipital but I went home hoping it would heal on its own. In march 2017 I had a similar air leak sensation and tried to wait it out ¬†by taking percocet and codeine. Since then my life went to complete hell i started getting this horrible swelling in left neck and burning sensation like my blood was on fire, I couldnt swallow too well and developed a high pulse of 100 with a blood pressure of 100 top number. I went the ucla er fearing cardiovascular collapse then they took an iodine contrast ct and found nothing and sent me home. The next morning I woke up with the worst heart pain and swelling in my neck. This led to more percocet and more iodine ct er trips. Since then Ive had drenching night sweats every night with the worst sun burn sensation that wakes me up like 5 in the morning. In mid May I had numbness all over my fingers and feet and thought it was clots so i took some aspirin in case but it caused even more er trips because i would wake up with this painful burning sensation like heart failure or something then if i stayed awake i would just pass out and be instantly woken up by pain. My blood pressure dropped to 70 with a pulse of 105. I rushed to ER and they did another iodine ct scan and found squat. Ive gone to so many specialist and got placed on anxiety meds. Ive seen the cardiologist, pulmonoligist, ENT, endocrinologist, rheumatologist, dermatologist, and pain management but everything checks out. Ive even gotten so desperate with how sick i am every day that I even went to the psychiatrist and took the lexapro and klonopin for a while. Those made it horrible. I was mentally ok even though the flare ups were horrible and never went away but after the psych meds I got super emotional and twitchy. I got off them and dealt with the withdrawal painfully, but now recently Ive developed hives that just come and go anywhere between 5mins to a few hrs all over my body. I found out about mast cells from looking up allergies recently and realized that when I wake up to cold sweat and swelling my eyes are super puffy and my esophagus is super dried out like I used to get allergies and take benedryl. Ive become hyper sensitive to heat ¬†and flush with a pulse that gets higher by the day. Every day that passes by my pulse consistently rises with a dull chest pain that I have no idea how to lower. Im taking benedryl, zertec and claritin and histablock within the last few days. My doctors refuse to see me anymore. They pretty much have forsaken me because its in the system that I have anxiety and been sent to a psychiatric ward. Its just happened so drastically I cant cope too well. I was a normal person that didnt have have any of these issues and now i cant stabilize my debilitating condition especially my heart and no one believes me because they think its anxiety disorder. I am struggling but thats because I cant get any treatment or help for 4 months of a nameless illness that randomly flares and wont get any better. Ive looked into the cancers but my cbcs are all normal and all the cts Ive had are so recent and show no tumors or anything. I feel like my blood is poison everyday because it spreads an inflammatory pain throughout my body causing me to sweat cold sweat and wear my heart out. I cant stabilize because no doctor seems to take me seriously enough to help me manage this. My last hope is that someone from the community can help me through this I dont know who to turn to anymore. My parents are sick of my crying and endless pain. Im so sick of this I just want to go back to how a was a few months ago. Is that even possible? Sorry for ranting things are beyond rough and Im so lost and the condition keeps worsening.

In mid May I had numbness all over my fingers and feet and thought it was clots so i took some aspirin in case but it caused even more er trips because i would wake up with this painful burning sensation like heart failure or something then if i stayed awake i would just pass out and be instantly woken up by pain. My blood pressure dropped to 70 with a pulse of 105. I rushed to ER and they did another iodine ct scan and found squat. Ive gone to so many specialist and got placed on anxiety meds. Ive seen the cardiologist, pulmonoligist, ENT, endocrinologist, rheumatologist, dermatologist, and pain management but everything checks out. Ive even gotten so desperate with how sick i am every day that I even went to the psychiatrist and took the lexapro and klonopin for a while. Those made it horrible. I was mentally ok even though the flare ups were horrible and never went away but after the psych meds I got super emotional and twitchy. I got off them and dealt with the withdrawal painfully, but now recently Ive developed hives that just come and go anywhere between 5mins to a few hrs all over my body. I found out about mast cells from looking up allergies recently and realized that when I wake up to cold sweat and swelling my eyes are super puffy and my esophagus is super dried out like I used to get allergies and take benedryl. Ive become hyper sensitive to heat ¬†and flush with a pulse that gets higher by the day. Every day that passes by my pulse consistently rises with a dull chest pain that I have no idea how to lower. Im taking benedryl, zertec and claritin and histablock within the last few days. My doctors refuse to see me anymore. They pretty much have forsaken me because its in the system that I have anxiety and been sent to a psychiatric ward. Its just happened so drastically I cant cope too well. I was a normal person that didnt have have any of these issues and now i cant stabilize my debilitating condition especially my heart and no one believes me because they think its anxiety disorder. I am struggling but thats because I cant get any treatment or help for 4 months of a nameless illness that randomly flares and wont get any better. Ive looked into the cancers but my cbcs are all normal and all the cts Ive had are so recent and show no tumors or anything. I feel like my blood is poison everyday because it spreads an inflammatory pain throughout my body causing me to sweat cold sweat and wear my heart out. I cant stabilize because no doctor seems to take me seriously enough to help me manage this. My last hope is that someone from the community can help me through this I dont know who to turn to anymore. My parents are sick of my crying and endless pain. Im so sick of this I just want to go back to how a was a few months ago. Is that even possible? Sorry for ranting things are beyond rough and Im so lost and the condition keeps worsening. Thank you for your time.¬† 4 likes, 23 replies "

I have been diagnosed with endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, fibromyalgia, migraines, stomach problems, intestinal problems, and of course asthma and allergies. Sometimes I have been helped by prednisone, Enbrel, xolair, antihistamines, etc. I have a niece who has Ehlers Danlos and I was reading sometimes mast cell disease goes along with it, so I mentioned it to her and she said, I have mast cell. I really am starting to wonder if I do, too. My allergist had mentioned the possibility before. I guess the biggest reason I want to know is because I would like to get pregnant, but I have repeated miscarriages, hemhorraging, preterm labor and infections and the specialists can‚Äôt figure out why. Could this be from mast cell activation? It is hard to decide when the doctors don‚Äôt know why I have had these problems. Please help if you know anything about this. I am getting the serum testing and I guess from there I could see my niece‚Äôs specialist at U of M. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I am having problems with wearing my dentures for long periods of time too. Now I am taking Benadryl to try to counteract the reaction that is still going on. I have an appointment with Dr. Akin but not until September. My allergist is trying to help me, but he is at a loss. My ENT doesn't know what to do either. Forget the resident I see. I was supposed to a TKR but they say it's too risky. Has anyone had problems with plastics or replacements? I am bummed as I hate being so deaf. I'd like to hear my grandson talking to me.

I am having a really bad degranulation event. I can't seem to get it under control. It has been going for almost a month. I went to the allergist, saw his new NP, and she had no answers. They want me to try Allegra, but I am leery of trying another med as I had reactions to Nexium and Zyrtec. I think I have mastocytosis as my tryptase was over 20 even without reactions. Been in the ER 3 times, but they don't help. Yesterday I took my Vitamin D3 and calcium and had a reaction. I am talking about sudden feeling of doom, low bp, and I grabbed the benadryl. It pulled me out of it, but now I don't know if it was that or if my histamine levels are not being controlled by the meds. She wouldn't order any blood work. My urinalysis is showing a high pH and I'm going into ketosis, slight for now. I am limited to only a few foods I can tolerate and they are bothering me now. I am on cromolyn, Zantac, Claritin, Flonase, eye drops, and Benadryl as needed. The benadryl really helps, but don't want to use it all time. The NP said if it continues they might have to consider a food line. I said no. It is in my GI tract. I have had polyps removed that were full of lymphatic tissue and other cells, but at the time they didn't test for mastocytosis. The Immunologist is pretty sure I have it in the gut. Joy. I have constant heartburn (helped by benadryl! That's why they think the mast cells are everywhere), terrible abdominal pain, diarrhea, and now blood. I am existing on bone broth. I can't eat anything not organic. It is getting expensive. I can't take any antibiotics, antifungals, etc. I have to avoid people, even my grandchildren for fear of catching something. I see Dr. Akin at U of M in September. I am trying to stay alive until then. Any suggestions would be appreciated. My PCP just won't even consider discussing this and says go to the specialist. My gastro's office says the same thing! I am hoping Dr. Akin can suggest a good PCP and gastro who will work with him. BTW, I had a bone biopsy that just showed low ferritin, which I didn't know is a sign of mastocytosis too. I really don't want another one done, but the doctor said sometimes they miss the spot. Joy! I really want some decent blood work done. I have swollen lymph glands and a tender spleen, but they just keep passing me off to the next doctor to try to find an answer.

I want to explore why doctors often misdiagnose people who have MCAS or pass them off as hypochondriacs. I want to interview people with this syndrome, and focus on educating the public. I am writing to you because I would like to know if you are interested in sharing your story for my podcast. I know that the more people that I interview, the fuller picture I‚Äôll be able to give of what it‚Äôs like to live with MCAS. I want to educate myself as well as the public so that hopefully more people with MCAS can receive help sooner (it took me over 10 years to finally get a diagnosis). If you're interested, please message me and let me know!¬† üôÇ By the way: if you want, I can include written stories anonymously. Or you could record your story in your own words, written or spoken. Thank you in advance for your time and help! Sincerely,¬† -Madison¬† 3 likes, 2 replies "

Ive been really struggling with coping with my symptoms and diagnosis journey for MCAS. Not really medically (although that has been difficult as well) but coping mentally has been hard. I wanted to start this discussion to meet other people going through the same thing because I feel like my family, and even my doctors, dont really understand what Im going through right now and Im just super confused about everything since I dont know anyone with this condition to compare it to. I first started with symptoms when I was 15, I ate ice cream and suddenly started feeling like someone was sitting on my chest and restricting my breathing. I went to three different allergists ‚Äì all of which said that I was not allergic to dairy. I kept eating dairy (despite the fact that it usually did not turn out well for me) mostly because I was in denial about suddenly having any type of limitation. Finally, when I was 17 I decided to give up dairy all together because my symptoms were starting to get really scary. Over time I have developed an allergy to many more foods (dairy, egg, gluten, peanuts, cashews, sesame, shellfish, coffee, peas, green beans, certain strong smells, chemicals, etc). Typically what I think to be allergic reactions present themselves through shortness of breath, chest tightness, coughing, lightheartedness, dizziness, flushing/hot flash, itchy skin (but never a rash or hives), nausea or a variation of said symptoms which (if they get really bad) are typically resolved by using an epipen. Recently I have also had a lot of trouble eating since I get full very quickly and start feeling super nauseous afterwards. The thing is: I have never had hives so what if its all in my head? Could these be caused by panic attacks, although its gotten to a point when Im not even worried when I get a reaction, my thought is usually something along the lines of ""dang it, there goes my streak""? I saw an allergist who told me that it might be MCAS, but all of the tests we have done keep coming back negative: we did a test for the kit mutation as well as a 24 hr urine histamine test. My doctor decided to put me on medication for mast cell to see what happens and they have really helped. They have slightly helped reduced the amount of reactions (I went from a reaction once to twice a week to going two weeks without a reaction at times) and they have made my reactions less severe in terms of symptoms and the amount of time it takes for it to go away. I was just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? Has anyone else had episodes where its just one symptom? Sometimes I will randomly have chest tightness but no flushing or dizziness, which I dont know if thats typical of an allergic reaction, if that is an allergic reaction.

But didn't have another for 63 days, but when I did it was normal 7 days, and now again, I'm just about at 63 days give or take (I don't have my phone with me to check my app) but is this normal?

My tryptase level was normal as were other mast cell markers in a urine test, but the allergist is going to treat me as if I have a mast cell disorder based on my symptoms. Nothing showed up on the food allergy skin test, although I am highly allergic to grasses and other inhalants. Here are my questions: I've had a chronic cough for years, and occasionally my throat and nose will close up completely so I cannot breathe at all during a coughing spell. Eventually it will release and I am exhausted for the day. There are no hives and this does not seem to happen in response to any food or inhalant, just triggered by the random cough. Sometimes it will occur when I've been asleep for a few hours out of nowhere. The doctor is calling this anaphylaxis and has given a prescription for an epi pen and a rescue inhaler with directions to go to ER after an episode. Since I can't possibly inhale during these episodes, I won't be able to use the inhaler. There is no point going to ER because once it's over, it's over. Does this sound like anaphlaxis to those of you with more experience? I am wondering if the epi pen is the answer. Next, I have terrible flushing episodes at random times during the day, and they are worse at night. I always have one about half an hour after falling asleep, where I get very hot, anxious, have elevated heart rate and my hands turn bright red. My blood pressure goes down and I feel faint. A cardiologist recently diagnosed me with dysautonomia. Sometimes I sweat a lot during an episode, and last night I nearly fainted when I got up to use the bathroom. I had to lie on the floor for a while before I could get up. This is in spite of using medications. I'm now using an inhaler for the asthma which has helped the cough a lot and increased my lung capacity significantly. I am also taking Zyzal, Zantac, doxepin and quercetin but the night time episodes have not diminished at all. They seem to happen at the same time every night beginning around 10 p.m. I don't get hives or itching with these attacks, but I also have neuropathy and it is highly activated by an episode. I am also woken up with a mild episode when it's time to get up for the day and that irritates the nerves terribly. Does this sound like a mast cell problem or something else? The trigger seems to be changing sleep states rather than an allergen. I am happy to finally have doctors taking me seriously but am overwhelmed and confused by these episodes and not sure we have hit the target yet. I would appreciate any observations.

It is dark like old blood and crumbly, not like the flowing bright red stuff I usually have. Usually I have a heavyish period for a few days and then it tapers off for the last few days. It has been consistent since I started when I was 14 (I'm 25 now). I even did a pregnancy test last month because I read blood like that could be implantation bleeding, it was negative, it was unlikely anyway as I have a copper IUD. I'm also experiencing vaginal dryness (I can get wet but it takes a while, and isn't as much as it was before. I also have low libido when in the past I've always had a high one. I will have sex if my boyfriend initiates it, but otherwise I just don't feel horny, and I don't masturbate when he's not there, like I used to. Everything I've found on google suggests premature menopause. None of the other explanations fit me, I don't have an eating disorder, I'm fit but not an athlete, I don't take hormonal birth control and I'm not breastfeeding. My mum had the menopause at a normal age in her 50s, and I presume my grandmother did. But the internet says 60% of cases are idiopathic anyway, 1/1000 women under 30 have this condition and I feel like it would be just my luck to have it. One of the symptoms is even weak bones and I broke a bone in my pelvis a few months ago that the doctor said is rare in young people (however he commented saying the bone density looked fine on the xrays.) I also have discomfort in my lower abdomen and vulva most of the time, my physiotherapist also told me to ask for a blood test from my doctor as I have sore joints all over my body. I've also been having digestive issues over a similar time frame. I've dreamed my whole life of having children and I'm so so anxious about these symptoms, I can't stop crying thinking I can't have children and my boyfriend will leave me as he wants them too. I feel so depressed. I had a kind of stressful time around 4 months ago as I had exams, however I've been through much more stressful events in my life such as relatives passing away and that never affected my cycle. Plus I've finished studying now and it hasn't gone back to normal. I will go to the doctor tomorrow but I can't think of any other cause üò¶ feel so depressed and hopeless 0 likes, 0 replies "

I am 15, 16 this July. My family has a history of uterine fibroids on my mothers side and I believe my grandma on my dads side had breast cancer. My last period was hell for me, I have noticed the pain getting stronger over the course of my last few periods, but the most recent one just had me curled up on my bed waiting to die. Cramps and back pain so bad I couldn't walk downstairs. I also couldn't eat, as the very thought of it made me want to vomit (ended up drinking some tomato soup). The pain went away after I somehow forced myself asleep, but I decided to take pain medication from then on as I NEVER want to experience that ever again. I started getting cramps a little more than a week after my period ended, and now it has escalated to bleeding, which is more than spotting. I am also producing brown discharge along with the blood which may just be blood. I am on day 23 of my on average 36 day cycle (length varies a lot, least I had was 29 days and most was 47 days, 60 day missed period too) Can anyone tell me what this might be?

My last two periods were really light. My first light period didn't concern me too much because I thought maybe it was stress but then my period I just had, was a lot lighter. It was so light I only wore a tampon to bed and if I went out in public but even when I had a tampon in, there was barely any blood or none at all. I'm not consistent with my pills and I never take them at the same time so I'm more concerned now because I'm wondering if it's possible I could be pregnant even on the pill.

I had very invalidating menstrual cramps days before and  throughout the menstruation and also many problems with pressure, pain and difficulty emptying the bladder (always on the right side where I have PCOS). During the last year my symptoms got worse for the bladder and also for menstrual pain that has became almost chronic even if I don't have menstruation (for 2 months I didn't have menstruation). I have tried many contraceptive pills, inositol and everything doctors prescribed to me. I just wanted to know if I could do an ovariectomy to remove the ovary with PCOS or is it unlikely that they would do this for this problem?

As I am writing this my entire body is weak and shaking, and I am nauseated with pain. This has been happening every month or so on my period for about 6 years (since I got my first, I am 18). Over these 6 years, I have had probably 6 or 7 different gynecologists and 4 different primary care doctors. No one has been able to give me an answer and gynecologists in particular have not taken me seriously. First, let me describe the pain itself. Over the last few years it has gotten significantly worse. I experience intense ovulation pain and cramps a week BEFORE my period (My periods were super irregular for a few years while my system recovered from the various birth controls, which I'll get to later, but are now back to a consistent 30-40 days between each one). During the period, I have medium to heavy bleeding, and for the first few days the cramps are so intense at times that I cannot walk, move, sleep, or in some cases breathe. I end up holding my breath for over a minute with each cramp because even the slight movement of air going in and out of my lungs worsens them. The pain also wakes me up in my sleep sometimes and I am unable to go back to bed. The cramps come and go repeatedly, similar to how labor contractions have been described to me. I self treat this pain with the maximum dose of Ibuprofen for someone my size, which I believe is 800mg every 6 to 8 hours (6 if I cannot handle the pain any longer). This takes about an hour to take effect and wears off about 4 hours after I take it. But during those 4 hours I am able to suppress the pain enough to function at least. (Note: over the years, my bleeding has not increased, but the pain has). I'm very worried that this repeated use of Ibuprofen every month (sometimes paired with the maximum dose of Acetaminophen if I have it) is dangerous for my kidneys and liver. One doctor recommended that I aim for 400mg instead of 800mg, but this is literally the ONLY semi-solution to my pain. Now to my story. I have been prescribed several different birth control pills, the shot, and the IUD in an attempt to stop my periods. All of these resulted in extreme side effects such as a long period of severe depression, anxiety, 50+ lb weight gain, insomnia, and suicidal thinking and ultimately self harm (all of which were misdiagnosed as being actual health conditions of mine, and I was given sleep medication, antidepressants, and therapy. Turns out they could all be linked back to birth control). The IUD itself caused one long period with non-stop intense cramping, which didn't end until I had it removed. I KNOW that these were side effects of brith control and side effects only. I have educated myself on mental health over these years for this exact reason, and I am the most calm and positive person I know, and that depression and anxiety are NOT something I would normally experience. On top of this, no doctor ever warned me of any birth control side effect before I took it. In fact, I was even cautioned against Googling the side effects because they would quote just scare me and only are experienced in extreme cases. Turns out I'm an extreme case, in every case. Because of this, I am unwilling to try any of these traditional birth controls or other hormonal medications ever again. When I tell gynecologists that my body does not react well to hormonal medications and I refuse to take them, they seem to be personally offended and can't offer me much advice after that, then I switch to another and the cycle continues. I even had to leave school, and all of my friends, because of the extreme side effects of birth control. The depression, anxiety, lack of sleep, and intense pain mixed together resulted in me having to enroll in an online academy and stay at home. My entire high school years have been online. While I enjoy my freedom in an online acadeny, my loneliness has negatively impacted my mental health. I am also seriously concerned about going off and starting my career and living life. Am I just supposed to stay home from work for a week every month? I am also considering enlisting in the military, which has been a life long dream of mine and is now compromised because I have been misdiagnosed with mental health conditions and birth control resulted in seriously disqualifying side effects such as self harm. I can only hope and pray that an exception will be made because of the complicatedness of this situation. I have been examined for endometriosis and tested for hormonal conditions that could be resulting in the pain, but the gynecologist that did this testing was only concerned that I wasn't getting pregnant and did not take my pain seriously, constantly mentioning birth control options. She seemed honestly bewildered when I stated that I would not consider birth control. I have had more than one gynecologist like this whos' only solutions to my pain were to sell me birth control or tell me to ""pop an Ibuprofen"". I am at a point in my life where if there was any long-lasting side effects of the birth controls I was given, they should now be gone (besides the massive weight gain, which I am still trying to shed to this day). There were no anomalies found in the scan of my uterus for endometriosis. There seems to be no explanation for my pain. I can say now that I was raised by a very tough woman and I have an extremely high pain tolerance. I recovered from surgeries and had a few accidents resulting in serious injury. I can handle pain, I know what real pain feels like and I know my periods are still the most painful thing I have ever felt and continue to get worse. I continuously see on online health forums that if my pain is interfering with my ability to function in normal life, I need to seek medical help. I have been now for 5 or 6 years. Either my pain is not being taken seriously because I am a teenage girl, or no doctor truly knows what is going on. I believe I should be able to go to work, go to school, and live my life without damaging my liver/kidneys, and being unable to move from unbearable pain. I eat extremely healthy organic food and I exercise every single day. I keep sugar low and get good fiber and other nutrients (I do not have a magnesium deficiency). I really do believe there is something underlying going on here. I am at a total loss. I have no idea what to do or who to ask for help. I am seeing another new doctor soon who hopefully isn't just trying to sell me birth control. I'm sorry if this sounds aggressive, but I am truly exhausted with the obsession of gynecologists for preventing pregnancy. I am not sexually active and never have been. This is about relieving my pain that is only getting worse, and as I lay here typing this I am literally nearing my breaking point of pain I can handle. I have yet to pass out from pain, but sometimes I wish I would so I didn't have to feel it anymore. I'm writing this because I have no answers, and after years now of researching my situation and scouring the internet for others with this exact problem, I have found very little promising information. One thing I repeatedly see online are doctors saying that if your periods are so intense that you cannot function correctly in your daily life, you have a right to seek medical attention. My situation is complicated and my story is long but I hope I can find some answers. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I go to the hospital quite frequently but they never check my ears they just do blood work. No one can figure out what is causing this. Thank you in advance. 0 likes, 6 replies "

So far I am lucky as I am not suffering with vertigo which is a blessing. However I feel the tinnitus is worse and at night when laying down I have the fullness feeling.  Sometimes when I wake up through the night it feels like I might pass out..a fainting feeling.  I realize now that I probably won't because it is more of the feeling in my ears.  My body does not feel like I am going to faint...just the feeling in my ears.  If anyone reading this has fainted before, you know the feeling ...very hard to describe. I am not on any medication whatsoever for menieres.  I also find that trips in the car make my ears worse ... tinnitus is louder.  I do not notice it in the car only after I get out for a while or the next day. Just wondering if I am alone with these symptoms or if anyone has any advise. Many thanks! 0 likes, 2 replies "

I had 7mg but I don't remember the name of the steroids injections(once I get the letter from the GP I will update it). I was given a general anesthesia before the injection and the procedure was done in a theatre. I guess the procedure only lasted about 20-30 mins. I had a slightly vertigo attack after the injection and vomiting as well. However I was discharged from the day care unit about 8pm with co-codamol and anti sickness medicine. I still have a stinging sensation to my ear slight headache and slight tinnitus ( they are quiet bearable). I am still on the betahistine 32mg 3 times daily which my consultant asked me to continue with. I still have a feeling like the vertigo might trigger back with some activity and movement with my head. I have a follow up appointment with my consultant in 2 months time and he said that gentamicin injections would be next if the steroids didn't work. So basically only one steroids injection and that's it, I am waiting for it to kick in, hopefully it works and my vertigo attacks don't come anymore. 0 likes, 6 replies "

Been lucky, had a year without vertigo,nausea and vomiting. Constant low level tinnitus though and mild hearing loss. Had a yearly revision just after Christmas and my hearing apparently better than previous year! Then two days later...nausea and fullness plus noticeable hearing loss and tinnitus jumped up a huge level. When I went through a series of really bad attacks between September and December 2018 I went to a private specialist ENT and he prescribed corticoids for a short period plus added diuretic to my serc intake and my episodes stopped until now. I repeated short term of corticoids again, helped with the fullness but the louder than ever tinnitus persists and for last two days mild dizziness and bad hearing loss in left ear. I'm under a bit of personal stress at the moment, could that be a factor? Is this likely to be permanent or is there anything I can do to help reduce it?

In my left ear, it's like someone turns on a tap and all I can hear is a rush of water then I get extreme dizziness and vomiting. Only yesterday I had another episode where I ended up on the floor of my bathroom at 3.30pm and never managed to get up from the floor until nearer 9pm. The symptoms I get are, dizziness, vomiting, tiredness, ringing in the ear, lack of sleep, frustration and sometimes the odd headache. I've been to the doctors, had an MRI, went to ENT, prescribed histamines and anti sickness tablets but still it persists. I feel like it's starting to take over my life, I'm worried about going away for work,days out, holidays etc. I'm wondering if any of you who are going through something similar can give me advice for ways to handle these symptoms, especially the dizziness.

She was unable to walk at her own and fell twice, luckily without hurting herself .She was rushed to the hospital where doctor‚Äôs initial findings were that it was TIA. Her EEG showed intermittent dominant left temporal sharp and slow waves. However her brain MRI and brain CT were normal without any abnormality .Her 48 hours heart Holter monitoring showed no abnormality .Doctors were unable to find cause of this attack. However they started giving her Levetiracetam HPL  500 mg and Lamotrigine 25 mg daily. She was discharged from the hospital after 3 days .She has lot of weakness and can hardly walk at her own. She has discontinued the new medicines  after noticing the severe side effects .She has her follow up appointments with the cardiologist and neurologist  next week .In the meanwhile I request Group members to provide their valuable input which may be helpful for my wife‚Äôs treatment. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I have managed to submit the remaining pieces of work for the course so I should pass my degree but the whole thing is very embarassing.¬† has anyone got any idea what this is? if this is just a stress response do people eventually come around? what advice would you give? could it be something physical? Its in the title but my hair is also much thinner than it used to be and doesnt grow anywhere near as quick??¬† I'm lost, this is ruining my life. Ive tried getting back into the things I used to enjoy like football but when I play I just feel zoned out and drunk. I get zero enjoyment from doing anything or talking to anybody in this state. Im so confused. If anyone could give some advice it would be greatly appreciately, as my life has quite simply stopped being worth living. I will just add that I was happy with everything I had in my life prior to this coming on¬†so I dont believe it to be depression. ¬† Sorry for the poor structure of this post.¬† 2 likes, 14 replies "

So, i started on 10mg alternate days and built up slowly. i am now at the point of going from 15mg/20mg alternate days to 20mg each day (i have taken 20mgs each day for 4 days now). i have had a few decent-ish days. yesterday and today i feel uneasy again. could this be due to the increase from 15mg to 20mg? would this small increase cause this even though ive been taking the drug for a while? i have feelings of heart skipping beats still (which i had before i started the citalopram) which have been checked out.  i go to the gym and walk kids to school each day. im just starting to get fed up of these up and down feelings. i start to feel that im getting there and then i feel horrible again. i just want me back!! Sorry if this sounds a rant but im feeling disheartened by it all. 0 likes, 7 replies "

I have had many concerns with my own ideas of whether or not I have some type of disorder or mental health problem. Going on forums like this isn't the best idea and I understand that, but since my resources/budget cannot make room for therapy, I want to collect a list of ideas before I finally have the chance to go to an appointment. Please read with caution, this gets a little extreme fast. There's been a lot of happenings in my life. I remember having troubles with my anger starting at a younger age, like when I threw my bike and helmet down when my friends picked on my training wheels. The anger was dormant for a while until I experienced an increased amount of problems with my male guardian who had a drinking problem. It never directly affected me. I began fearing/hating him way before that (when I was around the age of 2-4 ish), so to watch him harm my female guardian only fueled that. Once he threatened to ""hurt"" her, I stepped in to stop it. After that, every argument would leave me huddled in a corner, rocking back and forth, panicking, hyperventilating, crying, etc. It was an ugly sight. Both my fear of their fights and my fear of being sick (I think the term is hypocondriac) have caused me to be called crazy by my female guardian. Anyway, there was one time where she and I went to bed and his continued to drunkenly berate and name-call her for hours. Eventually, I got upset enough to punch a wall. After that, every time I got angry, I would hit a wall or door to relieve my anger. The numbing then stinging pain felt good. Starting in elementary school, I found comfort in playing pretend, whether alone or with friends. I mostly did it alone, it felt more comfortable. However, I could never get out of it. It was a habit I couldn't break. Up to my late teens, I still did it to some extent. If I didn't, I would be irritable. If I had the urge to, I felt like I needed to drop everything and do it. For a while, I could just forget my surroundings existed and I could picture the world I imagine as if it were completely real. Once I was older, it was a little harder, but I could encourage it by using music. I have self-esteem issues where I'll think negatively about myself. It ranges from being stupid, annoying, worthless, fat, mean, and more. I think it stems from my female guardian berating me for messing up chores or messing up activities I just learned to do. It did get bad enough that I took it out on myself. I couldn't get myself to use a knive, so I used my fingernails to claw across my arms. Once I had an income, it changed to using an X-acto knife to make little marks down my arm that would heal after a few days. I enjoyed doing it and I thought of it as little ""works of art"", something beautiful to my eye. Other forms of this included both starving myself for days or purposefully filling myself with food until I'm sick. I'll have moments where my emotions feel numb/nonexistent and I'll feel too distant to do anything, even what I used to enjoy. Family has said I have anxiety, because I tend to panic and overthink very easily. It is easy to overload my senses, especially if I'm not in a good mood. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be normal, but every once in a while, I'll get voices. Just someone who shows up and tells me to do odd things and I'll get this strong urge to do it that I can barely fight. Examples would be how I can't hold sharp knives for long, because it will tell me to bring it to my neck, or remove my clothes in public. This may be related a may not be, but I have memories of someone yelling suddenly from behind a doorframe when I was the only one home or someone whispering my name as I'm trying to sleep. I have a bad memory. I usually can't remember things like what was for dinner the night before. I think this is normal, though, so I don't pay much attention to it. This is a lot for you all to take in, but I just wanted help brainstorming ideas of things I could have. My thought process is that having a list may make it easier for me to talk to someone and could help quicken a diagnosis. Thank you so much for reading all of this. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Please help ,"Hi, I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to talk about this but I‚Äôm getting desperate for any advice or just someone who understands what I‚Äôm talking about because no one seems to. Basically, I‚Äôm very very obsessed with how I look. I know that sounds really vain, but it‚Äôs not like that, I don‚Äôt wanna be perfect or look perfect, I just wanna feel comfortable with myself? If that makes any sense? I have this big insecurity particularly with my jaw and chin, as I believe its severely weak, but others say they don‚Äôt see it that way. Recently I got work done on it, I had chin and jawline filler and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve wanted since I was 16 years old (I‚Äôm 18 now) so you can imagine how relieved I felt knowing this feeling  was gonna be fixed. its been a few days now and i feel like its made me obsess over it more, I see absolutely LITTLE difference sometimes then other times I‚Äôll see a nice shape but I keep seeing it as ‚Äúit‚Äôs disappeared and gone back to its old shape‚Äù (I‚Äôve only had it since Friday.) but it constantly changes, while others say they see a great change although I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt need it‚Äù. Now I‚Äôm obsessing with how I‚Äôm gonna keep up with the filler, and it‚Äôs driving me crazy. A similar thing happens with my body, for example I have a jacket that Used to fit me nicely but it‚Äôs too big on me now which made me feel great but when I look in the mirror I see completely overweight. I walk around with a fake clip in fringe every single day because I‚Äôm concerned with how big my forehead is, I draw a fake hairline on with eyeshadow whenever I don‚Äôt wear the fringe (which is really rare) I know others may do this as it‚Äôs a common insecurity for some, but I will not leave the house unless I 1) have either a fake fringe to cover my head or colour in my hairline 2) heavily contour my jawline (and then I‚Äôm never satisfied and constantly trying to hide it while I‚Äôm out). I never realised how bad it was until I got my jaw done, I‚Äôm still not satisfied. I didn‚Äôt get too much filler as I went with what was recommended to me, and honestly I‚Äôm not the richest person in the world, I literally saved up everything I have in order to pay for this when others usually have it as a ‚Äútreat‚Äù, I had it done because I just wanted to feel comfortable with myself. I‚Äôve tried accepting myself for years, and it‚Äôs just not working. I go to college 4 days a week and there‚Äôs days where I have to leave early because I can‚Äôt handle sitting there knowing people can see me and how I look, I cant seem to relax without looking at myself and making sure it‚Äôs not gone or my forehead isn‚Äôt ‚Äúexposed‚Äù . There‚Äôs a lot more I could explain but I don‚Äôt wanna make this too long lol I‚Äôm so sorry for the lengthy post, but does anyone have any experience with this type of stuff? should i talk to my gp? I‚Äôm terrified of my own mind cause I feel like it‚Äôs playing mind tricks on me, but im also scared to talk to someone just incase they also think im being vain and stupid. Its truly making me miserable. 0 likes, 4 replies "

I‚Äòm a 31 year old male, slightly overweight but generally ok (I hop On 29th Feb 2029 I was sick (throwing up) on a Saturday evening - through the nose and mouth. This was after a day drinking and eating fatty food. The next day I was fine until late afternoon when I started to get a tension/pressure   across my temples. I didn't worry too much and thought it would go by the next day. I've had this type of headache before, brain tumour worries before (about 6 years ago) and I got through it. Next day I woke up and it hadn't gone. It was a dull band type feeling, mainly on my temples and front of face around nose and eye sockets. This hasn't gone at all over these past 4 weeks - 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A nose feels a little stuffy but I've had a sinus infection before and it doesn't feel 100% like that. Last few days I've started to worry about my vision - blury/unfocused eyes when looking at something for a period of time, especially at a TV or PC, and it clears when a blink. I also have a slight sensitivity to bright light like the sun and eyes feel sore. I have also started to get a strange feeling in the right side of my face and body - not numb but like a weird tingle type feeling, mainly between my ear and jaw (cheek area). My ears have started to have the odd sharp pain. Headaches have been consistent with the odd pain or blocked feeling. I can exercise as normal, I don't have any balance etc issues or speech. The headache does seem to be worse in the morning (more pressure) when I wake up buy ok when laying down. I do feel more pressure, especially above the nose and around it when bending over. I've also had some muscle twitching which I've had before with MND/ALS fears. I've been (obviously) googling a lot, trying to get any answer that I'm ok. Due to the lockdown I'm unable to see a GP or get my vision tested (though I did have it tested about a month ago and nothing major came up - they took photo of eye and did pressure test a well). Is this anything to be seriously concerned about? My main worry is Brain tumour which makes me very anxious so anything that helps put my mind to rest on that front (why it isn‚Äôt) would be great. I keep trying to think I wouldn‚Äôt get all of these symptoms so quickly and at the same time. Anyone in the same boat or has had this type of thing before that can give me some advice/support that will help? Thanks as always forum! You've really helped me in the past. 0 likes, 2 replies "

As I kinda of 'woke up' from it, the floating, dreamy feeling slowly dissipated. My first thoughts were ""What happened? What day is it?"" Thinking a little more, I determined these things: it is February 6th 2020, the time was most likely around late 5pm (when I get home and online), I was getting a YouTube video pulled up, I need to make sure if people tried to message me. I opened my phone to find that it was actually around 2pm on March 30th, 2020. This completely threw me off. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't remember anything that actually happened during February and March. When opening my phone fully, I noticed an old, upsetting text message conversation was open that I don't remember going to. Later, I noticed I had a planner, so I opened it to the notes section at the end of each month (I opened to March), then immediately messaged my friends and family asking if there was anything important in the last two months I needed to remember. I wrote all answers down in that section. Usually, I am pretty forgetful, but not this bad. During this whole time, I'm panicking very, very hard. In between messages, I'd have to get up and pace around the bedroom to control my breathing. I felt incredibly nauseous. At some point, I'd lose balance or forget how I normally write.

I remember having a hard time speaking and my train of thought kept getting lost. At some point, hearing myself talk felt foreign, as if I couldn't recognize it was my own voice, like it was a stranger's. Though, over time, I was slowly getting back certain memories from the past two months. Not everything, but a few things. They didn't think it could be anything physically hurting me or my nerves, which led to the only two remaining options to be either something mentally wrong or something chemically wrong. They drew blood, and I have not heard from them yet. I'm very curious as to what this could have been. This is the first happening of it.

I have had osteomyelitis in my spinal cord and it's been almost two years since. I still have very bad pain in my back .  I just had an MRI done , the third and my doctor says it very much improved . I spent almost a year where I could hardly walk and had a pic line in for almost four months.  Just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and does anyone know the long term prognosis ? It feels like my spine is being pulled apart . I'm 59 years old and worked my whole life. I filed for disability because I'm losing everything I worked my whole life to build. Am I alone? Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thx 1 like, 4 replies "

Please Help!,"I been having bad breath since i ¬†was a teenager, I am in my mid 40's now and still have the same problem. usually gum would do the job and no problem, but now gum is not working for me any longer and my breath doesn't only smell like bad breath, it now smells like a fart. it is getting stronger to the point that someone 10 feet away from me can now smell it and people start saying ""yuck someone farted"" not knowing who it is so I act stupid and pretend it wasnt me. everywhere I go now I keep my mouth closed cuz if very little tiny breath comes out it can cause a big smell. please help me anyone, please. it is very depressing and sad to have to feel this way and having to stay away from people makes me feel lonely. i tried Dr Kats gargles which is considered the only cure for bad breath but even that didn't work for me. I am not a smoker, but the only time my mouth dont smell bad is when i smoke because it will smell like tobacco but i dont want my breath to smell like that cuz it is a nasty smell for me and for others. I been told that getting rid of my natural teeth and getting fake teeth or teeth implant can help but i cannot affor that. please help me, please!  3 likes, 30 replies "

Opinions please.,"Hello everyone, Me: 30 yo, recent extensive blood tests came back on except for higher than normal hemogloben (gradual increase over 3 years) I drunk heavily in 2018  other than that I don't drink. I smoked meth regularly in the year 2019 and I quit jan 2020. I dont smoke cigarettes or anything else. I have seen a dentist when it was originally a painful ulcer and she couldnt see anything wrong with it. Its been in my tongue now for 3 weeks. It has changed from painful to no longer painful. I can feel two hard tinytiny balls in the side of my tongue and theyre not painful unlesss i squeeze them hard. I saw a GP and he said it could be thrush, gave me some tablets to suck on and said come back in 3 weeks.. I'm worried this is something far more sinister and I dont want to wait 3 weeks if people here can give me a reason to go back and demand I get a referral to the ENT. Am I being ridiculous? 0 likes, 0 replies "

My right hip is gone I need a total hip replacement, and I started having problems walking like my legs don't want to work about 3 months ago, since learned that the arthritis in my lumbar spine is severe, waiting for an MRI because the doctor thinks I have some kind of nerve compression or nerve damage. He also said the rest of the spine surely has some issues to, just from looking at how bad everything else is. Just ordered ex-rays again to see if the left hip is also gone or if most of that pain is from the back problems. I am worried I will end up in a wheelchair. I have had arthritis for several years and have been taking Tramadol and Ibuprofin 600 three times a day each for quite some time now, but the pain has become so severe that does not take care of it all. The Orthopedic doctor gave me two steroid shots in the lower spine area a couple of days ago, and that helped with the shooting pains going down my legs and buttocks (he said he thought was nerve pain), and that did help quite a bit with that part of the pain.

I'm Canadian but spent 20 years in Europe working as a chef (apparently worked my fingers to the bone!) I'm now back in rural Canada to be closer to my elderly parents.  In any case,  I was quickly diagnosed with advanced CMC arthritis in the UK and offered surger,  but made the decision to get back to Canada for my parent's sake first, thinking it wouldn't be a problem to sort it out there. Well, do I ever regret not having surgery in the UK! It's been an uphill battle here. The first two doctors I saw mocked my condition - the first told me to ''suck it up - we all have age-related aches and pains'' ,  and that he'd never heard of anyone having  surgery to correct it. The second said she didn't believe this surgery was covered under our health care system and that I'd have to have it privately done in the States at my own cost.  I was about to give up when I saw a third doctor who agreed to refer me to a rheumatologist.  It took eight months to get an appointment and another many months to see an orthopaedic surgeon. Here we are, two years later and I'm finally getting my surgery in two weeks. The harried surgeon talked me into doing both thumbs at once. I know this is completely bonkers, especially as I live alone on a rural acreage and have little support. Why did I agree? Well, I couldn't bear to go through the whole process of waiting again, and I desperately need to get back to work. My career as a chef has been impossible without functioning hands and I've had to take anything else I could find where thumbs weren't terribly required! Ok - so here's my question; has anyone else had both thumbs done at once, and if so, what are your top tips to get through the recovery? I haven't found ANYONE on the whole internet who has had both at once, so this forum is my last resort. Please, no anti-national health care comments please.

The only real symptom i have is a sudden onset of my right testicle sensitive to the touch. I wouldn‚Äôt say it hurts or aches because that would imply that I felt it if I were sitting still, which I do not. But touching the area is very sensitive.  There may be slight swelling but I cannot confirm. There is no blood in urine or semen, and no pain when urinating or ejaculating. I had a vasectomy about a year and a half ago, which resulted in some similar pain for a short time, but has been fine ever since.  I am only sexually active with my wife. I also just traveled on a long flight and spent a significant time in the car, so I'm not sure if it could be related to sitting for a long period of time. Any thoughts would help.

There is currently no pain, or any type of discharge , and no blood in urine or semen. The only thing is the dark purple discoloration which seems to reduce and increase in darkness from day to day. I do have a doctor's appointment, but it's not until the end of the month. I was hoping someone might have some ideas as to the cause for this.

If you don't like long reads, you can jump to the questions in the end. I used to suffer from severe pain due to a large Varicocele in my left side. I noticed it usually became worse when sitting a lot. As I work at the computer, I started standing and laying down instead, which eased the variocele and pain somewhat, but never really healed it. And who wants to avoid sitting for the rest of your life anyway? I did ton of research on the topic and tried everything I could find. I found lots of interesting posts online about how imbalance in the pelvic floor and stomach spasm could lead to varicocele. After trying out yoga and certain stretches for months without results, I ended up throwing in the towel and went with varicocelectomy surgery. A few months after surgery, I felt better and I could sit again without any pain and with little to no discomfort. I started going back to the gym and daily routines, although I avoided sitting as much as possible. The only time I could feel the varicocele come back a little and cause pain was when I had sex (fast and hard thrusting) or when squeezing/holding the penis during masturbation (how is this even possible?). One day at the gym, I did crunches/situps to the sides and the next day, my varicocele was almost as bad as prior to operation. Right now my pain is really bad in the side of the stomach near the hip and same altitude as the belly button. It hurts sitting again, but it's worse in the stomach than in the scrotum. I did have an ultrasound to rule out kidney cancer etc, and the doctors now just seem to shrug off my problem. I haven't heard about this anywhere, so perhaps someone can shed some light in here. I am otherwise young and perfectly healthy and I eat only lean meat, lots of vegetables and some fruits. Questions I would love to have answered by a professional/experienced patient: 1. Can a varicocele happen due to constant spasm/contractions in pelvic/abdomen? 2. How can squeezing the penis shaft result in a painful varicocele? The veins are not directly connected are they? 3.

I have been suffering from testicular and leg pains for almost 4 years now, and I have not find a way to treat these issues. My left testicle started hurt suddenly with a sharp pain. I went to my family medicine and diagnosed as epididymitis (I wasn't sexually active). So my doctor prescribed a doxycycline (antibiotic) and 600 mg of ibuprofen.  After taking this medicine somehow the pain went away.  Every time, pain comes back randomly, I got a same prescription, but the pain started to spread into my left leg, inner thigh, and center of my left bottom foot.

Sometimes the pain doesn't relate to how much I'm moving though, it can just randomly get bad, I actually first experienced the pains while laying in bed. I feel like sitting on the chair makes it worse.

At same time, this new doctor recommend chiropractic to adjust my scoliosis. I went to chiropractic for 8 month (which didn't help with pain) while taking GABAPentin. GABAPENTIN DOES reduce the pain, but it does not treat or cure the leg and testicular pain. I also had ultrasound 3 times (2 from family medicine 1 from urology) and diagnosed that I have tiny kidney stone on the left kidney, but doctor told me this size of kidney stone does not cause any problem or pain. Urologist told me that my left testicle is larger than right testicle (maybe this is a sign of varicocele?), but he said it is normal.  Lastly, I took X-ray around my lumbar and sacrum area to see if there are any pinched nerve, but nothing was wrong. What I realized is that when I put my pillow between my low back and upper hip for 15-20 minutes, it reduces the pain.

GABAPENTIN DOES reduce the pain, but it does not treat or cure the leg and testicular pain. I also had ultrasound 3 times (2 from family medicine 1 from urology) and diagnosed that I have tiny kidney stone on the left kidney, but doctor told me this size of kidney stone does not cause any problem or pain. Urologist told me that my left testicle is larger than right testicle (maybe this is a sign of varicocele?), but he said it is normal.  Lastly, I took X-ray around my lumbar and sacrum area to see if there are any pinched nerve, but nothing was wrong. What I realized is that when I put my pillow between my low back and upper hip for 15-20 minutes, it reduces the pain. My conclusion is either I have some kind of prostate problem (such as Benign prostatic hyperplasia because I have frequent urination and delay in starting urination) and varicocele. I really want to fix the problem and get rid of the pain. I'd be really grateful for any feedback, thanks. 0 likes, 7 replies "

Anyhow, two/three days ago he had blood when he had a bowel movement and it has freaked him out a bit. Fast forward to today and his ultrasound they said that everything in his testicles looked okay apart from prominent veins, they then said that they needed to scan his kidneys but he doesn't know why and he is freaking out majorly, and thinks he has cancer or something!

Additional extreme sharp pain occurred within the right testicle during the moment of ejaculation/climax.  I visited my Primary Care Physician for blood work and thorough physical.

Full Pelvic and Abdominal CT scan was performed with no abnormal results. PCP referred me to a Urologist.  Urologist evaluated CT and added Ultrasound of testicles, again with no abnormal results.  Urologist prescribed FLOMAX which provided some reduction, although not elimination, of the pain however contained undesirable side effects.  Subsequently the Urologist prescribed ALFUZOSIN ER 10MG which like FLOMAX provided some reduction in the pain however did not eliminate the pain while still incurring severe pain during ejaculation with less negative side effects.  After nearly 9 months of ongoing treatment by the Urologist, the Urologist prepared me for the likelihood this could be a non-bacterial Prostatitus which may not be able to be treated effectively.   I had delayed a umbilical hernia repair until the testicular/Pelvic/Abdominal pain was resolved.  Facing the reality the Urologist had exhausted the investigation with no significant improvement and being prepared the pain could be a pain I would have to accept as the new normal, I conveyed to the urologist that I would proceed to meet with a surgeon to have the Umbilical Hernia repaired.  In doing so, it triggered a long shot potential cause from the Urologist that I may possibly have an inguinal hernia which may not have shown up in the CT scan.  The Urologist recommended I ask the surgeon to investigate for an Inguinal Hernia while performing the Umbilical Hernia Repair. Upon meeting with the Surgeon, the Surgeon immediately suspected the pain was that of a Inguinal Hernia.  The Surgeon performed a physical exam and found no evidence of an Inguinal Hernia however indicated they are easily missed and ordered a MRI of the Pelvis in an attempt to discover if there was in fact an Inguinal Hernia.  The MRI of the Pelvis did not indicate the presence of Inguinal Hernia.  During the prep of the Umbilical Hernia surgery, the surgeon and I discussed the possibility that there was a slim chance the MRI missed an Inguinal Hernia.  The Surgeon elected to investigate while performing the Umbilical Hernia repair and in fact found not one but two Inguinal Hernia's (one one the right and one on the left side of the pelvis where the testicular vesicles penetrate the abdominal wall).  The result was a second hernia repair surgery to repair the two Inguinal Hernia's (missed by both a CT and MRI scan).  Nearly immediately there was a significant (80+%) reduction in testicular/pelvis/abdominal pain.  The surgeon indicated the pain may fully go away however prepared me for the reality that the pain may not be fully eliminated.  Within two months post surgery the pain is 99% gone (rarely will I encounter a mild flanking soreness in the abdominal area.  Testicular pain 100% eliminated) I am posting this to aid others whom may be experiencing the same conditions as I was diligently searching for the cause of my pain and a treatment to resolve.
