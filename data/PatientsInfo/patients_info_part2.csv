2,C0272285,Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia,C0015672,Fatigue,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/help-severe-dissociation-719645,HELP!! Severe Dissociation,"Has anyone with complex PTSD (but no specific trauma memory) had severe dissociation where they've lost time and were not in control during the time they dissociated. And it was at a time where they were not at all stressed, simply calm but a little tired and did not expect to dissociate (which is often the case with me). Vs. when you dissociate but are still partially present and in control of your actions. I've seen a neurologist and a million therapists over the years and nothing has helped me stop the dissociation but until I hit perimenopause I was still always in control while I dissociated. But since peri it has gotten crazy worse. Would love to know I'm not the only one or some advice. Thx ladies. 0 likes, 9 replies "

All this stuff has ever done is cause me to become numb minded, seriously over weight and unsociable to the point i have become nocturnal so that i never have to even see another person. it no longer helps me sleep in fact i am also full of anger and hate noise or people. i skulk around my 24hour supermarket at 3 - 5am so i dont have to speak to anyone . self service checkout is great for this. i wasnt like this before these meds . I wasnt exactly a social butterfly but i didnt nearly die from a panic attack if someone approached me outside to ask for the time or pet my dog (who also now shares my isolated nocturnal existence) I have tried several times to stop this meds without success. every doc i ever spoke to just looked at me like im stupid whenever i mention my problems blaming it all on my PTSD but i know my own mind. I have had PTSD for years and years and was able to function better before this stuff was given to me. i now have a weight problem, headaches, anger, cannot work due to excess weight causing back problems and  . i am thinking about death every single day. I am constantly expecting horrible things like a arson attack on my home, someone murdering me while walking the dog at night, i keep a log of unfamiliar cars on my street, im i am obsessively clean. i am emotional. i have recently reduced my dose from 45mg to 30mg last month and next month i will be doing 30mg one day and 15mg the next etcetera for 2 months then go for 15mg for 2 months then 15mg one day then half a pill (7.5mg) the next etcetera for 2 months then half a pill (7.5mg) for a month then stop altogether. i have been advised to do this by a doctor i saw last month. this doctor was a new doctor i have never seen before because he was standing in for my regular doc who was on leave and he suggested this as the best way to stop taking it. he is also the first and only doctor i have met who 100% agreed that mirtazapine is a awful drug and is absolutely unsuitable for my condition and if he had been my original doctor he would never have put me on it. Therapy is what i need but I have been waiting for so long now that i dont even want to speak to a therapist. I need to talk with someone who has been through the same as me, someone who understands what its like to be abandoned and abused as a kid and or knows what its like to be shot by a gunman on a motorcycle in a murder attempt on me, someone who understands what its like to be awoken by a house on fire in a second murder attempt and absolutely nobody on either occassion being arrested or charged because the local police force were working for gangsters who had more power and influence than them. all of this when i was 17 years old and i am now nearly 40 and still living in hell. 0 likes, 0 replies 0 likes, 9 replies "

Anyone else,"I went deaf for 7 weeks in left ear and became worried that it was related to PsA. I have had PsA in my jaw a while back and had to change biologic therapy drug because of it from Etanercept to Certolizumab Pegol as a result. To cut a long story short, I did have wax in my ears so needed specialist help to remove from my very narrow ear canals. Great - hearing restored! What a relief! BUT Ear and neck ache remained...jaw slightly swollen. ENT specialist feels jaw - is now clicking both sides and come to think of it I'm biting my tongue a lot. Rheumatology appointment rolls up shortly after...mmm my wrists swollen (knew one was) and my fingers...just had not noticed as well as my jaw. Growl!  *********** ! Not happy when a Third Biologic is suggested  Secukinumab -  and it will need to be double the normal injectable dose. Possibly a steroid shot into my jaw as well I can see the end of the line in the mists ahead. Has anyone else been in this situation? There are new drugs all the time but is my body learning to overcome them?   0 likes, 0 replies "

I cannot tolerate co-codamol or tramdol - I vomit. My kidneys say no to NSAIDS of any sort these days too leaving me somewhat short of pain relief. I found the Butrans patches one of the best methods of delivering pain relief. Not having to remember to pill pop every 6 hours was a blessed relief. My GP changed the prescription from Butrans to Butec a generic, and I assume a lot cheaper. I checked it on line and found it was meant to be identical to Butrans. Unfortunately about 2 weeks after starting Butec I started getting a skin reaction under the patch. Week 1 was mildish, Week 2 lifted the skin off after removal of the patch and week 3 lasted 36 hours before I hastily removed it. Nothing had changed prescription wise apart from the change from Butrans to Butec.  Anyone else suffered this reaction? 1 like, 15 replies "

All I actually want is some advice about the creams they keep prescribing not just more of the same! Long story short. For around 15 years every winter I get what I thought was simple Eczema, essentially very dry itchy skin on the back of my calves, arms, torso and around the hairline on my face. Went to my GP many times over the years and they never gave me an actual diagnosis and kept saying ""come back when it's really bad and we'll take a look"". The problem was that it never got visibly bad but it would itch like hell and then I would scratch so much that I'd damage the skin. Eventually they prescribed a steroid cream and whilst it didn't cure it, it would make it go away for several days and the skin would return to looking like 'normal' and wasn't dry and flaky. Then around 2 months ago I started getting red patches appear on my skin. At first I thought it was the Eczema but then it got worse and it would start to flake badly and then crack and bleed. In other areas it would present as raised shiny patches of skin which after several days would then crust over. Off to the GP who said it was a fungal infection, several weeks of anti fungal treatment and it was no better, in fact worse. They then prescribed a mild steroid and that helped but the skin never returned to normal looking and shortly after stopping the cream, it would return. Back to the GP who referred me to a dermatologist who within 1 minute said ""oh that Psoriasis"". He then prescribed me Eumovate Ointment but said he'd give me another cream to use as well but that he couldn't prescribe that only my GP could??? When I saw the GP she couldn't understand why they couldn't prescribe this other cream and they hadn't received a letter from the Dermatologist so just sent me home with more Eumovate. The trouble is that the Eumovate Ointment is a tiny tube and what was originally meant to last at least 2 weeks, ran out after less than a week and that was after being very careful with the dosage. I have it literally head to toe in patches on all sides of my body so a 30g tube is never going to cover those areas twice a day for 2 weeks! The good news is that the Eumovate did help, all the flaky skin stopped and the red patches grew much fainter but nowhere does the skin look 'normal' i.e. you can still see red patches but they aren't raw looking just a pinker than the skin around it. There is one area, the area that had the 'shiny raised red skin patches' that whilst now the skin isn't raised and isn't red, it is now a lighter colour than the skin around it. The question I wanted to ask my GP is simply, whilst I know Psoriasis isn't curable, should the skin return to 'normal' looking in between flare ups i.e. when do I stop using the creams? I've been told to only use the cream for 2 weeks in any month as it's a steroid which I totally understand but if the skin hasn't returned to 'normal' does that mean the strength of the steroid isn't sufficient or that after giving it a 2 week break I should use it again for 2 weeks or that I shouldn't use it unless it starts to flake/crack/bleed/spread again? The other question is there a link between Eczema/Dry Skin and Psoriasis? I've never understood how or why I suddenly started getting really itchy skin every winter. 0 likes, 2 replies "

The trouble is that the Eumovate Ointment is a tiny tube and what was originally meant to last at least 2 weeks, ran out after less than a week and that was after being very careful with the dosage. I have it literally head to toe in patches on all sides of my body so a 30g tube is never going to cover those areas twice a day for 2 weeks! The good news is that the Eumovate did help, all the flaky skin stopped and the red patches grew much fainter but nowhere does the skin look 'normal' i.e. you can still see red patches but they aren't raw looking just a pinker than the skin around it. There is one area, the area that had the 'shiny raised red skin patches' that whilst now the skin isn't raised and isn't red, it is now a lighter colour than the skin around it. The question I wanted to ask my GP is simply, whilst I know Psoriasis isn't curable, should the skin return to 'normal' looking in between flare ups i.e. when do I stop using the creams? I've been told to only use the cream for 2 weeks in any month as it's a steroid which I totally understand but if the skin hasn't returned to 'normal' does that mean the strength of the steroid isn't sufficient or that after giving it a 2 week break I should use it again for 2 weeks or that I shouldn't use it unless it starts to flake/crack/bleed/spread again? The other question is there a link between Eczema/Dry Skin and Psoriasis? I've never understood how or why I suddenly started getting really itchy skin every winter. 0 likes, 2 replies "

All I actually want is some advice about the creams they keep prescribing not just more of the same! Long story short. For around 15 years every winter I get what I thought was simple Eczema, essentially very dry itchy skin on the back of my calves, arms, torso and around the hairline on my face. Went to my GP many times over the years and they never gave me an actual diagnosis and kept saying ""come back when it's really bad and we'll take a look"". The problem was that it never got visibly bad but it would itch like hell and then I would scratch so much that I'd damage the skin. Eventually they prescribed a steroid cream and whilst it didn't cure it, it would make it go away for several days and the skin would return to looking like 'normal' and wasn't dry and flaky. Then around 2 months ago I started getting red patches appear on my skin. At first I thought it was the Eczema but then it got worse and it would start to flake badly and then crack and bleed. In other areas it would present as raised shiny patches of skin which after several days would then crust over. Off to the GP who said it was a fungal infection, several weeks of anti fungal treatment and it was no better, in fact worse. They then prescribed a mild steroid and that helped but the skin never returned to normal looking and shortly after stopping the cream, it would return. Back to the GP who referred me to a dermatologist who within 1 minute said ""oh that Psoriasis"". He then prescribed me Eumovate Ointment but said he'd give me another cream to use as well but that he couldn't prescribe that only my GP could???

Seventeen months ago I had a big bilateral PE. Been experiencing some chest pains since then, which from reading posts here is not an uncommon experience. The latest bout of chest pains started after Christmas and have been constantly present since then, sometimes worse than others. My cardiologist assures me that because they are not related to exertion they are not heart related. I am on permanent anticoagulants (dabigatran/pradaxa). Overall I know my health has been downhill, certainly in recent months. The thought of going for a decent walk (even just 4km) has me doubting my ability to manage it without needing a seat half way. A week ago I noticed shortness of breath beginning. At first it wasn't much, and I tried some old asthma inhalers to see if they helped (no). No surprises as the shortness of breath did not feel like asthma. On Thursday I visited my GP and she did blood tests and renewed my asthma inhalers. Over the course of the week the shortness of breath when doing physically mild activities (like walking around the supermarket) grew to the extent that I feared I might faint a couple of times. On Saturday night I decided that I wasn't happy being at home in this state and drove myself to the emergency department of the local hospital. The staff at the hospital were very attentive and I quickly had ECG, x-ray and MRI. While under rest in the ED my heart rate and blood pressure dropped considerably.  (I note that, unlike my PE, my blood oxygen levels were never a concern.) I was moved to a medical ward overnight, and, because the tests did not show any clot or items of major concern (some evidence of small clots in my lung, but they may be a remnant of my PE and unlikely to be of interest apparently), I was quickly discharged and sent home. The doctor thinks that the chest pain is possibly muscular pain in the chest wall following the PE and not of concern. No explanation is given for the shortness of breath. So, here I am. Very glad to not have a clot, but with no answers for the relatively recent onset of shortness of breath. A walk to the letterbox makes me breathless. Walking to my kitchen to make a cup of coffee is enough. This experience of breathlessness feels very similar to my PE. It seems that the medical hope is that it will improve automatically. Has anybody else experienced this in their post-PE journey? Any wisdom to bring? 0 likes, 13 replies "

I've also had back pain on and off for a few months in my middle back, which I have an mri scheduled for next week.

A few doctors think my pain and symptoms are caused by   and fear of  . Well I am lucky I asked for the ct bc it incidentally found a small suspicious   in my lower lung. Went to the ER and they did a CTA of my lungs and found it to be 2 small embolisms. My oxygen levels were 99% and I didnt really have symptoms. I stayed in the hospital for 2 nights and they did a ton of blood work which I'm still waiting on. They also repeated the Ab/pelvis ct with contrast and they found no abnormalities l, although the first ct showed rectal wall thickening and sigmoid colon thickening, which could have explained the rectal pressure. I am now taking eliquis while they wait for the blood results. I consider myself lucky and thankful I found it when it did, but I'm also even more anxious than ever because I am worried that a cancer caused these embolisms l, as I have read that it is a known risk factor. I have no family history of clots. The only think I can think of is my roadtrip 4 months ago from Fl to Tennessee  which is about 10 hours each way, we only really stopped once briefly. Also when I got back i started having the back pain which made me miss a lot of work and I laid on the couch for a ton of time. Would you feel comfortable attributing these are provoking factors? I am tired of living in fear of cancer, I was about to ask my girlfriend to marry me in September before all of this and I feel like I have so many things going on at once now. Back pain, rectal pain, embolism, I cant even repeat a colonoscopy now for at least a month. I feel like I am on my own with this medical stuff now and I don't know where to attack all this. I would really appreciate some advice. Also are CT Angiograms where they look at lungs able to detect  ?

It got worse over the day and I couldn't sleep at night because of it. Shortness of breath was much worse when lying down. Also started to develope some pretty bad back pain. I do get some sharp feelings when I breath deep. I have seen 2 doctors and I have gone to the ER 2 times. Doctors think I don't have PE. The second doctor also said that my leg and chest symptoms are ""seperate things"". in ER I had my vitals taken, blood pressure is good and heart rate is around 70-80. But It has been once over 100. It might have been because I'm so anxous about this. Oxygen saturation is at 99%. Chest x-ray and ECG are normal. After xray and ecg ER doctor said that ""ECG didn't indicate any sings of PE and xray was normal too"" ""we can rule out PE"". I'm not getting any help. I have still all the symptoms. It hurts to breath, Impossible to sleep because of shortness of breath, back pain.... It's a nightmare. My own doctor comes back to duty on monday, so I have to wait and call him. Maybe he can do D-dimer blood test for me. I'm scared because I think I might not make it to monday. This has been going on already for 6 days.  Also the tight feeling in my leg is back. Hurts mostly when climbing stairs. I know this post is just a mess, but I'm so anxious. Sorry guys. 0 likes, 31 replies "

In that time he has gone extremely downhill. He has been coughing for over 10 years. They told him he was 85% FVC predicted. He is currently on Sulfamethoxazole for infection, prednisone, and pirfe ne to slow the scarring. They also gave him a rescue inhaler, but told him to only use it 2x per day, which doesn't seem right if he finds he can't breath. They did not give him a second inhaler either. He also has oxygen tanks. In the past 4 weeks he has become almost unable to speak. He whispers out words one at a time and can barely get them out. From what I understood, 85% was MILD. But this doesn't seem mild and is progressing very quickly. He doesn't have an appointment until next month. He only has basic Medicaid through the VA hospital in California.

He is not on any of the anti fibrotic medication yet because on his lung function test he still blows just above 80%. We had his consultant appointment just last week and were basically told to discuss a DNAR. The words of the consultant were 'you have important conversations to have' rather than the fibrosis worsening it is his DLCO - which last August was 25% and has rapidly decreased by 2% each time he has seen his consultant.. By my workings out that means hes around 18% now. When I spoke to his GP separately he said he wouldn't be surprised if my grandad wouldn't be here within the next 12 months.. Of course I'm devastated to have heard those words, but at least we can plan a short holiday and give him the best we can with what we have left. Can anyone offer advice on DLCO? I know it is gas exchange etc but I just want someone to be straight with me. I know it won't be nice to hear but I need to make this year the best for him.

In the December of 2014 i was diagnosed with Spontaneous Pneumothorax in my left lung and treated with chest tube drainage (ICD) ,then a pleuroscopy showed i had multiple large blebs in the apex of my lung, so they did a VATS assisted bullectomy followed by a pleurodesis , also while removing the blebs, they also removed a segment of the apex of my lung. Later on, in the year of 2016 , i had a spontaneous pneumothorax in my right lung for which ICD tube was put and i was discharged once my lungs expanded. A month after that my right lung again collapsed , so again an ICD tube was placed and then pleurodesis was done. After this i had never again had any episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax. But just a year back I had a check up because i had little breathlessness on exertion and my PEFR showed severe restriction.  X-ray was normal. Someone (i would like to rather not say who) said to me that it is because of the pleurodesis and there's nothing to worry. I still have breathlessness on exertion and on normally lying down my respiratory rate is 24cpm. Just yesterday while climbing up 3 floors i had rapid breathing. I read some articles on VAT surgery with talc pleurodesis... and there are studies which say that it causes only minimal long term adverse effects and short term effects like ARDS is rare. Now i do not know what to think of this report. So is it that I have severe restriction which is caused by Talc pleurodesis and that's tottally normal? Even if Talc is causing it, how is it doing so? By fibrosis? And if so...then can i say i have pulmonary fibrosis? and if that is so , my prognosis ain't so good then because it progresses , ain't it? Please correct me if am wrong.

I went on a low dose of gabapentin and nortriptyline, which I'm still on (it's about 6 weeks since my rash first appeared). Three weeks ago, my dermatologist gave me steroid shots in the spots where I told him it hurt. He numbed the skin first and his assistant also blew very cold air onto the spot while he gave me the shot. The pain of the shot wasn't too bad, really, even in my armpit. He gave me many shots. It took at least a week to 10 days to feel a reducton of pain in those spots. I returned to him a week ago for more shots in the spots that still hurt. I felt relief more quickly this time, but he also gave me lots more shots than the first time. I have another appt. with him next week. These shots have been a godsend, as I wasn't able to wear a shirt or bra for weeks due to the pain. I'm almost back to normal now. I wouldn't call it pain anymore. It's now just a feeling of minor irritation where it used to hurt like heck. I don't know why I can't find any information on the internet about these steroid shots for shingles pain. I want everyone to know about them. I also went to my family doctor once about the shingles. She prescribed the gabapentin and anti-depressant. When I asked my dermatologist why she hadn't mentioned the steroid shots, he said that she wouldn't have been trained in that. I highly recommend the steroid shots. I believe my dermatologist told me that there is also a bit of lidocaine in those shots, but I'm not sure I'm right about that. Hope this info can help someone. 0 likes, 29 replies "

I believe my dermatologist told me that there is also a bit of lidocaine in those shots, but I'm not sure I'm right about that. Hope this info can help someone. 0 likes, 29 replies "

I've discovered there's a list of things that if I do them my days get worse, such as: Running, Walking, Aerobics, sweeping, moving around for hours (hours of shopping is fun but I'm down for two days).  I've had to start lifting weights to get exercise.  Pants sting so I work from the office 1/2 a day and the other from home so I can get relief.  Does anyone else notice that what you do makes the pain worse, or is it just me???   My oh so smart brain keeps telling me that nerve damage just hurts regardless what you do, but I swear what I do affects it greatly.  I swear I'm starting to go nutso. Also weather changes... do they affect you?? FYI: I take Gabapentin regularly and use Lidocane patches (which are a God send), and then I have Butalb and Hydrocodone as needed.  But I don't like to take things so I take my Gab and Lido and I'm light on the others. 0 likes, 7 replies "

Its been very difficult for me over the past few months and honestly im doing my very best to fight it but some days its so much worse than others. No combination of medicine has seemed to help and only the combination of pethidine and morphine seems to only just take the edge off but within 2 hours of coming of this combo  my pain level is sky high again. i have tried mind over matter and meditation but its just not working and trust me im so strong willed im scared of myself. I dont want to swap one thing for another(PHN for pain med addiction) but im so completely lost im in so much pain most of the time that its constantly written on my face i thought i was hiding it well but obviously not well enough. The way my husband and kids and very close friends look at me with sheer helplessness i feel so extremely guilty im trying to hide how bad the pain is but im obviously not doing well enough. Why do they have to suffer ALSO am i not suffering enough for us all. Plz help me does anyone else feel the same?  If so how do u cope? I feel so much guilt. I just need to know that im not alone. Again i apologize profusely  for my complaining but i dont know who else but a PHN sufferer  would understand. Dont worry if ur not up to responding i just needed to write this down and feel like at least im doing my best to make it through another day.

I dont want to swap one thing for another(PHN for pain med addiction) but im so completely lost im in so much pain most of the time that its constantly written on my face i thought i was hiding it well but obviously not well enough.

149,C0032768,Postherpetic neuralgia,C0030193,Pain,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/promising-new-treatment-698361,Promising new treatment ,"After doing a fair amount of research, I asked my doctors about the possibility of ketamine treatment as a number of studies have demonstrated encouraging results. Apparently there are two types of treatment, both a quite serious and require direct infusions and staying in hospital for observation. I have yet to undergo the treatment and I have an appointment scheduled in 2 months at a specialised pain clinic. I have already met with a professor of pain management, who was very encouraging about the potential for a ketamine treatment for me. I am trying not get my hopes up, but after 5 and 1/2 years of pain I am pretty desperate for any treatment that can move me off a daily cocktail of powerful medications. Surprisingly, ketamine treatments are not widely discussed as possible treatments for PHN, despite the numerous successful trials. However, there was some publicity a few weeks ago about ketamine being used to treat depression. So if anyone is feeling hopeless and let down by the current course of prescribe medications I would strongly encourage you to ask you doctors and specialists about ketamine treatments. Once I know more after my appointment, I will try to post as much additional information as I can. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I've been a victim of PHN. My right torso, hip joint, right flank pain and spine involved. Horrible pain and on an off flares for more than a year. Did not take any medication for pain and tried many methods from herbal to food adjustment. My life has changed and i suffered from episodes of depression and anxiety. No one understand the type of pain we are going through. You have to be a patient with PHN to understand. This what works for me. At the beginning of my flare i take milk thistle supplement with 1000mg vitamin C daily and it helped a lot in easing the pain. I don't know if this will work for you but this combination helped me a lot. I wish you all a great health and please don't lose hope. Talal 0 likes, 1 reply "

If you have been prescribed  , opioid or otherwise, it is vitally important to take them regularly. For me this means takes tramadol and paracetemol every 8 hours. This is because there is a big difference in acute vs chronic pain. Most prescriptions or treatments are based on acute pain, where you are expected to take the medication whenever you feel pain.  There is some relief after 1-2 hours but then it slowly tapers off according to each drugs half-life. By taking the medication every 8 hours the half-life slowly starts to improve so that after 4-6 weeks, the pain relief is much more constant. This small change has dramatically changed my experience of pain and greatly improved my ability to function. What is shocking is that most GPs and even some specialists are not aware of this. I was only told about it by  a specialist pain clinic. So ask your doctor about it as soon as you can. Question wise, has anyone had a nerve block injection? Was there much relief, how long did it last? 0 likes, 7 replies "

I am the heaviest weight I have ever been. I've suffered with binge eating for years after a very restrictive diet and starving myself. it used to be a lot easier to lose weight when i gained a few pounds but now it seems near impossible. knowing how much I've gained makes me feel horrible, I hate my body and the amount of stretch marks that have developed is really upsetting me, half my clothes don't fit anymore and I have to make sure my stretch marks are hidden.  My stomach area is where all my fat seems to be storing which I'm guessing is the case for a lot of women with PCOS. no matter how hard I try the number on the scale doesnt go down if anything it goes up, I've tried really hard these past 2 months and have been to the gym 4 times a week consistently, lifting weights and doing cardio, yet still the number on the scale has gone up even though people tell me I've lost weight physically. Because of the excess weight I also have sleep apnea so i'm exhausted every day which makes me more likely to binge and the PCOS just makes it all 10 times worse due to my hormones and emotions being all over the place. I only get a period every 2-3 months and I get PMS symptoms for about 3 weeks until my period comes. during that time I am hungry ALL the time no matter how much / what I eat - i'm currently going through this which is ruining all my hard work from the last 2 months. I know losing weight will improve everything and I probably should tackle the binge eating first but its been 5 years and I still dont know how, when I went to the doctor in 2016 for binge eating he said 'what do you want me to do about it' which made me feel like i was overreacting and put me off seeking medical help for it. I'm stuck in a cycle that i'm desperate to get out of. I would appreciate any tips, thank you in advance xx 0 likes, 8 replies "

My stomach area is where all my fat seems to be storing which I'm guessing is the case for a lot of women with PCOS. no matter how hard I try the number on the scale doesnt go down if anything it goes up, I've tried really hard these past 2 months and have been to the gym 4 times a week consistently, lifting weights and doing cardio, yet still the number on the scale has gone up even though people tell me I've lost weight physically. Because of the excess weight I also have sleep apnea so i'm exhausted every day which makes me more likely to binge and the PCOS just makes it all 10 times worse due to my hormones and emotions being all over the place. I only get a period every 2-3 months and I get PMS symptoms for about 3 weeks until my period comes. during that time I am hungry ALL the time no matter how much / what I eat - i'm currently going through this which is ruining all my hard work from the last 2 months.

Would the fact I am missing periods have contributed to this in any way? I appreciate it is probably down to other factors but the weight gain timing ties in with when my periods stopped? Especially as well that the weight i've put on is most noticeable around my stomach and pelvic area.

I had no  , some pain and discomfort and started taking valacyclovir at first appearance of rash.  Six days ago I went outside (cold air) for first time in 2+ weeks and within the hour, experienced 2 attacks of sudden deep excruciating pain in my cheek.  Next day, I touched a scab on my skull and triggered the most sickening deep pain I've ever felt.  Later that night I had another attack this time from the area of my ear.  that day I started taking Gabapentin 300 mg 3 times/day.  Two days later Dr increased to 400 mg.  In the last 4 days I've had 4 attacks each day, all from the ear and neck area.  All these pain attacks last about one minute of horrible pain.  The rest of the day, my ear and cheek/jaw area feel either numb or tingling pain with occasional pain in the ear. My stress is waiting for the next attack to come.  Is this how it starts with everyone?  How long did these sudden onset excruciating pain attacks continue?  Since this is only Day 5 with Gab, I can say I don't see how its helping but probably needs time to kick in? and maybe higher dosages?  Weird as it may sound, I have the feeling that the Gab triggers an attack but that's probably my imagination.  At this point, I haven't had any relief from extra strength tylenol or advil.  If I can't stop the nerve attacks, is there something that will make them less severe?  My doctor is not knowledgeable other than basic textbook info, when I asked her about a lidocaine 5% patch, she said lidocaine patches are OTC.  She wasn't aware of the patch used for PHN.

Last week i had more blood tests after coming off my pill since the beginning of September, but the only period i've had (apart from my withdrawal bleed) has lasted two weeks inconsitently and it's only been brown, ive had no blood and some days there's no brown, but the next there is - I don't think that this is normal?

She was a college lacrosse player weighing around 120 and solid muscle. Looked like a sports model. She was also recovering from a   and torn ACL from freshman season. She was cleared to play in Jan of her sophomore year. Up to being cleared she conditioned and swam about 10 miles a day. Maintaining her 120 athletic body.  Around springtime she was showing signs of bad depression (stupid mom here thought it was because of lacrosse and school at first). She would call crying all the time. Well I finally realized it could be hormonal and advised her to get that implant out of her arm. The very next day that she had it removed she admitted herself to the hospital thinking she was having a   or heart attack. This is when the real nightmare began.       She became manic and very paranoid and her thoughts and ideas were grandiose. This was the beginning symptoms of a phychotic break. She soon was hospitalized for 13 weeks for acute phychosis. Treated with high doses of seraquil. An antipsychotic. When she was released she was 105 pounds. All bones and dangerously hyper thyroid. And no period since April when implant was removed.  Fast forward to this December. Now over 150 pounds. Acnemore severe than I have even seen. And depressed. The doctors are stumped. Moon face lead to being checked for Cushings but her cortisol is in the normal range.   Now they are saying extreme PCOS. Her one doctor says no way does PCOS attack someone in top physical shape. She has 2 MRIs scheduled to rule out a brain tumor of the pitituitary and adrenal.  My big question is does anyone know if the implant would have caused PCOS and how do you combat the severe acne.

I finally had a 'normal' bowel movement on the morning of 4th March  - which then turned into a loose bowel movement. This just so happened to be the first day of my menstrual period also. I got in my car to drive to work and shortly after i got severe stomach/ pelvis pains to the point i had to turn around to go home. On my way home i had to pull over as the pain was so intense i was vomiting. I was shaky, cold but sweating profusely. When i got home i ran to the toilet and produced a watery bowel movement (I didn't need to go again after that). At the same time i was still in severe pain and felt like i was going to pass out & vomit it was so bad. I couldn't walk or hardly move and all i could do was lay on the floor in front of the bathroom. I kept feeling like i needed to urinate (I had actually though a few days before i was getting a UTI as i permanently felt like i needed to wee, and i had a constant stinging sensation) but not much was happening when i tried. Anyway i ended up calling my mum as 2 hours had passed and the pain wasn't subsiding, and had actually moved to my lower back. Throughout the whole episode i was also getting sharp shooting pains in which felt like my urethra. When she arrived she thought it was best to call an ambulance as I was clearly not in a good way. (Still shaking, sweating and in a lot of pain, vomiting from the pain). 5 minutes before the paramedics arrived the pain literally stopped. I felt so stupid when they arrived, as other than feeling a bit weak, I felt as though nothing had just happened. They didn't take me to Hospital as they thought it was just a bug, but i have had gastro before and it was nothing like what i had just experienced. They recommended i follow up with my GP, that afternoon, which i did. So my GP took a urine sample for a UTI and pregnancy, which were both negative. He referred me for an ultrasound as he suspected a ruptured   or torsion. I had the ultrasound done today and i was able to view the report through my work. They have noted that there were no sign of a ruptured cyst, but evidence of poly cystic ovaries, ovaries normal size and no other issues. Since the 4th i have had a constant dull ache in my right side, which feels like my ovary. And every now and again sharp stabbing pains. I had dull aches and pains every now and then in my ovaries before, but it feel more constant and obvious since. Can someone please tell me I am not going crazy and that it wasn't a bug that caused all of this! I feel a bit annoyed that I went through so much pain and paid so much money for the ultrasound for them to find nothing!

Gastroscopy was all clear, but I noticed in the two weeks that I had to stop taking Omeprazole beforehand, my palpitations went, and chest pain was must less of a problem. Had a phone call discussion with my GP about this, and she has decided to switch me to lansoprazole after having been on Omeprazole for 2 and a half years, so worth a try. What I would like help on now is, I am coming down by the slow method from 4mg to 3 mg , and wondering once I get onto 3 mg all the time should I stay there for a while or start going down to 2mg? This is my fifth attempt at reducing, and it is going well with no pain, so don't want to mess things up by doing the wrong thing. Thanks. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I have chin hair and my total and free testosterone used to be high. My DHEA was slightly low and prolactin was slightly high. I've had chin hair for a few years before my hormones were tested to be imbalanced -- they were very normal, even despite the hair, until a year ago. I'm 28 years old, a virgin, and mildly obese. I'm not sure if I have PCOS because my doctor and different specialists all give me different answers, hesitantly, yet PCOS is documented in my medical records now. I always had regular periods since I first began menstruating. They were heavy and I had to always wear the thickest pads, but they weren't so extreme as to soak pads every hour or anything. With PCOS, isn't there usually an absence of periods? I never had amenorrhea. Is it possible to have regular monthly periods and still not ovulate? I started spotting in between periods about a year ago or less. One time I spotted daily for about 3 weeks. My estrogen levels were never flagged as being high and my progesterone levels were never considered low by the test's standards. I had another blood test for hormones very recently. My hormonal imbalances have since been corrected, and my estrogen is at the higher end of normal, I guess, and yet is higher than it was before I started birth control. My progesterone isn't flagged as being low. My estrogen level is 555.4 pg/ml. The standard range for this test is Follicular Phase (1-12 days) 90-590 pg/mL. On the Internet, it usually mentions standard estrogen levels as being much lower, but I suppose the lab that does my tests has a different standard. My progesterone level is 0.18 ng/mL. Is it possible that I have estrogen dominance, even though my levels aren't flagged? Also, I still have some intermittent spotting, though it is extremely light and mixed with normal discharge. My doctor doesn't seem concerned, even though I've been on my birth control 5-6 months now. Why would I be spotting like that? Should I be concerned? I'm worried about this being something dangerous like endometrial cancer. I can't do transvaginal ultrasounds due to being Autistic and a virgin who has severe anxiety. I've had 2 transabdominal ultrasounds though and they didn't find any evidence of malignancy. My uterus was a normal size, my ovaries were normal, and my endometrial stripe was 7mm thick, which is normal. My only issue was that some very small fibroids were noted. How common is endometrial cancer in younger patients with PCOS? I'm so afraid due to the higher risk of endometrial cancer that comes with having PCOS. I had hair on my chin for years and never addressed it because I'm very gender non-conforming in appearance (despite being straight) and it made me feel comfortable physically. Yet I had hormone tests done in the recent past that were normal, despite the facial hair. Only a year ago did my hormones start getting out of whack, and with that came the abnormal uterine bleeding. Though I had symptoms before of vulvodynia and IBS-like problems, which still occur, and warranted my first transabdominal ultrasound, which came back perfectly. The second ultrasound I had was during last summer, and although I had more very small fibroids, it was also normal. I have severe health anxiety, which my doctor says could contribute to the spotting. He also says that besides stress, the pills themselves aren't perfect and spotting can be expected sometimes. Is Aviane-28  (ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel) a common pill to experience spotting with, even after the initial 3 cycles? I have withdrawal bleeding during my bleed week on birth control that is still as heavy as my regular menstrual periods. Is this normal? I'm in constant fear and riddled with uncertainty, despite all reassurances from health care professionals. I'm terrified of cancer, and that I was too stubborn about my appearance to address the issue before it turned worse. My mother always wanted to address the hair growth to the doctor, just to see what he said, but I always refused her wishes. I'm also terrified that the doctors are wrong, or that the tests may have missed something. Am I too late? Do I have endometrial cancer, or can all of this be reversed before it ever leads into cancer? I'm taking much better care of my health now. I'm eating better and exercising more. I'm taking the birth control pills every day at the same time as prescribed.  I just want to be OK. I'll never mess with my health again. I used to eat a lot of junk food and now that I've stopped, my cholesterol and triglycerides have gone down to being borderline high, rather than high like they used to be. I'm trying to lose some weight. I've been a vegetarian since I was 12 due to ethical issues. For quite a few years though I've been eating a lot of fake meats that are soy-based. I'm not sure whether or not these are healthy for me. I know that this is a lot of information to process, and I didn't mean to write a book, but I'm very afraid and I need help. Is there anyone here with the medical expertise to answer my questions and address my concerns properly? Please help me. I want to stop living in fear and get on with my life.

I was diagnosed with PMR 4 weeks ago. My rheumatologist put me on 20 mg of prednisone for 4 weeks, reducing to 15 mg , then to 5 mg until I return for my next visit in April. Last night I had severe leg cramps, Not just in the calves, but my entire leg. I have never had this before. Is this a side effect of the Prednisone? Before being diagnosed, I was in severe pain with major stiffness in pretty much all my joints. Very difficult to get out of bed and walk in the mornings. I just thought it was old age. I have always been a fairly active woman, and considered myself a young 67. But by the time I was 68, I felt I had aged 10 years. After 1 week on the prednisone I felt like a new woman. I don't feel quite as good now as I did 3 weeks ago, and will start reducing my dosage today. Is that normal? The information on this site has been so helpful. Thanks in advance for any information you my have on this matter. 0 likes, 8 replies "

When Eileen describes the DSNS method of tapering prednisone, she writes about a Swedish gentleman who found out a tapering method, which Eileen et al developed further into the DSNS method. That Swedish gentleman is me – Ragnar. After a week´s trip to Athens the first week in April 2005 (at the age of 67), I felt very strange and had a dry cough. After two weeks I went to the doctor. After blood work, he couldn´t tell what was wrong but made a plan where he step by step eliminated possible diseases. After some months without a real diagnose, I was sent to the medicine department of a main hospital. I had some new blood work, and then they told me that I had better have a biopsy in a temple. The problem was that I had two trips abroad coming up. I got an appointment after the first one and a biopsy showed that I had what they had expected. I was told I had pmr but they didn´t tell me I also had GCA, so I heard about that later. I was put on 20 mg Prednisone (which is too low as a starting dose for GCA – but the subsidizing doctor didn´t see in the papers that I had GCA, I think. The next day I flew to the USA to participate in a class reunion after 50 years from graduation as an exchange student in a small town in Minnesota. My wife covered my white bandaid in the temple with skin-coloured surgical tape, so it shouldn´t show so much, especially not on the class picture. After about a week´s trip, while travelling in California by rented car, my wife used the scissors of a Swiss army knife to cut the strings that they had sewn at the biopsy. She dipped the scissors in gin from a miniature bottle we had got on the Atlantic flight – to sterilize it. Due to the cortisone, I felt great/high and on the national day of the USA, 4th of July, we walked downtown without problems. The brochure said the motel was in midtown, near downtown. I think we had to walk 20 blocks and then back – but I felt great even if my wife got tired despite being in better condition than I – the dose of pred helped me. I reduced the pred by 2.5 mg every 3-4 weeks until I reached 10 mg. Then I reduced by 1 mg every month until I reached 5 mg. I tried to reduce during a whole year, but every time I had to go back to 5 mg due to fatigue. I thought it was no idea to go around being tired all the time when I didn´t have to. 5 mg is a fairly low dose. Unlike most persons with pmr, I had fairly little pain. When I had slight pain, it could be anywhere in legs or arms. After a year, I thought I would test a new regime that I had found out.  After postng it, other pmr/GCA patients called it the Ragnar method. I took the lower dose 1 day, the old dose 2 days and repeated this once more. After about a week I took the step and lowered the dose each day. By doing this, my body reacted positively and I could start going down below 5 mg but only about 0.5 mg at a time. I had 2.5 mg tablets and cut them by hand in four parts, so it really was 0.6 mg at a time. If there was a problem, I just continued 1 day low dose, 2 days old dose for another week or so. After 3 ½ years – in the middle of December 2008 – I got down to 0 and I haven´t had any problems after that – now it is 11 ½ years after coming off pred. I did some travelling shortly after coming off pred – we were for instance a week in Scotland (Glasgow, Edinburgh and a short trip to the Highlands). I just took it easy when we walked and when we visited a museum I just sat down to have a rest while my wife did it more thoroughly.  Taking care of a friend´s dog keeps me busy and also makes me walk a bit more than I would otherwise do. I had reduced my weight about 6 kg before I had the diagnose and some time after I was up to the same weight as before, which I of course was sad about. I had a moon face for some time, but for a man it probably isn´t as bad as for a woman. My advice is not to try to reduce too fast, especially not below 5 mg when every 1 mg (preferrably 0,5 mg) reduction is a very high reduction in percentage. My belief is that it is better to feel well and take the disadvantages a bit longer, especially when reaching doses of 5 mg and under. I am of course grateful that I haven´t been in pain so badly as most of fellow pmr-sufferers have. Now, in 2020 I weigh 12 kg less than before I started tapering in 2005. Some years ago, I used the 5:2 method and later I kept the weight and even reduced by eating the right things – fish, chicken etc and at the age of 82 I am glad about my weight. Lesson: Don´t go too fast. Then you may get a flare and the time it takes may be longer than when you taper a lower amount. 1 like, 0 replies "

Taking care of a friend´s dog keeps me busy and also makes me walk a bit more than I would otherwise do. I had reduced my weight about 6 kg before I had the diagnose and some time after I was up to the same weight as before, which I of course was sad about. I had a moon face for some time, but for a man it probably isn´t as bad as for a woman. My advice is not to try to reduce too fast, especially not below 5 mg when every 1 mg (preferrably 0,5 mg) reduction is a very high reduction in percentage. My belief is that it is better to feel well and take the disadvantages a bit longer, especially when reaching doses of 5 mg and under. I am of course grateful that I haven´t been in pain so badly as most of fellow pmr-sufferers have. Now, in 2020 I weigh 12 kg less than before I started tapering in 2005. Some years ago, I used the 5:2 method and later I kept the weight and even reduced by eating the right things – fish, chicken etc and at the age of 82 I am glad about my weight. Lesson: Don´t go too fast. Then you may get a flare and the time it takes may be longer than when you taper a lower amount. 1 like, 0 replies "

When Eileen describes the DSNS method of tapering prednisone, she writes about a Swedish gentleman who found out a tapering method, which Eileen et al developed further into the DSNS method. That Swedish gentleman is me – Ragnar. After a week´s trip to Athens the first week in April 2005 (at the age of 67), I felt very strange and had a dry cough. After two weeks I went to the doctor. After blood work, he couldn´t tell what was wrong but made a plan where he step by step eliminated possible diseases. After some months without a real diagnose, I was sent to the medicine department of a main hospital. I had some new blood work, and then they told me that I had better have a biopsy in a temple. The problem was that I had two trips abroad coming up. I got an appointment after the first one and a biopsy showed that I had what they had expected. I was told I had pmr but they didn´t tell me I also had GCA, so I heard about that later. I was put on 20 mg Prednisone (which is too low as a starting dose for GCA – but the subsidizing doctor didn´t see in the papers that I had GCA, I think. The next day I flew to the USA to participate in a class reunion after 50 years from graduation as an exchange student in a small town in Minnesota. My wife covered my white bandaid in the temple with skin-coloured surgical tape, so it shouldn´t show so much, especially not on the class picture. After about a week´s trip, while travelling in California by rented car, my wife used the scissors of a Swiss army knife to cut the strings that they had sewn at the biopsy. She dipped the scissors in gin from a miniature bottle we had got on the Atlantic flight – to sterilize it. Due to the cortisone, I felt great/high and on the national day of the USA, 4th of July, we walked downtown without problems. The brochure said the motel was in midtown, near downtown. I think we had to walk 20 blocks and then back – but I felt great even if my wife got tired despite being in better condition than I – the dose of pred helped me. I reduced the pred by 2.5 mg every 3-4 weeks until I reached 10 mg. Then I reduced by 1 mg every month until I reached 5 mg. I tried to reduce during a whole year, but every time I had to go back to 5 mg due to fatigue. I thought it was no idea to go around being tired all the time when I didn´t have to. 5 mg is a fairly low dose. Unlike most persons with pmr, I had fairly little pain. When I had slight pain, it could be anywhere in legs or arms. After a year, I thought I would test a new regime that I had found out.  After postng it, other pmr/GCA patients called it the Ragnar method. I took the lower dose 1 day, the old dose 2 days and repeated this once more. After about a week I took the step and lowered the dose each day. By doing this, my body reacted positively and I could start going down below 5 mg but only about 0.5 mg at a time. I had 2.5 mg tablets and cut them by hand in four parts, so it really was 0.6 mg at a time. If there was a problem, I just continued 1 day low dose, 2 days old dose for another week or so. After 3 ½ years – in the middle of December 2008 – I got down to 0 and I haven´t had any problems after that – now it is 11 ½ years after coming off pred.

So I am posting this quite simple explanation  in response to a request from someone else on the forum. I first posted it on the HealthUnlocked forum FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT QUITE GETTING IT YET. Copied and pasted from elsewhere: Feeling confused as to why Coronavirus is a bigger deal than Seasonal flu? Here it is in a nutshell. I hope this helps. Feel free to share this to others who don’t understand... It has to do with RNA sequencing.... I.e. genetics. Seasonal flu is an “all human virus”. The DNA/RNA chains that make up the virus are recognized by the human immune system. This means that your body has some immunity to it before it comes around each year... you get immunity two ways...through exposure to a virus, or by getting a flu shot. Novel viruses, come from animals.... the WHO tracks novel viruses in animals, (sometimes for years watching for mutations). Usually these viruses only transfer from animal to animal (pigs in the case of H1N1) (birds in the case of the Spanish flu). But once, one of these animal viruses mutates, and starts to transfer from animals to humans... then it’s a problem, Why? Because we have no natural or acquired immunity.. the RNA sequencing of the genes inside the virus isn’t human, and the human immune system doesn’t recognize it so, we can’t fight it off. Now.... sometimes, the mutation only allows transfer from animal to human, for years it’s only transmission is from an infected animal to a human before it finally mutates so that it can now transfer human to human... once that happens..we have a new contagion phase. And depending on the fashion of this new mutation, thats what decides how contagious, or how deadly it’s gonna be.. H1N1 was deadly....but it did not mutate in a way that was as deadly as the Spanish flu. Its RNA was slower to mutate and it attacked its host differently, too. Fast forward: Now, here comes this Coronavirus... it existed in animals only, for nobody knows how long...but one day, at an animal market, in Wuhan China, in December 2019, it mutated and made the jump from animal to people. At first, only animals could give it to a person... But here is the scary part.... in just TWO WEEKS it mutated again and gained the ability to jump from human to human. Scientists call this quick ability, “slippery” This Coronavirus, not being in any form a “human” virus (where we would all have some natural or acquired immunity) took off like a rocket. And this was because, Humans have no known immunity...doctors have no known medicines for it. And it just so happens that this particular mutated animal virus, changed itself in such a way so that it causes great damage to human lungs.. That’s why Coronavirus is different from seasonal flu, or H1N1 or any other type of influenza.... this one is slippery AF. And it’s a lung eater...And, it’s already mutated AGAIN, so that we now have two strains to deal with, strain s, and strain L....which makes it twice as hard to develop a vaccine. We really have no tools in our shed, with this. History has shown that fast and immediate closings of public places has helped in the past pandemics. Philadelphia and Baltimore were reluctant to close events in 1918 and they were the hardest hit in the US during the Spanish Flu. Factoid: Henry VIII stayed in his room and allowed no one near him, till the Black Plague passed...(honestly...I understand him so much better now). Just like us, he had no tools in his shed, except social distancing/isolation... And let me end by saying....right now it’s hitting older folks harder... but this genome is so slippery...if it mutates again (and it will). Who is to say, what it will do next? Be smart folks... and listen to the scientific advice. #flattenthecurve. Wash your hands and stay home if possible..... share this to those that just are not catching on And here is another fairly blunt comment by a doctor from another doctor on his blog: Dear Readers. Here is a public service announcement from a wise friend of mine. ""Let’s talk social isolation, if you or a family member have symptoms. No, not the details. Look on the NHS website for that. More that I’ve become aware of quite a few people who aren’t ACTUALLY isolating themselves. Because, apparently, they couldn’t have the Coronavirus. Despite their cough. Despite their fever. Do you know what an R0 is? It’s a statistical measure of contagion rates. The Coronavirus has an R0 of about 3-4. So each infected person is likely to infect 3-4 other people. Now. If you DO have it and you DON’T isolate yourself completely, not going out, you run the risk of infecting people you walk past, people you queue behind in the shops, that person you so politely danced round in the shop doorway, anybody you encounter. Every single one you infect has a 5% chance (probably more) of ending up on the ITU in your local hospital. Yes, on a ventilator. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. Not only that, but given current mortality data, somewhere between 15-50% of the people ending up on ITU will die. Yes. They’ll die. So if you think popping out won’t matter, you’re wrong. You might just cause someone’s death. So stop being so ****** selfish. Isolate yourselves properly. Follow the guidance properly."" Credit to the amazing Dr Russell Brown. Between the two, I hope no-one can claim they didn't know the risks - to themself and to others. Here in Italy someone turned up at a hospital last week for a nose op. To avoid losing the appointment, they neglected to say they had a cough and fever (though  you do have to ask how the hospital missed that) and that they worked in a ski resort where they had been in contact with Covid19 +ve people. He had his op - but as a result the surgeon, anaesthetist and a nurse are all now infected and unable to work and potentially at risk of dying - a GP died yesterday, 52 years old and no underlying illnesses.

Do you know what an R0 is? It’s a statistical measure of contagion rates. The Coronavirus has an R0 of about 3-4. So each infected person is likely to infect 3-4 other people. Now. If you DO have it and you DON’T isolate yourself completely, not going out, you run the risk of infecting people you walk past, people you queue behind in the shops, that person you so politely danced round in the shop doorway, anybody you encounter. Every single one you infect has a 5% chance (probably more) of ending up on the ITU in your local hospital. Yes, on a ventilator. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. Not only that, but given current mortality data, somewhere between 15-50% of the people ending up on ITU will die. Yes. They’ll die. So if you think popping out won’t matter, you’re wrong. You might just cause someone’s death. So stop being so ****** selfish. Isolate yourselves properly. Follow the guidance properly."" Credit to the amazing Dr Russell Brown. Between the two, I hope no-one can claim they didn't know the risks - to themself and to others. Here in Italy someone turned up at a hospital last week for a nose op. To avoid losing the appointment, they neglected to say they had a cough and fever (though  you do have to ask how the hospital missed that) and that they worked in a ski resort where they had been in contact with Covid19 +ve people. He had his op - but as a result the surgeon, anaesthetist and a nurse are all now infected and unable to work and potentially at risk of dying - a GP died yesterday, 52 years old and no underlying illnesses.

So I am posting this quite simple explanation  in response to a request from someone else on the forum. I first posted it on the HealthUnlocked forum FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT QUITE GETTING IT YET. Copied and pasted from elsewhere: Feeling confused as to why Coronavirus is a bigger deal than Seasonal flu? Here it is in a nutshell. I hope this helps. Feel free to share this to others who don’t understand... It has to do with RNA sequencing.... I.e. genetics. Seasonal flu is an “all human virus”. The DNA/RNA chains that make up the virus are recognized by the human immune system. This means that your body has some immunity to it before it comes around each year... you get immunity two ways...through exposure to a virus, or by getting a flu shot. Novel viruses, come from animals.... the WHO tracks novel viruses in animals, (sometimes for years watching for mutations). Usually these viruses only transfer from animal to animal (pigs in the case of H1N1) (birds in the case of the Spanish flu). But once, one of these animal viruses mutates, and starts to transfer from animals to humans... then it’s a problem, Why? Because we have no natural or acquired immunity.. the RNA sequencing of the genes inside the virus isn’t human, and the human immune system doesn’t recognize it so, we can’t fight it off. Now.... sometimes, the mutation only allows transfer from animal to human, for years it’s only transmission is from an infected animal to a human before it finally mutates so that it can now transfer human to human... once that happens..we have a new contagion phase. And depending on the fashion of this new mutation, thats what decides how contagious, or how deadly it’s gonna be.. H1N1 was deadly....but it did not mutate in a way that was as deadly as the Spanish flu. Its RNA was slower to mutate and it attacked its host differently, too. Fast forward: Now, here comes this Coronavirus... it existed in animals only, for nobody knows how long...but one day, at an animal market, in Wuhan China, in December 2019, it mutated and made the jump from animal to people. At first, only animals could give it to a person... But here is the scary part.... in just TWO WEEKS it mutated again and gained the ability to jump from human to human. Scientists call this quick ability, “slippery” This Coronavirus, not being in any form a “human” virus (where we would all have some natural or acquired immunity) took off like a rocket. And this was because, Humans have no known immunity...doctors have no known medicines for it. And it just so happens that this particular mutated animal virus, changed itself in such a way so that it causes great damage to human lungs.. That’s why Coronavirus is different from seasonal flu, or H1N1 or any other type of influenza.... this one is slippery AF. And it’s a lung eater...And, it’s already mutated AGAIN, so that we now have two strains to deal with, strain s, and strain L....which makes it twice as hard to develop a vaccine. We really have no tools in our shed, with this. History has shown that fast and immediate closings of public places has helped in the past pandemics. Philadelphia and Baltimore were reluctant to close events in 1918 and they were the hardest hit in the US during the Spanish Flu. Factoid: Henry VIII stayed in his room and allowed no one near him, till the Black Plague passed...(honestly...I understand him so much better now). Just like us, he had no tools in his shed, except social distancing/isolation... And let me end by saying....right now it’s hitting older folks harder... but this genome is so slippery...if it mutates again (and it will). Who is to say, what it will do next? Be smart folks... and listen to the scientific advice. #flattenthecurve. Wash your hands and stay home if possible..... share this to those that just are not catching on And here is another fairly blunt comment by a doctor from another doctor on his blog: Dear Readers.

I've had PMR for about a year.  I've tapered down per month, finally from 3 mg prednisone to 2 mg to 1 mg and finally zero about a month ago.  At zero mg my symptoms were ""kind of"" there, but not bad at all, and my inflammation markers were ""normal,"" but right on the high edge of normal. Now, after a month without prednisone, the symptoms are slowly increasing - hard to pick up something from the floor, if you know what I mean.   Normally, I'd have no problem getting back on a low dose of prednisone, but with this coronavirus pandemic, I certainly am not eager to compromise my immune system at all!  I'm between a rock and a hard place! I'm ambulatory but easily fatigued.  I could probably handle this without prednisone, but now I seem to be having some symptoms of GCA.

I decided to make new post because the old discussion was too long ( 12 pages).  If anyone wants to see it you can find it at this link So where am I today?  Little overview - I am amateur triathlete that was preparing for next season in the fall of 2015, when I felt that something has changed dramatically and I was struck with terrible fatigue and was not recovering from exercise at all.  First visit to family Dr and he was recommending to rest for a week and it will go away. After a week it become worse. Second doctor also recommended the same... Third doctor also... After 4 weeks I was unable to go get out of bed by myself . I went back to family Dr and explain what has happened and finally he took careful look at my condition, did blood tests and came to preliminary conclusion that I might have PMR. He reffered me to rheumatologist, which did many tests, CT, MRI, more blood tests and confirmed that I do have PMR.  The last week before I was given prednisone was the hardest.  It was not just pain for even smallest effort to turn in bed, but it was depression that was set in because I have gone from very healthy to bed ridden in just 6 weeks or so. Then the prednisone kicked in. It was not immediate, because I was started on relatively low dose (15mg), it took almost a week for the effect to kick in.  That was the time I found this forum and started my old post - log on recovery.   It took me about one year of gradual effort to recover to the point that I was able to exercise at the level before PMR. So today I am at 2mg, still active. I start every day with 30 min walk ( have a dog to keep me committed) coupled with 15 min or so of stretching that focuses on shoulders and legs/hip area.  I go biking in the mountains for about 80 min at moderate level two times a week. I use HR meter to gauge my effort. I know from my training days that my maximum HR pulse rate for biking is 152 and I keep my effort at 65-75% of that maximum ( 110-130BPM) during exercise. I also swim once a week, for about an hour ( 2.5Km) at the moderate level ( my average pulse is ~105-110).  Each session ( biking or swimming) burns about 800-1000 Kcal).  I have never had to go on any special diet. My weight was pretty much the same and my long term sugar level is fine.  I do not restrict carbs, but my lovely wife cooks everything from scratch.  We eat typical local fresh food (moved from US to Japan after retirement).  Lots of vegs, rice, fish, and some meat. Although I consume lots of carbs, they are not highly processed.  I also have a glass of wine ( or three 😃 ) with dinner.  Pretty much I am back to pre-pmr lifestyle. 2 likes, 14 replies "

Well, my attempt to change my diet didn't change my cholesterol numbers, and after taking 10 mg to start, I did notice some mild stiffness, mainly after sitting for a while. After many years, the numbers started increasing, and my GP suggested doubling the dose of Lipitor, which I did.  It may have been around this time that I was suddenly struck by PMR.

From my last flare it has taken me over 2 years to come down                                  from 10 mg. to under 7 mg. (1/4 mg monthly on the dsns scale  with a couple of set backs. ).

Now i am on 7 mg                                          and feel quite good, so i am going to stay on that for 6 months then drop down to 6.5 mg                                           and see what happens, if all is good i will stay at that for a while before dropping further.                                        if things go pear shape it is back to 7mg for another 6 months.

For context, my last CBC was: WBC 13.3 (range 4-11) the highest it's been from the 7 labs I have copies of is 14.6 Neutrophils 9.2 (range 2-7.5) RBC 5.15 (range 4-5.10) Hemoglobin 167 (range 120-160) Hematocrit .480(range .350-.450) Platelet 313 (range 150-400) My CRP & ESR were both well below range so no inflammation.   No infections that I'm aware of and Creatinine also normal which would help identify if there was dehydration. Various symptoms that seem to come and go in waves  include headaches, burning red eyes,  chronic pain in hips and legs and feet (this symptom is consistent and it's difficult to know if it's muscle or bone pain), red flecks under the skin on palms of hands (that don't itch or blanch and never go away), periodic bouts of severe itching, hot flashes and excessive sweating & dizziness & fatigue, some numbness in extremities and intermittent chest pain. I should also point out it was discovered in 2016 that I was severely anemic (ferritin was <5 and B12 was also low).  I experienced painful periods with heavy bleeding, including clots so I was referred for an endometrial ablation.  I had the procedure done in October, 2016 and periods stopped.  Ever since, RBC counts have been continuously on the rise along with WBCs. Saw internal medicine in November of 2018 who ordered JAK 2 V617F mutation and EPO test along with abdominal ultrasound.  Just got results back last week.  Ultrasound came back fine but I tested positive for JAK 2 mutation and EPO was low normal.  Doctor indicated my history of heavy bleeding prior to ablation likely masked this issue I'm now encountering.  In essence, my body was previously blood letting naturally.

My buttcrack also started sweating more. It's ruining my life, I don't even feel like going out because of this and I resorted to wearing mostly nike shorts or anything dark to mask the sweat stains. I also suffer hypochondria as well. It doesn't help that I live in California. Bare with me as this is a lengthy post but i would appreciate the help. So, around october 22-23 this year, it seems that my tailbone region like the upper part of my buttcrack area has started to feel a burning sensation, I sweat there like crazy especially when I walk my dog outside even though weather is not too humid. I also feel a heat sensation in my buttocks when i walk. I've also noticed that my tailbone area sweats when i go pass out urine. So basically, the tailbone sweat occurs for me when i walk outside and its not too cold, or when i pass out urine. I've looked for people with the same conditions as me but those questions were back from 2009 or 2012. To add to that, I know this may be off topic, but earlier this year I went to the urgent care room to complain about pain in my testicle area, they did a scan on my back area to see any damages but it was normal, at school during early 2018 i suddenly wet myself which miraculously i avoided anyone and i got to change up. After a few months this testicle pain went away so I didn't bother. So could this be related to this tailbone sweat and heat sensation in the buttocks I've been experiencing? Again, sorry for the lengthy post. This new tailbone sweat symptom and excessive sweating has been ruining my life these past few months. Help is greatly appreciated 0 likes, 3 replies "

I wanted to share my story as within the last ten days my HH is now finally under control... It was all about how I controlled my breathing.  Yes the thing we take for granted. The thing we don’t get trained to do. Ive had ETS surgery and own my own Iontophoresis machine...but none of these actually get to the route cause. The ETS surgery stopped the sweating from my forehead and just pushed the problem to another part/parts of my body. The iontophoresis machine was just a pain to use and whilst you use it you feel like a failure. It’s not exactly a pleasurable experience. I also tried special deodrants, sage tea etc etc etc etc…. ive suffered in silence and now I know I can control it im so happy. In my experience what makes it worse is the day when someone notices you are sweating. The start of the condition grabbing hold of you and making you feel insecure. You start avoiding situations you may end up sweating in – parties, business meetings etc…. You then are always in FIGHT or FLIGHT mode…. And its not the place you want to be. Drinking ice cold water trying to calm your body down is again just another “band aid”…. Wearing vests in the summer , using hand dryers in the toilets etc is not helping you eradicate it from your life. I truly believe that HH is curable but you need to get to the route cause. In my experience it was my nervous system that I just didn’t know how to control. This may not be the case for lots of other people but I now feel much better about myself. I used to ask the question – why me? Why do I sweat like this? It makes you angry and hopeless 24/7. Yoga / and making sure you breathe properly has been my saviour.. Im now dry as a bone! I now don't feel helpless or angry I feel like a new man.... There is so much free information out there about breathing and controlling your anxiety. Don’t try and put a band aid on things, get to the route cause and you will also be dry! It might take time for you to adapt the way you breathe but please stick with it. It will help you I’m convinced.  I hope this message can help other people overcome their problem. 5 likes, 11 replies "

At that time they predicted it was an asthma attack(i informed them i had a history of asthma) though there was no actual evidence that it was that or an anxiety attack. Either way, they told me to take it for 4 or so days and follow up with my regular doctor. I did as told, 40 mg a day but on the last day i tapered myself down to 20 mg due to how terrible it was making me feel. (Fever,chills,etc) It's 3 weeks starting today and my body still feels strange after just 4 days of taking it. Although not as severe as the first days of withdrawal, I have been experiencing brain fog, blurred vision, body chills, headaches. I've been to the doctor and the ER again after that one visit but both reported  that I was fine and that there isn't  anything wrong with me. I've read a couple of discussions on here but most have been dealing with the long term whereas mine was only 4 days and its almost routing to a month?? I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this? I'm getting paranoid and I don't know what else to do. 0 likes, 1 reply "

The worst being the puffy burning sensation in my legs and feet. Ive been to the doctor and started water pills and the doc said he thinks its the prednisone that caused the water retention but im so anxious about it and it is very uncomfortable right now.

Muscle wasting and atrophy is extensive in the affected area. I am 66 years old and contracted the disease at 3. I am currently experiencing hip pain probably from overuse, but I have had this condition when I was in my 20s from overuse. I use a long leg brace and I modified it by inserting an strong plastic arm/wrist support from another procedure at the top of the brace on my left hip. The result was that when I walked it seemed like I was sitting when my weight shifted with each step. In other words the hip drop and corresponding tendon stress was avoided. Has anyone ever used a long leg brace that prevents the hip from dropping. The plastic I used eventually broke from the stress but it was never attached and affected nothing else. Before I try another similar modification I would like to ask if anyone else has a bracing solution for the hip drop common in polios.  0 likes, 5 replies "

I feel like I'm having other symptoms of pregnancy, but I'm probably just psyching myself out. But maybe not? I don't know. I've never had unprotected sex before and I'm never doing it again, not after this. I've taken 2 pregnancy tests, and they've both come back negative. I took an early detection test on Monday because I was cramping and nauseous and I just had a feeling, but it came back not pregnant. I'm not sure if that's accurate, because with this specific test you're supposed to take it the day of your missed period, and mine has no clear starting point (the buffer is different every time). The second one was from the dollar store, but it wasn't early detection. Please help me. I'm really scared because I'm not ready for a kid. I don't know if I should be worried. Heck, I don't even know if this is the right place to post this. I know I'm stupid, so please don't remind me. From a woman to a woman, help me please. 0 likes, 0 replies "

My experience of withdrawal then was horrendous (even though my GP says withdrawal isn't a problem!) and I've been told those from Pregabalin are even worse. At the moment, I take 150mg morning and evening. I know it's important to go very slowly, but what dose reduction is least likely to cause severe withdrawal symptoms, and do withdrawal symptoms resolve once an initial reduction has been stabilized? Are there any useful websites or forums where I can  find out more? 0 likes, 1 reply "

It's the first time I write here and I do it because I would like to know the opinion of other people who are in the same situation. I am 22 years old and I am sorry for the long post, I had no one to talk to, because I don't know anyone in this situation. 1 year ago I learned, through a MRI, that I have a 5 mm pituitary microadenoma, which secretes prolactin. I found this out in an unusual way, at the request of my dermatologist who assumed that the   burst on my face would have a different cause than the usual ones and so it was. Although,I do not have high prolactin levels (slightly increased)or menstrual cycle changes, I was prescribed Dostinex once a week and Eutyrox 5 days a week because the first drug created hyperthyroidism, but not serious. Since then, I have almost daily headaches, more aggressive or not (I have had them before but not this strong) I also had 2 pain attacks, as I call them, in the sense that I had unbearable pain, high pressure on the ears, head and eyes, severe   and nausea, because of which I was urgent in the hospital. I was also diagnosed with a degenerative disease on the C5-C6 disks of the neck, but from what I understood, it does not cause headaches, but rather shoulders and hands, which I do not have. I talked to my endocrinologist (I changed about 2 throughout the year because they didn't answer my questions and didn't care), and he told me that my chances of having headaches related to the microadenoma were low because It's too small. Also, for 3 years my eyesight has weakened significantly (I can no longer see in the distance), I wear glasses for half a year (I know, I waited a long time until I go to check), but he says that this is not a symptom either. At the pre-MRI check, I was asked if and for how long I had headaches (3-4 years, but I thought everyone has), if I had dizziness, stress (to which I answered yes), but after my diagnosis it is said that the symptoms are not related. Headaches only go with ibuprofen-based medicines. So I would really appreciate it if you shared your experience and if you would tell me tips or opinions about what I have told here.

As the week went on, I noticed it spread up my neck and another spot appeared right where my pants sit. I went to my pcp who said it appeared fungal and prescriped some antifungal cream. Of course that did no good. I am a pediatric nurse so I had one of the MDs look at it. She said it looked liked PR. She said to expect it to hang around for awhile. The following weekend I went to the beach and after laying out  for two days the spots were almost completely gone. My question is does it really look like PR? Is it common to disappear that fast?

Had my artery stitched in A&E without anesthetic (HORRENDOUS)  13th packed again at drs, appears ok - before bed, light fluid, pale pink 14th Blood, packing fell out, gunge and smell, told it looks clean and pink, no major blood loss 19th  Discharged from surgeon Dr Khalil He wasn't happy with A&E taking stitches out as he said it was far too soon, said fluid was expected. (but he doesn't have to live with it)  Showed him pics and he said they all looked normal. Asked about why he even used stitches and he came out with how it helps to heal it quickly etc. However now can remove the soggy dressing in the morning, shower it, then cover it before getting repacked at drs. 20th - dull ache starts in bum, not so much in wound 22nd - pain still, gungey dressing still sodden, swab taken 28th - swab results: infection  Sharp, itchy, Swollen hips and back, severe pain and can barely walk.  JAN 2nd/3rd - ventured out both days to test strengths when shopping etc, felt better than I had done,  exudate much less and much cleaner 4th - last day of tablets, another swab taken after (white)  ribbon dressing looked green.  8th - results abnormal but expected 14th - very low exudate but small amount of blood 15th - blood when wiping after toilet, following dressing change 20th - dressing changes start to become every other day FEB 3rd - bum crack becomes sore - dressing changed from 17.5cm Allevyn Gentle to 12.5cm to try and stop sweat etc from getting trapped. Told to apply sudocream when possible.  4th - bum crack bleeds slightly 5th - told bum crack has small hole which is spotting blood (this time told not to use sudo cream 😑 7th - told tear below bottom hole of wound 12th - tear goes to 2cm long, silver dressing used 15th - reaction to atrauman AG dressing, sore, red, itchy 18th - still hole at top, split still leaking exudate 24th - told best it's ever looked 26th - told no more dressings/ appointments 27th - slight bleed when cleaning 28th - told 1cm split, told this can happen and just to apply small bit of aquacell and cavilon cream You can imagine the tears I've shed, the blood I've lost not to mention the many time I've happily felt like jumping off a bridge. I suffer with anxiety, PCOS and HS so this really just hit the nail on the head. I'm at a point where I just feel hopeless. The nurses seem not to care now - 3 months is probably too much strain on the NHS. Even though I was made to pay for prescriptions for my cleaning fluid and some dressings. Ive been out of work for 4 months and am struggling to continue with university. I never thought it would end up like this.  0 likes, 2 replies "

I had a large pilonidal cyst about 7 years ago the doctors said it was quite large I was put under 4 times and kept in the hospital for 2 weeks as I received treatment. The doctor said it was congenital and ended closing the area rather than leaving it open. Anyways to this day I often get aches and tenderness in the evenings and was wondering if anyone ells gets this as well. I am so nervous about developing one again and don’t know if the aches are normal. 0 likes, 2 replies "

Recently I have  had, not PF with the pain under the arch, but intense pain around the outside and side of the heel. This was almost as bad as PF and left me almost immobile for several days. After rest and many aspirin, ibuprofen, and paracetomol it subsided but was immediately replaced with an intense pain on the top of my foot, as though someone had stamped on it.

Basically I am going for the wide excision surgery in 6-8week due to my chronic PS issue. The surgeon said that this type of operation was the only option which I understand because of the extent of the issue. But he told me that a massive area of tissue (I mean Massive, 4-5inch acros/length and right down to the bone ) would need to be removed. On researching online I have noticed that there is huge variances between the amount of tissue removed. When I asked him why such a large area had to be removed he said it is fairly standard. So my question is how do they decide how much to remove?? I had a massive abscess that was drained under general anaesthetic (4weeks ago in the UK), is that why such a large area is going to be removed? Is there anything I can do or am I better off just letting the surgeon do his thing?  History: 3years history of PS with at least 7 infections.  Conservative treatment was unsuccessful other then getting rid of the small infections.  26year male, very fit and active. 4 weeks I had a drainage of a abscess, was in hospital for two days due to the severity of the infection, I was operated on and it has really improved after 3 weeks of packing. I would really appreciate any help anybody could give me as I am self employed and the sooner I can recover the better. Plus rugby season is starting and I want to get back to training.  Thanks, Gavin  0 likes, 3 replies "

My mom drained it all. Since then it's been open. It doesn't hurt or leak unless I push it or squeeze it. And when i do it's mostly blood. But a few drops like 3 or 4 drops. And a week ago my wound got closed and no blood even when I squeezed but recently it popped again and there was pus inside. I cleaned it all again and its the same thing now. Little blood and little pus when i squeeze the wound from above. I don't have any pain at all nor is it leaking. Do I need a surgery? I'm really scared of surgery and my day involves lots of moment. So I can't stay in bed for 2 months or so. Can I cure this without surgery? 0 likes, 2 replies "

Four years ago i had my first bout with PR, I was 18 years old and i had broken out all over my torso. From what i remember i also experienced fatigue and anxiety do to the rash. I had it diagnosed by a dermatologist and it eventually cleared up. Two years ago i had another breakout of PR but it only lasted a few weeks and it was just on my abdomen. Right now i am experiencing another small outbreak of PR and a dermatologist has diagnosed it again. i am under a lot of stress right now so the fatigue i am feeling associated with it is intense. I also went in to get an ultrasound of my lymph nodes because they became so inflamed. The symptom making me the most anxious is the shortness of breath. It feels like i need to take an extra deep breath sometimes throughout the day but i do not notice it when exercising. My doctor thinks it is a mixture between fatigue and anxiety but i am curious to know if anyone else has felt this minor shortness of breath symptom as well as small recurrences of the rash! -Alex 0 likes, 5 replies "

I have no pain, no  , nothing of the sort, but I am worried about one thing. As I was changing the gauze the other day I touched the wound and noticed that there is a kind of ""bump"", as if the skin underneath is very hard. It did not hurt to touch it, but then when I took a picture of the wound, i noticed that it is slightly red. So I was wondering if this is just part of the healing process? Should I be worried?

On september 13, 2017 , I sat all day long in front of my desk, studying for 4 exams for the next day. I finished at 1AM and laid down immediately in my bed to get some sleep but I suddenly felt tiny pain at my back. I thought it was only because of too much time i spent sitting and studying. The pain was gone for several days but as soon as vacation started, the pain came back and 2 days later, a bump started to grow in that area. I had it checked at the hospital but I still haven't received the results yet. At first, the bump was felt internally but now, it's already seen outside and it's very painful that I can't even walk wihout waddling, and I haven't laid on my back since the pain started, only laid on my sides. So yesterday, I started taking   because my parents said so, I thought it would at least have it healed quickly. Yesterday, it started oozing pus, it was very smelly and it was all over my underwear, the smell penetrated through my bedsheets, and I've never smelled this nasty before. Is this a good thing? The pus is more of a yellowish but also brownish when too much comes out. Sometimes, blood comes out too but it's 1/10 of the pus. Until now, it's still leaking pus, so I wore pads inside my underwear to prevent it from spreading nasty odor around my room, my bed, and my clothes. My main concern is, 1. I've been cleaning the pus until now with a toilet paper, is it safe to use toilet paper in cleanig the pus?  2. When will it stop leaking pus? Uni starts in three days, so I'm very worried that I'll be smelly at school, waddling like a penguin because of the pain that the bump gives. 3. As said above, classes will start soon so I don't have much time for operation. Any suggestions to take care of it at home? I will be sharing updates about my """"bump"""" every now and then, maybe, and I would like to hear comments from anyone who would want to help me. : )  thank you 0 likes, 5 replies "

I'm writing on behalf of my mother, who last September had to undergo an tough operation involving the removal of a macroadenoma of the pituitary gland. While the operation was successful, it left her with a hemiparesis on the LEFT side. She was also in a coma for about two days after the intervention. The nasty bugger was apparently massive and had done some major damage to the pituitary gland and reached the hypothalamus, although damage done there was apparently very minor. The epicrisis mentioned about 90% of the tumor having been removed. : We've done several MRI scans since then, showing no residual mass in the location with no new signs of a tumor reappearing. We're constantly doing rehabilitation, so she is now able to walk (with our support, still losing balance when in open spaces) and perform various exercises with her hand! 😃 (still can't preform daily activities - long road ahead there!) For medication - she is prescribed  Dehydrocortison (5mg tablets, 1 in the morning and 1/2 before bed) and Nootropil (1200mg, twice a day - contains Piracetam). For the first few months, she was also prescribed Citicoline, but has now stopped taking it. I'm not mentioning other minor minerals, vitamins and eating supplements, but can do if need be.  I should mention that multiple blood tests in recent months showed increased levels of   and   in her bloodstream. We have an upcoming SPECT scan of here parathyroid glands in a few days, to see if a tumour might be causing this. We were told she should drink lots of water... So, that's that. Sorry for the wall of text! I can provide additional information if needed, like more detailed breakdown of medication regimes, MRI scan reports and so on. Any suggestions are welcome - mainly for the mouth, as eating difficulties are currently the main factor for depression and whatnot... Thanks in advance! 😃 0 likes, 1 reply "

After doing 2 rounds of testing with 2 different doctors, I have come out with the diagnosis that my tumor is a secreting tumor with both the cortisol level and the growth hormone. However, it is massive in size at 1.6cm prompting my endo to tell me that I will be having surgery, no matter the hormones , due to the fact it is affecting my vision and causing increased intracranial pressure. So now, I get to face the upcoming surgery date unknown at this present moment with the risk that my gland will be removed due to where the tumor is coming out from (it is sitting in the folds of the front and rear).

However, the exterminator found nothing and no one else in our house had a rash. The next derm I saw made the PR diagnosis. She said it would go away in a few weeks. In May,   my rash was still going strong despite using aloe, topical steroids, eucerine, sun etc. The derm did a second biopsy and said i just had extremely dry skin and she suggested photo therapy. She said maybe it would work or not. The photo therapy is so pricey and i needed a more confident reply from her. I decided to wait longer for the rash to resolve.  It didn't. Here I am in Sept 2019, almost a year later, still with PR. MY 3rd derm gave me a cortisone shot and said if this doesn't work then I can wait or do photo-therapy. He also said he sees many patients who have PR last for a very, very long time.  The shot has helped a lot. I'm hopeful it's on it's way out finally!

That same week, I developed a persistent dry cough (which lasted a little less than two weeks). Eventually, the mark grew and became more oval with a very noticeable ring. It got super itchy and raised. I thought it was ringworm so I started applying Lotrimin to it daily. A week later, it dried up and got flaky. I then noticed some more itchy bumps on my neck and on my underarms. Two weeks into October, I started getting extremely itchy all over and noticed that hives appeared on places I scratched. Just in one night, I developed itchy rashes ALL OVER my body. My face got super bumpy and swollen (but no rash) as well as my neck. Freaked out, I visited the urgent care center. They assumed poison ivy or maybe some other form of contact dermatitis and gave me some antihistamines and prednisone. After two days of trying everything including switching antihistamines, I was still covered in hives/rashes and was unable to sleep at night due to the itchiness. It got worse so I returned. They gave me a steroid injection saying it would help with symptoms. It did not. After one week of misery, I decided to visit my PCP for a different opinion. He too assumed it was an allergic reaction to something like poison ivy and prescribe even more antihistamines. those did not help either. At this point, I was stressed and depressed. After two weeks of severe hives/rashes, my family members got worried and suggested that I went to the ER so that at least they could at least refer me to an allergist or something. I decided to give it one last shot and consulted another doctor (this time online). After looking at pictures and asking me questions,  he said there was a good chance I had PR. That day, I looked up pretty much every single scientific journal I could find that talked about PR and everything made sense. It's now been about two weeks since the full body rashes appeared. I will include some photos. The skin on my neck, chest, underarms and shoulder blades are now super leathery, dry, and flaky. Despite moisturizing my body with Aquaphor Ointment every few hours, it's still flaky!!! I am afraid I'll have scars from all the scratching. It's truly unbearable and I wouldnt wish this on anybody including my worst enemy. So tell me, what's the healing stage like for you guys? How many weeks/months did this whole thing last for you and is flaky skin a sign of healing? 0 likes, 0 replies "

After a couple more weeks a rash started to appear on my stomach, then the next day my back, then the next day my groin and finally on my upper legs and my arms.

I took 2 a day for 3 days but stopped as I continued doing research and had read that the cause of pityriasis rosea may be related to poor gut health and a form of an auto immune disease. A lady had followed an auto immune diet (easily found on Google) and her rash had cleared up fast. At this point I was desperate to try anything to get rid of it as I kept noticing new spots every day and it was 40 degrees in Hanoi and I was too self conscious to wear clothes that exposed my rash - also I am a BIG believer that food is medicine. So I decided to follow the diet too (loosely) - I didn't go as far as offal for breakfast, but I only drank water or tumeric tea and  ate nothing but meat, fish and lots of vegetables and LOTS of kimchi for 6 days straight and moisturised my body with coconut oil around 3-4 times a day. My rash noticeably calmed down and pretty much disappeared from my torso and arms within this week leaving just a few angry spots on my upper right thigh near the herald. The following week it had all cleared up and the herald started to fade too. I felt so relieved as I had convinced myself it would last the full 12 weeks, if not more. I'm still not certain what or how my rash cleared up, but I strongly believe the big change in diet helped! I also read about L-lysine supplements which I purchased and took 4 every day during the 'gut cleanse' diet, so they could also have helped to clear my rash too. If you're suffering with pityriasis rosea then I really hope this helps as I was so desperate to find any information a few months ago when I was suffering with it. 1 like, 0 replies "

If you're reading this, you must have been diagnosed with pityriasis rosea. If you're anything like me, you've probably spent the last few days obsessively reading about it on the web. If you're disappointed by what you've seen (the rash lasting for years, being super painful, etc) then keep on reading! I managed to clear mine up by 90% within the first two weeks of having it. The day before I noticed the rash, I thought I had a stomach flu. I had just come off a month-long cold and was feeling so nauseous I threw up multiple times. This is part of the virus- it's normal to feel sick in some way before its appearance. My manifestation was like the flu- aches, vomiting, etc. The next morning, I woke up and found myself covered in little spots. I had noticed a few on my back the night before, but I figured they were just bites of some sort. When I looked in the mirror the next morning, however, I was horrified- they were all around my stomach and my back and they were super itchy. I immediately went to the clinic, where I spent the next few hours basically watching the rash spread down my arms. When I finally saw a doctor, they had no clue what it was- they told me it was either Hand, Foot and Mouth disease or chicken pox. They sent me to a dermatologist to be sure so off I went. Within 10 seconds she diagnosed me with pityriasis rosea. DISCLAIMER: she said I had an atypical case. I had no herald patch (although in the next few days I would develop 4-5 hearld patch looking spots) and the rash had come on super quickly. Relieved it wasn't chicken pox, I asked her how long it would last- and she told me MONTHS. At this point I basically wanted to die and I left her office holding back tears. When I got home, I literally spent the next 48 hours alternating between crying and looking up this awful rash. What I saw stressed me out even more- people saying their rash had lasted years, spread to their faces, was ruining their lives, etc. What I noticed, however, was that many of these people had put off seeing a doctor or had gotten misdiagnosed. I figured that my best chance of beating this thing was treating it as quickly and aggressively as possible. Let me just say- I had one of the worst cases I've read about. By the fourth day I was literally covered from the top of my neck down to my toes. Nothing was spared- not my feet, not my hands, not my scalp, not my 'lady parts' and i even had some on the inside of my mouth. I was literally polka-dotted with these big, blotchy red things. It was also EXTREMELY itchy, I wanted to crawl out of my skin and I could barely sleep. It was so depressing that I couldn't even look in the mirror. Honestly, I don't think you can understand how bad this makes you feel until you have it yourself. I could hardly look at myself without crying. That first night, however, I had to do something (I couldn't just sit around and watch it get worse!) so I went out and bought my first weapon: Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength shampoo (blue bottle, orange liquid). I applied it dry on my body 1-2 times a day and rinsed it off in the shower about 10 minutes after.  After a few days of this I just used it as a body wash, although I would let it sit for about 5 minutes before washing it off. This would temporarily make the rash bright red which was kind of depressing, but it would also stop the itching for a while and by the next day the rash was already starting to look better. Then it was on to the second step. I had read so much about tanning being a miracle cure that I decided, against my anti-tanning bed morals, to give it a shot. Of course my dermatologist advised me not to (which doctor would??) but I refused to live with this rash for the next several months. Over the next week and a half I went every second day- starting at first with 5 minutes in the lowest UV ray bed and gradually going up to 6 minutes on a medium bed. The rash would be extra itchy and red immediately after tanning, but by the second visit I noticed an improvement. I honestly think that this is what helped me the most. Third attack- I applied Zinc Oxide 40% to my body every night. It can be found as a diaper rash cream. I honestly don't know if this worked, but it helped with the itching and also made my skin look paler, which in turn made the rash look better which helped my stress levels. NOTE: I also used aveeno intensive moisturizer, with oatmeal. This really helped with the itching- I get that it's a bit counter-intuitive as we want to dry out the rash, but don't worry, that's not what it's moisturizing. It was honestly hard for me to even touch my body when it was looking so disgusting, but it was worth it in the end. I also took vitamin C and rubbed the soles of my feet with tea tree oil, along with drinking loads of water, fruit/veggies and green tea. Help your body out! By the end of the first week, the rash was already starting to fade. I had a few setbacks- on day 9, I randomly got a crop of patches all over my neck and even on my face. As bad as that was, they all disapeared within 2-3 days. Even now I find a new one once in a while but it's usually gone by the end of the day. I'm now exactly 16 days from when I was diagnosed. My rash has cleared up by 90%- all that is left is a few brown spots that just look like bruises. I feel so relieved I can't even tell you! Don't give up hope. There's no reason anyone should be suffering from this when there ARE cures out there. Follow the steps above and I'm hopeful you can clear yourself up just as fast! And just remember not to let this get you down too much. I know that even just 2 weeks can seem too long for something like this, but just stay positive and keep your smile. No one goes through life without getting something like this. As much as all these steps above helped me, what helped the most was going out with my friends and talking and laughing. Showing them the rash relieved me so much- people are kinder than you think and you don't need to go through this alone. Good luck and let me know if you have any questions! *as a sidenote - my doctor perscribed me a cortisone cream. I suggest not using it. After doing some research, I found that this can actually make the rash last longer. Use Zinc Oxide for the itching!   5 likes, 83 replies "

That first night, however, I had to do something (I couldn't just sit around and watch it get worse!) so I went out and bought my first weapon: Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength shampoo (blue bottle, orange liquid). I applied it dry on my body 1-2 times a day and rinsed it off in the shower about 10 minutes after.  After a few days of this I just used it as a body wash, although I would let it sit for about 5 minutes before washing it off. This would temporarily make the rash bright red which was kind of depressing, but it would also stop the itching for a while and by the next day the rash was already starting to look better. Then it was on to the second step. I had read so much about tanning being a miracle cure that I decided, against my anti-tanning bed morals, to give it a shot. Of course my dermatologist advised me not to (which doctor would??) but I refused to live with this rash for the next several months. Over the next week and a half I went every second day- starting at first with 5 minutes in the lowest UV ray bed and gradually going up to 6 minutes on a medium bed. The rash would be extra itchy and red immediately after tanning, but by the second visit I noticed an improvement. I honestly think that this is what helped me the most. Third attack- I applied Zinc Oxide 40% to my body every night. It can be found as a diaper rash cream. I honestly don't know if this worked, but it helped with the itching and also made my skin look paler, which in turn made the rash look better which helped my stress levels. NOTE: I also used aveeno intensive moisturizer, with oatmeal. This really helped with the itching- I get that it's a bit counter-intuitive as we want to dry out the rash, but don't worry, that's not what it's moisturizing. It was honestly hard for me to even touch my body when it was looking so disgusting, but it was worth it in the end. I also took vitamin C and rubbed the soles of my feet with tea tree oil, along with drinking loads of water, fruit/veggies and green tea. Help your body out! By the end of the first week, the rash was already starting to fade. I had a few setbacks- on day 9, I randomly got a crop of patches all over my neck and even on my face. As bad as that was, they all disapeared within 2-3 days. Even now I find a new one once in a while but it's usually gone by the end of the day. I'm now exactly 16 days from when I was diagnosed. My rash has cleared up by 90%- all that is left is a few brown spots that just look like bruises. I feel so relieved I can't even tell you! Don't give up hope. There's no reason anyone should be suffering from this when there ARE cures out there. Follow the steps above and I'm hopeful you can clear yourself up just as fast! And just remember not to let this get you down too much. I know that even just 2 weeks can seem too long for something like this, but just stay positive and keep your smile. No one goes through life without getting something like this. As much as all these steps above helped me, what helped the most was going out with my friends and talking and laughing. Showing them the rash relieved me so much- people are kinder than you think and you don't need to go through this alone. Good luck and let me know if you have any questions! *as a sidenote - my doctor perscribed me a cortisone cream. I suggest not using it. After doing some research, I found that this can actually make the rash last longer. Use Zinc Oxide for the itching!   5 likes, 83 replies "

If you're reading this, you must have been diagnosed with pityriasis rosea. If you're anything like me, you've probably spent the last few days obsessively reading about it on the web. If you're disappointed by what you've seen (the rash lasting for years, being super painful, etc) then keep on reading! I managed to clear mine up by 90% within the first two weeks of having it. The day before I noticed the rash, I thought I had a stomach flu. I had just come off a month-long cold and was feeling so nauseous I threw up multiple times. This is part of the virus- it's normal to feel sick in some way before its appearance. My manifestation was like the flu- aches, vomiting, etc. The next morning, I woke up and found myself covered in little spots. I had noticed a few on my back the night before, but I figured they were just bites of some sort. When I looked in the mirror the next morning, however, I was horrified- they were all around my stomach and my back and they were super itchy. I immediately went to the clinic, where I spent the next few hours basically watching the rash spread down my arms. When I finally saw a doctor, they had no clue what it was- they told me it was either Hand, Foot and Mouth disease or chicken pox. They sent me to a dermatologist to be sure so off I went. Within 10 seconds she diagnosed me with pityriasis rosea. DISCLAIMER: she said I had an atypical case. I had no herald patch (although in the next few days I would develop 4-5 hearld patch looking spots) and the rash had come on super quickly. Relieved it wasn't chicken pox, I asked her how long it would last- and she told me MONTHS. At this point I basically wanted to die and I left her office holding back tears. When I got home, I literally spent the next 48 hours alternating between crying and looking up this awful rash. What I saw stressed me out even more- people saying their rash had lasted years, spread to their faces, was ruining their lives, etc. What I noticed, however, was that many of these people had put off seeing a doctor or had gotten misdiagnosed. I figured that my best chance of beating this thing was treating it as quickly and aggressively as possible. Let me just say- I had one of the worst cases I've read about. By the fourth day I was literally covered from the top of my neck down to my toes. Nothing was spared- not my feet, not my hands, not my scalp, not my 'lady parts' and i even had some on the inside of my mouth. I was literally polka-dotted with these big, blotchy red things.

I wasn’t too worried, since I did get dry skin here and there, and it also kind of looked like a bug bite. When I got a few more spots in the same area, I thought maybe I had   (which I’ve had before) so my doc wrote me a perscription for the cream. That weekend, I was at my friends house and the spots had spread up my chest and neck and I became alarmed so I went to an urgent care where I saw an FNP. She was really dumbfounded by the whole situation and prescribed me some hydroxyzine 25mg (kinda like benedryl) and gave me some hydrocortisone 2.5% and sent me on my way.

He thought I was bit by some type of bug out in the mountains and prescribed me a steroid to take over the next week. By friday, it was still about the same, so I called him and he said I had Pityriasis, which was so crazy because I had originally asked if that’s what I had (since I had been doing my internet research) and both doctors said no!! But I felt pretty confident with this diagnosis based on my lack of symptoms (I really wasn’t even itchy), and how the spots were mainly on the trunk of my body. I was definitely a little sad to find out that it lasts about 4-6 weeks on average… because I am a 21 year old college student and it was the summer! I was also worried when I read that some people had this disease for up to 3 months or more!! My advice would be to try not to let those numbers effect you. Try to stay positive about the whole experience. I used coconut oil every day, took oatmeal baths every couple days, washed with head and shoulders shampoo, and tried to get sun exposure. The spots on my neck and chest went away within a few days because I didn’t cover them up and I constantly exposed them to the sun!! Around week 3 (from the first day of the spot), I was definitely noticing it fade and by the start of week 4 (today), I would say I could wear a bikini if I had to!! A few spots remain around my thighs and hips, but they are relatively dark. It also got a little more itchy before it started to fade and I was never itchy before. For me, I found the my PR started to go away very quickly once I lost INTEREST in it. Once I stopped worrying about it, or counting the days, it was like I just woke up and it was gone one day!! If you have PR, it can definitely be scary, and I felt at times I was going to have it for the rest of my life, but it is just a temporary disease and it makes for an interesting story!! 1 like, 12 replies "

I wasn’t too worried, since I did get dry skin here and there, and it also kind of looked like a bug bite. When I got a few more spots in the same area, I thought maybe I had   (which I’ve had before) so my doc wrote me a perscription for the cream. That weekend, I was at my friends house and the spots had spread up my chest and neck and I became alarmed so I went to an urgent care where I saw an FNP. She was really dumbfounded by the whole situation and prescribed me some hydroxyzine 25mg (kinda like benedryl) and gave me some hydrocortisone 2.5% and sent me on my way.

I've had it for about 8 weeks now. About a week before it started to fade I think it 'peaked' it was intensely itchy and very dry and flaky. A week later the itch had all but gone (except when after a shower) The patches enlarged and flattened and started to fade from the inside of the patch outwards. During this time my skin was very flaky. Within a week the rash had faded down to a tan colour and once the flaking had gone the tan patches were dry looking but flat. The early patches and herald patch have almost completely faded and the patches I got later on are still there but beginning to go.  Its been a horrid 8 weeks but I'm glad that it seems to be going - I'm just praying that its gone for good and will stay away for my wedding next year.  For those of you in the middle of it and feeling miserable - IT WILL GO AWAY! I really felt that i would have it forever but I'm almost normal again now and I'm so relieved!

Each time Ive had it for more than a year along with a year to recover from the hyperpigmentation. Through my research i found that PR is a type of herpes virus and that taking Lysine may help to stop it as Lysine can hinder viral reproduction. Sure enough this year  PR tried to come back. I started taking two 1500 mg of Lysine a day  After a week the spots started to clear. I thought i was over PR so I stopped taking the Lysine  and the rash tried to return. So for a month i repeated my dose and so far so good. This has also worked for my nephew. I think the key is to self disgnose early and start the supplements immediately before you see your doctor if you have no   to these supplements.  hope this helps someone! 1 like, 0 replies "

I am currently experiencing a recurrance of  . I had the first occurance about 9 or 10 years ago and my Dr too was not only surprised to see a rare disorder but to see it in someone at my age. I was 27 then. Even more surprised now at late 30's! I too thought there was a patch of ringworm on my arm and recently had an awful cold and took 2 days off work (that's really rare for me as I'm a bit a workaholic).  I didn't pay any attention to it at first, the spots that now cover my tummy, and a fear of having chicken pox actually made me look into what I had. When I read the symptons I realised that my symptons are classic. I would have left it at that, because I'm not suffering at all - not even itchy spots, provided I don't scratch the herald patch -  I don't even notice it. It was only when I read that only 2% recurs that I read on and found your experiences. My herald patch and spots has been so typical in both cases that there is no doubt it is pityriasis rosea. My Dr the first time told me that it was most likely to be stress related.  My only curiosity this time is why now?

Suffered from PF for several years. My first trouble was a few years ago, I went through, anti-inflammatorys(diclafenic), store bought insoles, stretching exercises and a refferal to   where they made me custom insoles. Eventually 3 lots of   that lasted a little less each time After a few months it actually subsided for a long time but unfortunately since a few months ago its come back with vengeance! I'm doing everything I can, stretching, golf ball and ice bottle every night, docs gave me naprroxen and Co codomol which just aren't helping enough. I wear thick socks and insoles and very good supportive trainers. The problem is I've been told I'm extremely flat footed and I'm also on my feet 10 hours a day for work. I've been refferd back to podiatry and today out of desperation I took another injection from the doctor (which is just made it madly painful at least at the time of writing. I'm not sure what more podiatry can do, and I feel I'm at my wits end with almost constant pain and occasional sharp stabs that almost make me collapse. Any more advice from fellow sufferers would be appreciated. Thank you.  5 likes, 25 replies "

It all started with me sitting in a chair and trying to curl my toes upwards when I suddenly felt a stabbing pain in my left heel. At first I thought that it was a cracked heel but was puzzled at how on earth it would have happened with me taking a good care of my feet and doing regular pedicures. And then I immediately thought about plantar fasciitis because I have two friends who have had it. I was waiting for a week for it to go away, hoping that I was wrong but that didn't happened. Went to my doctor who confirmed what I suspected - plantar fasciitis. I was devastated as I love going for long walks, running and doing boot camp style circuits several times per week as well as regular personal training sessions. I work as a housekeeper in a private home, so most of my day is spent being on my feet. This was the worst possible condition I could get! I spent 3 weeks feeling utterly miserable and depressed. Lost my appetite, lost 3kg of my weight and had nightmares about dead bodies. Meanwhile my personal trainer tried to persuade me to see a physiotherapist in a clinic where he used to work. I went there 3 days ago and regained my peace of mind. I am lucky in that respect that I caught it early, I knew what it was right away and stopped running and exercising except for walking. I had a full gait analysis and the results were quite shocking for me. Apparently my lower back muscles are very weak and cannot support my pelvis when I walk or run. Also I have a tight calf muscle (soleus) in my left leg. Both these things combined make me pronate inwards heavily while walking and running. The stress of it was too much for my plantar fascia and it resulted in a mechanical trauma. The physiotherapist was quite optimistic about my recovery and even advised me to continue exercising including running but avoid jumping. I am not sure about running but I am happy that I can continue my daily walks and not worry about causing any further damage to my foot. I will also have to do exercises to strenghen my lower back muscles and release the tension in my left calf. I also did a research about dietary requirements with this condition and herbal remedies. I am against synthetic drugs. Haven't taken anything since I was 17! Apparently, we should eat lots of salmon, sardines and pineapples. Luckily I love all these things and am very well stocked up on them now. From the list of herbal remedies stinging nettles caught my eye. Four years ago I cured my   by placing nettles straight on my back. So, now I am putting them on my foot inside the sock. I am also drinking bucketloads of nettle tea and even soaking my feet in it. It might be just psychological or a placebo effect but all my pain and discomfort is gone. I am not saying that everybody should try it but it certainly helps me. I definitely think that it is worthwhile having your gait analysed. As resting and not exercising alone will not cure the root problem. Unfortunately, this thing is getting worse for me. Been in pain for 4 days, cannot put the heel to the ground, so I am half limping half tiptoeing around at work. Needless to say it's making me depressed and miserable again. I am ready to try anything if it helps! If there is somebody who jas succesfully got rid of this condition, please, please, let me know how you did it!

I think it may be the form called policemans heel so I have increased the cushioning in my walking boots so now have gel heel pads, gel PF insoles and ordinary insoles and it makes walking bearable. I have just tied a roll on Pain relief called Biofreeze and the pain is much reduced better than the Voltarol I had been using so worth a try if you are a fellow sufferer. Manged my weeks skiing OK with PF insoles in my skiboots and fortunatly the boots take the strain off the foot as they clamp the whole foot and ankle so most of your wieght is tranferred to the calf, unfotunatly they are hell to walk far in otherwise I would be clumping around in them at home.

I dealt with the pain in both feet for two year - shoes - inserts etc.  As a martial artist I tried to stretch over and over again. I was in pain all day long, but mornings was the worst. I took a trip to Washington DC in October 2017 and that was the clincher. Finally in October 2017,  I sought treatment.  I had the shots and physical therapy.  By January 2018 i was mostly pain free.  Despite the constant stretching and karate, in March 2018, the pain was back with a vengeance in my right foot.  Back to the doctor for another shot, but the Dr. ordered an MRI instead.  The weekend before the appt to review the test, i started having pain in my Achilles tendon.  The MRI showed multiple tears in the plantar fasciitis and surgery was scheduled.  Because of the new pain in the Achilles tendon, we decided to do the gastroncnemius procedure as well. Like most people i read everything on the procedure and was beginning to have  doubts.  The problem with the net is everyone is always willing to post negative comments and the success stories not so much. I had the procedure on April 15, 2018.  I was in the surgery center for only a few hours.  I think the procedures took less than 20-25 minutes.  I was sent home in a walking boot with crutches. Day 1 - I have a very high tolerance for pain - probably because of the karate.  I took one Oxycontin as the gastrocnemius was causing the most pain.  the plantar faciitisomy  was barely noticeable. Lots of ice and Motrin Day 2 - I took another Oxycontin and lot's of Motrin and icing. Day 3 - 10  I stopped the Oxycontin and kept up with the Icing and Motrin.  By day 10 I no longer needed both crutches.  One was fine.  I progressively, as recommended by the Dr, increased the weight on my foot. Day 14 - Ditched the boot for a sketcher shoe and the one crutch. took steps one at a time and started PT. Day 21 - stitches removed and used a cane.  I could walk short distances without a cane. Between day 21 and June 30, i was diligent about my PT.  I was walking 3/4 to a mile everyday by the middle of June walked two miles.  I never really had any pain in the heel again. It's all in the calf below the incision.  It's June 30, and i can still feel it when i stretch and do my PT at home.  I've sprinted 40 yards with no pain, but the therapist said to hold off until i don't feel the tightness in my calf. I've been walking around in bare feet for the past month.  Do I feel tightness in the am?  yes, sometimes, but it works itself out after a minute. Yesterday was my last day of physical therapy.  They were really impressed in how fast i progressed, but that's what happens when you do your PT every day, sometimes three times a day.  It will be another 3-4 months before that tightness goes away, but I plan on starting back my Karate in two weeks.  You read a lot about inserts and this type of shoe and that type of shoe.

I’m just wondering how long I’ll have to be on crutches until this unbearable pain finally decides to go.  My gp never mentioned to me about using crutches for my affected foot.  He only gave me a prescription for an ointment for the pain. Witch by the way hasn’t been affective what so ever.  Should I be using something else other than the crutches?  So far using my crutches has been the only thing that’s help. But I don’t want to have to be on crutches anymore than I have to be. What else is there to try? Oh and I’ve also use a frozen water bottle on my foot twice already. Does a splint help at all?  0 likes, 50 replies "

Over the past 3 years I have had 6 SP on my right side. This past March I had a Pleurodesis that failed. Every time they took the tube out my lung would collapse again. I was transferred to St Louis to see a expert who also couldn’t explain why his was happing. I’m sure all of you know that when the tube is clamped and the lung holds they know it’s time to pull the tube. Well 3 separate times this was the case and my lung still collapsed so they performed a Pleurectomy which had now held. Anyone else had one before? I’m full of strange pains but I know that’s to be expected. Now I have been having pain on the left side which has never happened. I have had 2 incidents that felt like a SP but pain went away after 10 minutes. The pain is deferent though. Anyone had SP on both sides but feel different on the left side? Just frustrated and doctors just seem to brush it off. Have seen doctors in 3 different states ( I move a lot with work). All have different ideas and answers none of which seem to help. Thank you to anyone who has some advice.  0 likes, 1 reply "

I am a 21 year old female who first started getting spontanius pneumothorax's when i was 19 on both lungs. Last year (when I was 20) they operated on both lungs, on seperate occassions, to perform a bullectomy, pleurodesis and pleuroectomy. (Top marks for remembering the names!) I am now one year on from having the surgery, like others that I have read about on here, I also have the sharp pains on both sides sometimes. They are normally like a sharp stabbing pain for about 30 seconds and then it goes. (Something to do with nerve damage from the operations I have been told). However, the reason why I am writing on here is that yesterday the dreading air bubble sound in my chest came and I was feeling a bit of pain (exactly like the symptoms from my other pneumothorax's). So, I went down to a and e, had an xray which came back fine. However, I woke up this morning, the pain was slightly worse, and the air bubbling sound is still there. I dont know what to do. I feel silly going back to a and e, like im being paranoid or something? Its the air bubbling sound that really worries me though? Has anyone else had a similar experience after surgery? Surely my lung can't be collapsing again after having all 3 procedures on both sides? I would be very grateful for any advice or to hear similar experiences! 1 like, 28 replies "

I spent a week in a hospital ward full of   sufferers (I was the lucky one) and the mental scars you deal with when it happens are terrible, I thought I was going to breakdown as I coudn't understand why it happened....but..... it also has got to be one of best things that has ever happened to me, I stopped smoking straight away and have not touched a cigarette in the last 12 months, it made me realise what was important in life, 4 months after surgery my boyfriend and I went travelling for 2 months, we climbed the great wall of china and have done so many great things since it happened. It took quite a few months for the pain to subside (and the pain was horrific) and I still get the odd twinge and stabbing pain now and again.. I have accepted that I probably will for a very long time and I refuse to let it get me down, I ignore it and carry on. I changed my attitude about it and wouldnt let it beat me and having a positive outlook really helped me. When I went through the worst part I read so many horror stories on the internet, so I wanted to say this isnt one of those, yes it was absolutely horrendous but its turned out ok and I am sure there are many more people that have the same experience as me and for those that are struggling, I really feel your pain but try and be positive and make the most of what you have now. 7 likes, 88 replies "

I read that having lymes for a long time it will eventually move ro your tissue and bone so it will not be found in the blood any longer. Is this true? I know you cant believe what you read on the internet but it would make so much sense because I am having alot of random pain in my joints. My pcp just said she was going to continue with muscle relaxers ext. but I really want to know wth is in my body. So basically, is it possible to test negative for lymes after 12 years and should I try to find a LLMD or a disease doctor. Or is being IGg 41 ab nothing to worry about?

My symptoms were ignored by doctors.  I became very ill and this went on a long time. Finally I found I had several tick infections, one was anaplasma phag which is on the rise in the UK. I was treated with doxy.  Here is the problem, from my own research anaplasma phag alters the normal bacteria living on the spleen and no one knows the result of this. It can also stay positive in the blood at very low levels so you don't really know its gone.  It can make you a carrier and because of this many expensive horses who have survived the initial illness are eventually culled.  What I have found it that it does is to make me attractive to other parasites and I believe my immune system is compromised so its hard to clear them. I  have a fairly horrible life at present coping, this is highly depressive. Take care not to get bitten.  A new vet study shiws Anaplasma is far more prevalent in the UK than originally thought. 0 likes, 0 replies "

It usually happens after I swallow a pill. But sometimes it is accompanied with a very dull pain in the same area and even my upper back when I swallow. It goes away after a few hours but I've noticed it more lately since I've been more worried about it. I'm writing about this now because just last night I started noticing a weird feeling toward the back of my throat whenever I swallow and it is just now starting to hurt a little bit, particularly whenever I yawn.

The irritation/sensation being only on the right, in such a discrete area, is making me worry I've got a tumor in there.

I haven't fainted which I am thankful for, but my symptoms appeared out of THIN air and I am so frustrated as to why and or how I have developed these mystery symptoms. I have an appointment with an Electrophysiologist tomorrow and I am demanding more testing and if he needs to send me to further specialists I will gladly go. I feel as if I am at the end of my rope and all of these symptoms are due to some genetic/point mutation in my body as it is unexplained. I'm not sure how to deal with forcing myself food for the rest of my life, or not being able to enjoy the outdoors/beach any more. This is the definition of living hell for a girl who is 21 years old to be going through such a bizarre unexplained illness or set of symptoms. If ANYONE has any sort of information and or tips/help to provide for me please do. I am at a complete loss and seeing all my friends enjoy day to day activities and go out on the weekends absolutely breaks my heart as I used to be the most happy/outgoing girl with everything ahead of me, and now I have the worst anxiety because I feel like a total freak and no one will ever want to be with someone so troubled. Keep in mind I look completely healthy and normal so it is very deceiving. please help and please do not tell me it's anxiety/depression related. If I could go back to June and not have any of this happen to me believe me I would. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Oddly though, whenever I drink, I sleep less for a few days and feel much more active and social. I have been like this since my first time drinking at 15. I'm a pretty sporadic drinker, sometimes I won't drink for months, i'll drink for a few days straight, then not drink for months all over. This is how I know it isn't alcoholism, except for some reason I seem to be dependent on depressants, the only ones i've tried being alcohol and xanax. They both have the same after-effects, being I feel 110% for a few days after then I bottom back out. I have not ever had any non-prescribed stimulants, so I don't really know how they effect me, but everything seems to be backwards for me. My only idea is that I took Concerta 54 for 2 years in highschool, and I quit cold turkey in the middle of the year, no withdrawal symptoms there either. Oddly enough though, I feel like its effects still linger to this day, 4 years later. I have read that amphetamines have permanent effects on brain chemistry, so that's the only conclusion I can really come to. Could that be why I seem to be dependent on depressants? and why they seem to affect me in the opposite manor that they should?  To be clear, I have no mental issues other than ADD when I was younger, if you want to call that an ""issue"". I never tried a drug or drank prior to being prescribed concerta, and these ""symptoms"", if that's what you want to call them, have no negative impact on my life. I'm simply curious, as nobody i've ever met has shared this same phenomenon(I don't know what else to call it).  0 likes, 3 replies "

I've hidden this all from my wife and have been caught a few times each time I promise to stop but end up relapsing (and hiding it again).  I have acquired these opiates (codeine, tramadol and oxycontin) by lying to my GP about back pain. After the new year I got caught again and my wife basically said stop now or go, we went to the doctors together and I admitted everything (yet again).  My doctor gave me a taper plan and referred me to a addiction center. Its not going well at all.  My wife was very dubious about me going but I said at least I can try, I attended the first meeting and all looked quite promising.  The first thing they do is get you to admit you have a problem,  The second meeting my keyworker stated that he thinks I need to see their specialist doctor and will more than likely need to go on ORT (Opiate replacement therapy) which will probably be Buprenorphine and this will probably last about 6 months as well as normal weekly counselling sessions and weekly drug tests to make sure I am conforming with the plan. I thought this would be a good idea but when I returned home and suggested this to my wife the SHTF.  She basically said no way and that I wasnt going to be going back to my next session. ""you dont need it"" was the response I got.  Basically she thinks I can stop and after 2-3 days everything will be back to normal.  She doesnt understand addiction and hates drugs.  I've explained this to my key worker and he stated to bring her in so he can talk to her.  She wouldnt  go and if she did she wouldnt listen to a word anyway, she so stubborn. I know I have let her down and my kids down but i really now believe this ORT will work for me. So my next session is tomorrow, which I will will see the doctor, and basically cant go, if I do and come back with a script my marriage will be over and ill lose my kids,  if I dont go I fear i will relapse and my marriage will be over and ill lose my kids.

I was then put straight onto mirtazapine 15mg, along with diazepam as a GP had diagnosed me with anxiety and completley dismissed the sertraline as the cause of the symptoms I was having after taking it, I was fine for 4 weeks then when came off the diazepam and just on the mirtazepine I became extremley anxious and started to become suicidal and having really dark thoughts and was not myself and just felt like a stranger in my own life, felt like my brain was shutting down mental health wise and everything else. I was then immediately put onto citalopram 10mg, on 18th december 2019, along with quetiapine 25mg for ""anxiety"" and depression, I was doing well for a couple of weeks then went downhill again and became extremley depressed again, resulting in me being signed off work again. my dosage was upped to 20mg, and quetiapine 50mg at night to slow my anxious and suicidal thoughts which doesnt do anything at all. I was then after about a week, fine for almost 4 weeks, I became the best version of myself, calmer (I've always been quite snappy), i was genuinely happy and i found I got along with everyone better, it took alot to stress me out or worry me, this was the case for around 4 weeks, which is when I went EXTREMLEY downhill again, became extremley suicidal, contemplated taking all my pills whilst my daughter and partner wasnt here I was on my own, or moving out so my partner and 2 year old daughter dont have to deal with me anymore, as a constantly crying suicidal mess, not functioning, not sleeping, not washing, not talking, not eating etc. it got so bad that we ended up getting our local mental health team intensive service involved becuase I so badly wanted help to not feel that way anymore as it scares me so much, as I have everything in life and absolute no reason to have depression or anxiety, i was signed off from work for another month (2.5 months in total so far), and had mental health team visiting me daily. I saw a phsyciatrist and he upped my dosage of citalopram to 30mg, he said the reason I dipped straight back down was just down to my dosage not being high enough, I trusted this as seemed like a logical explanation and he has been a phsyciatrist for 37 years. I was then told to take diazepam to calm down my distress over the suicidal thoughts, and help me cope until the new dosage kicked in which the phsyciatrist said to expect small improvements after a week. I also started propranalol for the physical symptoms of anxiety, after starting the propranalol I was FINE, I was my complete normal self despite still having the mental anxiety, which I believed to be down to the dosage being upped and the propranalol, which I was taking 40mg 3x a day. I again had 4 very good weeks where I finally thought I was better, I was mega excited to go back to work, I was happy again, I finally truly believed that it was all behind me, I expected to have a bad day here and there but I didnt care as I finally felt better. then last Sunday I started to get the burning sensation in my chest again, almost exactly 5 weeks after my dosage was upped and 3 - 4 weeks after I had started to feel better, I didnt panic too much, as I thought that it may just be abit of a blip and tried my hardest to convince myself that this didnt mean I was going to become really unwell again. so i went back to work tuesday as planned despite me feeling and noticing I was spiralling again, and tried my hardest to just get on with it, this didnt work and now I have came massively crashing down again, I have called MH team and GP who both said take 1 extra propranalol and diazepam twice a day for couple of days, which I've done this week and I'm no better and back to square one of being suicidal and basically non functioning again and scared, lost and alone, fearing I'm going to have to quit my job, feeling disconnected from the world around me, not myself again, trapped in my own head and frustrated, extremley upset, feeling like I've let down my employer and my partner and little girl as although I cant help it and am trying my hardest, they simply do not deserve to have to deal with my mental health declining like this every 4 weeks, it's like I get a glimpse of my life back then snatched back away and to say I'm heartbroken is an understatement, I'm not eating, not sleeping and barley functioning again, and unable to concentrate which means I'll have to be signed off again and I'm actually contemplating having to quit my job that I loved so so much. I guess what I'm asking is what the hell do I do now? do I stay with citalopram 30mg, do I change completley to another medication? I'm so lost and alone and my partner is getting frustrated aswell I just dont know what to do as I cant go on much longer with this I feel so detached from everyone and everything am crying multiple times a day becuase I cant live like this it's like my personality is gone when am like this I'm like an empty shell, not taking care of myself properly, not eating, not sleeping, waking up feeling horrible and dreading another day, cant show love or affection to my partner or daughter, can hardly talk to them that much, all I want is my life back, as currently my life is disappearing before my eyes, I'll end up having to quit my job, I've even debated leaving my daughter and partner and moving out so they dont have to go through this with me, is there anyone out there who has had a similar reaction to sertraline who came out the other side?😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 0 likes, 9 replies "

I was then told to take diazepam to calm down my distress over the suicidal thoughts, and help me cope until the new dosage kicked in which the phsyciatrist said to expect small improvements after a week.

I again had 4 very good weeks where I finally thought I was better, I was mega excited to go back to work, I was happy again, I finally truly believed that it was all behind me, I expected to have a bad day here and there but I didnt care as I finally felt better. then last Sunday I started to get the burning sensation in my chest again, almost exactly 5 weeks after my dosage was upped and 3 - 4 weeks after I had started to feel better, I didnt panic too much, as I thought that it may just be abit of a blip and tried my hardest to convince myself that this didnt mean I was going to become really unwell again. so i went back to work tuesday as planned despite me feeling and noticing I was spiralling again, and tried my hardest to just get on with it, this didnt work and now I have came massively crashing down again, I have called MH team and GP who both said take 1 extra propranalol and diazepam twice a day for couple of days, which I've done this week and I'm no better and back to square one of being suicidal and basically non functioning again and scared, lost and alone, fearing I'm going to have to quit my job, feeling disconnected from the world around me, not myself again, trapped in my own head and frustrated, extremley upset, feeling like I've let down my employer and my partner and little girl as although I cant help it and am trying my hardest, they simply do not deserve to have to deal with my mental health declining like this every 4 weeks, it's like I get a glimpse of my life back then snatched back away and to say I'm heartbroken is an understatement, I'm not eating, not sleeping and barley functioning again, and unable to concentrate which means I'll have to be signed off again and I'm actually contemplating having to quit my job that I loved so so much. I guess what I'm asking is what the hell do I do now? do I stay with citalopram 30mg, do I change completley to another medication? I'm so lost and alone and my partner is getting frustrated aswell I just dont know what to do as I cant go on much longer with this I feel so detached from everyone and everything am crying multiple times a day becuase I cant live like this it's like my personality is gone when am like this I'm like an empty shell, not taking care of myself properly, not eating, not sleeping, waking up feeling horrible and dreading another day, cant show love or affection to my partner or daughter, can hardly talk to them that much, all I want is my life back, as currently my life is disappearing before my eyes, I'll end up having to quit my job, I've even debated leaving my daughter and partner and moving out so they dont have to go through this with me, is there anyone out there who has had a similar reaction to sertraline who came out the other side?😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 0 likes, 9 replies "

I had a severe bad mental reaction to the above medication after just 3 days which resulted in me becoming suicidal and felt all of the below and still do most of it: Dissociation Loosing grip on reality Numb Like I am not even in my own body Like I cant function or move Like I'm not normal Feeling like I'm living a nightmare Trapped in my own head and trapped by what's happening Cant be around people but petrified to be alone No emotion except for being petrified that im going mentald Cant get out of my own head or thoughts Cant take my daughter out to nursery or go to work through fear of what's happening to me Not myself Like I look in the mirror and it's not me Like I'm just a body not a person Constant worry that I'm going mental Was fine before taking sertraline Extremely scared and upset becuase I just want to feel normal again Completley unable to concentrate on even moving or thinking or work Unable to concentrate on surroundings Complete loss of appetite very unlike me Cant ever relax without not being able to get out of my head I feel like I need help to snap out of this Like I'm in a blur Like I'm in a bubble of my own thoughts and head that I cant escape from Detached from life All this is making me want to end it all like my partner and daughter wont be able to cope with me Scared something bad will happen involving my mental health Feel like my life will never be the same and wont be like real life was before this happened to me Like my daughter and partner would be better off without me whilst this is happening to me Guilt feelings becuase my partner is having to everything becuase I cant do anything Scared I'm loosing myself to mental illness Like I cant live like this I just want to snap out of this state immediately and just have my life back to normal and I cant and its terrifying me Guilty becuase I feel my partner will be worried and distressed to see me so not normal Feel like I cant do anything for my partner / daughter who I love so much becuase of what sertraline has turned me into Worried I'll lose everything I love my family and my job Worried my partner and daughter will get fed up with me like this and wont be able to deal with it Constantly depressed and extremely upset becuase of what's happening to me Constantly exhausted and almost feel physically Ill Feeling like I cant cope becuase of what's happening to me Feeling like sleep is the only way I can escape and that I should just shut myself away from everybody until I'm better Crying my eyes out becuase I just want to feel normal again immediately and go back to being the great strong working happy mum I used to be before monday 11th November and before its too late. I was then put straight onto mirtazapine 15mg, along with diazepam as a GP had diagnosed me with anxiety and completley dismissed the sertraline as the cause of the symptoms I was having after taking it, I was fine for 4 weeks then when came off the diazepam and just on the mirtazepine I became extremley anxious and started to become suicidal and having really dark thoughts and was not myself and just felt like a stranger in my own life, felt like my brain was shutting down mental health wise and everything else. I was then immediately put onto citalopram 10mg, on 18th december 2019, along with quetiapine 25mg for ""anxiety"" and depression, I was doing well for a couple of weeks then went downhill again and became extremley depressed again, resulting in me being signed off work again. my dosage was upped to 20mg, and quetiapine 50mg at night to slow my anxious and suicidal thoughts which doesnt do anything at all. I was then after about a week, fine for almost 4 weeks, I became the best version of myself, calmer (I've always been quite snappy), i was genuinely happy and i found I got along with everyone better, it took alot to stress me out or worry me, this was the case for around 4 weeks, which is when I went EXTREMLEY downhill again, became extremley suicidal, contemplated taking all my pills whilst my daughter and partner wasnt here I was on my own, or moving out so my partner and 2 year old daughter dont have to deal with me anymore, as a constantly crying suicidal mess, not functioning, not sleeping, not washing, not talking, not eating etc. it got so bad that we ended up getting our local mental health team intensive service involved becuase I so badly wanted help to not feel that way anymore as it scares me so much, as I have everything in life and absolute no reason to have depression or anxiety, i was signed off from work for another month (2.5 months in total so far), and had mental health team visiting me daily. I saw a phsyciatrist and he upped my dosage of citalopram to 30mg, he said the reason I dipped straight back down was just down to my dosage not being high enough, I trusted this as seemed like a logical explanation and he has been a phsyciatrist for 37 years. I was then told to take diazepam to calm down my distress over the suicidal thoughts, and help me cope until the new dosage kicked in which the phsyciatrist said to expect small improvements after a week. I also started propranalol for the physical symptoms of anxiety, after starting the propranalol I was FINE, I was my complete normal self despite still having the mental anxiety, which I believed to be down to the dosage being upped and the propranalol, which I was taking 40mg 3x a day. I again had 4 very good weeks where I finally thought I was better, I was mega excited to go back to work, I was happy again, I finally truly believed that it was all behind me, I expected to have a bad day here and there but I didnt care as I finally felt better. then last Sunday I started to get the burning sensation in my chest again, almost exactly 5 weeks after my dosage was upped and 3 - 4 weeks after I had started to feel better, I didnt panic too much, as I thought that it may just be abit of a blip and tried my hardest to convince myself that this didnt mean I was going to become really unwell again. so i went back to work tuesday as planned despite me feeling and noticing I was spiralling again, and tried my hardest to just get on with it, this didnt work and now I have came massively crashing down again, I have called MH team and GP who both said take 1 extra propranalol and diazepam twice a day for couple of days, which I've done this week and I'm no better and back to square one of being suicidal and basically non functioning again and scared, lost and alone, fearing I'm going to have to quit my job, feeling disconnected from the world around me, not myself again, trapped in my own head and frustrated, extremley upset, feeling like I've let down my employer and my partner and little girl as although I cant help it and am trying my hardest, they simply do not deserve to have to deal with my mental health declining like this every 4 weeks, it's like I get a glimpse of my life back then snatched back away and to say I'm heartbroken is an understatement, I'm not eating, not sleeping and barley functioning again, and unable to concentrate which means I'll have to be signed off again and I'm actually contemplating having to quit my job that I loved so so much. I guess what I'm asking is what the hell do I do now? do I stay with citalopram 30mg, do I change completley to another medication? I'm so lost and alone and my partner is getting frustrated aswell I just dont know what to do as I cant go on much longer with this I feel so detached from everyone and everything am crying multiple times a day becuase I cant live like this it's like my personality is gone when am like this I'm like an empty shell, not taking care of myself properly, not eating, not sleeping, waking up feeling horrible and dreading another day, cant show love or affection to my partner or daughter, can hardly talk to them that much, all I want is my life back, as currently my life is disappearing before my eyes, I'll end up having to quit my job, I've even debated leaving my daughter and partner and moving out so they dont have to go through this with me, is there anyone out there who has had a similar reaction to sertraline who came out the other side?😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 0 likes, 9 replies "

The GP in question prescribed a dosage of 50 mg to be taken 1 x times per day. After taking this tablet I experienced a pretty bad reaction and ended up having what can be described as a mini seisure and encountered a popping sesnation within my head. Since taking this drug I initally developed a painful pressure and swelling feeling within my head and I have now gone onto develop constant migraines, confusion, intemidate weakeness in right arm, not being able to feel certain emotions and generally feeling spaced out most of the time. I have been to both my GP and Hospital in relation to these issues where various tests such as  , Blood work, ECG have been performed. I am starting to become concerned about these symtoms and I am kind of worried that the Sertraline triggered some event that has damaged parts of my brain. Has anyone experience these type of symptoms with this drug? I feel like I have no where elese to turn to get answers. 0 likes, 9 replies "

My name is Jay, and I'm 34 year old guy. I'm physically very active, I workout everyday, and I eat healthy overall. However just about my whole life I have had excessive fat on my buttocks, and thighs. My BMI is 26 and I'm just slightly overweight buy not obese : I am 5'6 and weigh 165lbs. **But my hips, thighs and buttocks are out of proportion with my body. ** I have tried dieting, and can't get a referral from my doctor to see a dietician because I am technically not overweight. This has been a lifelong challenge for me, but I am finally fully determined to address or at least understand. I know everyone has fat deposits in different parts of their body. I have been working out regularly for about three years. I have been eating healthy (mostly vegetables, occasional meat, not many sweets, occasional drinking) for the past one year and it has had virtually no effect on my body shape. I do cardio, weightlifting, running and sports multiple times a week. I know can do better at eating healthy, and workout more but at a certain point it becomes too much. I have not counted calories yet, but at least for the next two weeks I will do that, and see what I find out. Maybe I am eating more calories than I think I am and that's what's keeping the fat on, even though I workout regularly? Anyway, I'm at the point now where I'm considering liposuction, but I am also worried about the side-effects of that. I don't want anything to get in the way of my active lifestyle. But I do want to feel good about my body. My upper body is toned and fit. I have some fat on my stomach but I have cut that down dramatically over the past year. My main goal is to feel as confident as I can! And I am a confident person, but we only live one life and I want to just life to the fullest. Any advice, support, or any kind of recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! \ 0 likes, 0 replies "

Ideally I would love to sit down with someone and plan out a program or something but I don't even know where to look for that really.

I had been watching what I eat, exercising and drinking half my weight in water every single day and still not losing any weight. At the time, I weighed 237 lbs. I should have been losing weight with diet and exercise, so I figured maybe I should get some tests done to make sure my health was okay.  My   came back great! I'm in good health as far as my blood work shows, but I obviously need to lose weight. So, my Dr suggested a weightloss pill with the speed of lightning. I, being all about a helping hand, said ""OF COURSE!"" However, I did ask her these questions: ""Will it cause  ?""  I asked this, because I was put on Adderal as a young girl and it made me anxious to the point of attacks. It was awful. I always ask this of medication now because I don't ever want to go through that again. In response, she said ""Well, not Topamax. It's actually used as a mood stabilizer, so it'll be good for your anxiety.""  Amazing! Losing weight, helps with anxiety... What more could I ask for. Then I asked: ""What should I avoid? What should I expect? She said I didn't have to avoid anything. She said I didn't need to expect anything, just weightloss.  Well, great! SIGN ME UP SISTER!! God, I wish I had never, ever everrrr accepted this drug. The next few weeks weren't hell, but they were just confusing. I didn't have anxiety because I was cloaked with confusion. The brain fog was real, the tingling in my hands and feet was real, but that stuff didn't really bother me because I was slowly losing weight. Just slowly, though. Nothing drastic. I could handle those side effects. The pill actually helped me sleep. I didn't mind it, until... I started losing my hair. The one thing I loved about myself, the one thing that, vainly, kept me going, clearly started to thin drastically. It started with my eyebrows. Then I could see my scalp more and more. Now it's to the point where I don't want to brush it because it just falls out on its own, why brush it out even more? So, I'm stalled at 224 lbs, my once beautiful long hair looks like it is hanging on by a thread and I am self weaning myself off of this awful medicine.  The withdrawals have been intense. Anxiety,  , stomach aches, even more confussion... I only took this medicine for a month!!! Like, how!? I have weaned properly with the advice of my Dr. I have an appointment on Monday, but I want to tell her how angry I am. She laughed at me when I told her about the hair loss and basically made it seem like I wasn't giving the pill a chance. She also said hair loss isn't a side effect of Topamax, but I have read differently.  I want to trust MY DOCTOR, but she has been so rude (so has her staff) and I'm just lost at this point. Who do I go to? Another Dr? Do I go to a weightloss clinic? What about my hair? Will it grow back? Is it permanent? I honestly have never been more depressed in my entire life. 0 likes, 8 replies "

Feeling frustrated and quite frankly really p****d off I stopped going and pretty much gave up.  A year on I recently found out I had a duodenal stomach ulcer which also makes you gain weight ..... Huray! -_- .... I've just finished taken my tablets to clear it so should no longer be there. I've also stopped taking the pill as that also contributes to weight gain. I now want to try loose weight again and was wondering if anyone had any tips they could share in regards to beating this weight gain, or how to try rebalance hormones or speed up metabolism? I currently only drink water and herbal teas, mainly green tea, peppermint tea and some immune and energy boost ones (the fruity ones!) I eat a lot of chicken at home!

Recently I've begun to gag when I laugh which is really often, while I'm blowing out vape specifically, and even if I try to sing, I've gained about 20 pounds (I'm about 5 5 and 150 pounds) in the past 4 months and am trying to to lose that weight now through push ups, sit ups and planks but i continue to gag. Also just another lil side note I've woke up almost every day for the past 2 and a half years feeling like i cant eat all that much or I'll puke, like a small slice of cake and a glass of milk is all I can really handle, normally I can out eat people much bigger than me and I still somewhat can, but now I sometimes feel like I can't eat through the day. Should I be concerned or is this just a little phase my body is going through? Cheers guys, thanks in advance 0 likes, 0 replies "

Approximately 20lbs (or 17% body weight). I am 32yrs old, 5'2"" and have remained at a consistent weight of 115-120 my entire adult life. I now weight 97lbs. I have been tested for a myriad of things.. Mammogram, chest xray both came back clean. Blood work has ruled out thyroid issues. Cortisol levels are in normal range (ruling out Addison's disease) My doctor is not finding anything and  beginning to act as if this may just ""be normal"", but I am certain it is not. Although the weight loss has plateaued, I am unable to gain weight now. I upped calorie intake, fats, proteins; lift small weights for muscle growth, and nothing has worked. I reach days where I will cross the 100lb mark, but within a day or two, I am right back to 97-98lbs. The weight never stays on. I don't really have any overt symptoms. Fatigue and sweating (A LOT - but only sometimes/some days) is really it. I'm at a loss and feel there must be something underlying going on here. Any guidance would be appreciated greatly!

Weight gain even when exercising, heart racing and weak muscles","Hello, I have been gaining weight steadily for years. When I do sport I can easily gain 1kg per month and if I diet I can gain 1kg per week. My stomach swells up and my heart rate can race for a second or skip a beat (even later in the day when not working out). My musculature does not improve even when working out. When I stop working out and dieting most of these symptoms improve. For example, I had a baby 4 years ago. Before pregnancy I was 78kg. I lost a little weight in the first trimester and generally felt better than normal. After giving birth I went from 94kg to 65kg without dieting in about 6 months. The second i joined the gym i put on weight and this pattern continues. It was the same for my first child. I feel like this is something related to an accident I had about 13 years ago. Before it, I was very sporty and felt great. In the accident i hit my right side with force and was fine, then fainted half an hour later. After that dizzy spells started, weakness began. I could barely walk upstairs. I would have almost seizure-like attacks. These were not panic attacks,they could happen even when sleeping and I wasn't stressed or depressed. I am better now but it still happens when my body is stressed in any way, like doing sport or after a miscarriage. I had a brain mri 3 years ago and last wrek had  CT scan for my torso. I have had full stomach ultrasounds and an Hysterosalpinography test for my womb as I have also had 4 early miscarriages. All my basic blood work has come back clean. I have also had cortisol, PTh, glucose, insulin, tsh, calcium, magnesium, creatinine and ALT tests done. I also had estrogen and progesterone checked. Everything has come back fine. The only problem found is a genetic blood clotting one - factor v leiden  which might explain the miscarriages  but the doctors aren't sure. I fall asleep easily but i dont get deep sleep and wake up a lot - again, not stressed. I also have a small hump of fat on my neck and a lot of stretch marks on my stomach and legs (not relating to weight). But obviously my tests were negative for Cushings. Is there anything that I am missing or any other ideas you might have? My whole life is being affected by this. Any helpful ideas would be so welcomed. 0 likes, 0 replies "

No appetite, lack of smell, breathing issues","I've been ill since September when I had a horrible virus on holiday and couldn't swallow. On return to UK was put on omeprozole, and treated for oral thrush. As still not better 2 weeks later was sent for upper gi endoscopy, all clear. Started to be able to swallow again, but very low appetite. Continued to lose weight and raised liver enzymes in my bloods so was referred to gastro team at hospital in November. Ultrasound clear, chest xray clear, bloods much improved,also clear for hepatitis and hiv, but referred for CT scan chest/abdo/pelvis or belts and braces, scary wait but all clear. Throughout this time appetite has declined further,  but I am forcing food down every day to prevent further weight loss. At night struggling to sleep, and regularly coughing/feeling like I cant breathe, even called an ambulance out when it got really bad one night, they  said my oxygen level was fine and it was a panic attack,but that doesnt explain why I keep snorting through my nose/struggling in the night when relaxed.  Have been prescribed citalapram for anxiety, and back on omeprozole as GP thinks coughing may be acid reflux. Due to constantly ringing ears/popping ears, and a reduced sense of smell have also had ent nasal endoscopy and head/iam mri privatley, again all clear. So why do I still feel terrible 2 months on? Main issues are: still no appetite, reduced smell, burning sensation across upper back sometimes, feeling  a non existat lump in my throat, and heaving most mornings. Doctor thinks my extreme anxiety through all of this is manifesting itself physically, but im far less anxious now and it is very physical what im going through, so it cant just be that? I dont know what else I can do, it is thoroughly miserable and I cant see similar examples of people going through this. Just want to be able to crave food, rather than force it down  and live my life again.  Any thought welcome, im fighting so hard but scared as I am not feeling better. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I am going to try and describe as best I can as to whats been happening to me recently and what I have currently done to try and sort my issues.

Then as the weeks went on my body got small and smaller to the point my wrists are tiny and my bones are way more visible on the arms and legs. I then started to get muscle twitching and spasms which freaked me out a bit so I went to the docs. At the doctors they did some standard tests like hitting my knees and elbows to check reaction, a coordination test, blood pressure and a few   to check levels. That was all 100% so because my GP took a look at my records and saw i used to be a bit anxious and I used to take medication so they wanted to see if it was my   causing the issues. this is where things went real down hill. they put me on sertaline which is meant to be a ""standard"" med for ""depression?"". I took it for a month and noticed I couldn't actually feel my arms or legs because of numbness and I was incredibly weak. Had a look online and apparently sertaline is used to relax muscles in some cases. this is the opposite of what i wanted as i worked in a fast past dangerous environment. so I came off it. I went back to the doctors and said I need more specific tests and they didn't know what to recommend ?! so I had to go home and research what kind of tests I might need. The best I could come up with was to see someone in neurology as my legs and hands were going haywire with cramps, twitching and because my arms and legs were getting smaller ect. I went back and said I wanted to see one, they referred me and I have had a series of other tests, nerve conduction's , mri and ct scan of brain and spine. all have came back fine, the guy that checked my nerves said that they are Benign twitches and that alot of people get them.  But I still have the problem of what the hell is going on with my body, why do i feel sick all the time and dizzy. They doctors said I need to look down less serious paths as they have ruled out tumours in the brain ,bleeding, any serious nerve disorders and imbalances. I have also checked for STI's because of the amount of partners I had in a sort period of time and that was good. So my question is whats next? I am not well at all and am losing the will at bit being told to pretty much sort myself out. I have had to leave work for a while. I don't know the specific blood tests they did but the one i had last night was around 5 tubes. that i think checked for more serious problems. Just to add that my stomach is always upset. I pretty much can't go no where without not eating for at least 3 hours prior otherwise your looking at a spout of stomach pains. though i have had that for years but it wasn't as bad as it is now. 0 likes, 9 replies "

Suggestions?","Hello! Here are my symptoms and about how long I have had them.  They all popped up around the same time which is why I have become concerned, but I also don't want to freak out for nothing! They are all likely not related, but I just need some type of reassurance that I don't need to be pushing for tests or something. Cold/Flu- I have had a cold for about 2 1/2 months, with having the flu (puking, fever, shake, diarrhea) twice in that time. The cold has varied from severe to totally manageable. I was prescribed antibiotics on the 29th of December and finished the 1 week dosage. That made my symptoms less severe so I went back to taking over the counter. Note, they only did a visual exam. No blood work or anything like that. Night Sweats- 2 months. I have never had an issue with excessive sweating. I have noticed I am sweating more in general, but at night is where it is excessive. I will wake up a few times a week drenched and the other days not drenched but definitely can tell I was sweating at one point (I have curly hair so the base gets extra curly when I sweat). High Anxiety- 2ish months. I have never been diagnosed or gone to a doctor for this because it has never been severe. It has become very hard to avoid right now, which is abnormal for me. I had never suffered a panic attack in my life and only know what they are because my friend gets them, and I believe I have had two in the past two months. Again, I haven't been ""diagnosed"" as having them, but I am not sure what else I could describe what happened except that they were panic attacks. Random joint/muscle pain- 1 month. I have had random shots of pain in various parts of my body, but mainly in my hips, lower back, and shoulders. I have not done anything different when it comes to physical activity, so I am not sure what could be causing it. It is primarily in my joints, but sometimes it feels like its deep  in my muscle (this is manly in my forearms). Tired/Unmotivated/No myself- 2+ months. In general for the past few months, I have felt exhausted and not motivated at all. This is NOT normal for me what so ever. At first I attributed to my ""winter blues"", which is normal for me. But I usually snap out of that by Christmas. Ankle Bump- 1ish month ago. I discovered a bump on my ankle when I had my feet out lounging on our couch. It was about the size of a small marble at the time. It grew to the size of a large marble in about a 2 weeks time, but has now shrunk back down to it's original size. It does not hurt. No discoloration. It is much softer than a marble, but harder then say a grape. It isn't ""movable"". If I were to draw a line down the center of my foot, it is about an a 1/2 inch the right right (on my right foot-looking down at it) and down a little lower than where the ankle bone sticks out on the right side (if that makes sense). Weight Loss- 1 1/2 months. I have lost about 10 pounds in the past 1 1/2 months, and it is not intentional by any means. I am normally 110-115 pounds, and I have dropped to 100. I have even teetered into the 97 range, which is abnormal. I don't feel like I am eating any more or less than usual. I do feel like I am getting full faster than normal, but I chocked that up to when I was sick with flu both times I didn't eat as much so maybe my stomach shrank a bit. But I feel like by now my weight should have gone back up and it hasn't . I called Aetna's Teladoc today and described everything above. He basically said that he can prescribe me stronger cold medicine, if the bump changes to go in and check it out, and that if the anxiety issue persists to call their other behavioral Teledoc line. He didn't address anything else and said none of it is related. The call literally lasted 6 minutes and I didn't leave feeling like he took anytime to think before giving me an answer. The follow-up message says my diagnosis is ""common cold"". He could be totally right and most likely he is, but I just want second opinions before chalking this all up to ""I am being crazy, calm down!"". Again, I am sure I am freaking myself out for nothing. But if anyone has any suggestions of where I should go or what I should do, let me know! 0 likes, 4 replies "

Suggestions?","Hello! Here are my symptoms and about how long I have had them.  They all popped up around the same time which is why I have become concerned, but I also don't want to freak out for nothing! They are all likely not related, but I just need some type of reassurance that I don't need to be pushing for tests or something. Cold/Flu- I have had a cold for about 2 1/2 months, with having the flu (puking, fever, shake, diarrhea) twice in that time. The cold has varied from severe to totally manageable. I was prescribed antibiotics on the 29th of December and finished the 1 week dosage. That made my symptoms less severe so I went back to taking over the counter. Note, they only did a visual exam. No blood work or anything like that. Night Sweats- 2 months. I have never had an issue with excessive sweating. I have noticed I am sweating more in general, but at night is where it is excessive. I will wake up a few times a week drenched and the other days not drenched but definitely can tell I was sweating at one point (I have curly hair so the base gets extra curly when I sweat). High Anxiety- 2ish months. I have never been diagnosed or gone to a doctor for this because it has never been severe. It has become very hard to avoid right now, which is abnormal for me. I had never suffered a panic attack in my life and only know what they are because my friend gets them, and I believe I have had two in the past two months. Again, I haven't been ""diagnosed"" as having them, but I am not sure what else I could describe what happened except that they were panic attacks. Random joint/muscle pain- 1 month. I have had random shots of pain in various parts of my body, but mainly in my hips, lower back, and shoulders. I have not done anything different when it comes to physical activity, so I am not sure what could be causing it. It is primarily in my joints, but sometimes it feels like its deep  in my muscle (this is manly in my forearms). Tired/Unmotivated/No myself- 2+ months. In general for the past few months, I have felt exhausted and not motivated at all. This is NOT normal for me what so ever. At first I attributed to my ""winter blues"", which is normal for me. But I usually snap out of that by Christmas. Ankle Bump- 1ish month ago. I discovered a bump on my ankle when I had my feet out lounging on our couch. It was about the size of a small marble at the time. It grew to the size of a large marble in about a 2 weeks time, but has now shrunk back down to it's original size. It does not hurt. No discoloration. It is much softer than a marble, but harder then say a grape. It isn't ""movable"". If I were to draw a line down the center of my foot, it is about an a 1/2 inch the right right (on my right foot-looking down at it) and down a little lower than where the ankle bone sticks out on the right side (if that makes sense). Weight Loss- 1 1/2 months. I have lost about 10 pounds in the past 1 1/2 months, and it is not intentional by any means. I am normally 110-115 pounds, and I have dropped to 100. I have even teetered into the 97 range, which is abnormal. I don't feel like I am eating any more or less than usual. I do feel like I am getting full faster than normal, but I chocked that up to when I was sick with flu both times I didn't eat as much so maybe my stomach shrank a bit. But I feel like by now my weight should have gone back up and it hasn't . I called Aetna's Teladoc today and described everything above. He basically said that he can prescribe me stronger cold medicine, if the bump changes to go in and check it out, and that if the anxiety issue persists to call their other behavioral Teledoc line. He didn't address anything else and said none of it is related. The call literally lasted 6 minutes and I didn't leave feeling like he took anytime to think before giving me an answer.

I'm especially interested in hearing from those who have had a vocal cord granuloma surgically removed, as that is an option I'm facing. I'm a 39yo male. About 1.5 years ago I started having discomfort in my throat.  It was vague and didn't exactly feel like a lump or injury but it was unusual, so I saw a primary care doctor.  I explained my symptoms and she felt my neck, looked at my throat and didn't see anything strange.  She suspected acid reflux and gave me Prilosec which I took for a few weeks.  The discomfort pretty much went away.  But next summer, the discomfort came back and was more prominent.  I was having strange throat spasms, kind of like a hiccup but more forceful.  They didn't happen very often, maybe one spasm every few weeks. But when they did, I could distinctly feel a   in my throat that I had never felt before. That obviously freaked me out. I'm an ex-smoker, who smoked for most of my 20s but stopped at age 29, so the potential for throat cancer was very worrying. I saw the doctor again, who referred to an ENT. The ENT did an endoscopy and showed me on the monitor: ""You see that? That shouldn't be there."" He pointed to a round 1 cm white thing on my throat, and my heart sunk. The good news, he said, is this is a granuloma which is non-cancerous. (Whew!) I asked him how sure he was about that, to which he responded emphatically, ""100%, I see these all the time. I've seen thousands of them."" To be safe they did a CT scan of the neck and didn't find anything other than the granuloma. The ENT recommended an acid reflux study, which involved wearing a probe through the nose into my throat overnight. Along with this they first did another endoscopy all the way down to my stomach which showed no other lesions. The ENT commented at that point that the granuloma looked ""a little better"". It had been a few weeks since the initial diagnosis and I had cut down on acidic food. Anyway, I did the acid reflux study which came up negative. (Which seemed fairly meaningless to me; it only indicated I didn't have reflux that particular night) The ENT said the options were to just keep an eye on it, or to have it removed since it sometimes bothered me. He warned that they tend to come back. He said that although he was certain it was nothing serious, they also would do a biopsy if it was removed just to be safe. He said nothing about this was urgent and if I wanted to have it removed, to schedule that whenever worked best. At that point I opted not to have it removed. Even with ""good"" insurance it had already cost me over $1000 up to this point, and I figured the surgery would be another big chunk of cash. Now that I knew what it was and had adjusted eating habits, I wasn't worried and I basically didn't feel it anymore, and if it was optional why go through with it? Fast forward another 6 months or so. I mostly have not noticed the granuloma, no throat spasms or feelings of an object in the throat.  Sometimes I'm vaguely aware that it's there -- the wintertime seems to aggravate it, with the dry air and nasal drainage -- but certainly not to the extent it bothered me before. I have occasionally noticed what seem like GERD symptoms though; sometimes my throat is generally sore, occasionally my left tonsil (same side as the granuloma) will be slightly enlarged. I've even noticed what seems like a mild acid burn on the back left side of my tongue. These things have only happened a few times and go away on their own, which is why I haven't sought treatment, although maybe I should have. Anyway, due to a temporary situation I'm in -- helping a relative recover from medical issues, so my income is reduced -- I am now on state Medicaid insurance, which is amazing. It covers almost anything and treatments range from very affordable to almost zero cost. But this is temporary, I suspect I'll be off this insurance within the next 6 months. So I'm going to see an ENT to check out the granuloma, and tell them about the occasional GERD symptoms.  And if they present the option again, I figure I might as well have the granuloma removed. It will be affordable and I'll have the ultimate peace of mind of the biopsy, although I'm not too worried about it -- and while I tolerate it alright, I certainly would enjoy having this thing out of my throat. Has anyone had a vocal cord granuloma? similar symptoms? Anyone have it removed? The first ENT told me it wasn't too bad, that people have a sore throat for a few days and that's about it. 0 likes, 1 reply "

As y'all probably have already read, I've been struggling with a sore and super dry throat for the last 3 months. Especially when I breathe through my nose I can feel the dryness and soreness. 4 months ago I also discovered a deep lump under my jaw, it's not visible though since it's rather deep into my jaw. It hasn't grown in size ever since I discovered it, but I sometimes feel pressure on my jaw and neck from it. I think that it's also important to mention, that I've been struggling with dry eyes for 3 years now and that it's gotten worse this year. Especially in the morning I wake up with extremely dry eyes, dry mouth and a dry throat. I went to the ENT doctor a couple weeks ago, who looked inside my throat and did an ultrasound on the spot where the lump is. She couldn't find anything and prescribed me organic pineapple pills, which didn't help me at all.

As y'all probably have already read, I've been struggling with a sore and super dry throat for the last 3 months. Especially when I breathe through my nose I can feel the dryness and soreness. 4 months ago I also discovered a deep lump under my jaw, it's not visible though since it's rather deep into my jaw. It hasn't grown in size ever since I discovered it, but I sometimes feel pressure on my jaw and neck from it. I think that it's also important to mention, that I've been struggling with dry eyes for 3 years now and that it's gotten worse this year. Especially in the morning I wake up with extremely dry eyes, dry mouth and a dry throat. I went to the ENT doctor a couple weeks ago, who looked inside my throat and did an ultrasound on the spot where the lump is. She couldn't find anything and prescribed me organic pineapple pills, which didn't help me at all. During my 2nd visit she told me that it could maybe be from my wisdom teeth which are coming out or a fungus, so she did a swab sample and sent it in, I'm still waiting for the results.

It happened that we stood outside and talked for few hours while weather got windy and I was wearing thin cloth, I smoked couple of cigarettes and started to notice feeling of getting sick that evening, over next few days I felt scratching in my throat and little bit of weakness. 2 days ago I started to treat my sore throat with Dorithricin, Tetesept and drinking teas with honey. I locked myself inside my house and distanced myself from everyone regarding COVID-19 outbreak, even thought I live in a country (Georgia) where less that 35 confirmed cases are known and I have not had any contact with anyone who traveled recently abroad. Basically I am pretty sure this is sore throat and nothing more. My symptoms are scratchy sore throat, 4/10 pain and soreness level, weakness and feeling sick 3/10 , slight headache 3/10 (probably cause I am watching laptop screen whole day), sometimes neck sweats when I try to sleep,  no fever (max I had during this 5 days was 37.1 rest is less that 36.9), no cough( 4-5 times a day), no sneezing (3-4 times a day), not feeling shortness of breath.

They didn’t give him anything but lidocane. I’m guessing he had close to 15 pokes. Has anyone else experienced their child go through this?  I’m loosing my mind  0 likes, 1 reply "

So I received a lumbar puncture almost 2 years ago and I still have pain around my spine in the precise area where the needle pierced me. The pain has been there continuously ever since the procedure. It feels like a dull tinge right on my spine, always limiting my movement and flexibility. Depending on my movement it can become a sharper tinge and pain. It feels like there is a little cyst that can hardly be felt but I'm pretty sure its there.  Admittedly, I have done little yet to try and solve this issue. I spoke to a couple doctors from the  same medical establishment, but they just shrugged their shoulders. The pain is less if I am warmed up, loose and in warm temperatures. Also I did have a blood patch 3 days after the puncture. I had severe headaches for a week after but they went away for good after that. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. 0 likes, 2 replies "

So I agreed to do spinal tap (guess what they call blind spinal tap, no xray used). I didn't have a headache at first from the procedure, but about two days later they came on the back of my head. It lasted about a week or less, I was able to function with Tylenol. Then the headaches went away. I thought a post spinal tap headache were completely normal? Especially since it stopped. That's why I didn't run back to the hospital. But now I'm learning I should have went back for a blood at first sign of headaches? Now a month later I'm left with no headache, but debilitating vertigo and motion sickness And nausea I didn't have before spinal tap. My gp thinks there's no correlation, and that if I was having a csf leak I would have an excruciating headache which I don't. From what I researched it's very rare but one can have a leak without headache. And I also read low csf pressure can cause vertigo and nausea. Am I overreacting, that I want to look into to spinal tap as cause of vertigo? My worries are CSF leak or aquired chiari. I got some blood work done Friday and saw my primary and told then about this. I got standard blood work done, results were fine, so i guess isnt something that will kill me anytime soon. Its really debillitating, I can barly stand without cane and when I move my head to fast while standing. I can fall. Can you have csf leak without headache? 0 likes, 4 replies "

I had bad bites 9 years ago in May 2010. They came up a week after returning from holiday in Thailand, but I'm also very outdoorsy so could have been from home in UK. They went bad and after a week of oral antibiotics from GP (who said they were boils!), they got a lot worse and I got even more poorly, raging fever, throwing up. I went to hospital and they said I had developed sepsis. I had a week of IV antibiotics in hospital followed by another 2 weeks oral antibiotics at home. So in total 4 weeks of antibiotics. There were 5 bites in total, all on one leg, the biggest one that took over the whole side of my thigh looks like it could of had the bullseye rash, hard to tell as I was very tanned. Hospital doctor could not diagnose but said likely they were some sort of tick bites as they had a black dot in the middle. A few months after treatment, the bites had all healed but the infection came back in my leg again with fever etc and I had another course of antibiotics. My health hasn't been right since. A few years ago i requested a test for Lyme but was refused, GP said if i had contracted Lyme, the month of antibiotics would have killed it. He also said the Lyme test wasn't accurate so there wasn't much point. Symptoms since bites: Spells of nausea, not being able to eat, no appetite, diarrea, IBS, along with weight loss Spells of chronic fatigue (sometime debilitating) Low blood pressure episodes Low blood sugar issues Temperature regulation issues (sometimes go hyperthermic, sometimes mild fever) Awful hormonal issues, severe PMT, bleeding 20 days a month Frequent injuries, sprains etc Very frequent infections. Colds & sick bugs every few months and also had Pneumonia and been hospitalized for a Quinzy needing IV antibiotics Developed skeeter syndrome (mosquito bite allergy) where whenever I get a bite my whole limb swells up and often needs antibiotics Heart palpitations & confirmed arythmia (of unknown cause) Post nasal drip / GERD / sticky thick lump in throat Insomnia Breathlessness Mild swelling of airways no known cause Recurrent fungal infections Melasma Ringing ears Various tests over the years have shown I'm in perfect health, except for one showing calcium deficiency which was resolved with treatment, and another showing high liver enzymes, which there was no cause for, but resolved itself. Basically I'm just told I'm fit, well and healthy and I must just be under too much stress. Anyhow, playing with my sons new TV microscope today that he got for Xmas, and I've accidently found that I am covered in what looks like Morgellons? All over my body but mostly face, neck, chest, back, upper arms, feet & hands. They cant be seen at all with the naked eye, these pics are at something like x200 magnification I think. Some are very close to the surface and some further under. And looking into this, Morgellons is apparently closely linked to chronic Lyme. Apparently the CDC said 60% of people with Morgellons tested positive for tick-bourne illness. Worryingly, my 7 year old son is also covered in these Morgellons things. He gets sick a lot and random fevers and always complaining of sore legs, or sore tummy, or headache. But I always assumed it was just nursery or school germs going about. Now I'm concerned if I did contract Lyme and it wasn't treated properly, I may have passed it to him during pregnancy. He was conceived less than a year after I was hospitalized for the bites. I'd really like to know if I have Lyme or not and therefore if my son may have, I guess I'm just looking for some input really, what to do. My GP has finally agreed over the phone to test us both for Lyme, so that's good, but my understanding is it might show as negative even if we have it? I will try to get a GP appointment for the suspected Morgellons next week. I have attached photos of the bites from 9 years ago and a few pics of the Morgellons in our skin.

I'd really like to know if I have Lyme or not and therefore if my son may have, I guess I'm just looking for some input really, what to do. My GP has finally agreed over the phone to test us both for Lyme, so that's good, but my understanding is it might show as negative even if we have it? I will try to get a GP appointment for the suspected Morgellons next week. I have attached photos of the bites from 9 years ago and a few pics of the Morgellons in our skin.

I had bad bites 9 years ago in May 2010. They came up a week after returning from holiday in Thailand, but I'm also very outdoorsy so could have been from home in UK. They went bad and after a week of oral antibiotics from GP (who said they were boils!), they got a lot worse and I got even more poorly, raging fever, throwing up. I went to hospital and they said I had developed sepsis. I had a week of IV antibiotics in hospital followed by another 2 weeks oral antibiotics at home. So in total 4 weeks of antibiotics. There were 5 bites in total, all on one leg, the biggest one that took over the whole side of my thigh looks like it could of had the bullseye rash, hard to tell as I was very tanned. Hospital doctor could not diagnose but said likely they were some sort of tick bites as they had a black dot in the middle. A few months after treatment, the bites had all healed but the infection came back in my leg again with fever etc and I had another course of antibiotics. My health hasn't been right since. A few years ago i requested a test for Lyme but was refused, GP said if i had contracted Lyme, the month of antibiotics would have killed it. He also said the Lyme test wasn't accurate so there wasn't much point. Symptoms since bites: Spells of nausea, not being able to eat, no appetite, diarrea, IBS, along with weight loss Spells of chronic fatigue (sometime debilitating) Low blood pressure episodes Low blood sugar issues Temperature regulation issues (sometimes go hyperthermic, sometimes mild fever) Awful hormonal issues, severe PMT, bleeding 20 days a month Frequent injuries, sprains etc Very frequent infections. Colds & sick bugs every few months and also had Pneumonia and been hospitalized for a Quinzy needing IV antibiotics Developed skeeter syndrome (mosquito bite allergy) where whenever I get a bite my whole limb swells up and often needs antibiotics Heart palpitations & confirmed arythmia (of unknown cause) Post nasal drip / GERD / sticky thick lump in throat Insomnia Breathlessness Mild swelling of airways no known cause Recurrent fungal infections Melasma Ringing ears Various tests over the years have shown I'm in perfect health, except for one showing calcium deficiency which was resolved with treatment, and another showing high liver enzymes, which there was no cause for, but resolved itself. Basically I'm just told I'm fit, well and healthy and I must just be under too much stress. Anyhow, playing with my sons new TV microscope today that he got for Xmas, and I've accidently found that I am covered in what looks like Morgellons? All over my body but mostly face, neck, chest, back, upper arms, feet & hands. They cant be seen at all with the naked eye, these pics are at something like x200 magnification I think. Some are very close to the surface and some further under. And looking into this, Morgellons is apparently closely linked to chronic Lyme. Apparently the CDC said 60% of people with Morgellons tested positive for tick-bourne illness. Worryingly, my 7 year old son is also covered in these Morgellons things. He gets sick a lot and random fevers and always complaining of sore legs, or sore tummy, or headache. But I always assumed it was just nursery or school germs going about.

All over my body but mostly face, neck, chest, back, upper arms, feet & hands. They cant be seen at all with the naked eye, these pics are at something like x200 magnification I think. Some are very close to the surface and some further under. And looking into this, Morgellons is apparently closely linked to chronic Lyme. Apparently the CDC said 60% of people with Morgellons tested positive for tick-bourne illness. Worryingly, my 7 year old son is also covered in these Morgellons things. He gets sick a lot and random fevers and always complaining of sore legs, or sore tummy, or headache. But I always assumed it was just nursery or school germs going about. Now I'm concerned if I did contract Lyme and it wasn't treated properly, I may have passed it to him during pregnancy. He was conceived less than a year after I was hospitalized for the bites. I'd really like to know if I have Lyme or not and therefore if my son may have, I guess I'm just looking for some input really, what to do. My GP has finally agreed over the phone to test us both for Lyme, so that's good, but my understanding is it might show as negative even if we have it? I will try to get a GP appointment for the suspected Morgellons next week. I have attached photos of the bites from 9 years ago and a few pics of the Morgellons in our skin.

I had bad bites 9 years ago in May 2010. They came up a week after returning from holiday in Thailand, but I'm also very outdoorsy so could have been from home in UK. They went bad and after a week of oral antibiotics from GP (who said they were boils!), they got a lot worse and I got even more poorly, raging fever, throwing up. I went to hospital and they said I had developed sepsis. I had a week of IV antibiotics in hospital followed by another 2 weeks oral antibiotics at home. So in total 4 weeks of antibiotics. There were 5 bites in total, all on one leg, the biggest one that took over the whole side of my thigh looks like it could of had the bullseye rash, hard to tell as I was very tanned. Hospital doctor could not diagnose but said likely they were some sort of tick bites as they had a black dot in the middle. A few months after treatment, the bites had all healed but the infection came back in my leg again with fever etc and I had another course of antibiotics. My health hasn't been right since. A few years ago i requested a test for Lyme but was refused, GP said if i had contracted Lyme, the month of antibiotics would have killed it. He also said the Lyme test wasn't accurate so there wasn't much point. Symptoms since bites: Spells of nausea, not being able to eat, no appetite, diarrea, IBS, along with weight loss Spells of chronic fatigue (sometime debilitating) Low blood pressure episodes Low blood sugar issues Temperature regulation issues (sometimes go hyperthermic, sometimes mild fever) Awful hormonal issues, severe PMT, bleeding 20 days a month Frequent injuries, sprains etc Very frequent infections. Colds & sick bugs every few months and also had Pneumonia and been hospitalized for a Quinzy needing IV antibiotics Developed skeeter syndrome (mosquito bite allergy) where whenever I get a bite my whole limb swells up and often needs antibiotics Heart palpitations & confirmed arythmia (of unknown cause) Post nasal drip / GERD / sticky thick lump in throat Insomnia Breathlessness Mild swelling of airways no known cause Recurrent fungal infections Melasma Ringing ears Various tests over the years have shown I'm in perfect health, except for one showing calcium deficiency which was resolved with treatment, and another showing high liver enzymes, which there was no cause for, but resolved itself.

Colds & sick bugs every few months and also had Pneumonia and been hospitalized for a Quinzy needing IV antibiotics Developed skeeter syndrome (mosquito bite allergy) where whenever I get a bite my whole limb swells up and often needs antibiotics Heart palpitations & confirmed arythmia (of unknown cause) Post nasal drip / GERD / sticky thick lump in throat Insomnia Breathlessness Mild swelling of airways no known cause Recurrent fungal infections Melasma Ringing ears Various tests over the years have shown I'm in perfect health, except for one showing calcium deficiency which was resolved with treatment, and another showing high liver enzymes, which there was no cause for, but resolved itself. Basically I'm just told I'm fit, well and healthy and I must just be under too much stress. Anyhow, playing with my sons new TV microscope today that he got for Xmas, and I've accidently found that I am covered in what looks like Morgellons? All over my body but mostly face, neck, chest, back, upper arms, feet & hands. They cant be seen at all with the naked eye, these pics are at something like x200 magnification I think. Some are very close to the surface and some further under. And looking into this, Morgellons is apparently closely linked to chronic Lyme. Apparently the CDC said 60% of people with Morgellons tested positive for tick-bourne illness. Worryingly, my 7 year old son is also covered in these Morgellons things. He gets sick a lot and random fevers and always complaining of sore legs, or sore tummy, or headache. But I always assumed it was just nursery or school germs going about. Now I'm concerned if I did contract Lyme and it wasn't treated properly, I may have passed it to him during pregnancy. He was conceived less than a year after I was hospitalized for the bites. I'd really like to know if I have Lyme or not and therefore if my son may have, I guess I'm just looking for some input really, what to do. My GP has finally agreed over the phone to test us both for Lyme, so that's good, but my understanding is it might show as negative even if we have it? I will try to get a GP appointment for the suspected Morgellons next week. I have attached photos of the bites from 9 years ago and a few pics of the Morgellons in our skin. Thank you in advance The bites 9 years ago: A few examples of what looks like Morgellons in my skin: A few examples of what looks like Morgellons in my Sons skin: 0 likes, 1 reply "

It cleared the headache and I don't really have any issues with headaches anymore. However, since the blood patch I feel this pressure in my lower back and I feel this   when I bend backwards, the farther I bend the more it hurts. Does anybody else experience this?

A month ago I woke up with two bites (one on my hand and one on my wrist). They were skin-colored at first and itchy and then turned into what you see in the pictures and stopped itching. The rash/reaction went away that night and only the bite marks remained. Since it was the first time I got a reaction that bad I googled it and all I could see was Lyme. I tried to ignore it and also had no symptoms but now a week ago I started having joint and muscle pain, which is either from anxiety or it means that this was in fact a lyme tick. Can you please give me your opinion before I go to an LLMD? Thank you. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Plz help,"i have recently been diagnosed with fibromyalgia after years of chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain. i first noticed this pain when I was 12, it started like a stabbing pain in my shoulder and then progressed to crippling radiating pain to my neck and spine. I had many xrays and mri's and finally just resorted to physiotherapy and dry needling as there was nothing showing in scans.  At the moment I have pain in more than 15 points on my body but my hip and shoulder are the worst. While this pain started I also began noticing food intolerances after a  bacterial stomach infection called helicobacter pylori. I was even hospitalized on one occasion due to the pain of digestion after eating. The food intolerances remain and I deal with IBS everyday. I was diagnosed with clinical depression and Gad when i turned 18. I tried 8 different medications over 2 yrs but nothing helped. i am currently seeing a counselor and attending support groups. I am struggling with my depression atm. My sleep has been getting worse over the past 5 years. I currently take sleeping tablets to help me get to sleep but sometimes I stay awake all night after taking them. even if i do sleep 8/9 hours i wake as tired as i went to bed. i suffer from short term memory loss and concentration difficulties. I had never connected all of my symptoms together until my pain management specialist diagnosed fibro. Now my symptoms are increasing and include nighttime tinnitus, headaches, mouth ulcers,  pins and needles/ dead legs, twitching muscles, burning legs at night, shooting pains in heels, cold intolerance and random flushing,  and irregular period even while on the pill. my mom was diagnosed with Lymes a few yrs ago after noticing a bulls eye rash and was treated. we live next to a forest and our dog regularly has ticks on him. i remember pulling ticks from my skin over my childhood years on many occasions but never remember seeing a rash.

My symptoms are crazy, constant headaches, struggle with screen time from phone, computers etc. Constant visual difference (had to explain, like an altered perception). Also a strong bounding pulse where I can actually see many of my arteries moving up and down, especially in the neck and abdomen, as well as seeing my chest move with every beat. All this has been checked out with echo's, ultrasounds etc. I’ve had 4 weeks of taking 200mg Doxycycline which I finished yesterday. I’ve had no improvement from the Doxy as of today. I am being retested in about 16 days, then a consultation with the infectious disease specialist around 3 weeks after that to discuss the next steps. Do you have any advice as I am still a bit in the dark about a lot of this. There seems to be a lot of literature about lyme available but not much at all about Anaplasmosis.

The cold feeling in the hands and legs. It started off in the feet only but has gotten more and more up my legs as time has passed. Nothing helps it feel better. I also have numbness in my feet and hands. About six months after having my son last year I started getting lower back and sciatic pain. My knee would give out as well. There are times where i get out of bed and i feel so weak like my body weighs an extra 50lbs. I have delt with canker sores for years but it would only be one or 2. Now i get alot more and alot worse ones that take 3 weeks to heal. I have no facial rash. Seem to be thirsty alot lately too. And sometimes heavy chest as if it were anxiety (very well could be).

Since the birth of my son about 3 month ago, I've developed some very strange symptoms. It started as a headache about 2 months ago, that spread into my neck. I knew it was different from the usual headache here and there, because the pain traveled. It lasted about a week and then tapered off. A few weeks ago it came back, along with severe joint pain in my neck, shoulders, back, arms, even wrists. Along with this came pins and needles, hot and cold sensations, and a bug crawling under my skin sensation. With this all of my stomach issues have flared up. I feel like i have a continuous flu. My hair is falling out, but I cant tell if that's just postpartum hair loss. My mom has Hashimotos diseases, and I'm prone to autoimmune issues because of my family history. I went to the docs last week and she ordered blood tests and a urinalysis. Still waiting for results. She did mention lupus though, and because of my inflamed flank pain I'm beginning to worry about lupus nephritis. Doesn't help that I can't stop googling every symptom I have. Just curious if this could be lupus, or possibly hashimotos based on my mom's history too. It may sound dumb, but I absolutely do not want to be put on steroids of any kind. I know some people don't have a choice, but I wonder if there's anyway to avoid steriods for the treatment of lupus or lupus nephritis. Thank you for reading this.

I'm trying to be as accurate as i can despite pain I'm in I've had symptoms for a long time, i was referred to a neurologist about 2 years ago, they did a physical check & mri was clear, gave me pregabalin and told me i might suffer with a continual migraine and migraine aura, its likely not ms, and sent me on my way i moved house and due to distance and feeling exasperated and exhausted i gave up visiting the neuro, i felt fobbed off, yet could barely see, lost vision and have become depressed. Couldnt walk far i always felt fragile, every day malaise, off feeling, physically cannot continue I'm in continual pain, and i can't think.  Cant express my thoughts or emotions well (started with flares of severe brain fog about 10 years ago) i havent improved. i am right now in a terrible way. I have tried phoning the gp (requested a blood test however due to the coronovirus outbreak i cannot get an appointment, just one telephone consultation after my blood test results are back and being told i need an eye test first ( i had one last year at  they couldn't find a problem, were blase to say the least and the dr said it was unlikely I'll go blind as these ""symptoms have been persistent for a long time"") i keep slurring my words and waking up not knowing where i am, who i am, everything is barely recognizable i feel totally disoriented day to day, as well as drowsy and just not with it and fully alert its like i cant wake up. The problems worsened, where I'm honestly not functioning at all now,  can barely move i crawl out of bed. Cannot eat very much, and have stopped for days at a time due to plain exhaustion these symptoms are causing. I need post it notes to remember what i last did or said, sometimes i forget mid sentence and the problems been worsening.  I have searing pain in my limbs all the time and fatigue which doesn't help When I'm  out, my vision blurs worse, I'm starting to miss the the pavement and fall off the curb when I'm walking, seeing stars, thousands of eye floaters now can't see cars well crossing roads, and my cognitive problems worsen i can't think for the life of me, cant speak without sounding drunk and come home with red, inflamed and swelling, hands and feet, searing pain and crushing sensations, my co ordination gets affected, clumsy and cant feel my limbs,  i don't feel fully awake and alert,  my visions all dark, lack of visual acuity my eyes are inflamed now daily,  all i know is i have an overwhelming headache. I feel terrible and its been worsening over the years The continual headache has been continually worsening for the part of 10 years now, my hearing is muffled which is I'm having problems explaining to the gp over the phone because if my thinking problems. I have severe personality, cognitive changes all the time, mood swings, rage even & mild psychotic symptoms. I get very irritable and its so unlike me. I find it unbearable i don't feel right at all  If the headache even eases off  slightly the described - lessens. There's some clarity When i come home the problem id be physically shaking with a tremor in the face, entire body,  hands and my lower arms it used to ease up after up to 5 hours, or several days being bed bound from fatigue after my body was unable to take a walk, heat used to make it worse Yesterday i had to walk to my drs to collect a blood test form. I picked up a sandwich from the shop, came back home. The tremor in my lower arms was so severe (felt like a vice) i couldn't hold the food to my mouth to eat it, i am extremely frustrated by it i have an all over fine shaking, more noticable in flares I've had chronic fatigue, and flares of a racing heart often when i sleep. So 155bpm on waking this used to happen in my late teens, had another bout in my mid twenties for no reason. At 30 i have mild episodes, i occasionally wake up with a racing heart and often dismissed it I've had daily night sweats for at least 5 years where its profuse, and severe hives episodes lasting weeks at a time. My skin hasn't stopped crawling all over for this period of time. Reduced me to tears and I've tried everything from changing my washing powder, changing my diet, skin care products to no success, over the counter antihistamines (provided short lasting relief but they only sell tiny tubes and its been affecting my entire body including face) This is only one skin issue. I've suffered swelling in my hands and feet & burning sensations from my mid teens (visibly red) a very long  time, people used to comment on this. And searing pain is only how i can describe it. Often upon exercise, sometimes doing nothing at all. it's sporadic. But the pain has worsened and the frequency recently. I am now waking with a numb face (can't always speak and get my words out) numb hands, lower arms and feet.  it doesn't subside but the symptoms seem to flare at night or when I've been asleep. The numbness seems to affect my taste and smell where its lessened  I wake up with flares with painful lungs when i inhale it feels like severe dryness that's causing the pain, sometimes coughing, and my throat is so dry i have voice changes that's extremely noticeable to me, a hoarseness In 2015 i became ill with what i thought was a virus. Fever & chills, swollen lymph nodes on my neck, vomiting, nausea, a blotchy bright red rash that started on my face and neck and worked it way onto my arms, legs, hands, and an unbelievable headache and the worst muscle pain and aches for about 6 weeks. The rash didn't start to disappear until 3 months later and i still had flares for about 2 years. The fatigue was knockout as if i had been hit by a train. The itching has never stopped, nor have the night sweats I've also lost weight not intentionally i have dropped 4 dress sizes in 1 and a half years.  Sometimes on waking up I've felt nauseous and headachey, eyes inflamed. I've noticed in the mirror with my terrible vision where i can barely see myself in the mirror,  for several years on and off an intense pink rash. On my face, notably around my cheeks and nose. It looks like sun burn. Sometimes my heart would be racing as most mornings. i can hear my heart pounding, daylight sensitive and find mornings unbearable. I suffer with dry mouth, subsequent teeth decay, brittle thinning hair that's falling out, it looks fuzzy and like cotton candy, a good volume has fallen out over the years throughout my twenties Dry skin. The odd mouth ulcer. I've checked myself for lyme disease recently (negative) blood sugar is normal. Even tested myself for HIV (negative) as i was at my wits end with these symptoms that have ruined my life and had little input from the drs the odd time that I've made an appointment I had my bloods done last year for a general check. Apparently CR P was fine, so apparently this means there's no inflammation. Kidney function fine, and the only issue was mild anaemia. (resolved after treatment) Tests done several years ago were slightly abnormal apparently this was nothing to worry about. Low WBC, on two consecutive tests but apparently this is common place if someone's a bit run down? I've included photos of my hands and how they look on a day to day basis, the rash and redness is more intense in person! Please excuse the swollen hands I've not gotten photos of the other rash I've sufferer that looked like red blotches I'm sorry about my grammar due to not feeling well After walking 4 miles after being told by tge DR they could do a blood test at the clinic, come straight in. The receptionist was difficult and said i could have  the form ( lockdown at the clinic) they told me they could no longer do bloods, and the hospital 8 mile walk away were nor taking general blood tests because of the coronovirus. The receptionist didn't listen, i insisted i couldn't wait several months seeing as I've lost a lot of my vision and in a really bad way, they said ring the hospital to get bloods booked.  They've missed an ANCA test off the list so i asked them to change it if i am asking to be tested for lupus or vascular issues. The DR changed the form. I am facing a 4 mile walk back to get the replacement form again from the gp with all these symptoms  Then bloods at hospital if i can even book that, i feel too ill to do this walk. i don't drive, have no one to help I feel like im on deaths door if I'm straight.  I can't get a taxi due to the coronovirus  outbreak How do i go  about this?  Sorry this is long not organized. I'm hoping someone reads this message x thank you 0 likes, 1 reply "

Please excuse the swollen hands I've not gotten photos of the other rash I've sufferer that looked like red blotches I'm sorry about my grammar due to not feeling well After walking 4 miles after being told by tge DR they could do a blood test at the clinic, come straight in. The receptionist was difficult and said i could have  the form ( lockdown at the clinic) they told me they could no longer do bloods, and the hospital 8 mile walk away were nor taking general blood tests because of the coronovirus. The receptionist didn't listen, i insisted i couldn't wait several months seeing as I've lost a lot of my vision and in a really bad way, they said ring the hospital to get bloods booked.  They've missed an ANCA test off the list so i asked them to change it if i am asking to be tested for lupus or vascular issues. The DR changed the form. I am facing a 4 mile walk back to get the replacement form again from the gp with all these symptoms  Then bloods at hospital if i can even book that, i feel too ill to do this walk. i don't drive, have no one to help I feel like im on deaths door if I'm straight.  I can't get a taxi due to the coronovirus  outbreak How do i go  about this?  Sorry this is long not organized. I'm hoping someone reads this message x thank you 0 likes, 1 reply "

I'm trying to be as accurate as i can despite pain I'm in I've had symptoms for a long time, i was referred to a neurologist about 2 years ago, they did a physical check & mri was clear, gave me pregabalin and told me i might suffer with a continual migraine and migraine aura, its likely not ms, and sent me on my way i moved house and due to distance and feeling exasperated and exhausted i gave up visiting the neuro, i felt fobbed off, yet could barely see, lost vision and have become depressed. Couldnt walk far i always felt fragile, every day malaise, off feeling, physically cannot continue I'm in continual pain, and i can't think.  Cant express my thoughts or emotions well (started with flares of severe brain fog about 10 years ago) i havent improved. i am right now in a terrible way. I have tried phoning the gp (requested a blood test however due to the coronovirus outbreak i cannot get an appointment, just one telephone consultation after my blood test results are back and being told i need an eye test first ( i had one last year at  they couldn't find a problem, were blase to say the least and the dr said it was unlikely I'll go blind as these ""symptoms have been persistent for a long time"") i keep slurring my words and waking up not knowing where i am, who i am, everything is barely recognizable i feel totally disoriented day to day, as well as drowsy and just not with it and fully alert its like i cant wake up. The problems worsened, where I'm honestly not functioning at all now,  can barely move i crawl out of bed. Cannot eat very much, and have stopped for days at a time due to plain exhaustion these symptoms are causing. I need post it notes to remember what i last did or said, sometimes i forget mid sentence and the problems been worsening.  I have searing pain in my limbs all the time and fatigue which doesn't help When I'm  out, my vision blurs worse, I'm starting to miss the the pavement and fall off the curb when I'm walking, seeing stars, thousands of eye floaters now can't see cars well crossing roads, and my cognitive problems worsen i can't think for the life of me, cant speak without sounding drunk and come home with red, inflamed and swelling, hands and feet, searing pain and crushing sensations, my co ordination gets affected, clumsy and cant feel my limbs,  i don't feel fully awake and alert,  my visions all dark, lack of visual acuity my eyes are inflamed now daily,  all i know is i have an overwhelming headache. I feel terrible and its been worsening over the years The continual headache has been continually worsening for the part of 10 years now, my hearing is muffled which is I'm having problems explaining to the gp over the phone because if my thinking problems. I have severe personality, cognitive changes all the time, mood swings, rage even & mild psychotic symptoms. I get very irritable and its so unlike me. I find it unbearable i don't feel right at all  If the headache even eases off  slightly the described - lessens. There's some clarity When i come home the problem id be physically shaking with a tremor in the face, entire body,  hands and my lower arms it used to ease up after up to 5 hours, or several days being bed bound from fatigue after my body was unable to take a walk, heat used to make it worse Yesterday i had to walk to my drs to collect a blood test form. I picked up a sandwich from the shop, came back home. The tremor in my lower arms was so severe (felt like a vice) i couldn't hold the food to my mouth to eat it, i am extremely frustrated by it i have an all over fine shaking, more noticable in flares I've had chronic fatigue, and flares of a racing heart often when i sleep. So 155bpm on waking this used to happen in my late teens, had another bout in my mid twenties for no reason. At 30 i have mild episodes, i occasionally wake up with a racing heart and often dismissed it I've had daily night sweats for at least 5 years where its profuse, and severe hives episodes lasting weeks at a time. My skin hasn't stopped crawling all over for this period of time. Reduced me to tears and I've tried everything from changing my washing powder, changing my diet, skin care products to no success, over the counter antihistamines (provided short lasting relief but they only sell tiny tubes and its been affecting my entire body including face) This is only one skin issue. I've suffered swelling in my hands and feet & burning sensations from my mid teens (visibly red) a very long  time, people used to comment on this. And searing pain is only how i can describe it. Often upon exercise, sometimes doing nothing at all. it's sporadic. But the pain has worsened and the frequency recently. I am now waking with a numb face (can't always speak and get my words out) numb hands, lower arms and feet.  it doesn't subside but the symptoms seem to flare at night or when I've been asleep. The numbness seems to affect my taste and smell where its lessened  I wake up with flares with painful lungs when i inhale it feels like severe dryness that's causing the pain, sometimes coughing, and my throat is so dry i have voice changes that's extremely noticeable to me, a hoarseness In 2015 i became ill with what i thought was a virus. Fever & chills, swollen lymph nodes on my neck, vomiting, nausea, a blotchy bright red rash that started on my face and neck and worked it way onto my arms, legs, hands, and an unbelievable headache and the worst muscle pain and aches for about 6 weeks. The rash didn't start to disappear until 3 months later and i still had flares for about 2 years. The fatigue was knockout as if i had been hit by a train. The itching has never stopped, nor have the night sweats I've also lost weight not intentionally i have dropped 4 dress sizes in 1 and a half years.  Sometimes on waking up I've felt nauseous and headachey, eyes inflamed. I've noticed in the mirror with my terrible vision where i can barely see myself in the mirror,  for several years on and off an intense pink rash. On my face, notably around my cheeks and nose. It looks like sun burn. Sometimes my heart would be racing as most mornings. i can hear my heart pounding, daylight sensitive and find mornings unbearable. I suffer with dry mouth, subsequent teeth decay, brittle thinning hair that's falling out, it looks fuzzy and like cotton candy, a good volume has fallen out over the years throughout my twenties Dry skin. The odd mouth ulcer. I've checked myself for lyme disease recently (negative) blood sugar is normal. Even tested myself for HIV (negative) as i was at my wits end with these symptoms that have ruined my life and had little input from the drs the odd time that I've made an appointment I had my bloods done last year for a general check. Apparently CR P was fine, so apparently this means there's no inflammation. Kidney function fine, and the only issue was mild anaemia.

I'm trying to be as accurate as i can despite pain I'm in I've had symptoms for a long time, i was referred to a neurologist about 2 years ago, they did a physical check & mri was clear, gave me pregabalin and told me i might suffer with a continual migraine and migraine aura, its likely not ms, and sent me on my way i moved house and due to distance and feeling exasperated and exhausted i gave up visiting the neuro, i felt fobbed off, yet could barely see, lost vision and have become depressed. Couldnt walk far i always felt fragile, every day malaise, off feeling, physically cannot continue I'm in continual pain, and i can't think.  Cant express my thoughts or emotions well (started with flares of severe brain fog about 10 years ago) i havent improved. i am right now in a terrible way. I have tried phoning the gp (requested a blood test however due to the coronovirus outbreak i cannot get an appointment, just one telephone consultation after my blood test results are back and being told i need an eye test first ( i had one last year at  they couldn't find a problem, were blase to say the least and the dr said it was unlikely I'll go blind as these ""symptoms have been persistent for a long time"") i keep slurring my words and waking up not knowing where i am, who i am, everything is barely recognizable i feel totally disoriented day to day, as well as drowsy and just not with it and fully alert its like i cant wake up. The problems worsened, where I'm honestly not functioning at all now,  can barely move i crawl out of bed. Cannot eat very much, and have stopped for days at a time due to plain exhaustion these symptoms are causing. I need post it notes to remember what i last did or said, sometimes i forget mid sentence and the problems been worsening.  I have searing pain in my limbs all the time and fatigue which doesn't help When I'm  out, my vision blurs worse, I'm starting to miss the the pavement and fall off the curb when I'm walking, seeing stars, thousands of eye floaters now can't see cars well crossing roads, and my cognitive problems worsen i can't think for the life of me, cant speak without sounding drunk and come home with red, inflamed and swelling, hands and feet, searing pain and crushing sensations, my co ordination gets affected, clumsy and cant feel my limbs,  i don't feel fully awake and alert,  my visions all dark, lack of visual acuity my eyes are inflamed now daily,  all i know is i have an overwhelming headache. I feel terrible and its been worsening over the years The continual headache has been continually worsening for the part of 10 years now, my hearing is muffled which is I'm having problems explaining to the gp over the phone because if my thinking problems. I have severe personality, cognitive changes all the time, mood swings, rage even & mild psychotic symptoms. I get very irritable and its so unlike me. I find it unbearable i don't feel right at all  If the headache even eases off  slightly the described - lessens. There's some clarity When i come home the problem id be physically shaking with a tremor in the face, entire body,  hands and my lower arms it used to ease up after up to 5 hours, or several days being bed bound from fatigue after my body was unable to take a walk, heat used to make it worse Yesterday i had to walk to my drs to collect a blood test form. I picked up a sandwich from the shop, came back home. The tremor in my lower arms was so severe (felt like a vice) i couldn't hold the food to my mouth to eat it, i am extremely frustrated by it i have an all over fine shaking, more noticable in flares I've had chronic fatigue, and flares of a racing heart often when i sleep. So 155bpm on waking this used to happen in my late teens, had another bout in my mid twenties for no reason. At 30 i have mild episodes, i occasionally wake up with a racing heart and often dismissed it I've had daily night sweats for at least 5 years where its profuse, and severe hives episodes lasting weeks at a time. My skin hasn't stopped crawling all over for this period of time. Reduced me to tears and I've tried everything from changing my washing powder, changing my diet, skin care products to no success, over the counter antihistamines (provided short lasting relief but they only sell tiny tubes and its been affecting my entire body including face) This is only one skin issue. I've suffered swelling in my hands and feet & burning sensations from my mid teens (visibly red) a very long  time, people used to comment on this. And searing pain is only how i can describe it. Often upon exercise, sometimes doing nothing at all. it's sporadic. But the pain has worsened and the frequency recently. I am now waking with a numb face (can't always speak and get my words out) numb hands, lower arms and feet.  it doesn't subside but the symptoms seem to flare at night or when I've been asleep. The numbness seems to affect my taste and smell where its lessened  I wake up with flares with painful lungs when i inhale it feels like severe dryness that's causing the pain, sometimes coughing, and my throat is so dry i have voice changes that's extremely noticeable to me, a hoarseness In 2015 i became ill with what i thought was a virus. Fever & chills, swollen lymph nodes on my neck, vomiting, nausea, a blotchy bright red rash that started on my face and neck and worked it way onto my arms, legs, hands, and an unbelievable headache and the worst muscle pain and aches for about 6 weeks. The rash didn't start to disappear until 3 months later and i still had flares for about 2 years. The fatigue was knockout as if i had been hit by a train. The itching has never stopped, nor have the night sweats I've also lost weight not intentionally i have dropped 4 dress sizes in 1 and a half years.  Sometimes on waking up I've felt nauseous and headachey, eyes inflamed. I've noticed in the mirror with my terrible vision where i can barely see myself in the mirror,  for several years on and off an intense pink rash. On my face, notably around my cheeks and nose. It looks like sun burn. Sometimes my heart would be racing as most mornings. i can hear my heart pounding, daylight sensitive and find mornings unbearable. I suffer with dry mouth, subsequent teeth decay, brittle thinning hair that's falling out, it looks fuzzy and like cotton candy, a good volume has fallen out over the years throughout my twenties Dry skin. The odd mouth ulcer. I've checked myself for lyme disease recently (negative) blood sugar is normal. Even tested myself for HIV (negative) as i was at my wits end with these symptoms that have ruined my life and had little input from the drs the odd time that I've made an appointment I had my bloods done last year for a general check. Apparently CR P was fine, so apparently this means there's no inflammation. Kidney function fine, and the only issue was mild anaemia. (resolved after treatment) Tests done several years ago were slightly abnormal apparently this was nothing to worry about. Low WBC, on two consecutive tests but apparently this is common place if someone's a bit run down? I've included photos of my hands and how they look on a day to day basis, the rash and redness is more intense in person! Please excuse the swollen hands I've not gotten photos of the other rash I've sufferer that looked like red blotches I'm sorry about my grammar due to not feeling well After walking 4 miles after being told by tge DR they could do a blood test at the clinic, come straight in. The receptionist was difficult and said i could have  the form ( lockdown at the clinic) they told me they could no longer do bloods, and the hospital 8 mile walk away were nor taking general blood tests because of the coronovirus. The receptionist didn't listen, i insisted i couldn't wait several months seeing as I've lost a lot of my vision and in a really bad way, they said ring the hospital to get bloods booked.  They've missed an ANCA test off the list so i asked them to change it if i am asking to be tested for lupus or vascular issues. The DR changed the form. I am facing a 4 mile walk back to get the replacement form again from the gp with all these symptoms  Then bloods at hospital if i can even book that, i feel too ill to do this walk. i don't drive, have no one to help I feel like im on deaths door if I'm straight.

I have tried phoning the gp (requested a blood test however due to the coronovirus outbreak i cannot get an appointment, just one telephone consultation after my blood test results are back and being told i need an eye test first ( i had one last year at  they couldn't find a problem, were blase to say the least and the dr said it was unlikely I'll go blind as these ""symptoms have been persistent for a long time"") i keep slurring my words and waking up not knowing where i am, who i am, everything is barely recognizable i feel totally disoriented day to day, as well as drowsy and just not with it and fully alert its like i cant wake up. The problems worsened, where I'm honestly not functioning at all now,  can barely move i crawl out of bed. Cannot eat very much, and have stopped for days at a time due to plain exhaustion these symptoms are causing. I need post it notes to remember what i last did or said, sometimes i forget mid sentence and the problems been worsening.  I have searing pain in my limbs all the time and fatigue which doesn't help When I'm  out, my vision blurs worse, I'm starting to miss the the pavement and fall off the curb when I'm walking, seeing stars, thousands of eye floaters now can't see cars well crossing roads, and my cognitive problems worsen i can't think for the life of me, cant speak without sounding drunk and come home with red, inflamed and swelling, hands and feet, searing pain and crushing sensations, my co ordination gets affected, clumsy and cant feel my limbs,  i don't feel fully awake and alert,  my visions all dark, lack of visual acuity my eyes are inflamed now daily,  all i know is i have an overwhelming headache. I feel terrible and its been worsening over the years The continual headache has been continually worsening for the part of 10 years now, my hearing is muffled which is I'm having problems explaining to the gp over the phone because if my thinking problems. I have severe personality, cognitive changes all the time, mood swings, rage even & mild psychotic symptoms. I get very irritable and its so unlike me. I find it unbearable i don't feel right at all  If the headache even eases off  slightly the described - lessens. There's some clarity When i come home the problem id be physically shaking with a tremor in the face, entire body,  hands and my lower arms it used to ease up after up to 5 hours, or several days being bed bound from fatigue after my body was unable to take a walk, heat used to make it worse Yesterday i had to walk to my drs to collect a blood test form. I picked up a sandwich from the shop, came back home. The tremor in my lower arms was so severe (felt like a vice) i couldn't hold the food to my mouth to eat it, i am extremely frustrated by it i have an all over fine shaking, more noticable in flares I've had chronic fatigue, and flares of a racing heart often when i sleep. So 155bpm on waking this used to happen in my late teens, had another bout in my mid twenties for no reason. At 30 i have mild episodes, i occasionally wake up with a racing heart and often dismissed it I've had daily night sweats for at least 5 years where its profuse, and severe hives episodes lasting weeks at a time. My skin hasn't stopped crawling all over for this period of time. Reduced me to tears and I've tried everything from changing my washing powder, changing my diet, skin care products to no success, over the counter antihistamines (provided short lasting relief but they only sell tiny tubes and its been affecting my entire body including face) This is only one skin issue. I've suffered swelling in my hands and feet & burning sensations from my mid teens (visibly red) a very long  time, people used to comment on this. And searing pain is only how i can describe it. Often upon exercise, sometimes doing nothing at all. it's sporadic. But the pain has worsened and the frequency recently. I am now waking with a numb face (can't always speak and get my words out) numb hands, lower arms and feet.  it doesn't subside but the symptoms seem to flare at night or when I've been asleep. The numbness seems to affect my taste and smell where its lessened  I wake up with flares with painful lungs when i inhale it feels like severe dryness that's causing the pain, sometimes coughing, and my throat is so dry i have voice changes that's extremely noticeable to me, a hoarseness In 2015 i became ill with what i thought was a virus. Fever & chills, swollen lymph nodes on my neck, vomiting, nausea, a blotchy bright red rash that started on my face and neck and worked it way onto my arms, legs, hands, and an unbelievable headache and the worst muscle pain and aches for about 6 weeks. The rash didn't start to disappear until 3 months later and i still had flares for about 2 years. The fatigue was knockout as if i had been hit by a train. The itching has never stopped, nor have the night sweats I've also lost weight not intentionally i have dropped 4 dress sizes in 1 and a half years.  Sometimes on waking up I've felt nauseous and headachey, eyes inflamed. I've noticed in the mirror with my terrible vision where i can barely see myself in the mirror,  for several years on and off an intense pink rash. On my face, notably around my cheeks and nose. It looks like sun burn. Sometimes my heart would be racing as most mornings. i can hear my heart pounding, daylight sensitive and find mornings unbearable. I suffer with dry mouth, subsequent teeth decay, brittle thinning hair that's falling out, it looks fuzzy and like cotton candy, a good volume has fallen out over the years throughout my twenties Dry skin. The odd mouth ulcer. I've checked myself for lyme disease recently (negative) blood sugar is normal. Even tested myself for HIV (negative) as i was at my wits end with these symptoms that have ruined my life and had little input from the drs the odd time that I've made an appointment I had my bloods done last year for a general check. Apparently CR P was fine, so apparently this means there's no inflammation. Kidney function fine, and the only issue was mild anaemia. (resolved after treatment) Tests done several years ago were slightly abnormal apparently this was nothing to worry about. Low WBC, on two consecutive tests but apparently this is common place if someone's a bit run down? I've included photos of my hands and how they look on a day to day basis, the rash and redness is more intense in person! Please excuse the swollen hands I've not gotten photos of the other rash I've sufferer that looked like red blotches I'm sorry about my grammar due to not feeling well After walking 4 miles after being told by tge DR they could do a blood test at the clinic, come straight in. The receptionist was difficult and said i could have  the form ( lockdown at the clinic) they told me they could no longer do bloods, and the hospital 8 mile walk away were nor taking general blood tests because of the coronovirus. The receptionist didn't listen, i insisted i couldn't wait several months seeing as I've lost a lot of my vision and in a really bad way, they said ring the hospital to get bloods booked.  They've missed an ANCA test off the list so i asked them to change it if i am asking to be tested for lupus or vascular issues. The DR changed the form. I am facing a 4 mile walk back to get the replacement form again from the gp with all these symptoms  Then bloods at hospital if i can even book that, i feel too ill to do this walk. i don't drive, have no one to help I feel like im on deaths door if I'm straight.  I can't get a taxi due to the coronovirus  outbreak How do i go  about this?  Sorry this is long not organized. I'm hoping someone reads this message x thank you 0 likes, 1 reply "

So 155bpm on waking this used to happen in my late teens, had another bout in my mid twenties for no reason. At 30 i have mild episodes, i occasionally wake up with a racing heart and often dismissed it I've had daily night sweats for at least 5 years where its profuse, and severe hives episodes lasting weeks at a time. My skin hasn't stopped crawling all over for this period of time. Reduced me to tears and I've tried everything from changing my washing powder, changing my diet, skin care products to no success, over the counter antihistamines (provided short lasting relief but they only sell tiny tubes and its been affecting my entire body including face) This is only one skin issue. I've suffered swelling in my hands and feet & burning sensations from my mid teens (visibly red) a very long  time, people used to comment on this. And searing pain is only how i can describe it. Often upon exercise, sometimes doing nothing at all. it's sporadic. But the pain has worsened and the frequency recently. I am now waking with a numb face (can't always speak and get my words out) numb hands, lower arms and feet.  it doesn't subside but the symptoms seem to flare at night or when I've been asleep. The numbness seems to affect my taste and smell where its lessened  I wake up with flares with painful lungs when i inhale it feels like severe dryness that's causing the pain, sometimes coughing, and my throat is so dry i have voice changes that's extremely noticeable to me, a hoarseness In 2015 i became ill with what i thought was a virus. Fever & chills, swollen lymph nodes on my neck, vomiting, nausea, a blotchy bright red rash that started on my face and neck and worked it way onto my arms, legs, hands, and an unbelievable headache and the worst muscle pain and aches for about 6 weeks. The rash didn't start to disappear until 3 months later and i still had flares for about 2 years. The fatigue was knockout as if i had been hit by a train. The itching has never stopped, nor have the night sweats I've also lost weight not intentionally i have dropped 4 dress sizes in 1 and a half years.  Sometimes on waking up I've felt nauseous and headachey, eyes inflamed. I've noticed in the mirror with my terrible vision where i can barely see myself in the mirror,  for several years on and off an intense pink rash. On my face, notably around my cheeks and nose. It looks like sun burn. Sometimes my heart would be racing as most mornings. i can hear my heart pounding, daylight sensitive and find mornings unbearable. I suffer with dry mouth, subsequent teeth decay, brittle thinning hair that's falling out, it looks fuzzy and like cotton candy, a good volume has fallen out over the years throughout my twenties Dry skin. The odd mouth ulcer. I've checked myself for lyme disease recently (negative) blood sugar is normal. Even tested myself for HIV (negative) as i was at my wits end with these symptoms that have ruined my life and had little input from the drs the odd time that I've made an appointment I had my bloods done last year for a general check. Apparently CR P was fine, so apparently this means there's no inflammation. Kidney function fine, and the only issue was mild anaemia. (resolved after treatment) Tests done several years ago were slightly abnormal apparently this was nothing to worry about. Low WBC, on two consecutive tests but apparently this is common place if someone's a bit run down? I've included photos of my hands and how they look on a day to day basis, the rash and redness is more intense in person! Please excuse the swollen hands I've not gotten photos of the other rash I've sufferer that looked like red blotches I'm sorry about my grammar due to not feeling well After walking 4 miles after being told by tge DR they could do a blood test at the clinic, come straight in. The receptionist was difficult and said i could have  the form ( lockdown at the clinic) they told me they could no longer do bloods, and the hospital 8 mile walk away were nor taking general blood tests because of the coronovirus. The receptionist didn't listen, i insisted i couldn't wait several months seeing as I've lost a lot of my vision and in a really bad way, they said ring the hospital to get bloods booked.  They've missed an ANCA test off the list so i asked them to change it if i am asking to be tested for lupus or vascular issues. The DR changed the form. I am facing a 4 mile walk back to get the replacement form again from the gp with all these symptoms  Then bloods at hospital if i can even book that, i feel too ill to do this walk. i don't drive, have no one to help I feel like im on deaths door if I'm straight.  I can't get a taxi due to the coronovirus  outbreak How do i go  about this?  Sorry this is long not organized. I'm hoping someone reads this message x thank you 0 likes, 1 reply "

Suspected long term lupus CNS vasculitis. In a really bad way,"Hi, i can't express my thoughts well so please excuse this not sounding planned. I'm trying to be as accurate as i can despite pain I'm in I've had symptoms for a long time, i was referred to a neurologist about 2 years ago, they did a physical check & mri was clear, gave me pregabalin and told me i might suffer with a continual migraine and migraine aura, its likely not ms, and sent me on my way i moved house and due to distance and feeling exasperated and exhausted i gave up visiting the neuro, i felt fobbed off, yet could barely see, lost vision and have become depressed. Couldnt walk far i always felt fragile, every day malaise, off feeling, physically cannot continue I'm in continual pain, and i can't think.  Cant express my thoughts or emotions well (started with flares of severe brain fog about 10 years ago) i havent improved. i am right now in a terrible way. I have tried phoning the gp (requested a blood test however due to the coronovirus outbreak i cannot get an appointment, just one telephone consultation after my blood test results are back and being told i need an eye test first ( i had one last year at  they couldn't find a problem, were blase to say the least and the dr said it was unlikely I'll go blind as these ""symptoms have been persistent for a long time"") i keep slurring my words and waking up not knowing where i am, who i am, everything is barely recognizable i feel totally disoriented day to day, as well as drowsy and just not with it and fully alert its like i cant wake up. The problems worsened, where I'm honestly not functioning at all now,  can barely move i crawl out of bed. Cannot eat very much, and have stopped for days at a time due to plain exhaustion these symptoms are causing. I need post it notes to remember what i last did or said, sometimes i forget mid sentence and the problems been worsening.  I have searing pain in my limbs all the time and fatigue which doesn't help When I'm  out, my vision blurs worse, I'm starting to miss the the pavement and fall off the curb when I'm walking, seeing stars, thousands of eye floaters now can't see cars well crossing roads, and my cognitive problems worsen i can't think for the life of me, cant speak without sounding drunk and come home with red, inflamed and swelling, hands and feet, searing pain and crushing sensations, my co ordination gets affected, clumsy and cant feel my limbs,  i don't feel fully awake and alert,  my visions all dark, lack of visual acuity my eyes are inflamed now daily,  all i know is i have an overwhelming headache. I feel terrible and its been worsening over the years The continual headache has been continually worsening for the part of 10 years now, my hearing is muffled which is I'm having problems explaining to the gp over the phone because if my thinking problems. I have severe personality, cognitive changes all the time, mood swings, rage even & mild psychotic symptoms. I get very irritable and its so unlike me. I find it unbearable i don't feel right at all  If the headache even eases off  slightly the described - lessens. There's some clarity When i come home the problem id be physically shaking with a tremor in the face, entire body,  hands and my lower arms it used to ease up after up to 5 hours, or several days being bed bound from fatigue after my body was unable to take a walk, heat used to make it worse Yesterday i had to walk to my drs to collect a blood test form. I picked up a sandwich from the shop, came back home. The tremor in my lower arms was so severe (felt like a vice) i couldn't hold the food to my mouth to eat it, i am extremely frustrated by it i have an all over fine shaking, more noticable in flares I've had chronic fatigue, and flares of a racing heart often when i sleep. So 155bpm on waking this used to happen in my late teens, had another bout in my mid twenties for no reason. At 30 i have mild episodes, i occasionally wake up with a racing heart and often dismissed it I've had daily night sweats for at least 5 years where its profuse, and severe hives episodes lasting weeks at a time. My skin hasn't stopped crawling all over for this period of time. Reduced me to tears and I've tried everything from changing my washing powder, changing my diet, skin care products to no success, over the counter antihistamines (provided short lasting relief but they only sell tiny tubes and its been affecting my entire body including face) This is only one skin issue. I've suffered swelling in my hands and feet & burning sensations from my mid teens (visibly red) a very long  time, people used to comment on this. And searing pain is only how i can describe it. Often upon exercise, sometimes doing nothing at all. it's sporadic. But the pain has worsened and the frequency recently. I am now waking with a numb face (can't always speak and get my words out) numb hands, lower arms and feet.  it doesn't subside but the symptoms seem to flare at night or when I've been asleep. The numbness seems to affect my taste and smell where its lessened  I wake up with flares with painful lungs when i inhale it feels like severe dryness that's causing the pain, sometimes coughing, and my throat is so dry i have voice changes that's extremely noticeable to me, a hoarseness In 2015 i became ill with what i thought was a virus. Fever & chills, swollen lymph nodes on my neck, vomiting, nausea, a blotchy bright red rash that started on my face and neck and worked it way onto my arms, legs, hands, and an unbelievable headache and the worst muscle pain and aches for about 6 weeks. The rash didn't start to disappear until 3 months later and i still had flares for about 2 years. The fatigue was knockout as if i had been hit by a train. The itching has never stopped, nor have the night sweats I've also lost weight not intentionally i have dropped 4 dress sizes in 1 and a half years.  Sometimes on waking up I've felt nauseous and headachey, eyes inflamed. I've noticed in the mirror with my terrible vision where i can barely see myself in the mirror,  for several years on and off an intense pink rash. On my face, notably around my cheeks and nose. It looks like sun burn. Sometimes my heart would be racing as most mornings. i can hear my heart pounding, daylight sensitive and find mornings unbearable.

(the saliva may make me feel like im slurring too) glands being constantly out is not a topic anywhere on google or youtube so just seeing if anyone has had anything similar. i dont know of this could be muscle but its the same size of both sides. sometimes the feeling goes away, when i wake up it seems fine but then its back in no time. i dont really know if this is normal but im 32 and never had a problem with glands. one thing to mention is that i had alot of stress recently which seemed to be when this started. but apparently stress dorsnt affect glands. any direction or experience would be nice to hear. best wishes Chris 0 likes, 0 replies "

Now whats odd is my lymph nodes never enlarged during the virus/infection itself but a week after stopping the antibiotics about 10 lymph nodes enlarged along the left side of my neck, both the left side under the ear all the way to the collar bone and along the left jugular more towards the front of the throat. Ultrasound shows the largest of these to be 8mm and most other 5-7mm. My doctor ran all kinds of blood work and i seen an ENT both did ultrasounds and said while slightly enlarged and a decent amount of them they showed no concerning characteristics. I continued to worry so they did a FNA biopsy of one not palpable but the largest under my jaw and it came back completely clear. So i was told that rules out pretty much everything besides a slow growing lymphoma. However they did say they think my nodes are more likely scarred. I guess following a battle with something nasty nodes can remain somewhat permanently enlarged. I know no one else who has ever had that and was just curious if anyone else has had a similar experience? 0 likes, 0 replies "

I had a CT scan (no contrast), which was fine according to doctor, but there was a 1.4cm (14mm) supraclavicular lymph node on left side, almost directly under swollen area. he said to make a follow up appt which i made for 3 weeks later as im doing uni exams, which he was fine about. I then googled supraclavicular lymph nodes, to check if it was a bother going back. I was scared, with stats saying supraclavicular lymph nodes are the most wortrying and likely to be mestatic especially from adbdomen and lungs. Everything, expressed these lymph nodes to be worrisome. I also after the CT that day had an ultrasound, but the lady said the node was too deep and she couldnt reach it, she then said and told doctor, its likely a reactive node, but she didnt actually do an ultrasound on it. I had CT of cervical spine and collarbone and no other lymph nodes present. I am now obviously super worried and the earliest I can get to doctors is in 2 & 1/2 weeks time. Does anyone have any experience with this or give anymore information? much appreciated 😃 also had blood tests that day came back normal. 18 year old female. i ahve also been experiencing mild shortness of breath and mild excessive thirst. noticed today as ive been having more headaches, that i have a swollen occipital node on the right side of head. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I don't remember exactly how big they were. But the lump never went away which i always thought was strange.  A couple months ago i felt more nodes in my neck on the sides under jaw and a couple above my colar bone they range from about 1.5 cm to 1cm which isnt very big but the one i noticed 2 yrs ago is about 3cm. Then a week ago i noticed some in my groin about 2cm to 1cm. Ive been worried sick for quite a while so a couple of days ago i visited the doctors. My mum and dad kept telling me its nothing but i went anyways - the doctor felt all of them and said the smaller ones may be noticeable because im quite skinny, she said that she wouldn't worry about them and that she has felt much bigger ones. I told her i thought they had grown  slightly since i noticed them but she still wasn't worried. she said if i don't have any other symptoms like fevers its nothing to be concerned about.  Im only 16 years old and i really don't want to be worried about this. All google says is lymphoma and its really been worrying me, if it it that it must be a slow growing type because they are growing very slowly but thats very rare at my age. What do you guys think- no other symptoms, doctors not worried whatsoever, parents arent worried. thanks 0 likes, 2 replies "

I went to my primary doctor in late August with the swollen lymph nodes on the left side of my head (one in my neck and one in front of my ear lobe) I was also experiencing some swelling on that side of my face and some ear pain. I was given antibiotics which resolved the issues with the swelling and ear pain. However, the lymph nodes did not go down. I went back in September after having blood work done which showed nothing except slightly elevated cholesterol and a slightly elevated C reactive protein. My doctor was far more concerned about my cholesterol and getting my weight down (which I totally understand) but I was far more concerned about the lymph nodes and what they could mean. He did not seem to have any concern at all about my lymph nodes. He scheduled me to come back in January to see if I had made any improvement with my weight and cholesterol. Also the C Reactive protein had returned to a normal level. When I went back in January I had lost 15 pounds after changing eating habits and began to exercise which is something that I basically was not doing in prior years. However the lymph nodes were still swollen and he decided that he wanted me to go get an ultrasound on them which I did. A few weeks later my doctor called me and told me that my lymph nodes were definitely enlarged (duh) and that he would like for me to go have a biopsy done which I have scheduled for March 6th. He still said that he is not very concerned but just wants to confirm that everything is okay. All of my paper work mentions the lymph node on my neck and not the one by my ear which is actually the one that concerns me more (It is larger than the neck one and feels much harder). I asked my doctor why the lymph node by the ear was not mentioned and he said to address it with the surgeon when I go in for the biopsy. This entire situation has been causing me a ton of anxiety over the past 6 months. I have been having difficulty sleeping, thoughts are constantly racing, and I am just feel an overall sense of helplessness. I know I am probably overreacting since no tests have come back with anything yet but I can not stop worrying. I thought I would post on here to maybe have a chance to talk to some people who have had a similar experience. Nick 0 likes, 9 replies "

I have been having difficulty sleeping, thoughts are constantly racing, and I am just feel an overall sense of helplessness. I know I am probably overreacting since no tests have come back with anything yet but I can not stop worrying. I thought I would post on here to maybe have a chance to talk to some people who have had a similar experience. Nick 0 likes, 9 replies "

I urinate a lot during the day, and it definitely is not a normal amount. My theory is that the swollen glands, and swollen spleen (if it is) is pushing onto my bladder. I have to push onto my abdomen sometimes to get the wee out. I urinate about 4-5 times before I sleep, so between 9 and 10:00-10:30. I am very tired, it is not tiredness I would call it fatigue. The other day I fell asleep on the sofa for three hours and I got woken up at 7pm confused. I need naps quite often. The doctor ran a blood test: I have higher red blood count than normal and lower urea levels. He didn't mention this but it flagged up on the screen so it must of just been borderline. I did have low T4 but normal TSH so I am getting another blood test done for 'something' peroxide. I had white spots on my tonsils but no glandular fever, sore throat or illness usually  concerning them. normal temperature on the lower end. I am glad he issued another blood test because I don't want this case to close, I want to get to the bottom of it. I am actually quite worried because this is not normal. The doctor doesn't know about the urinating and stabbing pain when I cough because its worsened this week. But, I thought he would be more concerned seen as I am in quite a bit of discomfort. I have heard people can get swollen glands for ages for no reason, but these symptoms are uncommon for me and are not to do with common colds, mononucleosis etc. Any advice would be great!

Best I can describe it is a wave that starts at the front of my head or side and spreads quickly to the other side or back and it's like a wave crashing or a pulse (not a heart beat pulse) but a pulse that starts somewhere and pulsates outwards quickly. It causes me to stop everything im doing and shut my eyes and hold my head momentarily. Its a horrible feeling it causes a strange short of dizziness/disoriented feeling that has been coming and going for last couple of hours that worsens when a wave/pulse hits.

For the first 3 months, I actually thought I had ingrown hairs, or a fungal infection from having to wear stockings every day so I was lathering steroid cream on the bumps- which made it 10000x worse. I finally went to the doctor in early April, and I couldn't believe I had MC- still have no idea how I got it. We started burning the bumps, but alas they kept returning more and more. I have tried everything (ACV, TTO). I even got so desperate, I stupidly used 'wart-off' a highly acidic product. This actually burnt off most of my skin, including my very sensitive genital region. The pain was unbearable, I couldn't walk as huge burn blisters formed between my legs and my doc confirmed I had second degree burns. I did not think the MC could survive that trauma, but I was wrong and after my wounds heal guess what?.... MORE FRESH MC LESIONS!!  The doctor looked at the MC again after the burns had healed and he insisted it was clearing up. But I used my phone light to inspect myself again as I got home, and I could clearly see new lesions forming.  So this is where I'm at now. For the past week, I have been rigirous in my methods. I am using aldara 3 times a week, and on the other days using iodine solution( Aldara comes in teeny tiny packets and is super expensive, which is really annoying). I am then covering every inch of skin between my legs with tough, XL bandaids. It's not all that comfortable but that way I am stopping the infection from spreading ( I hope ). I do this every night after a shower. I then wear it for the whole next day then take the bandaids off in the shower at night and repeat the process. I have seen a big improvement with this method. My skin is quite red and irritated in general, but I know that the inflamation of molluscum is good as it means   is fighting it.

Also, how paranoid should I be after showering, as since getting molluscum I've put my towel straight in the wash if I accidentally touched some of the lesions with it despite being really careful trying not to?

I didn't get out of bed for 2 1/2 weeks. I couldn't physically sleep or turn my brain off at night (or in the day) no matter how tired or exhausted I was  which made the low mood even harder to deal with.  I was  .   I was put on 15mg mirtazapine at night which knocked me out but I felt spaced out & not with it all the day & after 5 weeks my gp swapped me to trazodone.  I actually felt better coming off the mirtazapine but the insomnia returned full force.   I was put on 100mg of trazodone at night for 3 weeks, then upped to 150mg for 2 weeks & it's just been upped to 200mg at night in the last 2 days.   This medication does nothing for my sleep as the doctor assured me it would & im currently having to take a 7.5mg zopliclone each night to get between 4-5 hours sleep, I know this is not a long term simulation.  My moods still unbearingly low but I can cope with the day a little better if I manage to get some sleep at night.     I ended up going to a&e a few weeks ago as I felt   & they advised to go back to my gp. I've been on 200mg of trazodone at night for the past 2 night along with the zopliclone & I feel spaced out & completely not with it in the day, I'm not sure if it's a too higher dose???  About 5 years ago I tried sertraline & citalopram & they both made me even worse so I was put on amytripyline at night to help with sleep, It helped but I had severe anxiety back then not depression.  My gp is concerned the trazodone isn't working as I'm not feeling even slightly better & next week wants to try me on fluoxetine.  Has anyone got any advice?   I work in the NHS & desperately want to get back to work, I also have a very supportive partner but still feel low, have no appetite, feel tired all the time, anxious & unmotivated.  I'm trying to go to the gym & I'm currently having private counselling each week. Thank you x 0 likes, 7 replies "

I'm finding it hard to live my life because of this disease. I went to the doctor about 5 months ago once I noticed the bumps, originally I just thought they were shaving marks, but they stayed there after weeks and hardened. The doctor spent about an hour scraping the warts off (which was painful as f**k) so he could send the scrapings back to the lab. Once he got the results, he called me and told me it was MC, and there was no treatment for it except the scraping method. I contacted my insurance and found out there was some topical solution for getting rid of the warts. I've been using it for about 3 days now and it's making my skin dry up down there. Now for the social aspect of this. I'll go out with friends and sometimes one of my girl friends (as in a girl who is my friend) will bring their friends and we'll end up hooking up. But It's getting real tiresome to explain to everyone who I consider attractive that I can't go back to their place with them. This sucks. This is my 20's here, I can't go through it with some awful disease which is going to limit my ability to socialize or develop relationships. I've had the disease for about 5 months now and my summer is about to start. I don't want to have to go through the whole summer having to limit the amount of fun I have because I'm not clean down there. I'm suffering entirely too much anxiety to try to talk to someone in hopes of a serious relationship because I'm sure they'll just stop talking to me if I tell them I have this disease. And they'll have to find out sooner or later because they'll wonder why I don't want to take off my pants. I'm very grateful for the life I have lived so far, and I know we all have to go through our hardships, but this just flat out sucks. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this illness or any other recommendations for treatment? I really don't want to have this for the rest of the summer. Thanks.   0 likes, 13 replies "
