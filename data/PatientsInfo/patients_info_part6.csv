I should say at this point I am also suffering with bronchial problems which when the Dr came she immediately dealt with this even though she increased my pain medication. I also told her I had had a 3 day episode of not being able to control my bowel at all. Few weeks later I had to go Drs as pain was unbearable I was there at 18.00 hours hospital half an hour later saw registrar about 5 hours later in agony. After I was admitted with suspected spinal compression they couldn't decide whether to send me to Newcastle RVI  but I was sent 18 hours later for MRI which showed I had a very large disc growth so was operated on for CES which by this time was urgent and major surgery. I don't know why it was missed or not considered over the last 5/6 weeks. Is someone at fault or was I just unlucky 0 likes, 5 replies "

This was followed by a fusion 6 months later.  Thankfully, I recovered and was left with just some numbness on my right leg and toes and this horrible constipation issue, which is nothing compared to what others are going through. Its been years now and it seems to get worst. I feel the desire to use it, but the muscle wont open enough So I cant never really empty my bowels. Either it wont open enough or it will cause some sort of spasm and the muscle completely close. I've been to so many doctors and they all say the same, drink more water and eat more vegetables. I explain everything I went through and the reason why Im going through this and it's like they don't understand. Sometimes the nurses don't even know what CES is. It is so frustrating because sometimes feel sick and now  my stomach is large, I look like I'm pregnant, I can't really lose weight because I cant use it, and all the drs can say is eat better, drink more water, and try laxatives. I do all and nothing works. Any advise?? 0 likes, 2 replies "

As far as i can tell, it went well. Ive got the numbness in my legs and i think things are getting better there. But like many with ces, i dont have control of my bladder and bowels. bladder I can deal with a lot easier. But my bowels are the problem. I am having a constant sensation of needing to poop. But when i actually have a seat on the toilet, nothing comes out. I often times go 3-4 days without having a bowel movement. Despite eating full meals throughout this time. when i do finally go, its due to a combination of a couple things... i usually go after i convince a friend to give me an enema. And then, i still only go if i sit on the toilet and gag myself as if I’m trying to make myself vomit. I guess the pressure of vomiting pushes things along as well. Keep in mind that I’m not actually vomiting. Just going through the gagging motions. I usually do this on an empty stomach. It ain’t pretty. And I ain’t proud of this. But a man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do... i take Lactulose every once in a while. But that only helps me poop a very little tiny bit. And not an actual full bowel movement.  Every time i have a bowel movement, i think it’s solid, and possibly hard. When i was in the hospital and rehab center, my stool was pasty and runny. I was eating pretty bad at the hospital. But  because my stool was runny and pasty, it would always come out whenever i would stand up and exert myself as in stairs or standing/sitting repeatedly. as a result of this, i am considering switching to a liquid diet altogether. This would be a big undertaking for me. And i wanted to know if anyone had any other suggestions on how to get bowels under control before i pull the trigger on a liquid diet. evryone Around me seems to think they’re an expert on how to get me to poop. Drink this. Eat more of this. What these people seem to forget is that, these hoodoo voodoo tricks they have are for people with functioning bowels.  I dont want to end up pooping From my side in to a bag. 0 likes, 4 replies "

I've had back issues for about 6 years now. and around August, I decided to go to an orthopedic specialist to get some real answers instead of continuing to go to a Chiropractor. I had severe sciatica, pins and needles, occasional numbness in legs, intense back pain. I'm a chef so I put a lot of wear and tear on my back and legs anyway. I went through multiple tests to be able to get an MRI in October where they revealed I had 3 herniated discs (l4,l5,s1) l5 s1 being super serious and very herniated. I tried my luck with an epidural injection- no help at all.  That was a couple weeks ago. and then scheduled surgery for a discectomy. Monday- I realized I had saddle numbness on my left side. i was concerned so I called and they said that's just a symptom of my herniations.  On tuesday of this week, I had a hard day at work but I was fine until bed. A little sore, nothing crazy. I woke up at 3 am in INTENSE pain through my left leg and low back. I tried to get to the bathroom and when I got there the pain was so intense and all of a sudden my whole left leg went completely numb. I was screaming and crying and my wife came to get me to go to the hospital. I was in the ER for a few hours before another MRI was done. they sent the results to my surgeon and at that point he said nothing about cauda equina and that surgery wouldnt be moved up. My regular doctor admitted me for the night on the hospital and told my surgeon to talk to me. I dont know what happened between- but then he came and said I would be getting surgery Friday or Saturday (still wednesday night at this point) then came the next day and said he really tried for friday but they didnt have room that night and he had a 15 hour surgery case. So Saturday morning it is. I still have only about 50 percent feeling in my left leg if that. They fed me a lot of   in the hospital. I still have saddle numbness on left side. butt and thigh completely numb and groin is about 70 percent numb on left side. I still seem to have full bladder control. I just passed a bowel movement and urination. from what I read that is a good sign. I'm very nervous about surgery and recovery.  I'm afraid of permanent damage and I'm afraid I'll have to stop being a chef. I'm afraid of being a burden to my wife. this is so scary.  24 hours til surgery. 0 likes, 7 replies "

I was screaming and crying and my wife came to get me to go to the hospital. I was in the ER for a few hours before another MRI was done. they sent the results to my surgeon and at that point he said nothing about cauda equina and that surgery wouldnt be moved up. My regular doctor admitted me for the night on the hospital and told my surgeon to talk to me. I dont know what happened between- but then he came and said I would be getting surgery Friday or Saturday (still wednesday night at this point) then came the next day and said he really tried for friday but they didnt have room that night and he had a 15 hour surgery case. So Saturday morning it is. I still have only about 50 percent feeling in my left leg if that. They fed me a lot of   in the hospital. I still have saddle numbness on left side. butt and thigh completely numb and groin is about 70 percent numb on left side. I still seem to have full bladder control. I just passed a bowel movement and urination. from what I read that is a good sign. I'm very nervous about surgery and recovery.  I'm afraid of permanent damage and I'm afraid I'll have to stop being a chef. I'm afraid of being a burden to my wife. this is so scary.  24 hours til surgery. 0 likes, 7 replies "

I've had balance issues for a little over two years now that have come and went, and some weird feelings in my scalp like nerves moving. I may be overreacting but I got so scared just at the thought of having a brain tumor that I started crying the other day. My symptoms haven't really gotten that much worse over the years, and my balance problems haven't caused any falls or anything. But I'm just scared. I can't go out or do anything. I can't even go to the store. Because certain things trigger it. Maybe I have anxiety? Are brain tumor symptoms worse than this? Would it have killed me by now? Thank you. 😦 0 likes, 6 replies "

It has been almost a year in a couple months, however, I have been dealing with a constant ""knocking"" sound I am hearing in my head. I cannot run or jump (I mean I could, but it would be extremely discomforting) because there is something in/around my head that I feel that is kind of moving (perhaps in a pendulum fashion, but I am unsure of this)... every time I feel/hear it when I walk, try to run/jump, it creates this sound that is like a slight knock on a wooden slab. I have to irrigate my nose almost every other day or I get severe headaches and naseau, but when I skip an irrigation - I feel like the mucus that I do not clean out makes this knocking sound more prevalent. My ENT made me feel as though I am overreacting - and he questioned if I thought I was hearing my heart beat. No. My significant other and my mom have both heard this knocking while walking next to me, but they only heard it prior to when I found out I have to irrigate my nose in order to prevent headaches (my doctors never told me I have to continue irrigating, which is another whole set of problems). The struggle here is how I can convey this to the doctors - when I shake my head, it feels like a loose bolt that perpetuates this knocking sound. That is the only way I can describe it.. and I have tried showing them the sound, but it does not always come on command. They have seen an MRI and they said I am fine. It really sucks and discomforting because my head feels really fragile on most days and I love being active. I am hoping someone might be experiencing the same thing? Even similar?

I often feel breathless with an accelerated heart rate.  I have also been having night sweats,  pretty much every night for the past couple of weeks.  Im not waking up soaking but definitely wet enough to make my bedding damp.  I also have this knot type feeling in my abdomen like a strain or something,  the joint in my right elbow hurts on and off.  I feel like this is taking over my life,  im constantly worried,  i wake up grumpy, moody and irritable,  im impatient and short tempered and literally dont want to do anything.  Im worried that i have carcinoid syndrome or lymphoma etc, as alot of my symptoms match up to it. has anyone else ever had these symptoms? 0 likes, 0 replies "

I wouldn't say I'm short of breath, but i wheeze more now and have a chronic cough, producing thin clear frothy mucus with every cough and it's frankly relentless - after 'enjoying' 5 years with just rales at night and extra mucus only when working out on my bike (no cough). After a sputum test coming back 'satisfactory', I'm impatiently awaiting a consultation in late October with a cough specialist, and part of me is wondering what I should be doing in the meantime to prevent further damage. Seems as if antibiotics wouldn't help given the fact that no bugs were found in the sputum.

In 2010 when I was 18 I found a large lump under my right nipple. My GP sent me to the breast clinic and I had a biopsy done which showed I had a touch of Gynaecomastia. I did not have man boobs or anything it must have been just a slight thickening of the breast tissue. Anyway all was fine and I was not bothered by it again until late 2016 I started to develop pain under my left armpit and then in early 2017 slight pain in my left breast area accompanied by what felt to me like extra tissue under the nipple and a moveable lump. I went to my GP who referred me again to the hospital. The hospital did not really seem interested it was a quick run of the fingers up and down the chest not actually examining the nipple area and off you go. Then around September 2017 I developed the same symptoms of extra tissue under the nipple and a moveable lump in my right breast. I again returned to my GP who was not bothered in the slightest and said because the lumps were mobile they were unlikely to be serious and off I go. Would this just be Gynaecomastia? I have tried not to worry about it but it has never gone away and I have read that it should go away on its own after a couple of years.  I can be a bit of a worrier and have convinced myself I have cancer a few times but then I try to think logically that if I had untreated breast cancer for 3 years I would probably be dead or very unwell by now. It does not really bother me although it can be a bit painful from time to time nothing severe just a tinge. I think about going back to the GP and then about just leaving it quite a lot. Feel like I dont want to bother GP as have been a few times and they are not concerned. Any other guys had this? 0 likes, 5 replies "

I don't have any symptoms of anything else, no headaches, nothing -- but I do have seborrheic dermatitis. Anyone else ever have something like this? The only thing I can seem to find online is information about pilar and epidermoid cysts. 0 likes, 8 replies "

I notice a painless, pea sized lump under my left arm pit on a self breast exam on 11-11-18. I went to my OBGYN on 11-14-18 for this. He said it was a lymphnode, and nothing to be concerned with. I have no injuries to cause an inflammatory response, am not sick. The lump is still present, & unchanged. I have messaged the office to see how much longer I am to wait and continue to assume it is nothing, or when to come back. On 11-25-18 it will have been there for at least 2 weeks, or longer as I had not done a self breast exam in a few months. Should I request further testing? I am slightly alarmed. 0 likes, 4 replies "

Like this kind of a lump underneath even though there's one in my right breast it's not sore. Over the years I have had a   and ultrasounds and all clear. When I check myself for lumpsthere are none but it just feels horrible . Has anybody else got this feeling with small breasts? I wonder if it's because there's not a lot of tissue there because they are small so I can feel everything if that makes sense.

Distraught ","Hello, I am a 25 year old male, I've searched the internet high and low but there doesn't seem to be any reassurance out there for me. I lost my appetite seeminly over night about 3 months ago. Over that time I have seen 4 different doctors and they have presribed various things like laxatives and acid reflux as I have also had mild digestive complaints on and off. None of these have had boosted my appetite though. I still enjoy eating and do so to keep my energy levels up, but I never actually get hungry and sometimes I get bloated after meals. I also had a colonscopy (I requested it) to rule out colon cancer and it was all clear so the doctor just gave me anti-anxiety meds assuming my lack of appetite was psychological. Only thing is I'm convinced it's not and have seen another doctor who I persuaded to give me an ultrasound. Doctor doesn't seem too worried though and just seemed to imply I'm a hypochondria.    Assuming I am right about the lack of appetite being physical, can I really be anything else but cancer? I'm convinced what I am experiencing now is cachexia, or wasting from late stage cancer. I can't help but think it's pancreatic cancer with liver mets as I also have digestive complaints (have even had floating stools for a while now), I initially considered this just to excedingly rare in people my age but my symptoms just seems textbook. All in all just can't really believe this is happenning and I'm terrified about the ultrasound. 4 likes, 118 replies "

The chest pain is worse if I press on my chest, but it also sometimes hurts on its own, and it's completely on and off. So sometimes I won't notice it for a few hours or a few days, then it comes back 😦 I went to a doctor (walk in since I don't have a family one), and got referrals for a CBC and EKG- CBC came back normal, haven't gotten the EKG yet. I also got a referral for a chest x-ray, after I kept asking the doctor if she thought it might be a blood clot (she handed it to me and basically said ""you don't need it but if it makes you feel better then here""). Doctor said it was probably just my muscles and told me to take aleve for it, but I'm really worried that it's actually something more serious that they're missing. I'm terrified of getting that chest x-ray because I feel like it's going to show that I have lung cancer. I know that's not common given that I'm 20, so at first I was able to reassure myself a bit, but then I realized that it could be lung cancer that spread from somewhere else, and I just never noticed the symptoms of the primary cancer. I'm so anxious about it that it's really been interfering with my life, and also with my ability to do assignments for school since it takes up so much of my mental energy- I'll have panic attacks and suddenly start crying and spend way too long looking at survival statistics and information about terminal illnesses online D: I know that I have anxiety, but I also know that chest pain and shortness of breath are never good signs. And I swear this feels different from similar health anxiety episodes I've had before.  I know that I probably should get the x-ray,  but I've convinced myself that it's going to show something terminal and I don't know how I'll cope with waiting for the results. 0 likes, 3 replies "

My visa was already stamped. But a drastic change in my life was about to happen. A  setback that  eventually made me put my resignation. It was the year  2012 when  I decided to focus only on my health. As I was walking out of the washroom one evening, I suddenly collapsed on the floor. I tried to get back on my feet but failed repeatedly. My mother and domestic help, somehow put me to bed. Again, the next morning, I was unable to get up on my feet. Sensing numbness and abnormality, I called a neurosurgeon who confirmed that I was paralyzed waist-down. Further tests revealed that I had multiple tumors in my spine and a  set of two damaged vertebrae. That had caused severe paralysis. While the initial biopsy of my armpit sample showed false negative result of no malignancy, the second biopsy using sample from my bone marrow, and a  full-body PET-CT Scan, confirmed cancerous nodes not just in my spine but also in my bladder, intestines, liver, tail bone, etc. It was in stage 4. The doctors said that I was a terminal case, and I would not survive beyond five to six weeks. My vulnerable condition and lack of time did not allow me to fly to the U.S.A to my siblings for advanced treatment.

But I  resolved otherwise. A step towards better health was the best birthday gift that I  could have given myself. I had a rare type of non-hodgkins Lymphoma(NHL). Since it was one of the most aggresive forms of NHL, it had spread rapidly in my body, possibly  in merely six to eight months and led to my deteriorating condition. Prior to my radiation and chemotherapy sessions, I was advised a  complicated spine surgery.  The specialist had told my mother that even if it was successful, I would still always be wheel-chair bound. I had tears in my eyes because all my life, my parents had worked so hard bringing me up, and now when I was ready to support them in my youth, I would be a burden on them. My parents assured that just like in the past, they would always be proud of me going ahead!  That evening, almost magically, my one of my big toe demonstrated some movements. The Doctor was excited and decided to postpone the surgery since my body was perhaps responsive to medications. That surgery never happened! I  underwent a  protocol of  eight and a half cycles of chemotherapy and eight sessions of radiation. In the meanwhile, I would regularly undergo physiotherapy sessions, initially passive and later active ones, thrice a day. I  had to wear a  robot-like steel jacket which kept my spine erect and in place because any bends could have lead to twists and grim complications. The doctors advised us to follow a “log procedure” to avoid bed sores. Bedsores are a condition when a lack of air passage between the bedsheets and the prolonged inertly-lying paralysed body can lead to fungal infections.

No pain, normal diet, no signs of weight loss or anything. Everything is normal except for the blood in my spit. Was referred to a Respiratory Lung Specialist this morning and was told the condition is not serious as everything is normal except for the blood in spit. I requested for a thorough check as there was no medicine prescribed for the last few visit at the GPs and he recommended me to go for a   for my sinus and chest. (Both my parents passed away of cancer). But he highlighted that the downside is CT scan is able to pick up extremely small abnormalities with size of even 2mm to 3mm. I am very afraid of the CT scan that might discover abnormalities. Should I still go for the scan? As i requested for it, was not mandate by the specialist. By the way, was prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide for my nasal blockage. 0 likes, 2 replies "

And the problem is that I am from Europe and every hospital is shut down because of COVID-19, I have no idea when it will work properly and this also another reason why I am freaking out, I cannot check my health with doctors, it looks like everyday I notice something bad. Maybe I won't survive till quarantine is over. I am asking you to help me survive it, and maybe you have experienced something like this and have suggestions what should I do. Thank you. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I was a fit and healthy 29 year old (or so I thought) i had a beautiful 2YO daughter and all was going really well. I fell pregnant with my second and a few things preceeded and this is where my health started to take a strange turn. First I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Admittedly my diet wasn't picture perfect as I was eating a lot more (bad and oily) carbs to try to curb morning sickness. but my BMI is right at the bottom so nit iverweight or anything like that. The only number that was out was fasting and it was only ever out by .3 at the most! i ended up on insulin for fasting. when I gave birth to my daughter she was born insulin dependent (i had too much insulin in my body and bloody regret ever going on it). Anyway I felt pretty good - bub and I were healthy until one day when I woke up i had this wierd vision disturbance for 15 mins until I ate something. nothing followed went to the doctor and she diagnosed a visual migraine. perfect was on my way and didn't bother me. until the next night same thing happened with the addition of pins and needles and complete out of body experience. went to hospital and everything as I thought I was having a stroke. diagnosed as panick attack. this is where my health worries started. I am going to list below all my symptoms, tests done, and the what my current worry is. they then did a blood test to check my blood sugar, and found two hours after sugary drink (after fasting 8 hrs) that I was actually having hypos. Blood sugar dropped to 2.1 to be exact. Symptoms in order of getting them: After the stroke scare symptoms i got an mri and saw a neurologists all with normal findings. Bone and joint pain especially in knees - tests done included a battery of blood tests and ultrasound on knee and xray on knee. they checked specifically for lyme disease a full blood count, autoimmune and inflamatory markers. All normal. Found lumps on my hip bone and shin bone - ultrasound found a cyst and fatty deposits. Nausea - found I had a tummy virus (from stool tests). Neck pain - ultrasound found somewhat enlarged thyroid gland and thyroid nodules but all looked normal. additional Neck pain and lymph nodes especially one above collar bone - ultrasound showed all normal and called superficial lymph nodes and because I am skinny can feel them more. Chest pain + pain in back and lymph node under arm (or maybe fatty deposits) and boob lump - boob ultrasound and under arm  ultrasound as well as chest xray - clear/normal. Pain under (below) both ribs,  indigestion, food going down slowly, and severe pain in bag - suspected gall stones so abdominal ultrasound of liver, gallbladder, and pancreas - Clear. also have had about 3 ECG's. have a slightly high cholesterol count but that is improving (it's hereditary). Now I still have the pain bellow rib cage on both sides and an uncomfortable feeling below sternum. pain can be quite bad and quite sharp on left hand side. My bowel movements have changed too (constipated and pebble poops sorry tmi!!) but I have recently changed my diet so that could be a contributing factor. My mums mum died of a heart attack at 37, and dads mum of a brain tumour in her 30's. Dad's sister had breast cancer. i have been worried about having the following: breast cancer, ovarian cancer (pap smear clear), MS, lung cancer, Bone Cancer, Lymphoma, Gosh the list goes on. only because I was so healthy then all of a sudden have gotten these symptoms so it has completely rocked me! Now I am seriously worried I have pancreatic cancer. I am going to ask for an endoscopy but I just want this to end. i can't figure out if there is seriously something wrong and all the doctors/radiologists are missing something, or if I just have a serious case of health anxiety! i had quite a traumatic childhood and my brother and I got taken from my mother when we were 8 in quite a bad way, because she was suffering mental health issues. We then went on to experience some pretty traumatic things from 15+ so I am unsure if this has contributed to my anxiety. i am so worried I will leave my kids at a you g age - infact it is the thing that terrifies me most! if you are still reading thank you so much for taking the time to read my post. ❤❤ Any advice would be amazing! 0 likes, 4 replies "

Dad's sister had breast cancer. i have been worried about having the following: breast cancer, ovarian cancer (pap smear clear), MS, lung cancer, Bone Cancer, Lymphoma, Gosh the list goes on. only because I was so healthy then all of a sudden have gotten these symptoms so it has completely rocked me! Now I am seriously worried I have pancreatic cancer. I am going to ask for an endoscopy but I just want this to end. i can't figure out if there is seriously something wrong and all the doctors/radiologists are missing something, or if I just have a serious case of health anxiety! i had quite a traumatic childhood and my brother and I got taken from my mother when we were 8 in quite a bad way, because she was suffering mental health issues. We then went on to experience some pretty traumatic things from 15+ so I am unsure if this has contributed to my anxiety. i am so worried I will leave my kids at a you g age - infact it is the thing that terrifies me most! if you are still reading thank you so much for taking the time to read my post. ❤❤ Any advice would be amazing! 0 likes, 4 replies "

All normal. Found lumps on my hip bone and shin bone - ultrasound found a cyst and fatty deposits. Nausea - found I had a tummy virus (from stool tests). Neck pain - ultrasound found somewhat enlarged thyroid gland and thyroid nodules but all looked normal. additional Neck pain and lymph nodes especially one above collar bone - ultrasound showed all normal and called superficial lymph nodes and because I am skinny can feel them more.

Just over 6 months ago I started having bad abdominal pains followed by watery diarrhea. Over the next day or so this turned bloody and I went to ER, where they gave me antibiotics and told me it was probably bacterial gastroenteritis. My inflammation markers were high and my iron levels were low (I wasn't anemic, just low in iron). The antibiotics seemed to clear things up, and any blood that was visible went away after 5 days or so, along with the stomach cramping. Blood tests afterwards showed my inflammation markers were normal, along with normal thyroid levels but still lowered iron (concerned about this because I know this is a symptom of bowel cancer). A month or so later I had a very itchy rectum and what seemed to be the early signs of an anal abscess, again I was prescribed antibiotics and it left. Fast forward to now (6 months later) I don't have any visible blood, but on a couple of occasions I have noticed foul smelling mucus in an otherwise normal looking stool. I have regular patterns of how often and when I have a bowel movement. Sometimes my stools seem pretty loose but I wouldn't call it diarrhea., but generally my stools tend to vary over the course of weeks. I visited a gastroenterologist to follow up the anal itching and the scary symptoms which lasted 5 days, and he said I'm far too young for it to be colorectal cancer and didn't even suggest it as an idea. He said if anything its a 50/50 it might be crohns disease or a really bad infection that didn't get picked up in any stool samples. I get super scared when I have diarrhea or any mucus as I'm scared it might be cancer. I have terrible anxiety which I'm taking medication for.

A month or so later I had a very itchy rectum and what seemed to be the early signs of an anal abscess, again I was prescribed antibiotics and it left. Fast forward to now (6 months later) I don't have any visible blood, but on a couple of occasions I have noticed foul smelling mucus in an otherwise normal looking stool. I have regular patterns of how often and when I have a bowel movement. Sometimes my stools seem pretty loose but I wouldn't call it diarrhea., but generally my stools tend to vary over the course of weeks. I visited a gastroenterologist to follow up the anal itching and the scary symptoms which lasted 5 days, and he said I'm far too young for it to be colorectal cancer and didn't even suggest it as an idea. He said if anything its a 50/50 it might be crohns disease or a really bad infection that didn't get picked up in any stool samples. I get super scared when I have diarrhea or any mucus as I'm scared it might be cancer. I have terrible anxiety which I'm taking medication for. So I'm wondering, does this sound like colon cancer at all? 0 likes, 5 replies "

I haven't had a normal stool in about a month. Also noticing a yellowish liquid with mucus as well when having my bowels. I have had a colonoscopy done about 2 years ago for some stomach pains I was having , everything turned out clear. Not even a polyp. I have no clue what can be causing this, do I inquire about another colonoscopy? Or is that not necessary for the fact that I had one not to long ago. I tend to think the worst and my biggest fear is cancer 😕 I am a 23 year old male.  Otherwise known as pretty healthy never had anything hugely wrong with my health. But I definitely feel like somethings up and I hate that I don't know whats causing this. Any advice or similar experience for recommendations would be a great help. Thank You! 0 likes, 1 reply "

He sent me to a gastroenterologist. I went to see the gastro enterologist for the first time 3 weeks ago. he touched my belly and deduced that I had irritable bowels. He prescribed me antispasmodics and asked me to do an ultrasound scan. 1 week later, my symptoms still persisting, I went for the ultrasound scan. I was then found a fatty liver, but I had so much gas in my stomach that the doctor could not observe my intestines. I also had a blood test that revealed that everything was perfect with my blood and enzymes. In the meantime, I began to feel the desire to have a bowel movement almost all day long. i could go to the toilets 3 to 4 times a day with nothing getting out. One afternoon, during a stool, I noticed blood in my stools. so I went back to see my gastro enterologist with the results of my blood test and the ultrasound scan. He then examined my rectum with a digital rectal exam and had a rectoscopy on me. Thanks to the rectoscopy, he then found hemorrhoids inside my rectum and told me that it was why i had blood in my stool. he then told me that my pain was due to an irritable bowels syndrom. Finally he told me that it was not worth it, doing a colonoscopy because of my exam results and my age and he sent me back home.

I had an ab/pelvic CT scan and flex sigmoidoscopy but without fasting or bowel prep; results were mostly normal except the possible volvulus of the sigmoid colon that the flex scope ruled out. I have internal hemorrhoids though. My pain still comes and goes so my gastro doctor wants to rule out other problems with a full colonoscopy. My blood work shows no anemia and my upper quad abdominal ultrasound showed no serious problems except gallbladder polyps that they said are stable at 4mm greatest polyp. My liver bloodwork is okay. Pain is upper and lower right. I am still scared for colon cancer. Please let me know if your symptoms are similar. I am afraid it’s sinister as I have these issues for a long while.

I am having a small stripe of bright red blood coating on my last stool and bright red blood when wiping on toilet paper. My previous blood in stool or on toilet paper were three weeks ago and ten days ago. I used Prep H and increased fiber and laxative beno-fibers as well as increasing fluid intake and exercise/walk. It seemed to helped but now the hemorrhoids/piles issue returned and it’s only five days till my colonoscopy that I scheduled six weeks ago. Is it okay to go through with it in 5 days? Is it safe for me to have a colonoscopy when I have hemorrhoids issue now? The procedure is on August 15th. I know I will have to go through the prep so lots of explosive or diarrhea days before the colonoscopy. I have been straining and having irritation or anal pain prior to this week. I had soft stools and diarrhea for almost three weeks before this. I started the low residue or low fiber 5-7 days before the colonoscopy as advices and I am having issues with bowel movement, constipation and straining. I am planning to used Miralax for everyday now until the procedure. Do you have any suggestion for best cream to use before the day? What about specific diet or foods? I already bought white bread, white rice, apple and white grape juices, powerade drinks for electrolytes and other minerals. I am dreading the explosive days while having symptoms.

When I refer to ""pit of my stomach"" it feels as though it is between my rib cage, not too far up from my belly button. The pain is sharp and comes in waves and although I often feel gassy at the same time, it doesn't feel like regular gas pain. I would almost liken it to a shark knife cutting into one particular spot. It will sometimes last for a few hours, or sometimes go away once I've had some water, and sometimes comes out of the blue. I was chewing peppermint gum today which I thought may be the cause, is there any other foods that trigger similar symptoms in others? Or has anyone experiencing anything similar that may have another cause?  If it continues I will go and get tested, but for the time being just wondering what it could possibly be.

It included supplements such as Vitamin C, methyl folate, B 12, zinc, and 16 ounces of celery juice every morning.  I felt pretty good. Then about three weeks ago I added Maca root to my regimen. Within a week, I had stomach pains, bloating, gas, belching, watery diarrhea (and constipation in the same day),  bloating, gnawing feeling in the stomach, loss of appetite, delayed digestion, nausea, etc. I noticed I had started to lose weight. I stopped all supplements and went back to a regular diet. The nausea and  stomach pains subsided (though, I notice celery juice brings them back). My appetite came back. All of the other symptoms remain, but I am still rapidly losing weight. I am consuming 1800 calories a day. I have lost 8 pounds in the 3 weeks that I have been dealing with this.

Nearly five months ago, I woke up in the morning feeling 'off'. I assumed I was just getting sick...again....because before that morning, I was suffering from all sorts of health issues. I felt like I was constantly sick (with cold/flu like symptoms), I was dizzy at times, vomited randomly and had some heart burn. I went to the doctor a few times, he ran tests and nothing remarkable came back in the results. So shortly after I got up, I had to go back to sleep. I felt really foggy, dizzy and weak. I slept for most of the day and evening. At around 8pm, I got up to use the washroom. And nearly passed out  just trying to pee. When I stood up, I collapsed and things just got extremely scary from there. I could not get up from the floor, in fact I couldn't even speak, my hearing and sight went, my breathing was out of my control and extremely shallow. I was freezing cold and then I vomited about three units of blood (frank). I had the terrible feeling I wasn't going to survive. My husband wasn't home, I was alone...and there was no way I could have reached the phone to call 911.  Thankfully my husband came home shortly after with our kids, he found me when he opened the washroom door and found me. He called 911. When I got to the ER my hemoglobin was 72, I was given four units of blood. Which brought my hemoglobin up to 86. I was scoped two days later and they found a peptic duodenal ulcer. Which the GI specialist claimed was healing. I was sent home with iron supplements and proton pump blockers. Since then, my health has been a complete MESS. My hemoglobin has not come up over 104, my iron count is 8, my palettes are climbing with every blood test (weekly), so is my RBC, carbon dioxide and other things I can't remember right now. I've lost 70lbs since the bleed.  I struggle to do anything, walking around our apartment leaves me winded, my heart races and I usually have to brace myself or take a break, due to dizziness or fatigue. My mood is awful. My ulcer still hurts ALOT despite the proton pump blockers (which have been changed a few times to see if a change could help). I can sit down for five minutes or five hours, and every time when I stand....I'm dizzy. Sometimes more than others, ranging from feeling like I might faint to having to brace myself for a minute before continuing on. At times my sight goes blurry, for no reason and it doesn't only happen when I am dizzy. My ears/hearing is sometimes muffled. Like I'm wearing earplugs. My arms and my legs, are covered in bruises, which very few are from injuries. Most of them are from pressure, applied to that area. Like if I sit cross legged on the floor, my feet are badly bruised afterwards. I have two young kids, and I can't play with them, I can't even lay on the couch just it be around them...because my sleep pattern is completely reversed.  I do not smoke, drink, or do drugs. I am not on any meds except a Rx sleep aid. I have always tried to avoid meds (even pain meds) if I could. And I was tested for h. Pylori, a breath test, blood and stool. All were negative. I am beyond frustrated and while I love my family Dr and trust him. He doesn't seem to get how much and how negatively this is affecting myself and my entire family. He told me it should take about three months for my body to recover (my hemoglobin). Yet it's not, it has come up to 104. But then dropped back down to 99.  I have an appointment with him this Monday and I am terrified that, because my most recent level came up from 99 to 104. He is going to say, I am getting better. I know I am not. I am hoping someone might have some advice or suggestions.....because I can't keep going on like this. I am missing my kids growing up. And I just cannot understand how feeling this way for so long, is remotely ok or getting better.  I am also curious if anyone has had a second bleed, with an ulcer that previously bled? I'm terrified of having another severe bleed with my hemoglobin being so low.  Thanks for reading this novel!     1 like, 20 replies "

I went to the doctors and tested positive for helicobacter pylori. I have completed the 7 day treatment (Triple Therapy.) I was on 400mg Metronidazole 3 times a day, Amoxicillin 500mg 3 times a day and Omeprazole 2 times a day. I've been off the medication for about 11 days. I have waves of extreme tiredness, abit sickly feeling, sick upper abdominal feeling, tounge doesn't look right, been given thrush treatment for this. And also I have waves of soreness and swelling feeling in the upper stomach. I have lost a bit of weight, a few pounds. I have been off work for a month in total and am wondering if I will ever get my health back? I take probiotic tablets, Manuka honey, peppermint tea, abit of yoga, walking, plain foods. But admittedly at times I do feel a little bit destressed when I have waves of not feeling so good. Everyday is a battle at the moment. Plus when I go to the loo, last week my stools were acidic, this week a slight improvement, but not normal. The doctor just said they can retest in another 3 weeks. But sometimes I feel so ill.

I accepted but on reading the leaflet  and talking to others I had doubts.  One friend reported it was painful and invasive, another needed gas and air for the pain.   The leaflet said a very small number will need emergency treatment for bleeding after screening, but that most of these make a full recovery.  I rang the NHS helpline to ask what happens to those who don't,  and was told they might need a colostomy bag for the rest of their life.

I then went to a specialist who referred me for a flexible sigmoidoscopy. I had it in late november and there was no polyp but apparently I have an aphthoid proctitis. also, biopsies were taken and the results are normal except a small edema of Chorion (what is it?). So I guess it was the cause of the red blood in my stools and the mucous. HOwever, my gut is still gurgling (on left side mainly). I am so afraid that the diagnosis is not proctitis but a cancer as the flexible sigmoidoscopy didnt went through all my colon... I dont know what to do 0 likes, 3 replies "

I also have constant stomach growling sounds, whether I'm hungry or not. I'm having intermittent soft flat stools, very foul-smelling but it usually goes back to normal after 2-3 days. I have recurrent anal itching and pain that often gets worse when walking for a long distance. I first went to my GP 3 months ago, he performed a DRE which showed nothing except an ""anal congestion"" not sure if it means hemorrhoids or not... Anyway, my GP gave me some cream and stool softeners which indeed helped with the pain but not with the bleeding. The bleeding is typically bright red and seen on the toilet paper. For the past 3 months, I had bleeding 3-4 times. As the bleeding did not stop, I went back to my GP. He said there's no need to worry but in order to ease my mind, he referred me to a GI surgeon to check for hemorrhoids and give me treatment. Before going to the surgeon, he asked me to perform three FIT tests and blood tests. FIT tests came back negative and blood tests were perfect. So about a month ago I paid a visit to the GI and he did not perform any DRE. He performed a really quick thirty seconds anoscopy which, in his own words ""doesn't show much"". That's where I started to be really scared, I really thought that my condition was benign and it was strictly a hemorrhoids condition. I don't really understand, because the anoscopy was extremely painful on the left side of my anus and when the GI touched the left part it was ultra painful. Then going to toilets after the anoscopy, I have blood on TP without having a bowel movement. So, I really thought for a minute that he identified the bleeding source.

I also have constant stomach growling sounds, whether I'm hungry or not. I'm having intermittent soft flat stools, very foul-smelling but it usually goes back to normal after 2-3 days. I have recurrent anal itching and pain that often gets worse when walking for a long distance. I first went to my GP 3 months ago, he performed a DRE which showed nothing except an ""anal congestion"" not sure if it means hemorrhoids or not... Anyway, my GP gave me some cream and stool softeners which indeed helped with the pain but not with the bleeding. The bleeding is typically bright red and seen on the toilet paper. For the past 3 months, I had bleeding 3-4 times. As the bleeding did not stop, I went back to my GP. He said there's no need to worry but in order to ease my mind, he referred me to a GI surgeon to check for hemorrhoids and give me treatment. Before going to the surgeon, he asked me to perform three FIT tests and blood tests. FIT tests came back negative and blood tests were perfect. So about a month ago I paid a visit to the GI and he did not perform any DRE. He performed a really quick thirty seconds anoscopy which, in his own words ""doesn't show much"". That's where I started to be really scared, I really thought that my condition was benign and it was strictly a hemorrhoids condition. I don't really understand, because the anoscopy was extremely painful on the left side of my anus and when the GI touched the left part it was ultra painful. Then going to toilets after the anoscopy, I have blood on TP without having a bowel movement. So, I really thought for a minute that he identified the bleeding source. He said it wasn't so clear for him and I should come back if the bleeding comes back. But he wasn't really concerned as three FIT tests came back negative. I was so scared that I took a picture of my own anus (which I'm a bit ashamed of), but anyway, here's what it looks like: I mean, doesn't this looks like hemorrhoids to you ?

I was wandering if anyone had or has similar issues to me. I have never had these sort of problems. I'm 32. a year and a half ago I was having urgent bowel movements for months. I figured it was just food causing this until it got so bad I could hardly hold my bowel movements in If not near a toilet. I finally got tested and had a parasite called entomoeba hystolica. I took metronidazole and diloxanide furoate. the first Doctor did not prescribe the diloxanide so I had to start the treatment again. after I was given the all clear from the parasite I still have 7-8 bowel movements a day. watery stools. no blood no pain. but always felt this very small ache in lower left abdomen. went in for a endoscopy and colonscopy. I was told there was no chrons but biopsy came back that I had Lymphocytic Collitis. they said it was likely caused by the parasite. but also now my immune system is attacking my colon. I took entocort for 6 weeks. I had almost immediate relief after starting. once the entocort was finished I still had on and off issues with my stomach. took the entocort October 2018. it is now November 2019. between that time I started having alot of Indigestion and burping, but the burping was constant and uncomfortable. also slight nausea which was more annoying than anything. the gastro prescribed drugs to help with this but it never worked. months later (April this year) all my symptoms started to decrease till I eventually stopped complaining or worrying about stomach issues except the occasions when I would eat something abit rich or hard to digest. I started to learn what foods irriated me and now have a very basic diet. after months of issues and anxiety I decided to stop being scared to eat out (which is how I think I got the parasite) and start living again. had my first bought salad in over a year and that was the start of me being carefree. afew weeks later I had a week of diareah and that dull ache back in my lower left side. I went to the doctor and stooll test was fine. calprotectin was 26. the bowel problems were up and down for weeks. mainly I was okay. 2 months later it started again but lasted 2 weeks, lots of urgency to go to the bathroom and watery stools. went again for a stool test and the calprotectin was now 1000 which is extremely high. however only seem to have watery stool in morning than I manage to get through the day with no more bowel movements which is great, but concerned as to why my reading was so high in the first place. the gastro wants to do another colonscopy in next 2 weeks. I'm so nervous as to what they will find, or even worse what if they find nothing. I started taking a Probiotic called vsl3 which was recommended to me. it's very expensive but I swear it takes the edge of the bowel movements. i feel like I have lost the last 2 years of my life always worrying about this and waiting for the day i go back to having a normal stomach. I've stopped dating and everything as this is so embarrassing. anyway sorry this is so long, trying to fit 2 years of problems into one message. I look forward to hearing if anyone has experienced similar problems and frustrations. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I've had numerous trips to the Docs and have tried everything from Anusol, strong prescribed version of Anusol, Fibrogel, something that numbs the inside, rectogesic ointment and now Glycerol suppository & Movicol. The Doc sent me to see a bowel surgeon who sent me for a CT scan which diagnosed a dilated rectum. As I was getting pain he did a Colonoscopy which came back clear. After a few more trips to Docs I was referred back to surgeon who diagnosed a fissure but said it was healing up so should be OK and put me on Movicol. After 4 days on Movicol I was going 4-5 times a day and stopped taking it. From using the rectogesic ointment I noticed as I applied it with my finger that I could feel poo in my rectum which I think is the cause of my pain and discomfort. I go regularly and seem to do enough but within an hour I can feel irritation from more poo sat in my rectum. This is my main cause of concern and feel that if I could rectify this then all would be good. Any advice welcome Regards Tom 0 likes, 4 replies "

I also feel hot and clammy all the time, feel bloated and gassy - and sometimes I can't go to the toilet at all. My stools are normally runny, or ribbon-like and i feel really fatigued all the time. Recently, my back has started aching and I have pelvic pain, too. After about six weeks, I went to see my GP, who sent me for an ultrasound, stool sample and blood tests - all came back normal. I had an ultrasound of my abdomen to check for gallstones and this came back negative as well. I had an x-ray of my abdomen and the doctor said there was a buildup of feces in my upper colon, so I was prescribed some laxido. I took this as per the directions and changed my diet, but I'm still not able to evacuate my bowels fully. I think I am just starting to get a bit worried, because I feel if it was a hard stool that had become stuck, hopefully the laxido and dietary changes would be enough to fix this. I'm female and 25 and this has come put of nowhere; prior to this I have never struggled with constipation. I exercise regularly and am otherwise healthy. I do struggle with depression and I have recently changed job and moved (though this was after my symptoms started), so I wonder if this has triggered it. I saw my GP last week and they booked me for another x-ray of my abdomen, which will take a couple of weeks to come through. I have another appointment This Friday and I'm not sure whether to ask for a colonoscopy to rule out anything serious. Thanks so much for your help 0 likes, 0 replies "

For more backround, about two years ago i began having diarrhea which very quickly became severe and i began vomiting constantly aswell. Had a colonoscopy and endoscopy, barium swallow, gastric emptying test, no one could figure out what it was and quite frankly didnt seem to care all that much. It got to the point i was on my death bed and didnt recover until a long hospital stay.  About a year ago i started vomiting large amounts of bile at random times and whenever i drank water on an empty stomach. Of course, recently, when id finally gotten to my healthiest, i suddenly had a day-long illness which i originally presumed to be a bug. Now i dont even know what it couldve been because my symptoms have been prolonged (its been a month). My only intestinal symptom was diarrhea, which was strangely odorless and was basically just bile by mid-day. I woke up in the middle of the night to vomit once, and it was just bile. I slowly recovered within a week, just for it to almost return by the weekend. I was so frantic about it that i used what i knew could slow down my intestinal motility. Ever since, it's been a back and forth fight and im damn sick of it. To get back to the topic, my stool is whats been concerning me. When i wipe, theres always bile leftover with the stool. The stool itself is like healthy brown but really orange tinted. Occasionally, there are tiny black specks in it. I do not eat anything that could cause the appearance to look like this so please dont ask. Originally, i tried probiotics, which helped enough to the point that it went back to a normal color, but that was only temporary. Every other day i have to take 1-2 imodiums to slow things down before the diarrhea starts again, which also seems to color the stool relatively back to normal. However, im afraid im already starting to become tolerant of the imodium and it will eventually stop working. Ive gathered some research from actual real people, and its suggested i could have a gallbladder blockage, bile malabsorption, problems with my bile salts, and/or gi bleeding (which is probably much less likely), etc. My mother and every immediate family member on my father's side has needed to have their gallbladder removed for some reason. I have so many other health problems that have arised in just a few years so i dont want to have to live with this. I dont want to have to focus on this all the time like its made me have to do, because gastrointestinal issues are what effect me the worst emotionally. It wouldnt seem like much to you and likely even less to doctors, but im very young and illness has taken up so much of my life already. 0 likes, 3 replies "

Of course, recently, when id finally gotten to my healthiest, i suddenly had a day-long illness which i originally presumed to be a bug. Now i dont even know what it couldve been because my symptoms have been prolonged (its been a month). My only intestinal symptom was diarrhea, which was strangely odorless and was basically just bile by mid-day. I woke up in the middle of the night to vomit once, and it was just bile. I slowly recovered within a week, just for it to almost return by the weekend. I was so frantic about it that i used what i knew could slow down my intestinal motility. Ever since, it's been a back and forth fight and im damn sick of it. To get back to the topic, my stool is whats been concerning me. When i wipe, theres always bile leftover with the stool. The stool itself is like healthy brown but really orange tinted. Occasionally, there are tiny black specks in it. I do not eat anything that could cause the appearance to look like this so please dont ask. Originally, i tried probiotics, which helped enough to the point that it went back to a normal color, but that was only temporary. Every other day i have to take 1-2 imodiums to slow things down before the diarrhea starts again, which also seems to color the stool relatively back to normal. However, im afraid im already starting to become tolerant of the imodium and it will eventually stop working. Ive gathered some research from actual real people, and its suggested i could have a gallbladder blockage, bile malabsorption, problems with my bile salts, and/or gi bleeding (which is probably much less likely), etc. My mother and every immediate family member on my father's side has needed to have their gallbladder removed for some reason. I have so many other health problems that have arised in just a few years so i dont want to have to live with this. I dont want to have to focus on this all the time like its made me have to do, because gastrointestinal issues are what effect me the worst emotionally. It wouldnt seem like much to you and likely even less to doctors, but im very young and illness has taken up so much of my life already. 0 likes, 3 replies "

Just wondered if anyone has experienced anything similar? With regards to the feeling in the ribs at no point has it been massively painful to the point where I have needed to take any pain killers or anything like that. It just feels more uncomfortable than anything else rather than painful as if there is something under my ribs that should be there. The lower left ribs feel bruised to touch but again not that painful. I play football and go to the gym and have been able to continue both without any trouble or issues. With regards to my bowels they have just been a bit all over the place since it started really. At first I kind of felt constipated and was having bowel movements but size and quantity wise there wasn't as much coming out as normal or as expected and had a feeling of not fully emptying. In the last month that has changed slightly in that I have had a couple of what I would call regular sized and quantity movements but they seem to happen every 3 or 4 days and in between the movements are the fairly small quantities mentioned and usually very irregular shapes and sizes although the feeling of not emptying seems to have gone or reduced. I have been to see my GP 3 or four times since this started. First couple of times they had a feel around and couldn't feel anything untoward and suggested it was just a bit of constipation so suggest some over the counter laxitives and then when that didnt work prescribed some Laxido sachets which again didnt do anything really. I have now had a blood test and an chest xray that I am awaiting the results of and have an ultrasound booked in but that isn't for another 3 weeks. In the meantime I just really suffering a bit mentally not knowing what this is and obviously worrying this could be something serious. Just keep searching and searching online and must have diagnosed myself with about 25 different things which I know is silly but can't help it. I am someone that never usually gets ill so this is very out of the ordinary for me. I am only 32 and lead a pretty active lifestyle, eat well, don't smoke and don't drink too much, weight and BMI is all in the decent range - all things which my GP keeps telling me means that it being something serious is unlikely but at the same time it doesn't show any sign of easing up. Not had any diarrhea at all in the 3 months although stools have been pretty soft the whole time even when not much is coming out. Not had any blood in my stools that I have been able to notice. Its just so frustrating as for 3 months whilst I have been able to go to work etc I just feel like I am constantly at about 70%. I feel ok physically but not great and mentally I just feel shot to pieces. Obviously I need to wait for my results and take from there but just seems such a drawn out affair to try and convince GP that something just doesn't feel right and just wondered if anyone had suffered anything similar to this? 6 likes, 370 replies "

I haven't changed my normal diet any, I have not started any new medications.  My stools are very stinky, and almost shinny. Every now and again I get some pain in my upper abdomen but nothing big. Any ideas? I do not wanna go to the Urgent care just to be told its the Stomach flu. I have no other symptoms. No  , no nausea, just the slight pain in my upper abdomen that is not all the time.

After a lot of research, i finally ended up with this routine and for me it works so hopefully this may help someone else. I use hot compresses and then wipe and massage my eyes with blephagel (much more gentle than blephasol) every other day,  and after i have washed my face with just any face wash at night, i use Lush Ultrabland... it is amazing. A little odd at first because it feels like youre spreading butter on your skin it is so thick and oily, but it has honestly done wonders for both my eye health and my complexion! I use a cotton pad and get a generous amount on it, swipe it over my lid and ensure it coats everything like my waterline and eyelashes etc, then get a clean flannel/cloth, hold it under hot water until wet and heated, then gently dab it on my skin until the ultrabland is removed. My eyes have been clear for 17 months, i get the occasional stye due to my dry eyes but this generally goes away quickly i just use a heated compress day and night for around 3 days straight and clean them after with the same products i normally use. As for the eye eczema, after lots of use of antibiotics, creams and ointments, i was eventually prescribed Protopic Gel. I have honestly not had an issue since the first application, it was unbearable, the first use is so uncomfortable they warn you it will feel like an allergic reaction, i thought about taking it off but i perservered and within 24 hours my eczema had gone right down to minimum, used it for a few days with no symptoms and i have not had to apply it since! Well worth asking to try. I hope this helps. Jade 0 likes, 1 reply "

The only thing that seems to bother me is the noticeable redness/swelling under my eyes. What I have actually noticed about my eyes is a long the line where the tear ducts are they seem um i dont know how to describe maybe like waxy? I seem to produce a lot mucus in the corners of my eyes after hours which is like a stringy clear consistency as oppose to dry. Is this signs of MGD? Could this be a result of whats causing my under eyes to look sore and red? Because sometimes when i wash my under eyes with lukewarm water they look slightly better than what they looked like when they looked somewhat oily, however this lasts for about 4-5 hours before they go back to oily/sore looking again. I am wondering if anyone has has a similar problem and what i could do to tackle this? Is there anything without using concealer (which i have not done yet by the way) that people have had success to eliminate the swelling under eyes? Thank you 0 likes, 0 replies "

Affected my universal credit ,"I'll make this as easy as possible. Been off work for over 12 months due to   and   and having a breakdown. I claim universal credit and receive lcwra element and housing benefit. Finally ceased employment August 19 after my ssp had fully exhausted. Received final pay from employer which was £0 as they said they had overpayed me and that I owed them. Went through ACAS conciliation and had a tribunal claim which was due to court in February 2020. Employer settled out of court and admitted they was wrong and I we agreed on a sum of £2200. They paid the tax on it and it was directly paid to my account on the 4th march 2020. I also received my full universal credit award on the 10th that month. I have today looked to see if my payment is available for April and it is showing as £0 due to a reported earnings by my employer of £2200. Yes I did receive £2200 which was a compensation /settlement payout and I was under the full impression that this was my money to do as I wish as it was a payout not an actual wage.  The money has all been spent on various things and I was expecting my normal pay this month to continue but as I've explained above it has been reduced to zero pounds because of my payout. Can anyone help or has anyone been in this situation and what was their outcome. I didn't realise the dwp could do this and I'm hoping it maybe a problem with their system where it sees an amount of money as a wage whether it's compensation or not.  I'm really stressed as I have my 13 year old son up for easter and with all this covid19 situation too it is making feel really ill plus seeing my payment today is really not helping my mental health.

I have recently been prescribed Diltiazem XR, 130 mg to treat tachycardia and panic attacks. I have been taking the medication for one month as of today. I was prescribed the medication after a two day hospital stay, during which a twenty-four hour urine test was taken, results normal, and several blood panels were drawn, the results of which were normal except for mild anemia (something that's been fairly persistent for several years), and slightly raised thyroid level, an 8 I believe. I have also been previously diagnosed with GERD, tachycardia and probable IBS-C.  The side effects I noticed immediately after staring the diltiazem were constipation, though that's also the nature of my IBS, and cough, though I often struggle with cough due to GERD. I am managing both of those. Otherwise I've done very well on the medication. However, last week I noticed swelling and tenderness on my neck beneath my jaw, between the jaw bone and submandibular gland, which has also been swollen. It went away and now has returned again. It is less swollen in the mornings before I take the diltiazem, and seems to grow more swollen and tender as the day goes on. I was quite concerned about this but read that one of the common side effects can be swelling and tenderness in the neck. However, now I've found lymph nodes in my armpits as well that seem slightly swollen and it's freaking me out a bit. The information I read only mentioned swelling int he neck. Three months ago my GD checked my lymph nodes during a routine exam, no swelling. I saw her again two weeks ago as a follow up and hadn't noticed any swelling then either. I have a cardiologist followup in two weeks, and was going to mention the swelling at that time if it doesn't resolve itself first. However, I have to admit that after finding the nodes in my armpits, I'm a little freaked out about it and am nervous about waiting in case its something much more serious. I don't have any other symptoms to suggest I've got a cold or other infection, and I'm wondering if anyone else who takes diltiazem has experienced  generalized lymphadenopathy as a side effect?

Only other explaination is that I am getting much better sleep now that I no longer have to go to work, a regular eight hours and at the same time rather than the shifts I used to do. The other thing, could it be depression?, I have always lived alone but now that I no longer see people at work, my life is almost complete isolation, but yesterday for instance, I saw a friend I havnt seen for a few years, but my brain still stayed very dull indeed. 1 like, 18 replies "

I'm a 32 year old black female with high bp which I take lisinopril/hctz for. Well in January I started feeling anxious so my doctor gave me buspirone. Well I took it starting around May because really I was hesitant about taking it, but it made me loopy/dizzy like and I had palpitations so strong I ended up going to another doctor who put me on atenolol 25mg for 10 days and told me to stop the buspirone.  So I stopped taking the buspirone immediately and stopped the atenolol Monday and it's Wednesday and please believe me when I say I have never felt this way in all my life. Like when I walk I feel like I might just faint. And even sitting down I feel so weird. I can't even explain it. I'm jittery and when I ate I felt a little nauseous.

I found hope and strength from so many. I am a bisoprolol user of 5 years. 2.5mg given to me for ectopic beats by cardiac consultant who was reviewing me after a hospital admission with query panic attack/heart attack. Tests revealed nothing other than ectopics. I told her at the time i had a low heart rate anyway but she persisted. When i arrived at A and E having anxiety the first thing they had done was give me GTN which stopped my heart completely!! Reduced my already low heart rate to zero. So i have taken these for five years during which time anxiety has persisted although ectopics were not felt as they had been. I eventually realised the trigger for my anxiety attacks was a very low heart rate below 40 which was sending my body and system into a meltdown. So i decided to wean myself off. Firstly i cut the pill in half for 30 days. No effect in first week or so then i became very fatigued and exhausted. Chest pains accompanied by high blood pressure and high heart rate when doing anything. Very intense emotional moments overwhelming me. Feelings of fear and panic. Trembling was also evident. I relied heavily on CBD oil and just OTC painkillers at this point to help which they really did. I also took vitamin c d and a b complex daily and manuka honey. I also made a carrot and banana smoothie with spirulina daily.  Rest is essential and a belief that you have to maintain that things will get better. I persisted with walking around the house and just trying to do anything no matter how small just to stay a little active although fatigue would follow quickly. At twenty five days or so i could feel that there was some relief and the bad days receded slightly. I reduced the dose further at thirty days and took a quarter off the half tablet. After two days i had a couple of really bad days where all the bad effects returned with vengeance. Then a couple of good days where i really started to feel some strength return. At thirty days i also started supplementing with L Carnitine and CQ10 and am still doing so. This good days bad days pattern has become the norm and now i am at day 57. Still have unpleasant combinations of effects on bad days but they are getting less and that is a fact. I have been able to reintroduce walking outside into my days now and other day to day activities and do feel stronger. However i have to be careful with not pushing too far too quick as i have had issues after doing this. I have found that eating smaller meals helps. Avoiding any high sodium intake helps. Water certainly helps so stay hydrated. I have learned to give in to the fatigue when it comes so just accept you have to rest. It will improve eventually. I am still taking just over a quarter of my tablet but am gently weaning off this and plan to do so over the next six months. I can say i feel much improved since doing this and even though i still have these withdrawal symptoms they are nowhere near as bad as i felt when i was on the full dose.

After when was no psychological need in medication the doctor agreed to help me to quite respidral starting from January 2018. I used to take 2mg dose daily in the evening. The doctor suggested me to use 1mg, and in first 24 hours I had a strong headache and numbs in my right hand. On the second day of reducing pill from 2mg to 1mg I started felling my right hand is heavy. I  continued to use the only  1mg of respidral for almost 4 months and after 4 months I drooped dose from 1mg to 0.5mg. I started to feel that all my right body side is heavy, the skin was sensitive (i started to get large bruises and marks, feel uncomfortable from touch or anything pressing). After one more month, I quite respirdal fully and I experienced very sensitive skin and pain from any touch and press, even if I am just sitting, driving I had pain from chair pressing my legs. Also, I got a feeling of my eyes and tongue burning, muscle stiffness. This remained for 2 months. I have visited few neurology doctors and they did not have any solution. In September 2018 I told about my symptoms to my psychiatric. He suggested starting using respirdal again. From the first pill in less than 12 hours I start feeling 95% normal and all of the above symptoms were gone except little pain in shoulder and heavy right hand. The doctor thought it is depression pain and he gave me pill  Cyprilix. I did not get well and my doctor gave me Cymbalta and I started feeling pain in different areas like legs front and back, shoulder, eyes, and back. Mean I dropped to be only 60-70% normal feeling of the body. I visited few doctors and they are not aware of the right treatment and they informed that they have never heard about such side effects of respidral. I would like to know if any of any patient using respidral reported such cases and what is the correct treatment. Thank you. 0 likes, 1 reply "

My psychiatrist suggested that I increase my SSRI to the maximum dose and I did that. Again, within a couple of weeks, I felt an instant improvement and it felt like I was alive again. With time, medical school continued to be a constant and increasing source of stress, while my personal circumstances weren't great either. My next consultation with my psychiatrist led me to cross taper my SSRI with a newer medication, the SNRI class. And again, within a couple of weeks, life was back on track. I pushed myself to achieve my personal and professional goals but I started to notice a pattern to my mental health illness. It seemed as though my body would require a constant modification of treatment. During this phase, I accomplished certain personal and professional goals and I came to the UK to practice medicine and with an aim to specialise in psychiatry. I came here with a prescription of my SNRI which I was to continue due to my predisposition to relapsing/recurrent depressive episodes while away from my family. However, the SNRI failed to help me as within a week of starting work in the UK, I relapsed in to severe depression.

My educational supervisor signposted me to register with my GP, my GP immediately ran a thorough work-up of my physical health profile and signposted me to occupational health services with my employer (NHS). I received amazing support from occupational health at Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust where I utilised Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (6 sessions did the trick for me). In the meantime, while I struggled to balance my personal and professional life, my GP referred me to Tertiary Care Services for specialist opinion. I then voluntarily started my treatment with tertiary care services where I had a re-assessment of my underlying diagnosis. It was here that I was made aware that I may be a victim of Bipolar Disorder and possibly not a depressive disorder. I had full faith in my care team and with the insight of my consultant, was started on treatment for Bipolar Disorder. As I write my story, I am currently admitted as a patient under the Section 3 of the Mental Health Act (UK), I continue to follow the care plan established by my consultant and I am delighted to say that my mental health diagnosis has been established to be Bipolar Disorder. I am currently in remission, thanks to the vision of my entire care team and my own insight as a junior doctor. I would like to end by saying that my struggle with mental health continues and continue my pursuit of treatment.

I'm on Seroquel but I recently had the idea that I should button myself up so to speak, that is not allow myself to become enthusiastic or excited even in a good way around people.  But turning myself into a stick in the mud doesnt seem the answer even if I could achieve that. I enjoy expressing myself but I'm afraid of my natural spontaneity since it seems like it's a highway to bipolar acting out.  The other day I was at a huge luncheon and felt bipolar immediately upon sitting down.  I was very uncomfortable with my location and bored and needed to change my seat to sit with people I liked to be around more.  But the degree of discomfort I felt seemed about ten times more than a normal person would feel.  And I was anxious for myself because of how I was feeling, thinking that these bipolar symptoms were never going to go away, and feeling inferior to just about everybody else there who wasnt squirming in their seat the way I was. 1 like, 4 replies "

I guess this is a half question/half story. But I'm concerned about my spouse's mental health and I'm not sure what to do. At this point, he refuses to seek professional help. He has a family history of bipolar but has not been diagnosed. I know that posting here is not a substitute for seeking mental health care, but I'm really trying to make sense of this since I, unfortunately, can't make him get help. I guess I'm wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar? I just feel so lost and am in so much pain. I love him so much and just want to make things better for everyone. I feel like I'm living in a nightmare... I've been separated from my husband for two months now (together for 13 years, married for five). He began a new, high-stress job at the end of September and around the same time, his grandmother (who basically raised him while his mother worked) became very ill. It's at this time that I noticed a personality change in him. Fast forward to the beginning of November--we had a fight--I'm still not sure about what--that ended in him wanting a divorce. I was totally blindsided. We were having intimacy issues (I chalked that up to stress and both of us being tired from our workdays), but otherwise, we had a good marriage. Spent lots of time together, talked all the time, ate dinner together every night, went on trips together, he took me out of town for my birthday a few days before our fight, wrote ""I love you!"" on my birthday card, etc. During this fight he told me that he never loved me, always knew our marriage would fail, and only did nice things for me to convince himself that he loved me. Since our separation--which was entirely his choice--he's essentially been gaslighting me, according to my therapist. Basically making me feel like I'm an abusive monster who doesn't deserve love or sex. I've also caught him in lies (e.g. he told me that our marriage counselor told him that his and my relationship is the ""most (explicit-ed) up she's ever seen."" Turns out she said nothing of the sort and was horrified that he'd tell me that). There's much more, but hopefully, that provides some context. I truly don't know where this is coming from. I'm definitely not perfect, but therapy has taught me not to buy into his perception of me. I'm very concerned about his mental health. This is not the kind, supportive, fantastic man I married. I feel like he's an entirely different person. Not only do I feel this way, but his family, my family, and our friends feel this way, too. It's like everyone else sees there's something wrong except for him. His family has been trying to get him to see a mental health professional, but he's very reluctant. Currently, he refuses to see me because ""our situation is difficult,"" I'm ""so much a part of his pain,"" he's ""doing everything he can to keep it together,"" etc. He also refuses to talk about our situation with me in any capacity, which really hurts me. All of this really hurts me. Some more possibly relevant points: he's mentioned hallucinating before; stated that he's ""losing his mind""; thinks he knows everything about everything but simultaneously admits to having ""inadequacy issues""; is rather condescending; has difficulty concentrating and moves from ""project to project"" without completing anything; stated that he feels like he's ""moving underwater,"" and has mentioned being both incredibly anxious and depressed.

I was prescribed the medication after suffering with chest pains and palptations along with a high heart rate, i went to the hospital and had an ECG which came back all clear and then had an chest x-ray which again came back all clear, a long with blood tests that were all clear. My GP then placed me in diazepam as they thought it was down to anxiety, however that did not work i was still suffering from a high heart rate so they then placed me on bisprolol to 'treat the symptoms'. I have now been off the tablets for around 2 weeks,  the first few days i felt fine i was really happy i was having no side effects, however a week being off them i began to feel really shaky and weak, i also tried doing some things i used to do so tried going back to the gym but i would come home and my rate would not settle past 120bpm as i assumed id be able to go back to doing normal things being off them.

Wary of it, he has been taking half the dose every day for about a month. Since starting it, he has been in bed about 12-16 hours a day, has insomnia, a sensation of coldness in the body, painful arm muscles, hunger in the middle of the night and the feeling of general exhaustion. We have been reading the posts in this forum of many others who have had similar experiences. Although all of these symptoms presented precisely when he began the Bisoprolol, two different  cardiologists told him they were lack of anima and sent him to the psychologist. He was on Ramapril before the Biso but it lowered his blood pressure too much, as did other heart protectors. Does anyone know of a substitute for Bisoprolol, something hopefully without the debilitating side effects and without lowering the blood pressure? Thank you. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I was fine for the first few weeks, but then I started to develop aches and pains all over and found yoga and pilates increasingly difficult. The aches and pains, particularly in my legs, just got worse and worse. Ten days ago, I went to my GP, who advised me to give the Bisoprolol a rest and see how I get on. I stopped taking the medication (but continued with anticoagulant) - and the almost immediate effect was a threefold increase in intensity of my aches and pains! All movement is a struggle, particularly walking up and down stairs,  bending or squatting, sitting down and getting up. From an active , flexible, mobile woman, I now  feel disabled and depressed! I make sure I stay as active as possible and I walk everyday - but at the slowest pace! It is early days since I stopped taking Bisoprolol (10 days and counting) but I'm worried that these horrible symptoms will never go away! Anyone out there experiencing same or similar? Any idea how long these symptoms may go on for? 0 likes, 32 replies "

I also have large under-eye bags.  Now I'm told to do the hot eye-mask treatment 10 minutes every day, followed by massage, followed by - at the moment steroid eye drops, antibiotic eye drops and moisturising eye drops.  In the past I have always used an ice cold eye mask to try and reduce the eye bags, but now that I'm using a hot one every day, I see that my eye bags are swelling up.  To moisturise my skin in the eye area I use La Roche Posay eye cream.  I've been reading up about Butterflies Eyecare make-up, which seems to be suitable for sensitive blepharitis eyes.

I also have large under-eye bags.  Now I'm told to do the hot eye-mask treatment 10 minutes every day, followed by massage, followed by - at the moment steroid eye drops, antibiotic eye drops and moisturising eye drops.  In the past I have always used an ice cold eye mask to try and reduce the eye bags, but now that I'm using a hot one every day, I see that my eye bags are swelling up.  To moisturise my skin in the eye area I use La Roche Posay eye cream.  I've been reading up about Butterflies Eyecare make-up, which seems to be suitable for sensitive blepharitis eyes.  Just wondering, if anyone has been on similar treatment and what they do re eye bags and make-up?  Am just feeling rather self-conscious... GP just tells me bags are part of the aging process... 0 likes, 6 replies "

This is how I prepare and use the method told to me by my retired doctor: Add freshly boiled water to a bowl, place a hanky size cloth into the water, (I used a new thin face cloth that my wife uses for make-up) leave a corner of the cloth out over the edge of the bowl. Using a small wooden spoon in one hand pick up the cloth by the dry exposed corner and wrap it round the spoon, twirling the spoon so as to gather the whole cloth around the spoon. Over the sink hold the spoon slightly tilted upwards handle down, lean over the spoon with eyes closed and move your head so that you can feel the steam rising from the cloth onto your closed eye, slightly moving your head side to side so the steam covers the whole eye lid area. After around 10-15 seconds the steam will lesson as the cloth cools down. I then hold a corner of the cloth and un twirl it from the spoon, then getting another corner of the cloth in my free hand I shake the cloth open to cool it a little so that I can then squeeze out the water and use the warm cloth to gently rub the eye lids. Replace the cloth in the bowl and repeat the process for the other eye. Repeat again for both eyes. By this time the water will have cooled to the point that there is no steam left although you can continue bathing the eye with the warm squeezed out cloth if you feel it necessary. I started one evening and repeated it in the morning for the first and second day, now I just do it at night and my eyes feel the best they have for a long time and no wipes or drops!

I have recently started using the UK wet ones  which seem to have improved things. I read here that the US ones are better. Is this in terms of comfort or effectiveness as I have had no adverse affects? Also how should one apply the wipes. Should you scrub the lid margin like you would with a q tip or should you just close the eyes, wipe the lids and let dry before opening? I would appreciate any advice? 0 likes, 3 replies "

The lower lash line also red I looked tired and as if I’d been crying all the time . I thought I was just tired then I noticed my eyelids and inner eye corners itching like hell. I was always rubbing my eyes. This horrible feeling always there led to to my eyes actually feeling dirty and itchy and my sight seemed blurry and the foreign body sensation was so horrible, and it was all the time. My eyes just randomly went red and then pink and then red but never back to a nice white eyeball. I finally reached my wits end by then I was fed up depressed and walking around with a really angry red eye that was not getting better. I went to the doctor and she sent me home with allergy eyedrops. No improvement went back came home with steroid drops used them for two weeks ....no improvement. By this time I had red small puffy swollen eyes and I was finding my self looking at them throughout the day. Almost obsessed it’s all I could think about so back I went this time to eye a&e. Six hours later I’m told I should never have been taking steroid drops and that I had Blepharitis and mgd. Prescribed dry eye drops and warm compresses and lid hygiene ie. baby shampoo !! Told I had it for life and I was devasted.  Was I really meant to deal with what they called a minor condition for life , surely they couldn’t be so casual about this, it’s a condition that affects your life so much. Refused to accept it but started with the programme they had advised. The warm compress made it worse eyes more puffy and pink. The eye drops only helped for a short time. I felt sick everytime I looked in a mirror and I looked in the mirror a lot , a vicious circle of discomfort and worry. Then I Was visiting my mum one day and was whinging about my eyes she also had noticed the state of them.  She went to the cupboard and pulled out just a jar Of standard normal honey. She said I’m going to put this on your eyes and it’s going to sting for about 5 minutes. I refused I said are you crazy things are bad enough as it is. Even the odd eye lash had started to come out nowadays.  She scolded me she said back in the days in India they didn’t go to doctors or buy expensive drops and scrubs they just whacked some honey in thier eyes. I did know my mum does this and my dad and have been for years and years for just general eye health. So I thought what the hell let’s just do it. She took a metal eye liner stick (you get them in Indian kajol bottles ) she disinfected it took a spoon of honey out of the jar doused the metal thing in it and then she swiped across my lower lash line as if applying kajol and then swiped some across the eye lid too and then she practically massaged it all over my eyes.  The stinging and burning was horrendous, oh my days it was so uncomfortable I couldn’t open my eyes they were watering so much. When I could open them for a second I had a hand mirror in front of me and all I could see was pink eyes. I remember screaming mum what have you done. I can’t see there going red ! She laughed and said stay like that for 15 minutes then go wash them with a clean flannel one for each eye.  15 minutes later I washed my eyes and omg the relief it immediately felt better , and no pink eyes. And most amazingly of all my eyes looked like glass and felt so good and omg my vision felt so clear..... it felt like a new lease of life. I carrried on and to this day I still do it once a week. My eyes are white clear and shiny my lashes are think and back to how they used to be. I have no problems now. I wear eye make up all the time but I make sure my eyes are clean and everything is off properly before bedtime. I don’t use my dry eye drops anymore I don’t need them I cancelled my repeat prescription from the doctors.  My mum also gave me some kind of other thing to wash my eyes with apparently they use in India for inflamed eyes I have to chop a bit of it off mix it in water and let it foam up then I wash my eyelids with it rinse off and done I do that about twice a week.   All I can say is I know how hard this situation is I know first hand how it affects you menatally and pysically. And if anyone’s was worse than mine then I don’t even want to think how you manage. I just want people who have Blepharitis to just please try honey , seriously , it’s an ancient old remedy used in India. And stick with it it stings it burns but once that subsides the relief is just so amazing. Thanks mum I always turn my nose up at your herbal remedies but mums know what they’re talking about !  Please try honey ! And all of those suffering from Blepharitis...don’t give up don’t let it get you down , do something about it that’s not text book advice from just the doctors.

In the morning, on a daily basis, I take four Q-Tips (this gives me eight passes over my eyes) and get them wet in the distilled water. Then I pass them with a slight pressure over the eyelids, between the eyelids where they touch when closed, at the corner of the eyelids, and all surfaces of the exterior eyelid.  I believe that I am cleaning away the bacteria that normally would invade my eyes and cause burning, watery/ , gritty feeling, etc. There are many ways that one might ""clean"" their eyes, but I have found that this works for me.  I don't need any other medication or treatment. Maybe you have the same sort of blepharitis that I have and maybe this simple method will work for you.  All the best of luck in dealing with this very troublesome affliction.  Thanks.  Duke   1 like, 9 replies "

Initial State:- Eye irritation/soreness/dryness including corneal ulcers, etc which I have had for over 2 months continually. Requiring washing approx 3-4 times daily with warm water, baby shampoo, eye drops etc.. When starting with the Wet Ones, I initially felt slight stinging around the rim of the eye, but this stopped after 24 hrs use. After 3 days:- A lot of relief, maybe rinse eyes with just warm water if they felt dry. After 7 days:- I have forgotten that I have blephoritus. Have to remind myself to clean eyes with Wet Ones.  I will continue to use the wet ones, now cutting down to 3x daily as recommended by Lynda79, and will update again next week. Hope this helps somebody, and many thanks to Lynda79 for sharing this.

Food poisoning type symptoms multiple times (sometimes found salmonella, but wasn't checked every time as I got older), I was hospitalized for that once when I was young.  About 25 years ago, I had what I'm very sure was Bornholm disease, multiple tests, barium/xray/colonoscopy, they never found anything.  It lasted several months and recurred, and I never found anything out about that.  The description of that matches, I almost passed out multiple times, almost, but close, things got dark plus major, major pain, left of belly button.  Gallbladder removed 20 years ago. Current, blood pressure is a hair high, not too high (under 140 top at the dr.  usually under 120 at home though, or close).  Blood tests normal.  I have chronic fatigue, very tired, sometimes it can hit me while I'm doing something and I can't hardly keep my eyes open.  I wake up and feel like I need a nap, after sleeping all night.  I can sleep during the day, yawn a lot.  There is a sleep test ordered, take home test, he wouldn't do an overnight full test. Since I was about 12 or so, I have noticed occasionally my heart skipping around, a few seconds.  Sometimes once a day, sometimes less, sometimes don't notice it for a long time.  I've mentioned that countless times to doctors, they listen to it a while and say it's fine.  I asked if I could have a test, he said if there were no additional symptoms like swelling, ""no"".  I was wondering if I had some issues caused by the coxsackie. Pain in my hands and feet.  They found arthritis, might be that, almost 20 years, more than a little.  It started left foot, right foot, then both hands over a couple months progression, they feel the same, the fall after my gall bladder was out (in Feb.). Checked my neck to see if nerve related, arthritis in the neck too.  Just checked one hand, didn't check feet.  Random thought, I was born with hammer toes too (if there's something related to that). Any thoughts?  Losing my good insurance this year, won't be able to get sick next year (can't get a subsidy, they go by gross income not net, high deductibles).  I've changed doctors a few times through the years.  I mention fatigue, they say depression, except it's NOT in my head.  They had me on meds for depression over 25 years ago, it did absolutely nothing for the fatigue, in fact the pills made things MUCH worse (they kept changing brands and doses), pretty sure I didn't get along with them. I'm not on any meds of any kind (nothing illegal either), don't drink at all, no tobacco, never did.

A year ago, I was diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. However, I’m looking for answers on what caused me to develop this chronic condition. After some research, I discovered that for a large portion of my life I’ve had a high RBC. According to the test results, out of 13 CBCs, 8 of them have shown a high red blood count (61% of the time). If anyone could provide information on what could be causing this I would greatly appreciate it.

I have suffered with mild depression before  but never anxiety and this has completely knocked me off my feet. I am normally a strong and happy go lucky type of person and i don't recognize myself anymore. i have seen my GP and had blood tests to rule out any underlying medical symptoms and my results have come back and said my potassium levels are high, does any one have experience or knowledge with high potassium and anxiety? i am just trying to get a hold of what this is and i know perhaps i am just suffering with an anxiety disorder but anything that could help me to piece it all together and get a hold of it would be so helpful. thank you for taking the time to read my story. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I would say I am pretty healthy usually, I have to have a blood test every 6 months as my Serum Total Protein has always been high (since 2004) being around 84 g/L- 88g/L along with my Igg (around 21 g/L) but my Dr has never been concerned due to how long its been the same. Other than that I have no issues. End of Jan I got a persistent   and then suddenly came down with a  , fast HR and feeling terrible. Dr had a listen to check, said it sounded crackly and prescribed   for 5 days. I began to fill better but the cough stayed around. Three days after finishing antibiotics the fever and feeling terrible came back and I was seen by the Dr again who said it sounded like a very nasty infection. He prescribed me Co-Amox for 7 days and within 3/4 days I began to feel better and after a week or so I was myself again and the cough cleared up. For around two weeks I have been fine but last Friday I began to feel rough again (no cough this time) but by the early hours of Sunday morning I was in A&E on IV fluids due to a fever of 38.4, shakes and a HR of around 130bpm. Once my HR had come down they sent me home saying it was a virus. By Monday my fever has still not gone and I had developed a   with some nasty looking tonsils. I went to the Dr and he prescribed me more antibiotics for bacterial  . I had a blood test and x ray while in A&E and they didn't really go through results in much detail. The X-ray was apparently clear but some of my bloods were a little off but didn't go into much more than that. I had a look at them and I was hoping someone here could do the same, my main worry is that I have essentially had 3 infection in a very short period of time. This isn't normal for me. Dr says he thinks I have just been unlucky and immune system was weak from first infection. Abnormal - Total white cell count: 12.7 10 12/L Platelet: 230 10 9/L (it was 3.1 in February) Lymphocyte 1.7 Abnormal - Monocyte 1.3 10*9/L Eosinophil 0.1 Abnormal - CRP - 20.5mg/L (it was 11 in February) I am going back in a few weeks to have bloods again but I just wanted to see others opinions on whether these could show an underlying cause?

Was given antibiotics for 5 days and started to feel better. 3 days later it came back worse, fever, shakes etc and was given stronger antibiotics (Co Amoxiclav). Within a few days my fever came down and I felt better, cough cleared up. X-ray was clear. A little over a week ago I had to go to A&E with a high HR, fever and shakes. I had blood tests which are below and given more antibiotics by Dr for bacterial tonsillitis. Within a few days, fever went and I felt better. On Wednesday night, once again, fever, shakes and muscle aches but the problem I have now is Dr won’t let me into the surgery as I have a fever. He’s told me to stay at home. Today (Sunday) I’m feeling much more myself with abit of a cough. I’m really concerned there must be a serious underlying issue here and it’s going to be looked over due to everything that’s going on at the moment. My blood tests as of just over a week ago: WBC - 12.7 10 13L Neutrophil 9.5 10 9L Monocyte 1.3 10*9L (abnormal) CRP 20.5 mg/l (abnormal) My serum total protein has been high since 2004, around 84-88 but my Dr has never been concerned as it’s been so long. My Igg has been 20 for some years too. Any advice would be appreciated. I tried to google but that put me into more of a panic with different blood cancers. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Since this conversation, only 3 weeks ago, pain has virtually gone although I was left with numbness in my thigh and foot. However, numbness in thigh has reduced by 75% although only 25% in foot. I take a single ant-inflamatory med each day. I have shed a few pounds and have been walking couple of miles daily, but no physio on consultants advice. I'm now unsure of my next action. Do I let it continue to improve naturally with conservative methods? I feel nerve block right now wouldn't be useful as I have no pain to block. Microdiscetomy may still be an option - I have seen the MRI and seen the prolapse yet as I'm not in discomfort it seems a bit unnatural taking surgery. I have been resting a lot, but building up each day recently. Many thanks 0 likes, 1 reply "

I ...,"Microdiscectomy surgery worked like a dream for me !! I am 26 years old and started with back pain in April 2005, and was initially diagnosed with sciatica. This was 7 weeks before my wedding. Not ideal at all, I was in vast amounts of pain, particularly down my right leg. I was left with a limp and unable to do any walking, standing or sitting for any amount of time. During my honeymoon the pain became even more intense and I ended up in hospital in San Francisco. They did the usual leg raise tests and diagnosed a slipped disc. made it back to the UK, and after a visit to the hospital and my GP was reffered to a consultant neurologist. The wait on the NHS was silly, so we paid to get a private consultation. He sent me for an MRI scan which showed prolapsed L5 S1. Told I needed micro diskectomy, but the waiting list was 6 months. After waiting 3 months and being in horrendous amounts of pain (not to mention the psychological effects of having no life!!) we decided to take out a loan and get it done privately. Had the op on November 7th, and it is the best money I have ever spent in my life. The pain in my leg was gone straight away.  I was off pain killers completely within two weeks of surgery. I feel on top of the world. After surgery the main issue you will have is sitting down. You are walking the day after the operation, but sitting takes a little more time. There is some numbness in my right foot, but nothing major, and this is expecetd to calm down in a few months. It's three weeks since the op......I am now walking for 2 hours or more each day, swimming, driving and doing small bits at the gym. Do not be scared about having this operation.

My question is should I go ahead with the surgery or cancel it. Is it possible that the Gabapentin, Cymbalta and Cortisone are controlling the pain?

I have been to an osteopath and I cannot physically afford to go there every 2 weeks because that’s how often she wanted to see me! I’ve had x-rays god knows how many times. My osteopath even thought I might have  , I was only 18 then! The pain: I have a constant pain right in the middle of my spine, it’s always there no matter what I do. My lower back has always hurt ever since I was 8! I can’t sit, lay down, drive do anything without my lower back hurting, I has always been that way. I sometimes get a shooting pain through my back and I can’t physically move until the shooting pain has gone. I struggle to go to the toilet because it’s painful, it’s painful sneezing/coughing etc. When I’m in extreme pain or been to work for a few hours I can barely move my left leg, it sort of feels numb (it’s hard to explain) like it isn’t my life so to speak. I’m even struggling to sleep at the moment because of the pain and that has never stopped me sleeping before. I’m here as a last resort because I honestly don’t know what to do. The doctors aren’t listening to me or taking my seriously. I don’t know if I should demand a MRI or for them to look further into it but they just keep transferring me to physiotherapy. Thank you to anyone that can help or replies it’s much appreciated, I keep breaking down and I don’t know what else to do. Thank you 0 likes, 10 replies "

I tried to do exercises but every time ended up with more pain. Even I can't sit. sitting is impossible. I also use plastic bag for pee and loo often.

I am a 34 year old male with back problems that started just before I turned 30. At this time I had an MRI that showed signs of a bulge and ""greying"" in the disk. I was refferred to physio, and as a result told to loose some weight (which I did - 4 stone). Things were ok but never really 100%. I had been back to my DR a few times and tried things like narproxin and codine, non of which helped really. Things of late have become unbarable, everytime I sneeze I will fall in pain if I'm not holding on to something, lying in bed is horrific and if I try to move I can literally yelp in pain. The pain comes from my lower back and shoots into my groin and into my legs. The passed couple of weeks  numbness and shooting pains in my leg, general weakness in my glutes, bending down and not being able to get back down - so went to the Doctors and was reffered to the muscular skelital dept (massive waiting list) and I prescribed AMITRIPTYLINE and startwd them immediatley. At work, a few days later I was chasing someone (i'm a Police officer), and the pain came on in my lower back, and when I got back to my car I felt damp down below - lots of warning signs. The next day my whole body felt wrecked, so I went back to the Doctor (a few days after). He doubled my dose to 20mg of AMITRIPTYLINE and sent me off for and MRI. At the hospital A&E they gave me diazepam (wow!!).. So my MRI results were as follows: ""The l4-l5 and l5-s1 intervertebral disc show minor noncompressive annular bulges indenting the thecal sac anteriorly. No evidence of nerve root compression or foraminal stenosis"" ""Conclusion Stable degenerative minor noncompressive annular bulges of l4-l5 and l5-s1 discs. No evidence of nerve root compression or foraminal stenosis."" I might be reading this wrong and taking the a&e doctor wrongly, but I feel like theyre saying there's nothing wrong - man up!! It just doesnt explain my levels of pain and discomfort? I left being told to speak with my GP and ask to be reffered to a neuro/spinal surgeon, which I will be doing tomorrow. I am just really confused and frustraighted?? Meanwhile I'm off work seemingly with no good excuse? 0 likes, 8 replies "

I am a 36 year old mate who had a L4 L5 decompression discectomy 4 weeks to the day.  A bit about me then, as I said I am a 36 year old male, 6 foot 2 and althletic build. I have served in the British Army in both Commando and Airborne sqaurdrons. I am now a Police Officer and have been for ten years now and work on the firearms teams. The reason I had a herniated disc was that I always pushed my body to the limits and just took pain killers when my lower back hurt. I can recall back to 2005 when I was blown up in Iraq to my back problems. I would just push through the pain still squatting and doing dead lifts even though my hamstrings where tight through my running i just wouldn't give in.    That is until last summer 2015, I picked up a sofa at work whilst wearing all my kit (body armour, pistol and magazines strapped to my legs). I should of asked for some help but being a stubborn man who could do anything physical of course I wasn't going to ask for help. As soon as I lifted it I felt a sharp pain in my hamstring in my left leg but I thought nothing of it as I have always suffered with some form of back or leg pain. After approximately 1 week the pain was even worse but I could still walk and complete my day to day tasks. I paid for physio and sport massages which seemed to help and I was back in the gym thinking everything was ok, just carrying on. I had sciatic pain constantly for approximately 4 months at degreeing levels until November 2016. Carried on as normal until a hard day at work and a chest infection, I have always been very guarded on how I cough and sneeze because of my herniated disc, it would hurt like hell if I wasn't careful. Went to bed and fell into a deep sleep, that was until a coughing fit in the middle of the night. As soon as I had finished I knew my back had gone but I thought it would get better, I laid in bed for 4 days on just my right hand side because that was the only position that didn't hurt. I couldn't stand up without having to dive back on the bed in such agony. I had to go to the toilet in a bottle because I just couldn't stand up.   After 4 days of this I had to phone for an ambulance because it was just getting worse and the GP would not come to me because I was not an emergency, yeah I know not been able to stand for 4 days is not an emergency. To get into the ambulance I had to slide off the bed on my right hand side and the same down the stairs and onto the bed at the bottom of the stairs. Got to hospital where I was given Co-codomol, tramadol and diazepam but still had the pain so I was given a bed.    Had a MRI scan after 7 days in hospital where it was found that I had herniated my L4 L5 disc so much that most of the disc was hanging out. I was told by the surgeon that surgery was the only way which I knew myself anyway because of the pain. I welcomed the surgery because physio, pain killers and sport massages would never of fixed my herniation. As you look through these forums you will read that some people think that dancing around a tree and rubbing cream on your back will solve the problem, a bulge can go back with the above help but an herniated disc even if the pain is under control will not go away once it has poured out, it doesn't miraculously go back. You can look through all the websites and there is very little evidence that a herniated disc will go back to normal but a bulge yes.  When I woke up from the operation I had no sciatic pain at all, the only pain I had was from the surgery. The surgeon was unsure if I needed a fusion but said that once I was open he would decide which I was happy with just to not be in pain anymore.  Once I was wheeled back to the ward I just wanted to get going and tried straight away to wee, but this took me around 3 hours to empty my bladder. The next evening I was able to stand up without any pain ( Don't forget that I haven't been able to stand for around 14 days by then). I got walking straight away using crutches which was hard at first because I had lost a lot of mobility from my left leg but I was determined to get going. I had the operation on the Wednesday afternoon and I walked out of the hospital using crutches on the Friday afternoon. I was still a bit sore but no sciatic pain. On the Sunday I was out all day walking around using the crutches which I paid for in the evening, I had done to much so it was pain killers and straight to bed. In the morning I was fine and just took it easy which I have been for 4 weeks now, I had to use both crutches for around 2.5 weeks than one for the rest of the week. I now walk with no crutches and walk fine with no pain. Because I was opened up to have fusion my lower back muscles where prized from my spinal so my recovery took a little longer than the Micro-discectomy.  Want I really want to say is be positive, I needed surgery there was no question of that. The hardest thing for me now is taking it easy because I just want to get back to the gym but I know Rome wasn't built in a day. I have changed my whole attitude to my herniated disc, my days of dead lifting and doing squats are OVER that is for sure. Once that disc comes out there isn't anything put in it place so be careful and listern to your body but be positive. I was told to not do anything for 6 weeks that includes driving, after 3 weeks I felt good to drive so everyone is different (still haven't driven though because of doctors orders). I have seen the physio who gave me some stretchs to do at home which help a lot so don't pay lip service to them do them even if you are out and about find some time, they don't take long. Mine are for tight hamstrings.    I am off the pain medication which I stopped completely which was a mistake because I couldn't sleep, after 3 days I was fine.  Keep moving it does help, stay positive. I do have a long way to go but so far so good and everyday I get a little bit better, I never want to feel sciatic pain again so I am doing want I am told.  I will update in another 2 weeks after I have seen my surgeon. But if you have had a positive experience please can you post it because there is a lot of doom and gloom out there.  5 likes, 46 replies "

As you look through these forums you will read that some people think that dancing around a tree and rubbing cream on your back will solve the problem, a bulge can go back with the above help but an herniated disc even if the pain is under control will not go away once it has poured out, it doesn't miraculously go back. You can look through all the websites and there is very little evidence that a herniated disc will go back to normal but a bulge yes.  When I woke up from the operation I had no sciatic pain at all, the only pain I had was from the surgery. The surgeon was unsure if I needed a fusion but said that once I was open he would decide which I was happy with just to not be in pain anymore.  Once I was wheeled back to the ward I just wanted to get going and tried straight away to wee, but this took me around 3 hours to empty my bladder. The next evening I was able to stand up without any pain ( Don't forget that I haven't been able to stand for around 14 days by then). I got walking straight away using crutches which was hard at first because I had lost a lot of mobility from my left leg but I was determined to get going. I had the operation on the Wednesday afternoon and I walked out of the hospital using crutches on the Friday afternoon. I was still a bit sore but no sciatic pain. On the Sunday I was out all day walking around using the crutches which I paid for in the evening, I had done to much so it was pain killers and straight to bed. In the morning I was fine and just took it easy which I have been for 4 weeks now, I had to use both crutches for around 2.5 weeks than one for the rest of the week. I now walk with no crutches and walk fine with no pain. Because I was opened up to have fusion my lower back muscles where prized from my spinal so my recovery took a little longer than the Micro-discectomy.  Want I really want to say is be positive, I needed surgery there was no question of that. The hardest thing for me now is taking it easy because I just want to get back to the gym but I know Rome wasn't built in a day. I have changed my whole attitude to my herniated disc, my days of dead lifting and doing squats are OVER that is for sure. Once that disc comes out there isn't anything put in it place so be careful and listern to your body but be positive. I was told to not do anything for 6 weeks that includes driving, after 3 weeks I felt good to drive so everyone is different (still haven't driven though because of doctors orders). I have seen the physio who gave me some stretchs to do at home which help a lot so don't pay lip service to them do them even if you are out and about find some time, they don't take long. Mine are for tight hamstrings.    I am off the pain medication which I stopped completely which was a mistake because I couldn't sleep, after 3 days I was fine.  Keep moving it does help, stay positive. I do have a long way to go but so far so good and everyday I get a little bit better, I never want to feel sciatic pain again so I am doing want I am told.  I will update in another 2 weeks after I have seen my surgeon.

I am a 36 year old mate who had a L4 L5 decompression discectomy 4 weeks to the day.  A bit about me then, as I said I am a 36 year old male, 6 foot 2 and althletic build. I have served in the British Army in both Commando and Airborne sqaurdrons. I am now a Police Officer and have been for ten years now and work on the firearms teams. The reason I had a herniated disc was that I always pushed my body to the limits and just took pain killers when my lower back hurt. I can recall back to 2005 when I was blown up in Iraq to my back problems. I would just push through the pain still squatting and doing dead lifts even though my hamstrings where tight through my running i just wouldn't give in.    That is until last summer 2015, I picked up a sofa at work whilst wearing all my kit (body armour, pistol and magazines strapped to my legs). I should of asked for some help but being a stubborn man who could do anything physical of course I wasn't going to ask for help. As soon as I lifted it I felt a sharp pain in my hamstring in my left leg but I thought nothing of it as I have always suffered with some form of back or leg pain. After approximately 1 week the pain was even worse but I could still walk and complete my day to day tasks. I paid for physio and sport massages which seemed to help and I was back in the gym thinking everything was ok, just carrying on. I had sciatic pain constantly for approximately 4 months at degreeing levels until November 2016. Carried on as normal until a hard day at work and a chest infection, I have always been very guarded on how I cough and sneeze because of my herniated disc, it would hurt like hell if I wasn't careful. Went to bed and fell into a deep sleep, that was until a coughing fit in the middle of the night. As soon as I had finished I knew my back had gone but I thought it would get better, I laid in bed for 4 days on just my right hand side because that was the only position that didn't hurt. I couldn't stand up without having to dive back on the bed in such agony. I had to go to the toilet in a bottle because I just couldn't stand up.   After 4 days of this I had to phone for an ambulance because it was just getting worse and the GP would not come to me because I was not an emergency, yeah I know not been able to stand for 4 days is not an emergency. To get into the ambulance I had to slide off the bed on my right hand side and the same down the stairs and onto the bed at the bottom of the stairs. Got to hospital where I was given Co-codomol, tramadol and diazepam but still had the pain so I was given a bed.    Had a MRI scan after 7 days in hospital where it was found that I had herniated my L4 L5 disc so much that most of the disc was hanging out. I was told by the surgeon that surgery was the only way which I knew myself anyway because of the pain. I welcomed the surgery because physio, pain killers and sport massages would never of fixed my herniation.

Odd that, as i never go any time other than the morning. There was a small amount of blood in the stool yesterday, but very little on the toliet paper. Yippee! I took a little miralax yesterday evening to get things going. It worked. This morning I went WITH NO blood that I could see in the stool or, on the toliet paper. *However, I do have a small amount of cramping pain on the left side.Most of my pain is actually on the right side where the incisions are located. Is cramping a bit normal after this type of surgery? Should I have not used the miralax? I called my doctor and honestly the man seemed a bit annoyed😟😟. I wasn't expecting that to be honest. He's been quite good thus far, but his attitude today put me off. These surgeons all seem to have the personality of my tea kettle. I'm paying him a fortune you'd think he could take more of an interest! I haven't  had any cramping until I used the miralax,  so perhaps that was a bad call. I asked my doc prior to leaving hospital if it was okay to use it if I felt I was a bit constipated. Anyway, I'm obviously  new to all this and honestly this has been quite a scary process. I ecstatic that there no more blood, but I'm concerned about the cramping. Have any of you lot experienced a small bout of cramping after surgery? Any and all advice appreciated.

I'm sorry if that's the case. This is how I cope. I thought after AML Leukeamia I'd be done with very serious health issues...anyway posting seems to help my anxiety. I've been out of hospital since Friday evening, and this is what I've learned in no certain order. 1.) We all heal differently. 2.) I bleed like a sive at first. I was terrified by the blood covered fecal particulate, and blood in the water. The blood gradually ceased--yours will too. In fact it may come and go for weeks as my doc told me. Believe your physician. 3.) Walk your arse off. 4.) Use the breathing doohickey they gave you to avoid pneumonia. I inhale into it at minimum  5x an hour. 5.) Stay on top of your pain management. Don't worry about constipation at this point. You can always treat that with Miralax down the road. My advice is stay AWAY from laxatives that aren't very gentle. 6.) Call your doc if you're concerned about anything--even if your doc acts annoyed. Who cares, You're paying him a fortune for his services. Surgeons can be right pr*cos at times. Ignore them if they become a bit cheeky. 7.) Rest a lot! 8.) Drink loads of water. 9.) Stay on a low residue diet for at minimum a month. Don't rush it!!! 10.) Wear your binder when attempting a poo. It really, really HELPS. 11.) Here's a BIG one...Do NOT eat high fat ice cream. Do NOT eat chocolate. I made a chocolate Shake for my lunch yesterday. Epic failure. I was in the loo at least 20x between noon and 7pm. 12.) If you're going to eat dairy, don't eat a lot. I'd honestly say eat it sparingly. 13.) Don't get up suddenly, don't sit down quickly. Have someone help you when getting out and in cars. 14.) Potatoes are your friend. 15.) Dinner rolls are your friend. 16.) White pasta with butter is your friend. 17.) Keep stress levels low. 18.) Only deal with supportive folk in your life. 19.) Have a good cry. 20.) Have a positive attitude. Thanks for listening. Cheers, Jacob 1 like, 10 replies "

I had extremely bad stomach burning. This had nothing to do with my resection. They did my bloods and  a CT scan--all normal for someone 18 days post-op. What I do know is sweet anything, dairy higher in fat and certain carbonated  drinks do me in.  My surgeon told me to try mixing in foods with no raw veggies. My dumb arse had sushi, or rather sashimi. For a night cap I had a chocolate chip cookie with a small glass of ice cold skin milk. BAD IDEA!!! I do believe my stomach isn't at all ready for that yet. I've had moderate success  with canned cooked green beans.  My fiance had Chinese two days ago and I had a  one small broccoli  floret. Again, how dumb am I l😆? Very. So, long story short I've been told I'm walking too much, and basically overdoing it. Currently i have a fentanyl  25 mgh patch . This certainly helps with my incisional pain.

How to deal with this?! ,"Hi there! I can't sleep at nights when my boyfriend is already asleep...  I start thinking about that everyone else can sleep so easily and I can't, so this became a horrible struggle how to sleep and not bother my family members who sleep easier and they have a better routine than me.  I start worrying about my work (I'm a teacher)  which starts at 8am and feel like I can't go to work. The nights that I sleep 2 to 4 hours I still go to work and suffer all day. All of this started a year ago since then I'm afraid of going to bed every single day. I started seeing a therapist who prescribed me RIVOTRRIL which helped only at the beginning and after taking it for 8 months in low dozes I finally got taped off. Now I feel even worse. It's getting worse and worse.  When I realize I can't sleep I start having a panic attack.. Then I wake my boyfriend up and tell him how much I hate when he has a good routine and I don't. I realize that I hurt him the next day but I can't do anything about it. I really hate this situation and I don't want to hurt my loved ones... Just don't know if this is a common reason for insomnia or is this a mental diagnosis or just a temporary thing. Please give me some direction if you can. Thank you so much! P. S.  I have got diagnosed PTSD. Always had extreme anxiety just recent years could deal with it better. 0 likes, 3 replies "

My brain wants to go to the worst case scenario and jump to spinal tumor from metastasis.  The fact that I dont smoke cigarettes and the pain is relatively new should put my mind at ease right? I'm going back to the doctor to check this out, but middle back pain is common right? I read that middle back pain is more common to be cancerous than lower back pain and it stresses me. Back pain is common and I am probably worrying for no reason. Appreciate any comments! 0 likes, 3 replies "

Usually, it's when I've been standing around a bunch (or walking). I don't have any issues if I get on my bike, go to the gym, have a full workout, etc. It might just be a ""things need to warm up"" kind of thing, or possibly a postural thing. The back pain itself is more of a discomfort/dull pain, and leaning over forward to stretch it out feels more intense than the back pain for a moment, but kind of relieving too once I stretch into it.. kind of like if you've been looking to one side for a long time, and you turn your head to the other side just to move it around. Is this a sign of bad posture that I need to address, lest I create permanent damage to my spine over the next 10 years, maybe from naturally over-arching my lumbar? p.s. I've scheduled an appointment with a PT, but wanted to get the hive-mind's perspective too. In general, I have some amount of hypermobility (most noticeable in my shoulders, which dislocate super-easily, if in a precarious position like attempting an overhead squat), and some knee pain... I wonder if that's all linked, or if this is separate... It'd be good to know if there's an overall thing that's exacerbating this, or if the back issue is isolated. 0 likes, 5 replies "

I dont really remember when it formed because i never had any pain or discomfort. I believe mine came about due to constant sweating (no AC in Texas heat with long commutes) and the fact that I had a bacterial infection (Beta Hemolytic Streptoccocus Group B) after intercourse. This was cleared with antibiotics. Also, ever since then I have always had whats feels like a subtle yeast infection that was diagnosed and treated. Having this cyst was VERY depressing. My bf at the time, unfortunately, was not understanding as this put a strain on our relationship. I did not feel confident or atrractive because of it and our physical relationship was nearly non existent. Intercourse didnt hurt but it didnt help. The cyst would get bigger and go down but never went away. Just an ugly squishy lump. It was about the size of a large grape. I went on a health craze because of the things that happened to me. I had ""yeast"" infections every couple months and would get treated. So I started eating better. I started eating raw garlic, only drinking water, cutting sugar. I would do these things here and there but not for too long because it was difficult! I wont even list the supplements i took because i did not have the patience as they obviously never worked. The Sitz baths didnt work either. A couple weeks ago I was at my lowest and very depressed and crying for having this lump on my vulva for 3 years. It was so bad i did the unthinkable. My cyst was NEVER infected. It was just...there. As i read on a few forums. I decided to self treat because surgery was not an option and i am a firm believer in DIY and saving money. I was goign to pop it.. I would NOT reccomend this course of action to anyone but I will tell u my experience (last resort): I purchased 3 packs of very thin syringe needles. Bought gauze pads and an antiseptic rinse.  I soakded 1 last time and thoroughly cleansed my vulva with soap and water then checked myself with a mirror and did it again. I faned myself and dried off. I grabbed the needles,some cotton balls, a cup of warm water,gauze pads, paper towels, the mirror and a small bendable lamp. I sat on the floor on a towel and spread my legs. Situated the mirror and light in between so i could clearly see. All my ""tools"" were in close proximity. I first sat and cried more thinking. I either live with a warped vulva, go have surgery and have a scarred vulva with the possibility of it coming back and most likely with a vengance, or do this now and see what happens. I had heard about blood poisioning but i quite frankly did not care. I was NOT about to live with a warped vulva any longer and if i was going to the ER or needed surgery, i first wanted to try it myself.  And I am so happy i did. I sat on the floor after going back and forth and finally uncapped the needle(sterilized) and poked the cyst after cleaning the vulva. No blood immediately came out! Just clear liquid. then a small amount of blood. I kept doing this for about 10 needles. it didnt hurt at all. nor was i bleeding. So i opened another pack and decided to aspirate it... I folded and pushed and squeezed the area until i had the cyst in a position where most of the fluid had collected. I poked it with a needle and aspirated. It was clear! Which apparently meant no infection.I kept doing this 15 more times. losing a few needles in the process because i couldnt aspirate properly. Some liquid was clear and some was a slight yellow. Which was odd but i tried turmeric down there and maybe it seeped through and changed the color, i dont know. This whole process took about 25 needles and the cyst sac had finally shrunk! (well because i sucked all the fluid out) i cried again tears of joy! My vulva is now 97% normal looking. I now have extra skin that has stretched since i have had this cyst for so long. I am wondering when it will shrink back? Sorry for such a long post. I wanted to share my experience and what i did. yes i did a crazy thing with 25 needles. But i also did not get sepsis. nor did i die or end up in the ER. My cyst doesnt even look like a cyst anymore. My vulva just has some extra skin that i am concerned will not shrink back.   0 likes, 4 replies "

What does it look like. ,"Yesterday after masturbating, I went to pee it hurt a little, but when I wipe it hurt bad. I thought I just wore my clit out because that’s happen before when over using my vibrator. Today as I was going through out my day to use the bathroom it hurt when I wiped. And a little when I was walking. I got home and took a look at my clit and seen a bump right by my clit and on my hood an dark spot. I immediately thought I had herpes so I got really paranoid and have been looking up symptoms. I got tested thanksgiving and was negative. I pray to good it isn’t herpes or hiv, or any STD for the matter. Since it is one bump and I’ve been touching my vagina and vulva for some hours now and only see one bump, doesn’t look similar to the symptoms not vagina as those I seen I started looking at vagina and why I could have a dark spot and ran across vulvar cancer. I was reading up and seeing what happens and I have a dark spot and a bump, which are symptoms.  I looked up some pics of the dark spots are mines was similar and so was the bump.

It lasted 3 weeks before I could get in to see the doctor and unfortunately, no home remedies helped at all. The doc inserted a word catheter which fell out 34 hours later. That was 2 weeks ago, and tonight, I felt a little lump again and some tenderness, but when I looked, I think there's still a hole there as it was draining some when I pressed on it. Has anyone had a word catheter and experienced a similar situation? Does this mean everything is ok? Or should I be worried about another BC popping up?

I am 23 now and I got my first at 16. About a year ago, I had a marsupialization as a permanent solution after several in-office lancings, catheters, etc. 3 months later, I developed another cyst and discovered that   made it drain on its own and it was gone. Got another one 3 months after that, 6 months post-op. Same treatment at home - antibiotics made it drain. 4 months after this, 10 months post-op, I got my third since my surgery. Antibiotics didn't take, so I made an appointment after about a week and they happened to have a cancellation the next day for surgery and my OB/GYN suggested I go through with the excision surgery I have been dreading because of these horror stories I have read (and cried) about for months. I had my excision 6 days ago and am feeling okay. Waking up after the surgery was terrible and I was in excruciating pain for a few hours, but I was told no morphine/pain medicine was used during the surgery, so it was warranted. I took pain medication for the first 12 hours in conjunction with 500mg ibuprofen every 6 six hours, and it mostly just uncomfortable. I did not sleep for more than 3-4 hours at a time, and slept with a pillow in between my legs for comfort, but I was able to keep up with my medicine. I used an ice pack on and off for 20 mins at a time for the first 36 hours to help with swelling. Now 6 days out, I am somewhat pain-free. And mind you, I have like, ZERO tolerance for pain. I'm the biggest baby. There was some bleeding right after the surgery, but it turned to just some discharge by the next morning, and I have had a tiny bit over the last day or so. Here and there I get a pang of slight pain or a pinching feeling that hurts, but it goes away. I am a bartender so I have to be off of work for 10-14 days and have been resting as much as I possibly can. It is mostly just uncomfortable and I can't stand for too long of a time before needing to sit/lay again. This experience is straining on my relationship (he was here for my marsupialization in the very beginning), but we both agreed that this was the right thing for me to do. I know that I can't live my life afraid of this happening forever and always wondering when it's going to come back, so I went through with the surgery. I have a check up appointment with my OB/GYN who also performed the surgery this week, a little after a week post-op. I am still taking my ibuprofen every 6 hours to manage soreness/discomfort and I have been on a week of antibiotics to prevent infection. I decided to look today after the swelling and possible bruising has gone down and was definitely surprised at the amount and placement of the stitches. My doctor said they were inside the vagina rather than outside like my marsupialization (which was terrible because I had them for 8 weeks and they hurt like hell), but they run all the way from the gland and up to the top on the right side in the inner labia. It's not pretty but I'll take a little ugliness over pain and fear for the rest of my life. All in all, I'd say this is going to be worth it so far.

I've taken about 5 baths already it refuses to pop and its just getting bigger. I've read on here that massaging and tea tree oil helps and I tried both, didn't work. Someone on this forum also recommended silica spray which I already ordered and should be getting in 2 days. Fingers crossed because I really don't want to pay so much to see the doctors. How long do these things usually last for you guys because I read they should pop on its own in about 2 weeks but I've had mine for about 4 im getting nervous and impatient. What are some other remedies or tricks that worked for you guys besides the most well known ones? Should I just try to sterilize a needle and pop it myself? 0 likes, 5 replies "

From surgeries to marsupilizations, to it bursting on its own. I have had my bartholin glands removed from both sides, and when another cyst arrived only 9 months after surgery and weeks of healing, I lost my mind. I thought it would be gone for good because of the removal of the glands. It was like I was in a nightmare and I was fed up. I went on the search for SOMETHING/ANYTHING to define the root cause of these because it seemed as if no doctor knew what to do besides treating the abscess itself by loading me up on antibiotics or putting me under for surgery. When you get these things more than once a year, it is not optimal to be going under local anestethia or having antibiotics so often.  Since I prefered not to grow a pair of testicles (thats the cute name I came up with for these)...I started searching for a doctor.  After being treated by 6 different doctors, finally, I found a doctor who actually cares. Who spent about an hour explaining things about this condition I never heard before.  I would like to share this with everyone, as I know how frustrating and how little information there is out there. I hope I can be of help. Since my abscesses were reoccuring, this amazing doctor said that we needed to look at the reasons of why my body is creating these things constantly even after having my bartholin glands removed. Finally! A doctor who started our discussion with this as opposed to ""I'll write you a prescription for.."" or ""lets schedule an appointment for operation.""  He explained: - Every time you got a cyst, it created a new cavity for a possible new infection. That is why they reoccur and seem to get worse each time. Even if you have had the bartholin gland removed, you can still get an abscess as long as these cavities exist and get introduced to any imbalance/bacteria. It is not ideal to removed these cavities, as part of the vulva will need to be removed as well. So, finding the root cause of the cysts is more ideal.  1) Pathogens - Bacteria wise, get tested for Ureaplasma/Mycoplasma. These can ""go into hiding"" so you will need to be tested several times in order to know whether you are cleared. It has been linked with barthoinitis, and is a separate test, so don't think that a pap smear will show it. A PCR test is the most accurate, but also the most expensive, so taking pap cultures for this every 3 months can do the trick. Also, this bacteria lives in males in their prostates, so if you are in a relationship with a male, make sure he gets checked out as well by a urologist. 2) Biological - Women who suffer from bartholin gland abscesses also have a higher risk of getting colon cancer in the future. This is due to the fact that they are so close to one another in the body that the imbalance of flora in the colon can create imbalance in the vagina/the other way around which can cause the abscess in the bartholin cyst. It is important to get your colon healthy. This can be done through taking probiotics daily and finding out which foods you should be eating. This is essential to creating an appropriate balance in your body. Every body is different and requires different things for nourishment...you need to find out what is right for you and keep it up (especially the probiotics!). - Also, make sure you practice good hygiene. do this for you AND your partner. This includes:   -washing underwear separate from other clothing in high temperature   -ironing all underwear (especially on the part that touches the genitals)   -use female washing liquid in the shower and wash ""there"" with your hands   -always wash there after any sexual intercourse (oral included)   -make sure your partner is clean as well (washing his hands before getting frisky)   -sleep with no underwear   -use organic pads/tampons  I know it seems like alot and like it requires a lifestyle change, but it does not hurt to be hygienic, plus it prevents the kind of pain you experience with an abscess, which is totally worth it. I have started doing everything the doctor told me for the past 2 weeks now...and I feel great! This is probably the placebo effect, but I'm just happy this doctor gave me hope. I'm not a medical professional in any way, and maybe these recommendations are his own theory...but heck, it made a lot of sense to me! He said the results may not be immediate, but over time you will become healthier and so will your body. I am actually excited about my future now when before I was dreading when my next ""testicle"" would arrive. I hope that I could have been a help to you all and provided some hope.  Please feel free to ask me any questions ladies, and again...I'm sorry if you are going through this.

After nearly three years of suffering from these horrible, nasty, painful monsters, I finally found a cure. I had my first abcsess at 25, it was excrutiating pain and went to the size of a tennis ball. I tried all the advice on the internet (sitz baths, hot compresses etc), none of these worked and I eventually had the marsupilaziton surgery (which for some people, is a permanent cure). It was uncomfortable and I was in hospital for around 10 days. My second one came up around 6 months later, again extremely painful. I was admitted into hospital for surgery again but fortunately, it decided to burst itself in the night whilst in the hospital. I was discharged the next morning and was pain free. A few months later, another one decides to pay a visit. So as usual, I go to hospital, which by this time, the gynae doctors are familiar with me. The doctor examines me and says it is not as big as the first two and that if I want, I can have it drained there and then. Obviously, this would mean that I would be awake throughout the procedure but also that it will be a quick fix and can go home the same day. I choose to have this and with a bit of numbing cream and squeezing of my moms hand, the abcsess is drained.  This procedure is painful, but NO WHERE NEAR AS PAINFUL AS HAVING THE  ! When you are desperate, you will do anything to make it go! A year and a half passes by (present time) and my 4th one arrives. I went to the hospital within hours of feeling that familiar pain. it was not as large as it had been but I wanted to nip it in the bud asap before it got to that size and that horrendous level. The doctors turned me away twice over two days and said that they cannot do anything as it still isnt big enough to operate on.  Absolutely distressed, in pain and physically drained, I went home, where me and my mom frantically googled other peoples home remedy ideas, desperate to find a cure. We kept coming across a remedy involving,tumeric powder, coconut oil, baking soda and sea salt. First, I mixed tumeric powder with the cocunut oil, to make a paste. This bought all the puss to the surface of the abscess, making it almost triple in size and the skin layer very thin, almost ready to pop. i left it on for approxamatley 2 hours. it does get very painful and uncomfortable but u can see that it it is ready to burst. A few painkiller kept the pain tolerable. Once it looks ike it is about to burst, mix the baking soda and salt in some water and dab on with a coton pad. I left the cotton pad there, held in pace with my underwear and sanitary towel.  Baking soda and salt are supposed to burn the skin. So when the skin is very thin, it shouldnt take much for it to tare which will lead to the abcess draining. i left the cotton pad in place for twenty minutes and realised the pain of the abscess jad dissappeared. When I checked, it had burst! the pain relief is instant and you feel almost back to normal. I am now writing this less than 12 hours later and I feel great. There is very little pain (only to touch) and hardly any swelling. The abscess is draining itself. I have been having warm baths to keep the area clean and speed up draining but overall Im feeling happy and relieved. Please try this as it really does work! Be patient and brave no matter how hard it gets, and believe me, I know it gets hard! If u think about it, this is a logical remedy- the tumeric (an anti-oxidant) makes all the puss come to the surface, making the skin thin and the baking soda and salt (an acidic formula)  burns the thin layer of skin making a hole for the abscesss to drain. Good luck ladies! You can do it xxx   19 likes, 138 replies "

It has recurred at least 6 or 7 times, and I have had an Incision and Drainage performed twice, one under local anesthetic and once under general. I can't stress enough, GET THE GENERAL! The needle with the anesthetic was BEYOND painful, and I'm not ashamed to admit I screamed bloody murder when they cut the thing open! Hands down, the most painful experience of my life. With the general, I experienced zero pain and no memory of the procedure. Yesterday, to my horror I felt the familiar hardened bump start to rise. Today at work, where I sit at a desk all day, the pain went from tolerably uncomfortable to unbearable. After being driven to the ER and speaking with a doctor, I decided to forgo the surgery, or at least postpone it, and give home remedies one last try. In my searches through forums and websites, I saw the same remedy mentioned a few times: Phoebe's Cure. I decided I had nothing to lose, drove to the pharmacy, and picked up the necessary ingredients: a bottle of calamine lotion, a bottle of witch hazel, a bottle of tea tree oil, and a roll of gauze. At this point, it was about 5:00 in the afternoon. I drove home, drew myself a hot bath and added Epson salts, and sat for about 20 minutes. When I got out, I soaked the gauze in a mixture of 6 oz of calamine lotion, 2 teaspoons of witch hazel, and 2 teaspoons of tea tree oil. The recipe actually only asks for 1 teaspoon of the latter two ingredients, but at that point I was almost hysterical with pain so I figured, go big or go home. I soaked the gauze in the mixture, then covered the cyst (likely an abscess at this point) with the gauze, held in place with my underwear. I left this for about 40 minutes, swapped for a hot compress for about 10 minutes, then applied another soaked gauze for about 30 minutes. At this point, I couldn't even help crying from the pain. I took a painkiller, and drew myself another hot bath, this time using table salt instead of Epson salts. I stayed in again for about 20 minutes, then restarted the cycle of changing the soaked gauze every 30 minutes or so. I could feel the cyst growing in size and getting even harder, and I noticed the mixture in the gauze was causing some stinging. At around 9:00, about 3 and a half hours after I drew the first bath, (WARNING, this is gross! Please do not read past this point if you are squeamish!) I was lying on the couch and suddenly felt liquid drip down. I put some mild pressure on the gauze, then went to the bathroom to see what was going on. Full disclosure, I'm also on my period right now, making it extremely difficult for me to tell exactly what was going on. I pulled the gauze away and sure enough there was a large spot of pus about as big as a Canadian Twoonie. I wanted to cry in relief, but didn't let myself believe I was out of the woods yet. I swapped for a new gauze again, left it, checked again, and sure enough, more pus. I put pressure on the spot where it seemed to be originating from with the gauze, and when I pulled it away, more pus. I cried with absolute relief.  I have never, ever found a home remedy that was even remotely effective for this ailment or any other. I am BLOWN AWAY at how effective this was! Let me preface this by saying I'm not a medical professional by any means, but I believe this worked by bringing the pus to the surface of the abscess until it finally burst. The originating spot of the pus was the spot that had become the hardest and probably the most painful point on the abscess over the three and a half hours of changing gauzes.

Eventually it seemed as if my discharge was off (thick, yellow. No smell, itching or burning) and I came to the assumption the summers ever had thrown off my PH balance. I stopped using it and started taking a probiotic to help even things out. Although the probiotic has seemed to help, the internet has me convinced there is still need for concern. I have taken a  regular ph balance test as well as a monistat test...both resulting without issue. The discharge I seem to be having is as follows: Dry Watery Mucus like (clear and/or white) And every now and then, it will be paste with a tint of yellow for a day at most It really seems that BV presents itself in multiple ways. I guess my understanding was my PH level would be off if there was an issue. Don't know if this is worth a doctor visit (with an expensive specialist fee) I've heard drinking hot lemon water along with lots of water helps?

However, my sex education was minimal so I thought this was normal, although I did always wonder why other girls were so confident spreading their legs and not worrying about the odor escaping, but I didn't worry too much about it. Later, when I was about 17 years old, my aunt, who did my laundry at the time, mentioned to me that she thought my sister had a vaginal infection because of what she saw on her underwear, but my sister and I are the same size and I KNEW I had some stuff on my underwear so I'm pretty sure she was talking about mine. This was the first time I even had an inkling that maybe something was wrong with me, so about a month later, I asked my mom to go see a GYN, but her GYN told her it was unnecessary unless I was sexually active (first example of an incompetent GYN). I wasn't going to admit to my mom that I was sexually active at that age, so I just went on with life as usual. When I was 22, I was about to get it on with this guy that I really liked, but suddenly got really self-conscious about the odor so I stopped it before things went further. Fed up with this, I finally scheduled an appointment to see a GYN and see what was up. So I go to the doctor and she says I look normal and does the test, but it comes back NEGATIVE. At first I was relieved, because oh my god nothing is wrong with me! But then a couple of months passed and I got self-conscious again and thought, ""No, this CANNOT be normal."" So I schedule an appointment again at the same clinic but with a different doctor and she examines me again. She says it looks like I might have a yeast infection and tests me again. This time it comes back negative for yeast, but ""intermediate"" for BV. She did a PCR test (DNA test) which has a 95% senstivity so it's supposed to be pretty accurate and much better than a simple culture. These were the results: Lactobacillus LOG: 7.59 - normal Gardnerella Vaginalis LOG: 4.64 - detected - normal Atopobium Vaginae LOG: ❤️.00 - Not detected Megasphaera LOG: 5.29 - increased According to the results, everything was normal except for Megasphaera which is considered ""increased"" if over 4.40. But the diagnosis was: ""Sample demonstrates quantitative profile of bacterial species which is not characteristic of bacterial vaginosis, but may represent a transitional state."" So my interpretation of this is that I didn't have BV, but it could shift that way if something happened. I was given oral metronidazole which did absolutely nothing. Literally didn't change my symptoms or anything. I had to leave the state for a year and wasn't able to go to the doctor again, so I learned to deal with it just by making sure not to open my legs near anyone so that they wouldn't smell me, but now suddenly the discharge was bleaching my underwear at the crotch. That had never happened before so now I was more worried. I went to a different GYN in November of last year and she once again told me that I looked totally normal and tested me for cultures. Once again, NEGATIVE for everything. I went to a different GYN in January of this year and she did a PCR test again and this time the test results were totally normal! Lactobacillus: >7.50 Gardnerella: ❤️.00 - not detected Atopobium: ❤️.00 - not detected Megasphaera: ❤️.00 - not detected All this told me was that I always have the necessary lactobacillus and none of the bad bacteria, at least not enough to overthrow the good bacteria which is supposedly what BV is all about! All the doctors assumed since I had normal test results that my discharge and strong odor meant nothing apparently, so they didn't help me after everything said I was supposedly normal. I took to wearing panty liners everyday since at least that way I wouldn't have to worry about bleaching all my underwear or accidentally opening my legs and subjecting my coworkers to a such a strong odor. In May, I went back to the third doctor I'd been to and I told her I was still having the same issues. She examines me again and notices that I do look ""runny"" so she prescribes me oral metronidazole again despite the fact that I told her it didn't do anything the last time. She does a test too and later emails me to tell me the results were once again NEGATIVE. I take the metronidazole anyway, except this time not only did it not do anything, but it made me extremely sick too. I had to take a day off work because it made me so nauseous. I travel for my job so I constantly have to find new doctors wherever I go, but this was becoming such a problem because I decided to google what BV was, since I never had before, and suddenly I was reading about reduced fertility, miscarriages, PID, susceptibility to HIV/STDs, and it freaked me out. I requested a 2 month extended vacation so I could come back home and go to my mom's GYN because I freaked her out too when I called her, crying that I would never be able to have kids, and she told me to go to her doctor because he was great (this was the same doctor who said I didn't have to go until I was sexually active). Anyway, he turned out to be a good doctor. I told him about the negative test results and he says to me, ""Yeah, BV can sometimes test negative, but you still have all the symptoms of BV so we'll treat it. I won't even take a test since you've had so many and I'll give you the Metrogel since it's more effective."" Honestly, I felt relieved. Finally! A doctor who believes what I say! So I used the metrogel for the 5 days and my symptoms cleared by the 3rd day. I was ecstatic! I also started taking 150 billion CFU of probiotics every day and used boric acid suppositories for 21 days after treatment since I read that it can prevent recurrences. And it was working great except for the excessive watery discharge from the boric acid, but the smell was nearly gone and the light yellow discharge was minimal. But then...like 5 days after ending the boric acid method, all my symptoms came back. Now here is where I need someone's help because I don't know if I really have BV or if it's something else, or if this is just how I am supposed to be normally. I'll be a bit TMI right here, but if you're reading this then you're probably used to it. I don't have a fishy smell. I can sometimes convince myself that it smells like tuna, but usually the smell I get is either vinegary, or overly sweet. My sister and I had been working out once and I accidentally opened my legs too wide and she remarked that something smelled like rotten bananas. My panties will either smell like that or like ammonia. I have discharge all day long. Like I can be clean for like 3 hours after showering, but then it's like I'm leaking nonstop and my panties will be damp by the end of the day and the smell will linger so bad on my jeans that I can only risk wearing them once before I have to wash them. I have rare itching, like maybe once a week for like 5 seconds. And something super important: I have pH litmus strips. I tested myself while on metronidazole and on boric acid suppositories and it was around 6-7. Before I started those and now, after treatment and with my symptoms having returned, my pH is between 4.0-5.0. It's hard to tell exactly because of the slight differences between the strip and the color chart, but it's WAY lighter than while I was on boric acid and metronidazole. So I don't get it. My test results are negative, my pH is technically close to, if not in the healthy vaginal range, and I don't have a fishy odor. What is wrong with me? I'll also mention that I've been tested for all STDs and I am pre-diabetic (though I'm not sure how much this factors into it considering I've had these issues since I was young and I for sure wasn't pre-diabetic then). I'm getting so frustrated because I'm taking a ton of probiotics, including L. Rhamnosus and L. Reuteri, along with 140 billion CFU of women's probiotics that contain a ton more bacteria. I've inserted   into my vagina and that didn't do anything except give me a sour yogurt smell and more watery discharge (from the capsules, I'm guessing). And probiotics are so darn expensive! I've tried: a balance complex* - didn't do a darn thing even after taking them for a month essentials prebiotics* - these mildly helped, but symptoms returned right after finishing them essentials probiotics* - didn't do anything Folic acid w/vitamin d and vitamin B - again, nothing Boric acid suppositories - helped while using them and a little afterward, but not a permanent cure Salt baths - I saw this on youtube and tried it for like 2 days, but it was so inconvenient and didn't help the slightest I did take 50 billion CFU probiotics along with a tablespoone mix of Apple cider vinegar, Garlic, and Honey for like 3 days and that reduced the discharge a lot, but I then had a pap smear (normal) and it all came back full force. I don't know what else to try. Luckily, my doctor gave me 11 refills on the metrogel so I'm going to try that again along with double the amount of probiotics, a few inserted vaginally, and the ACV/Garlic supplement to see if it does anything. I've also read that Vitamin C inserted for 6 days after your period for 6 months can work. But I tried Vitamin C suppositories from the essentials brand and it had me spotting on the second day so I stopped. Does anyone else have similar symptoms to me? Regular-ish pH, non-fishy odor, negative test results? I'm driving myself crazy constantly researching treatments, clinical studies, and checking how I smell every hour. I'm sorry that this was so long, but I needed to be as detailed as possible 1)to document this, and 2) to see if anyone else has had this experience. Any help is appreciated, thank you! And hopefully we can help each other. 1 like, 17 replies "

Luckily, my doctor gave me 11 refills on the metrogel so I'm going to try that again along with double the amount of probiotics, a few inserted vaginally, and the ACV/Garlic supplement to see if it does anything. I've also read that Vitamin C inserted for 6 days after your period for 6 months can work. But I tried Vitamin C suppositories from the essentials brand and it had me spotting on the second day so I stopped. Does anyone else have similar symptoms to me? Regular-ish pH, non-fishy odor, negative test results? I'm driving myself crazy constantly researching treatments, clinical studies, and checking how I smell every hour. I'm sorry that this was so long, but I needed to be as detailed as possible 1)to document this, and 2) to see if anyone else has had this experience. Any help is appreciated, thank you! And hopefully we can help each other. 1 like, 17 replies "

However, my sex education was minimal so I thought this was normal, although I did always wonder why other girls were so confident spreading their legs and not worrying about the odor escaping, but I didn't worry too much about it. Later, when I was about 17 years old, my aunt, who did my laundry at the time, mentioned to me that she thought my sister had a vaginal infection because of what she saw on her underwear, but my sister and I are the same size and I KNEW I had some stuff on my underwear so I'm pretty sure she was talking about mine. This was the first time I even had an inkling that maybe something was wrong with me, so about a month later, I asked my mom to go see a GYN, but her GYN told her it was unnecessary unless I was sexually active (first example of an incompetent GYN). I wasn't going to admit to my mom that I was sexually active at that age, so I just went on with life as usual. When I was 22, I was about to get it on with this guy that I really liked, but suddenly got really self-conscious about the odor so I stopped it before things went further. Fed up with this, I finally scheduled an appointment to see a GYN and see what was up. So I go to the doctor and she says I look normal and does the test, but it comes back NEGATIVE. At first I was relieved, because oh my god nothing is wrong with me! But then a couple of months passed and I got self-conscious again and thought, ""No, this CANNOT be normal."" So I schedule an appointment again at the same clinic but with a different doctor and she examines me again. She says it looks like I might have a yeast infection and tests me again. This time it comes back negative for yeast, but ""intermediate"" for BV. She did a PCR test (DNA test) which has a 95% senstivity so it's supposed to be pretty accurate and much better than a simple culture. These were the results: Lactobacillus LOG: 7.59 - normal Gardnerella Vaginalis LOG: 4.64 - detected - normal Atopobium Vaginae LOG: ❤️.00 - Not detected Megasphaera LOG: 5.29 - increased According to the results, everything was normal except for Megasphaera which is considered ""increased"" if over 4.40. But the diagnosis was: ""Sample demonstrates quantitative profile of bacterial species which is not characteristic of bacterial vaginosis, but may represent a transitional state."" So my interpretation of this is that I didn't have BV, but it could shift that way if something happened. I was given oral metronidazole which did absolutely nothing. Literally didn't change my symptoms or anything. I had to leave the state for a year and wasn't able to go to the doctor again, so I learned to deal with it just by making sure not to open my legs near anyone so that they wouldn't smell me, but now suddenly the discharge was bleaching my underwear at the crotch. That had never happened before so now I was more worried. I went to a different GYN in November of last year and she once again told me that I looked totally normal and tested me for cultures. Once again, NEGATIVE for everything. I went to a different GYN in January of this year and she did a PCR test again and this time the test results were totally normal! Lactobacillus: >7.50 Gardnerella: ❤️.00 - not detected Atopobium: ❤️.00 - not detected Megasphaera: ❤️.00 - not detected All this told me was that I always have the necessary lactobacillus and none of the bad bacteria, at least not enough to overthrow the good bacteria which is supposedly what BV is all about! All the doctors assumed since I had normal test results that my discharge and strong odor meant nothing apparently, so they didn't help me after everything said I was supposedly normal. I took to wearing panty liners everyday since at least that way I wouldn't have to worry about bleaching all my underwear or accidentally opening my legs and subjecting my coworkers to a such a strong odor. In May, I went back to the third doctor I'd been to and I told her I was still having the same issues. She examines me again and notices that I do look ""runny"" so she prescribes me oral metronidazole again despite the fact that I told her it didn't do anything the last time. She does a test too and later emails me to tell me the results were once again NEGATIVE. I take the metronidazole anyway, except this time not only did it not do anything, but it made me extremely sick too. I had to take a day off work because it made me so nauseous. I travel for my job so I constantly have to find new doctors wherever I go, but this was becoming such a problem because I decided to google what BV was, since I never had before, and suddenly I was reading about reduced fertility, miscarriages, PID, susceptibility to HIV/STDs, and it freaked me out. I requested a 2 month extended vacation so I could come back home and go to my mom's GYN because I freaked her out too when I called her, crying that I would never be able to have kids, and she told me to go to her doctor because he was great (this was the same doctor who said I didn't have to go until I was sexually active). Anyway, he turned out to be a good doctor. I told him about the negative test results and he says to me, ""Yeah, BV can sometimes test negative, but you still have all the symptoms of BV so we'll treat it. I won't even take a test since you've had so many and I'll give you the Metrogel since it's more effective."" Honestly, I felt relieved. Finally! A doctor who believes what I say! So I used the metrogel for the 5 days and my symptoms cleared by the 3rd day. I was ecstatic! I also started taking 150 billion CFU of probiotics every day and used boric acid suppositories for 21 days after treatment since I read that it can prevent recurrences. And it was working great except for the excessive watery discharge from the boric acid, but the smell was nearly gone and the light yellow discharge was minimal. But then...like 5 days after ending the boric acid method, all my symptoms came back. Now here is where I need someone's help because I don't know if I really have BV or if it's something else, or if this is just how I am supposed to be normally. I'll be a bit TMI right here, but if you're reading this then you're probably used to it. I don't have a fishy smell. I can sometimes convince myself that it smells like tuna, but usually the smell I get is either vinegary, or overly sweet. My sister and I had been working out once and I accidentally opened my legs too wide and she remarked that something smelled like rotten bananas. My panties will either smell like that or like ammonia. I have discharge all day long. Like I can be clean for like 3 hours after showering, but then it's like I'm leaking nonstop and my panties will be damp by the end of the day and the smell will linger so bad on my jeans that I can only risk wearing them once before I have to wash them. I have rare itching, like maybe once a week for like 5 seconds. And something super important: I have pH litmus strips. I tested myself while on metronidazole and on boric acid suppositories and it was around 6-7. Before I started those and now, after treatment and with my symptoms having returned, my pH is between 4.0-5.0. It's hard to tell exactly because of the slight differences between the strip and the color chart, but it's WAY lighter than while I was on boric acid and metronidazole. So I don't get it. My test results are negative, my pH is technically close to, if not in the healthy vaginal range, and I don't have a fishy odor. What is wrong with me? I'll also mention that I've been tested for all STDs and I am pre-diabetic (though I'm not sure how much this factors into it considering I've had these issues since I was young and I for sure wasn't pre-diabetic then). I'm getting so frustrated because I'm taking a ton of probiotics, including L. Rhamnosus and L. Reuteri, along with 140 billion CFU of women's probiotics that contain a ton more bacteria. I've inserted   into my vagina and that didn't do anything except give me a sour yogurt smell and more watery discharge (from the capsules, I'm guessing). And probiotics are so darn expensive! I've tried: a balance complex* - didn't do a darn thing even after taking them for a month essentials prebiotics* - these mildly helped, but symptoms returned right after finishing them essentials probiotics* - didn't do anything Folic acid w/vitamin d and vitamin B - again, nothing Boric acid suppositories - helped while using them and a little afterward, but not a permanent cure Salt baths - I saw this on youtube and tried it for like 2 days, but it was so inconvenient and didn't help the slightest I did take 50 billion CFU probiotics along with a tablespoone mix of Apple cider vinegar, Garlic, and Honey for like 3 days and that reduced the discharge a lot, but I then had a pap smear (normal) and it all came back full force.

However, my sex education was minimal so I thought this was normal, although I did always wonder why other girls were so confident spreading their legs and not worrying about the odor escaping, but I didn't worry too much about it. Later, when I was about 17 years old, my aunt, who did my laundry at the time, mentioned to me that she thought my sister had a vaginal infection because of what she saw on her underwear, but my sister and I are the same size and I KNEW I had some stuff on my underwear so I'm pretty sure she was talking about mine. This was the first time I even had an inkling that maybe something was wrong with me, so about a month later, I asked my mom to go see a GYN, but her GYN told her it was unnecessary unless I was sexually active (first example of an incompetent GYN). I wasn't going to admit to my mom that I was sexually active at that age, so I just went on with life as usual. When I was 22, I was about to get it on with this guy that I really liked, but suddenly got really self-conscious about the odor so I stopped it before things went further. Fed up with this, I finally scheduled an appointment to see a GYN and see what was up. So I go to the doctor and she says I look normal and does the test, but it comes back NEGATIVE. At first I was relieved, because oh my god nothing is wrong with me! But then a couple of months passed and I got self-conscious again and thought, ""No, this CANNOT be normal."" So I schedule an appointment again at the same clinic but with a different doctor and she examines me again. She says it looks like I might have a yeast infection and tests me again. This time it comes back negative for yeast, but ""intermediate"" for BV. She did a PCR test (DNA test) which has a 95% senstivity so it's supposed to be pretty accurate and much better than a simple culture. These were the results: Lactobacillus LOG: 7.59 - normal Gardnerella Vaginalis LOG: 4.64 - detected - normal Atopobium Vaginae LOG: ❤️.00 - Not detected Megasphaera LOG: 5.29 - increased According to the results, everything was normal except for Megasphaera which is considered ""increased"" if over 4.40. But the diagnosis was: ""Sample demonstrates quantitative profile of bacterial species which is not characteristic of bacterial vaginosis, but may represent a transitional state."" So my interpretation of this is that I didn't have BV, but it could shift that way if something happened. I was given oral metronidazole which did absolutely nothing. Literally didn't change my symptoms or anything. I had to leave the state for a year and wasn't able to go to the doctor again, so I learned to deal with it just by making sure not to open my legs near anyone so that they wouldn't smell me, but now suddenly the discharge was bleaching my underwear at the crotch. That had never happened before so now I was more worried. I went to a different GYN in November of last year and she once again told me that I looked totally normal and tested me for cultures. Once again, NEGATIVE for everything. I went to a different GYN in January of this year and she did a PCR test again and this time the test results were totally normal! Lactobacillus: >7.50 Gardnerella: ❤️.00 - not detected Atopobium: ❤️.00 - not detected Megasphaera: ❤️.00 - not detected All this told me was that I always have the necessary lactobacillus and none of the bad bacteria, at least not enough to overthrow the good bacteria which is supposedly what BV is all about! All the doctors assumed since I had normal test results that my discharge and strong odor meant nothing apparently, so they didn't help me after everything said I was supposedly normal. I took to wearing panty liners everyday since at least that way I wouldn't have to worry about bleaching all my underwear or accidentally opening my legs and subjecting my coworkers to a such a strong odor. In May, I went back to the third doctor I'd been to and I told her I was still having the same issues. She examines me again and notices that I do look ""runny"" so she prescribes me oral metronidazole again despite the fact that I told her it didn't do anything the last time. She does a test too and later emails me to tell me the results were once again NEGATIVE. I take the metronidazole anyway, except this time not only did it not do anything, but it made me extremely sick too. I had to take a day off work because it made me so nauseous. I travel for my job so I constantly have to find new doctors wherever I go, but this was becoming such a problem because I decided to google what BV was, since I never had before, and suddenly I was reading about reduced fertility, miscarriages, PID, susceptibility to HIV/STDs, and it freaked me out. I requested a 2 month extended vacation so I could come back home and go to my mom's GYN because I freaked her out too when I called her, crying that I would never be able to have kids, and she told me to go to her doctor because he was great (this was the same doctor who said I didn't have to go until I was sexually active). Anyway, he turned out to be a good doctor. I told him about the negative test results and he says to me, ""Yeah, BV can sometimes test negative, but you still have all the symptoms of BV so we'll treat it. I won't even take a test since you've had so many and I'll give you the Metrogel since it's more effective."" Honestly, I felt relieved. Finally! A doctor who believes what I say! So I used the metrogel for the 5 days and my symptoms cleared by the 3rd day. I was ecstatic! I also started taking 150 billion CFU of probiotics every day and used boric acid suppositories for 21 days after treatment since I read that it can prevent recurrences. And it was working great except for the excessive watery discharge from the boric acid, but the smell was nearly gone and the light yellow discharge was minimal. But then...like 5 days after ending the boric acid method, all my symptoms came back. Now here is where I need someone's help because I don't know if I really have BV or if it's something else, or if this is just how I am supposed to be normally. I'll be a bit TMI right here, but if you're reading this then you're probably used to it. I don't have a fishy smell. I can sometimes convince myself that it smells like tuna, but usually the smell I get is either vinegary, or overly sweet. My sister and I had been working out once and I accidentally opened my legs too wide and she remarked that something smelled like rotten bananas. My panties will either smell like that or like ammonia. I have discharge all day long. Like I can be clean for like 3 hours after showering, but then it's like I'm leaking nonstop and my panties will be damp by the end of the day and the smell will linger so bad on my jeans that I can only risk wearing them once before I have to wash them. I have rare itching, like maybe once a week for like 5 seconds. And something super important: I have pH litmus strips. I tested myself while on metronidazole and on boric acid suppositories and it was around 6-7. Before I started those and now, after treatment and with my symptoms having returned, my pH is between 4.0-5.0. It's hard to tell exactly because of the slight differences between the strip and the color chart, but it's WAY lighter than while I was on boric acid and metronidazole. So I don't get it. My test results are negative, my pH is technically close to, if not in the healthy vaginal range, and I don't have a fishy odor. What is wrong with me? I'll also mention that I've been tested for all STDs and I am pre-diabetic (though I'm not sure how much this factors into it considering I've had these issues since I was young and I for sure wasn't pre-diabetic then). I'm getting so frustrated because I'm taking a ton of probiotics, including L. Rhamnosus and L. Reuteri, along with 140 billion CFU of women's probiotics that contain a ton more bacteria. I've inserted   into my vagina and that didn't do anything except give me a sour yogurt smell and more watery discharge (from the capsules, I'm guessing). And probiotics are so darn expensive! I've tried: a balance complex* - didn't do a darn thing even after taking them for a month essentials prebiotics* - these mildly helped, but symptoms returned right after finishing them essentials probiotics* - didn't do anything Folic acid w/vitamin d and vitamin B - again, nothing Boric acid suppositories - helped while using them and a little afterward, but not a permanent cure Salt baths - I saw this on youtube and tried it for like 2 days, but it was so inconvenient and didn't help the slightest I did take 50 billion CFU probiotics along with a tablespoone mix of Apple cider vinegar, Garlic, and Honey for like 3 days and that reduced the discharge a lot, but I then had a pap smear (normal) and it all came back full force. I don't know what else to try. Luckily, my doctor gave me 11 refills on the metrogel so I'm going to try that again along with double the amount of probiotics, a few inserted vaginally, and the ACV/Garlic supplement to see if it does anything. I've also read that Vitamin C inserted for 6 days after your period for 6 months can work. But I tried Vitamin C suppositories from the essentials brand and it had me spotting on the second day so I stopped. Does anyone else have similar symptoms to me? Regular-ish pH, non-fishy odor, negative test results? I'm driving myself crazy constantly researching treatments, clinical studies, and checking how I smell every hour. I'm sorry that this was so long, but I needed to be as detailed as possible 1)to document this, and 2) to see if anyone else has had this experience. Any help is appreciated, thank you!

Went to the gynecologist for the first time and I couldn't even complete a full pap because it was so painful. She was still able to get a swab test and I tested negative for Trich, BV, and a yeast infection.  I have heavy light-dark yellow discharge, burning, occasional itchiness, and redness.  So obviously something is going on.  She put me on a 7 day course of Flagyl twice a day.

This may help destroy the BV biofilm that attaches to the vaginal wall by drying it out, causing it to no longer survive. I figured that's what it would do.  So I got a small cup and poured around 100ml of water and added one heaped teaspoon of sea salt ( has to be sea salt ) then I mixed it together. Then added a tampon inside n left it to soak in the solution for 30 mins. Then I insert it and leave it in for about 2- 3 hours repeating twice a day.

I was in the ER twice where they did a chest X-ray and then did a CT scan of the chest and abdomen yesterday and everything showed up normal.  Would the cat scan with contrast be able to show if I had a tear or rupture?  The best way to describe is like breathing through a big straw.  And my cough sounds like a drum. The doctors say it could be anxiety.  Should I press for more tests?  Thanks 0 likes, 2 replies "

Last week those symptoms returned with a vengeance and would not go away,so after scouring the Internet I decided to try a mixture of Diglycerinated liquorice,slippery elm,and a digestive enzyme bought from a local health shop and hey presto it seems to be working and for three days I have stopped taking Lansoprazole completely. I hope that this new course continues to work as I am not sure about the long-term effects of taking PPI's it seems to be open to debate as to their efficacy over a long period of time. Anyway for now I feel human again and will continue with my current treatment of 2-3 DGL capsules,a steeped brew twice per day of slippery elm powder(mix with milk and hot water) and one Digestive enzyme capsule at tea time. However if necessary I may still take the odd Lansoprazole if this new method fails to continue to do its job. By the way I am 63,male and currently awaiting a second knee replacement,medically retired in June last year from Royal Mail due to knee injury incurred on duty,I believe as a result of this inactivity (I have not worked since last June) this illness i.e Barretts et al appeared,the worry and inability to walk properly for 15 months has caused it to surface. I would be interested to know if anyone else has had a similar experience and whether or not anyone is using natural remedies for treating this horrible affliction which according to one nurse in Orthopaedics when I had my preop for knee replacement 'is nothing much' I quipped back that try telling me that at two in the morning when I'm still awake feeling like I've eaten a five course meal and cannot get comfortable in bed,anyway food for thought,I will be glad to hear of anyone else's experiences on the subject of Barretts and on alternative treatment.

Last week those symptoms returned with a vengeance and would not go away,so after scouring the Internet I decided to try a mixture of Diglycerinated liquorice,slippery elm,and a digestive enzyme bought from a local health shop and hey presto it seems to be working and for three days I have stopped taking Lansoprazole completely.

Meanwhile my consultant has instructed I raise my dose of lansoprazole to 60MG  and take it all at one time. I had previously been taking 45mg split into two doses daily. I started feeling sick and had diahrroea almost immediately and have had a blistery rash every now and again. i am wondering if this dose is just too high and if there is an alternative medication. the doc has done blood and stool sample tests this week , and i have no results as yet , but i have had a rubbish time over christmas with these problems. THE doctors are not all that knowledgable and say to stick with what the consultant says. they think that the large dose has surpressed the acid so much that its possible normal gut bacteria have been able to get a bit of a hold. what does anyone think? should i stick this out till next scope? have almost decided to get the hernia repair op.

I try to do more and more intermittent fasting (14:10) and not to eat after 5 pm. I start the day with an extensive breakfast, a light lunch and do dinner canceling. Between the meels I eat some healthy snacks. I try to avoid bad fats and eat a lot of rice, potatoes, veggies, fruits. Fish and chicken too with low amount of red meat. Not to forget that I do 2 times a week cardio training (do this before my diagnoses too) and 2 times muscle training (doing this I always be aware that I breath normaly during my exercises). My wish is going back to my normal weight but I cannot do this with my actual eating behavour. If I break this system I always feel completely guilty - not caring my barrett - MY vicious circle.

I'm 29 and otherwise in perfect health - not overweight, never smoked, exercise, only drink socially. My father has had it for a few years, but was diagnosed later in life and my aunt had esophageal   that she detected very late in stages and passed from complications (not from cancer so i'm told) - so it's clear there is some history there. I think what I'm hoping most for, is to just connect with others and hear success stories that this is something totally livable with and not putting a cap on my life years. I've googled and of course, everything comes up mentioning Cancer - which is terrifying. Additionally, I've read some things from others my own age about how they're coming to terms with potentially leaving their children and spouses behind, which is even more painful to read. My doctor mentioned my size is very small and there is no dysplasia - which sounds positive. I was prescribed a dosage of PPI's and have been researching diet lifestyles. More or less, I'm just hoping to hear that I have many, many years ahead of me and I can go on to live life as long and normally as any other person without Barrett's. It is devastating to think that my life could be cut short over something like acid reflux. I also worry that being diagnosed so young, and having more years to live with the disease, will shorten my life, too. Have many people lived long years with maintaining this? 0 likes, 25 replies "

Recovery in the hospital was a little longer than expected, I belive this was due to the fact that I was told by nurses to try and eat soup only a few hours after the op, and was being given several different tablets to swallow, this meant I actually kept being sick, aggravating the operation recovery, once they put me on IV pain relief and stopped suggesting I ate, I started to feel better.  Once home, my recovery was much better, the first week, understandably was the worse, lots of tenderness, lack of appetite and very lethargic, but this soon improved.

(not pleasant I know)  Since the operation, I have not had the slightest bit of indigestion/heartburn, I am on no medication and can eat just about anything.  My one downside from the operation is that my IBS is definitely worse than it was before, and as much as I hate this, I feel it's a small price to pay to help prevent the Barratts I was diagnosed with back in January 2015.

Lastly Dihydrocodeine for a year. 8 a day but sometimes up to 12 (30 mg, no paracetemol). I did a fast taper dropping 1 a day until none. Strangely and gratefully, the withdrawal wasn't bad at all. I had very minor stomach upset, sneezing, and no energy at all (also some depression). I managed about 6-7 hours of sleep a night and took nothing but magnesium at night in case of RLS and to help with sleep. The minor withdrawal lasted only a few days. I was very surprised by this and still have a hard time believing that i wasn't sick as a dog. I think i've been lucky regarding that and am grateful. The thing that is really bad is that PAWS has hit hard. I'm exhausted all the time. Absolutely wiped out. Along with this is depression and anxiety. I am able to function well for the most part but the PAWS is rough. Strangely, on day 5, NO DHC, i felt pretty normal. The next day, FULL PAWS. I know that all there is to do now is wait for the PAWS to lift a day at a time, exercise, eat healthy etc...

Well at the beginning of the semester we were talking about diabetes in class and not sure why but it sent me into a panic wonder if I had the disease (I have a history of anxiety,  I tend to worry excessively about things, but not formally diagnosed.) basically, since we began talking about diabetes in class, I’ve had the symptom of frequent urination. I’ve always seemed to go slightly more often than my friends ever since I was little but that’s normal for me. Lately, I feel like I have to go every hour or 2 and am constantly checking my body as to whether or not I have to go. It seems to be more frequent when I’m home and worrying. But it’s not like an overwhelming urge to go, just a feeling that my bladder is somewhat full. When I’m out or busy, not thinking about it I tend to go normally about 6-8 times a day. I also don’t get up at night to go. I don’t have any excessive thirst, blurred vision, yeast infections, slow healing, tingling, nothing like that. Just the sometimes frequent urination. I also don’t drink much water. When I do go it’s not a huge amount and sometimes I’ll go every 30 mins just to “check”. We had to take our blood glucose at school one day for a lab and mine was 98 but that was 2 hours after having a bacon egg and cheese on a roll lol.

I am a 42yr old female.  I have been since I was 15 or 14 skipping meals to maintain my weight so I can eat a lot at once.  My dieting has varied from when I was a teenager and in my 20's I'd go for 4 days each day eating less than 500 calories to binge eat for 3 days during high school and college whatever and how much food I wanted. Then in 1999, for around 6 months I stopped, gained some(went from 94lbs to 106lbs at 5'0"" tall.  Well I didn't like the way I looked, went back to some dieting from time to time.  When I got married in 2002, had 1 or 2 days at least a week of eating less than 500 calories.  I have had a few episodes over the years of low blood sugar at night had to eat some sugar, but it's all WORTH IT to NEVER EVER be fat, because for me, it's everything to look good. If you don't look good, you have nothing in this world. Everyone judges you on how you look whether it's your old high school friends or old boyfriends or getting a job to ever one day if your significant other dies or divorces that you had to go find someone new you would not look good to try to find someone it would be very difficult.  So for me, looking good is the only thing that matters, the ONLY THING in life for me, so for me, even when I had the episodes once in a while(could be a few times in let's say 2 or 3 years) of low blood sugar, it was all worth it to not be fat.  I only have had tingling hands when I had the low blood sugar episodes, which were always rare.  I did have my heart obviously beat kind of fast whenever I would do a simple task like going to use the bathroom or taking a shower.  The past around 5 years being doing 2 days a week less than 500 calories and 1 day a week around 850-900 calories. Weight loss of 5lbs a week(2lbs in one day weight loss for the 2 less than 500 calories) and 1 lb for the 850-900 calorie day.  Now, can't seem to diet at all.  I ate a large salad this past monday, which I was so hungry I ended up eating a 280 calorie bag of cookies after I felt I needed sugar.  I am really worried that I have something wrong.  My dad has type 2 diabetes since 1986, but he loss weight, I am GAINING weight(not much, but for me going from 98lbs to 101-102lbs is huge for me personally) and it is real weight since I have maintained this weight for since August.  As I said, I am not fat or chunky as I am 5 feet zero inches tall and weigh around 101lbs.  I have gotten my glucose test in July even and it was 87, which 110 is the most you can go to, so it's normal and the highest it was ever was 90.  So I am not sure what's going on since I was getting hungrier even back in July when I got this tested.  So I am not sure what is going on? Is it just perimenopause or is it insulin resistance or diabetes?  The thing that dumbfounded about is that I have been skipping meals since a teenager, but have   and all of a sudden I have some   at times,** but not losing weight** and have GAINED unlike my dad.  I have had since my early 20's frequent urination so I can't say that's a symptom.  I only have thirst issues if I have eaten something with a lot of salt and even when I have, most of the time I am not thirsty a lot, so that symptom you can't say I have either.  So the only thing I have is that I am hungry more often than usual and sometimes it has been an extreme hunger.  So I am not sure what is going on? Any thoughts?  I am not sure if not eating has caused my issue or eating too much carbs and sugar or it's none of that at all? As I said, my glucose has been fine and even had a time of extreme hunger last August, they tested my glucose, it was 90.  So I am not sure why I feel I am unable to do my diet days when before I could do it without issue that it wasn't that hard to live without much food in one day? For example, after a weekend of eating a lot, Mondays were easy, now I am extremely hungry even if I ate a lot on both Saturday and Sunday.  I am kind of worried it could be diabetes and I don't know how it could be since even just a few weeks ago, I dieted less than 500 calories and I didn't go into low blood sugar episode or anything like that? So I am not sure why I am so freakin hungry? What could it be? Don't say too much carbs and sugar since I have eaten this way since my late teens early 20's, so why would I start something weird now all of a sudden? 0 likes, 15 replies "

I am a 42yr old female.  I have been since I was 15 or 14 skipping meals to maintain my weight so I can eat a lot at once.  My dieting has varied from when I was a teenager and in my 20's I'd go for 4 days each day eating less than 500 calories to binge eat for 3 days during high school and college whatever and how much food I wanted. Then in 1999, for around 6 months I stopped, gained some(went from 94lbs to 106lbs at 5'0"" tall.  Well I didn't like the way I looked, went back to some dieting from time to time.  When I got married in 2002, had 1 or 2 days at least a week of eating less than 500 calories.  I have had a few episodes over the years of low blood sugar at night had to eat some sugar, but it's all WORTH IT to NEVER EVER be fat, because for me, it's everything to look good. If you don't look good, you have nothing in this world. Everyone judges you on how you look whether it's your old high school friends or old boyfriends or getting a job to ever one day if your significant other dies or divorces that you had to go find someone new you would not look good to try to find someone it would be very difficult.  So for me, looking good is the only thing that matters, the ONLY THING in life for me, so for me, even when I had the episodes once in a while(could be a few times in let's say 2 or 3 years) of low blood sugar, it was all worth it to not be fat.  I only have had tingling hands when I had the low blood sugar episodes, which were always rare.  I did have my heart obviously beat kind of fast whenever I would do a simple task like going to use the bathroom or taking a shower.  The past around 5 years being doing 2 days a week less than 500 calories and 1 day a week around 850-900 calories. Weight loss of 5lbs a week(2lbs in one day weight loss for the 2 less than 500 calories) and 1 lb for the 850-900 calorie day.  Now, can't seem to diet at all.  I ate a large salad this past monday, which I was so hungry I ended up eating a 280 calorie bag of cookies after I felt I needed sugar.  I am really worried that I have something wrong.  My dad has type 2 diabetes since 1986, but he loss weight, I am GAINING weight(not much, but for me going from 98lbs to 101-102lbs is huge for me personally) and it is real weight since I have maintained this weight for since August.  As I said, I am not fat or chunky as I am 5 feet zero inches tall and weigh around 101lbs.  I have gotten my glucose test in July even and it was 87, which 110 is the most you can go to, so it's normal and the highest it was ever was 90.  So I am not sure what's going on since I was getting hungrier even back in July when I got this tested.  So I am not sure what is going on? Is it just perimenopause or is it insulin resistance or diabetes?  The thing that dumbfounded about is that I have been skipping meals since a teenager, but have   and all of a sudden I have some   at times,** but not losing weight** and have GAINED unlike my dad.  I have had since my early 20's frequent urination so I can't say that's a symptom.  I only have thirst issues if I have eaten something with a lot of salt and even when I have, most of the time I am not thirsty a lot, so that symptom you can't say I have either.  So the only thing I have is that I am hungry more often than usual and sometimes it has been an extreme hunger.  So I am not sure what is going on? Any thoughts?  I am not sure if not eating has caused my issue or eating too much carbs and sugar or it's none of that at all? As I said, my glucose has been fine and even had a time of extreme hunger last August, they tested my glucose, it was 90.  So I am not sure why I feel I am unable to do my diet days when before I could do it without issue that it wasn't that hard to live without much food in one day? For example, after a weekend of eating a lot, Mondays were easy, now I am extremely hungry even if I ate a lot on both Saturday and Sunday.

A possible cure? ,"I am creating this thread in the hope it can be a place of hope and support for those with diabetes insipidus (or health issues that mimick this condition) and also possibly provide information to help some people resolve their symptoms, or dare I say it, find a cure. First, please let me state I am not a medical professional so please do your own research, I'm am just sharing my thoughts and ideas. From my research over the past 2 years I have reached the conclusion that many people diagnosed with cranial diabetes insipidus, particularly idiopathic cranial  diabetes insipidus may have a different underlying condition that may be causing their symptoms and may actually be able to resolve these issues and possibly cure the disease. I find new cases whenever I look,  of diabetes insipidus that has gone into remission or gone away after a patient has taken certain medications for conditions not thought to be related to diabetes insipidus. There seems to be a link between immunosuppressent drugs given to patients that has often resulted in the symptoms of diabetes insipidus disappearing. Could diabetes insipidus for some people actually be caused by an autoimmine condition? And some medications taken for autoimmine issues can possibly resolve diabetes insipidus? I'm my opinion there are those with diabetes insipidus due to genuine pituitary / hypothalamus issues be it from a tumor, inflammation, head trauma etc but there are also those who have an autoimmine condition which somehow suppress vasopressin. I also believe there are those that do not have anything organically wrong with their production of vasopressin but for some reason the body has become confused and has become hypersensitive to fluid intake and believes the body needs far less fluid then is actually adequate. As if the water level for the body has been lowered dramatically and whenever you try and hydrate the body instantly wants to dump the fluids out but at the same time people with this issue can still produce vasopressin and their condition often fluctuates. I have probably said enough for now but I will share some studies and stories of diabetes insipidus in my next posts. Please feel free to get involved and share your experiences and ideas on this subject and if you kmow of any stories of improvement/cure of diabetes insipidus please post them here.

A possible cure? ,"I am creating this thread in the hope it can be a place of hope and support for those with diabetes insipidus (or health issues that mimick this condition) and also possibly provide information to help some people resolve their symptoms, or dare I say it, find a cure. First, please let me state I am not a medical professional so please do your own research, I'm am just sharing my thoughts and ideas. From my research over the past 2 years I have reached the conclusion that many people diagnosed with cranial diabetes insipidus, particularly idiopathic cranial  diabetes insipidus may have a different underlying condition that may be causing their symptoms and may actually be able to resolve these issues and possibly cure the disease. I find new cases whenever I look,  of diabetes insipidus that has gone into remission or gone away after a patient has taken certain medications for conditions not thought to be related to diabetes insipidus. There seems to be a link between immunosuppressent drugs given to patients that has often resulted in the symptoms of diabetes insipidus disappearing. Could diabetes insipidus for some people actually be caused by an autoimmine condition? And some medications taken for autoimmine issues can possibly resolve diabetes insipidus? I'm my opinion there are those with diabetes insipidus due to genuine pituitary / hypothalamus issues be it from a tumor, inflammation, head trauma etc but there are also those who have an autoimmine condition which somehow suppress vasopressin. I also believe there are those that do not have anything organically wrong with their production of vasopressin but for some reason the body has become confused and has become hypersensitive to fluid intake and believes the body needs far less fluid then is actually adequate. As if the water level for the body has been lowered dramatically and whenever you try and hydrate the body instantly wants to dump the fluids out but at the same time people with this issue can still produce vasopressin and their condition often fluctuates. I have probably said enough for now but I will share some studies and stories of diabetes insipidus in my next posts. Please feel free to get involved and share your experiences and ideas on this subject and if you kmow of any stories of improvement/cure of diabetes insipidus please post them here. I will find a way. Thank you. 2 likes, 24 replies "
