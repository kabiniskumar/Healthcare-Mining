The right side of my body does not feel the same as my left. Everyday i have discomfort in my right arm my right leg and sometimes even the right side of my face. My arm and leg have a sort of numbing sensation and sometimes feel rather cold.I've had people point out that i was limping along with when i walk my right foot feels heavier. I have noticed i am acquiring some muscle imbalance in my back noticeably. The right side of my face will sometimes feel as if the muscles are extremely tight and my right eyebrow will be raised as if it was being pulled up. Sometimes my right eyeball has pain as well as if somebody has been applying pressure to it. I do believe i have pinched nerve behind my scapula. I have pain in that area for a while however over the past year my symptoms have gotten worse. If anybody has any input it would be greatly appreciated. Thank You,"

I wasn't wearing a seat belt, and flew into the dash. It was a very bad crash and a very hard hit.

It hurt so bad, I couldn't even touch it, brush my hair, or even open my mouth for almost two weeks (It hurt my temple when I opened my mouth). It gradually improved, and got to where it would just very dully ache every other day or so. Well, as of yesterday, my entire head has been feeling pain in random, spread out places (the place that got hit months back hurting the worst). It isn't an unbearable pain or anything, but it's just worrisome. I also feel a tingling, almost numb sensation all across my head, but very amplified in my temple area. It has almost felt like something is ""moving"" where I got hit a few times over the past two days. I'm also going to clarify that I did not go to the doctor after the wreck, so I'm not 100% sure it was a concussion, but I'm just assuming it was due to how hard of a hit it was. My mom insists I'm okay, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that I swam pretty vigorously around 5 days ago (hand stands, flips underwater, lots of playing around with my younger cousins). She said that may could have played a part in it, but of course my anxiety tries to tell me it is something much worse, such as a blood clot or serious brain damage. I've read about Post-Concussion Syndrome, and I'm honestly not sure if this is it (partly because I didn't get the doctor's say that it was a concussion to begin with, but I'm pretty positive myself). I'm mainly just scared that I've developed a blood clot over the past few months due to the impact, and I'm going to have a stroke or something as severe. I know no one can speak for sure on this issue, but any suggestions or experiences with head injuries or anything of the sorts would be very very appreciated. Thank you all in ahead of time! (P.S. I have a yearly checkup next week, and I'm going to go ahead and ask about this when I'm there.

I am 30, a FT (returning) student and FT manager and am feeling overwhelmed in my last semester before graduation. I have been throwing up when I wake up on busy days for nearly a year. I have panic attacks about twice a month which numb my face and blur my hearing. I believe that most of my anxiety is related to untreated ADD. My parents did not believe in it and ignored and were insulted by teacher conferences where it was discussed. I struggled to graduate highschool, but moved away from a chaotic situation and began community college, where I began using marijuana to focus. Suddenly, I was on the deans list, I have self-medicated this way since. Since I have a high gpa and no need for academic accommodation, my councilor sent me to the nurse she didn't feel the need to investigate add. The RN prescribed celexa, which has stopped the panic attacks and vomiting. With graduation approaching, I feel that the only way I can quit marijuana use and obtain a next-level position is by properly treating my ADD. I have quit pot multiple times for 2 months or so and I show up to work on my days off, lose my phone in the freezer/linen cabinent/street, and perform substantially lower on tests. So now what? How does a grown woman reach out for help with ADD? Oh and I don't have a family DR., I usually go 1-3 years between trips to urgent care, which is why I went to the medical center at school. Any advice for my next steps is greatly appreciated! I have meant to write this post for years so please no attacks!"

Can Sudafed, Minoxidil and Calcium heartburn pills cause high BP and heart rate???","Hi, Yesterday, 12/28/17, I had a drug interaction. I was cleaning my wood pellet stove and during the process I noticed I was sweating and my heart was racing. I sat down in front of my clock and checked my heart rate, it was 162 BPM!  I had a doctor's appointment that day anyway, so I took a shower and got dressed to go to my orthopedic. I felt a little off while I was in the office and spent like I ran a marathon. When the nurse put the finger heart rate monitor on I noticed my heart was still running between 115 and 120. My BP was 140/110 also high. I think something I put into my body yesterday interacted with my prescription meds.  I said something to the nurse when I saw my heart rate, she said to speak to the doctor about it.  I started using Minoxidil 5% Wednesday to help thicken one side of my beard and assumed that maybe it was interacting with my meds because it was only my second day taking it. I checked for drug interactions and didn't see any between it and my meds when I started using it. The doctor told me that Minoxidil shouldn't cause this condition. The minoxidil box says Minoxidil can cause your heart to race. I googled minoxidil interactions and found several people who claim they had interactions immediately after using it.  I went home, alerted my psychiatric nurse and then took to the internet to try to find some answers.  My heart rate and BP came back down last evening.  I found several things that could have caused a problem and was hoping someone might be able to shed some light on the issue.  I take three prescription drugs daily 10mg ritalin 3x daily for ADHD (just started taking in May) 100mg Zoloft 1 x daily for PTSD 100mg Seroquel 1x daily for insomnia I went untreated for years and began to suffer extreme anxiety and depression, so I saw a doctor last November. Ultimately I was diagnosed as ADHD and PTSD. I've had sleeping problems since I hit puberty, it's genetic on my mother's side of the family so I addressed that too.  I also have SIBO, small intestine bacteria over production. I'm on a low FODMAP diet, and mostly use aloe vera gel and occasionally use calcium pills to control heart burn.  When I started taking these meds I was 20 pounds lighter. My resting blood pressure was 107/70 and my resting heart rate was about 55-60.  I started smoking again last year, then I injured my right forearm so I stopped working out on top of it all. My blood pressure has steadily climbed. At my last visit to my Psychiatric nurse WEDNESDAY this week my BP was 128/80 and my heart rate was 60 BPM.  I asked my nurse if she thought the Ritalin was causing my BP to rise, she said it's the smoking and lack of exercise. I quit smoking tobacco a month ago, and switched to an e-cig, I'm down to 3MG of nicotine, next step is 0 so I'm dealing with that. As soon as my arm is 100% I'll return to the gym too.  On Christmas Eve my wife made a beautiful spread of food I shoudn't eat, but I did anyway. On top of that I did some drinking, vodka, club soda and OJ over the weekend and through Wednesday night. My heartburn was out of control from Christmas eve and is just starting to subside right now so I've been taking more calcium pills to help control the heartburn.  I found an article that said Calcium pills can raise the PH level in your stomach which can cause Ritalin to absorb more into your blood stream.  I found another article that said Minoxidil can cause a racing heart rate because of a sudden decrease in blood pressure. The article said that your heart will race to bring your blood pressure back up, but no data to confirm that hypothesis.  I've also got a cold, I've been taking a generic Sudafed 12 hour for a week or so too. I found that the Sudafed I was taking can interact with Ritalin, but again no data to confirm. By the way it's real Sudafed, not the PE. And for the record I took some Sudafed this spring and didn't notice any problems, but I was 20 lbs lighter and in better shape.  Did I mix a dangerous concoction of Ritalin, Sudafed, Calcium pills? I didn't take Ritalin, minoxidil or Sudafed today. I'm gonna just deal with the cold, and would love someone to weigh in on what could have caused this issue.  That's all I've got. Thanks in advance."

Until then he lived at home with me as his primary care giver (with support from our 4 children) as well as for the past nine years he attended an ""Alzheimer's Day Care Center"" 3 days a week. He does come from a family with a history of longevity, but also our research proved that there is a strong tendency of Dementia/Alzheimer's.

I plan on asking her doctor about the connection but I can't sleep and I stay awake reading articles such as this, and frankly I don't want her doctor to think I'm a fool, or be one of those people who thinks they know more then the doctors who are tirelessly trying to find answers."

I played again a week later and the rest is history.  I came home from that game and could not leave a dark room for over 3 months. The next year was terrible.

Here we go again.  July of 2017 I was golfing even though I could barley function and during my violent swing and twisting my head I saw stars and again felt much worse in the next few weeks.  August of 2017 is a month I will never forget. I was selling a home for a gal and she thought she could help me with my issues and offered to hook me up to electrical stimulation via ear clips. After declining a few times I decided to give it a try. at first I could not feel anything. then I started feeling my brain pumping with each electrical pulse. after what I think was a few minutes. I took them off cause I could not function.  After this I started shaking and had the chills every second of every day. I hardly new my name for months and I still have symptoms to this day.  I am nauseous ever day. Cant look at computer screens. My neck gets super tight all the time. mostly in the back of my neck and then going down my back.

97,C0016053,Fibromyalgia,"C0596601, C0015672, C3714552","gastrointestinal gas, Fatigue, Weakness",https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/51960/where-would-i-get-this-exraordinary-ability-tested,Where would I get this exraordinary ability tested?,"My age is 49, my sex is male, and I am caucasian. All indications are that I have an extremely rare (not sure even how rare, I am sure other people have it, but I could be the only person on the planet to do it at this extreme) autustic ability. Before you read this, please do not dismiss what I am about to say as impossible, because I already had some of this ability tested at my doctor's office and it has atleast been verified that I can do it well enough that it is beyond a normal person's abilities. Furthermore my parents have witnessed me do it all my life. And lastly it took like 8 hours of search on the internet (thats how rare it is to find info on this) to find a reference by a medical doctor who talks about a rare occurence with fibromyalgia that can also happen with autistic patients because of how both disabilities effect the central nervous system. As I understand it, some fibromyalgia and autistic patients only require maybe a 1000th of the stimuli from a sensory gland of a normal person to detect something, because of how their central nervous system gets stimulated so much more easily or reacts much more faster (not sure which). The reference on the internet I found speaks of fibromyalgia patients who can hear the humming of the ballast tubes in flourescent lights that no normal human can hear, because of their central nervous system. That reference also refers to the possibility of it also effecting a fibromyalgia or autistic's sense of smell. In my case, almost all my senses are effected to some extent but smell seems to be effected the greatest. Let me give some examples. When I was around 18. I was in my bedoom behind a closed door, with tape all over the door to keep smells out (thats how sensitive I am to smells), and I am like 40 feet away from the kitchen and my sister cooks a tv dinner (like fish with white wine source). Both my mother and sister are standing 3 or 4 feet from the microwave and can't smell the alcohol. I smell it behind the taped door in my bedoom, from 40 feet away. I also smell odors thru walls, thru pipes, etc. Recently, just happened a couple months ago, I smelled something like a dead animal when I was in a car (the smell was overwhelming to me). Both my parents were in the front of the car and couldn't smell something that was overwhelming to me, and it wasn't until the moving car went for another couple minutes that my parents could finally smell it. So maybe 200 to 300 feet or perhaps more feet in distance before they could pick up the smell. Just another case of how much farther away I can smell stuff then normal people. And as I mentioned earlier my doctors office tested and verified that I wasn't just imagining this ability. I go to a therapist for my autism. The therapist told me that he put a tiny amount of cleaning stuff on a chair to test me (I was unaware that he did it until after the test was over). A patient came in 15 minutes later, and even sat in the chair and could not smell it. Then a patient came in an hour later and sat in chair, and couldn't smell it. Then another in 2 hours, then another in 3 hours. I came in 4 hours later and smelled it, as soon as I opened the door, and could even state where the smell is coming from, the chair. The same therapist also tested me another 20 to 30 times, and each time I correctly identified the smell, and it was a smell that was too weak for normal people to pick up. And today, believe it or not, I smelled better then a gas detection meter. I'm getting tired of typing so will summarize quickly. I lived next to gas stoves for 32.5 years and never reported a gas leak. What are the mathematical odds, if you pick a random day in 32. 5 years to just report that you smell gas and there really is a leak, and it is just coincidence? The gas man is saying it is impossible because his meter (which apparently isn't as accurate as me) didn't pick up the smell in the hallway, when I smelled gas coming from a neighbor's apartment. Never reported something like this in 32.5 years of being around gas stoves. The day I reported it, the gas man, goes into the apartment and checks the stove and there is a leak (I was correct). And just to be clear again: I walked in front of every apartment in the building, didn't smell gas at any, except for the one where the gas man actually said there was a leak and I never reported a gas leak in 32.5 years of being around gas stoves. It would be around a 1 in 60,000 (or higher) mathematical probability that it was done by random chance. The gas detection meter couldn't detect the gas in the hallway, but the only way I could of known which apartment out of all of them in the building had the leak, and the only way I could of reported this on the correct day of the leak (when I never reported a gas leak in 32.5 years) is it was NOT random chance or coincidence. At this point, I really like to find out what is going on and get as close to an exact number to how much better I smell then a normal person. I live in Pennsylvania, but I could travel if necessary.

Many confusing undiagnosed symptoms.","When I was 12-13 I was running fast in the hallway at school. I dropped my lunch box outward and while running I bent over to attempt to retrieve it and with my head tilted down I hit my head on the corner of a wall hard. I then had a big pool of blood about a few feet wide on the ground. I lived up in the Rocky Mountains and was taken to a small clinic there and they only gave me stitches. No ER room, no tests. The scar is about four inches long.  When I was 14-15 my friend told me I could see cool rainbows if I tried something. He told me to sit upside down on my head on a couch, push and blow air into my head as hard as I could while he held my ears closed, and I held my nose and mouth closed so the air had nowhere to go. I did not see rainbows. I pushed as hard as I could over and over for a few minutes with not having much room for the air to escape.  Since I am not there, hypothetically speaking what kind of damage could have occured from all of this? I've heard others online say things like herniated sinus, damage to vagus nerve, cranial damage, etc. I've also heard people say its just anxiety or I'm over reacting, but my eyes become bloodshot after bending over, that's a direct physiological response, I don't just have anxiety. Could my brain be swelling for some reason after bending over causing the red eyes? I would like to know what to tell the doctor or what kind of tests I should have. I'll be seeing a physical therapist in a month for my back, I'll tell him about the head or nasal issues.  Symptoms: These can last the whole day, part of the day, or a short time.  When I bend over forward or tilt my head too far (other triggers too see below) my eyes become red and burn, vision a little blurred. I feel pain somewhere I think in my nasal cavity. I feel like there is some kind of unequal pressure in my head and pain as I move it around like my brain is swollen or it feels like I have painful moving slight water logged head. It becomes a lot harder to think, foggy thinking. I have difficulties remembering things. Decreased cognitive ability. While its happening I have a lot less energy, my heart feels stressed if I try to run while feeling like this, I feel a throbbing sensation in my fingers and other places. Sudden or inconsistent sounds and or lights feel like they are ""grabbing"" at my heart or cause a little pain in my head. Some kind of slight epilepsy? (I also had a head injury a little before then see below) I think I've had a couple of small seizures. I feel like I need to keep my head as level as I can and can't tilt it past a certain point. When my eyes turn red I also feel a strong sensation of my pulse at the tips of my fingers and increased awareness of my heartbeat, but the doctor says everything about my heartbeat is normal. I feel a throbbing sensation in other parts of my body too.  Also when laying down I get tiny air bubbles that trickle out of one of my nostrils making a tick, tick sound, even when I hold my breath, doesn't seem to be coming from my lungs. Not sure if that's related. When it goes back to feeling mostly normal and I feel better, my head still feels ""not solid"" and feels like I need to avoid bending over. I think I've also had a couple of small seizures, I fainted once in the bathroom and when becoming conscious again it was like my arms were locked together.  Symptom Triggers: Some are stronger than others. Pushing when pooping or farting. Tilting my head too far. Bending over. Breathing through my nose or blowing my nose. Swallowing. Sucking. Sneezing. Also sudden or inconsistent sounds or flashing lights feel like they are ""grabbing"" at my heart or cause pain in my head.  ----- Now years later with a possible back injury, when walking I feel pain in my heels (does not radiate throughout legs) each time I feel pain in my heels I feel a corresponding pain in my head. It seems like Sciatica from what I've read, except Sciatica doesn't radiate to the head. Rolling my heels slightly, or being on uneven surfaces feels like it pinches my heels and at the same time causes a pinching pain feeling in my head and each step triggers some or all of the above symptoms temporarily or for longer time.  Not sure if this has anything to do with it, I didn't feel different after this even, but also when about about 10 years old I was riding my bike in the street and I got knocked out, I remembered something about a lady saying something like ""Its your fault!"" I think I got hit by a car. I came home, later people told me for a few hours I didn't know who my family was and then I went to sleep for a few hours and woke up normal. They didn't take me to the ER or doctor for that either. I had scrapes on my body including my head. No scar or stitches from that. Broken bike though.  Considering all of the above, I have many symptoms and many theories. Could part of my brain be getting pinched in a crack in my cranium? Could my brain be swelling for some reason? Could I have a hernia in my nasal cavity somehow? How could that affect my brain? What connects my heels to my back and my head? I'm not sure."

It becomes a lot harder to think, foggy thinking. I have difficulties remembering things. Decreased cognitive ability. While its happening I have a lot less energy, my heart feels stressed if I try to run while feeling like this, I feel a throbbing sensation in my fingers and other places. Sudden or inconsistent sounds and or lights feel like they are ""grabbing"" at my heart or cause a little pain in my head. Some kind of slight epilepsy? (I also had a head injury a little before then see below) I think I've had a couple of small seizures. I feel like I need to keep my head as level as I can and can't tilt it past a certain point. When my eyes turn red I also feel a strong sensation of my pulse at the tips of my fingers and increased awareness of my heartbeat, but the doctor says everything about my heartbeat is normal. I feel a throbbing sensation in other parts of my body too.  Also when laying down I get tiny air bubbles that trickle out of one of my nostrils making a tick, tick sound, even when I hold my breath, doesn't seem to be coming from my lungs. Not sure if that's related. When it goes back to feeling mostly normal and I feel better, my head still feels ""not solid"" and feels like I need to avoid bending over. I think I've also had a couple of small seizures, I fainted once in the bathroom and when becoming conscious again it was like my arms were locked together.  Symptom Triggers: Some are stronger than others. Pushing when pooping or farting. Tilting my head too far. Bending over. Breathing through my nose or blowing my nose. Swallowing. Sucking. Sneezing. Also sudden or inconsistent sounds or flashing lights feel like they are ""grabbing"" at my heart or cause pain in my head.  ----- Now years later with a possible back injury, when walking I feel pain in my heels (does not radiate throughout legs) each time I feel pain in my heels I feel a corresponding pain in my head. It seems like Sciatica from what I've read, except Sciatica doesn't radiate to the head. Rolling my heels slightly, or being on uneven surfaces feels like it pinches my heels and at the same time causes a pinching pain feeling in my head and each step triggers some or all of the above symptoms temporarily or for longer time.  Not sure if this has anything to do with it, I didn't feel different after this even, but also when about about 10 years old I was riding my bike in the street and I got knocked out, I remembered something about a lady saying something like ""Its your fault!"" I think I got hit by a car. I came home, later people told me for a few hours I didn't know who my family was and then I went to sleep for a few hours and woke up normal. They didn't take me to the ER or doctor for that either. I had scrapes on my body including my head. No scar or stitches from that. Broken bike though.  Considering all of the above, I have many symptoms and many theories. Could part of my brain be getting pinched in a crack in my cranium? Could my brain be swelling for some reason? Could I have a hernia in my nasal cavity somehow? How could that affect my brain? What connects my heels to my back and my head? I'm not sure."

Many confusing undiagnosed symptoms.","When I was 12-13 I was running fast in the hallway at school. I dropped my lunch box outward and while running I bent over to attempt to retrieve it and with my head tilted down I hit my head on the corner of a wall hard. I then had a big pool of blood about a few feet wide on the ground. I lived up in the Rocky Mountains and was taken to a small clinic there and they only gave me stitches. No ER room, no tests. The scar is about four inches long.  When I was 14-15 my friend told me I could see cool rainbows if I tried something. He told me to sit upside down on my head on a couch, push and blow air into my head as hard as I could while he held my ears closed, and I held my nose and mouth closed so the air had nowhere to go. I did not see rainbows. I pushed as hard as I could over and over for a few minutes with not having much room for the air to escape.  Since I am not there, hypothetically speaking what kind of damage could have occured from all of this? I've heard others online say things like herniated sinus, damage to vagus nerve, cranial damage, etc. I've also heard people say its just anxiety or I'm over reacting, but my eyes become bloodshot after bending over, that's a direct physiological response, I don't just have anxiety. Could my brain be swelling for some reason after bending over causing the red eyes? I would like to know what to tell the doctor or what kind of tests I should have. I'll be seeing a physical therapist in a month for my back, I'll tell him about the head or nasal issues.  Symptoms: These can last the whole day, part of the day, or a short time.

It is very rare and there was one other suffer in your forum that I have been wondering/worrying a lot about lately (Mikey44). Mikey if you are out there I hope everything is ok??? Haven't heard from you in quite a while and was a little worried about you. Did you go through with the foot amputation? Just letting you know that you are still in my thoughts, and hope you are having expert opinions and a bit more pain control. All the best, Amanda : )"

I am writing to seek help and advice from anyone who knows what the problem is. Basically she is experiencing: Uncontrollable spasms from her abdomen The spasms worsen when she is feeling discomfort such as migraines, menstrual cramps The spasms will cause her heart to feel weak She has seen many G.Ps in the past but she was diagnosed as being stressed and given anti-depressants. However, that did not help the condition. This condition has been very disruptive to her life and I wish to have some insight on the type of illness it is. Hope you guys can help a brother out. Thank you."

What I and others are experiencing around this topic is unrelated and has no correlation to anxiety. Anybody who says it is not going through this, is being hard headed and as well in a hurry to jump to a conclusion. Yes the symptoms include anxiety but it is not the root cause of the problem. Unfortunately when bringing up this topic with most health care ""professionals"" they just write it off as. I first started noticing the effects of this pathogen three years prior, (mid of 2015) as well as remembering controlling the entirety of my body & being completely healthy. So far roughly around every single doctor or neurologist I have went to in my area has assumed I have been incorrect about my hypothesis about my self diagnosis or to go as far and call me delusional. With regard to whether anybody believes me or not is not of my interest but to dispute and to further archive my self diagnosis is my main concern. The brain stem is connected directly to the tongue, which is therefor essential for most of the motor functions of the human body. Now to say that if saliva embedded with pathogenic bacteria could make its way from the tongue, to the brain stem, to the peripheral nervous system, to basically spread to parts of the brain could it? The head tremor started when I felt my neck snap in certain places. It was a rather disgusting sound I felt. I feel as though as there are nerves on the back of my neck crawling, running up to my head. At times rising to the sides of my head, extending to my frontal lobe. It is followed by deterioration and tremor of the vision, cognitive impairment, consistent nightmares and other serious issues. I remember scouring the Internet for drugs that could possibly reverse the initial effects of the tremor. I came across Trazodone. I will vouch for this drug 100% My saliva is indeed the root cause of all of this. Within the first initial week of taking the drug my saliva regenerated, became thick again and every single part of my body became free of any sort of tremor.  Unfortunately for me I ended up distorting my sleep schedule which ultimately ended up (no idea how) slimming my saliva back down to this cottony, weak texture. With that brought back the tremor. Saliva in all cases tells how healthy person is. If it is thick and sticky that usually means a person is fine and healthy. If it is vice versa, generally the person is not. I'm certainly most likely experiencing a case of nerodegeneration. To make things worse my family and personal doctor think I am making this up and do not believe me. Adding to the palm to the face I have no money for an MRI or ""decent"" health insurance. I have been reading studies about the drugs Trazodone and Dibenzoyl methane to possibly slow the effects of the spreading disease. Taking the first medication I can say it indeed does but does not eliminate it.  I argue that this was passed orally and is slowly worsening . I am certain it is a pathogenic bacteria but not entirely sure. To reiterate my intention is to archive my findings and possibly to spread awareness. Let me also say there are more people than me going through this. This is a severe issue that I will not label as just anxiety. the image uploaded shows parts of the brain affected. To go into detail, the red areas that I've circled are parallel to the health issues. The vision / eye tremor being caused by infected optical lobe, tremor on the face being caused by the infected facial nerves. ect.... Pretty much my entire body is subjected to it. The bacteria or pathogen is slowly spreading across the brain. Yes I am absolutely terrified. By next year I can be put in a state of dementia and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it unless I can get the help i'm in dire need of.  No I am not over analyzing my situation. Reason why my personal doctor does not believe me is because he says impossible to be transmitted anything via saliva . I may look normal when you see me but I feel a tremor on my brain stem and twitch constantly. Feelings of depression hit even harder than they used to.I heard phage treatment may be an answer and I am willing to spend the rest of my money on it, but I have no way of knowing how to diagnose myself. I can't get that kind of treatment unless I get a diagnosis that shows what is wrong. A blood test shows my white cell count normal. Unless the location I went to get my testing done did not correctly run my information , to be honest I am lost. I would not be pressing this issue if there wasn't anything wrong with me."

Detailed explanation and symptoms: I need help getting my Mom diagnosed and admitted to a hospital until they are 100% positive about her diagnosis.  My Mom has had chest pain for over 6 months, probably a year. She coughed up Blood 2 weeks ago and is not a smoker. In November, when I knew something was wrong; I told her to go the ER - I made her go quite honestly. They did an EKG, and said everything was fine and her heart looked good. I know she has a lung problem, thyroid problem and possibly a brain problem. I am positive because of handwriting analysis. I backed off for a while after her EKG was good because I was worrying her and my parents were both getting upset. She had mild and completely random - maybe once a week or once every two weeks - problems with her memory. She had random leg pain only in one leg and she didn’t know how to describe it. She had a minor and very little cough I think she has been hiding from me. In December, around Christmas, she was watching my baby and she said she reached for something behind the radio and pulled a muscle. I kept telling her to go make sure that was all it was and she just kept ignoring it. She had the pain to where at times I could tell it was bothering her and at times it hurt her to sit and feed my baby when she visited which really bugged me. This pain she had was in her upper left quadrant (near her ribs and she described it as basically from the front of the lower rib area to the back of the lower rib area). She never had it looked at! It hurt her for ATLEAST a month probably more like 2 months.  I have noticed her “tripping” or losing balance for the past 3-6 months but it is becoming more and more often. I said something to her almost every time I seen it happen and she brushes it off as if nothing happened. Well, it has got more and more frequent to the point I’m worried she will fall and really hurt herself or while holding my baby, fall and hurt my baby along with herself!! :(  Also, she told me just recently she has been having a lot more symptoms than I realized. I made her go to the ER last night with the following symptoms: -Coughed up blood clot 2 weeks ago -Fatigue -Anxiety and Stress (she attributes to being from her job and some of it probably is) -Feels like it’s hard to swallow -she is always clearing her throat -recently I see her grabbing her neck more and more (universal sign for choking) -lack of balance -dry cough -feels like she is congested -coughed up almost a 1 inch blood clot less than 2 weeks ago -Charlie horse pains often in her right foot and lower leg (sign of DVT) -she described to me she “felt like there was a blood clot in her neck”  -she physically looks drained -she seems to know something is wrong -she is forgetting things she never should forget (she bought my baby an elephant and it’s head and ears flap - she was SO happy to show my baby this toy and less than ONE or TWO months later, she asked me who got it for my daughter!! I almost cried because I know something is wrong. Her grandma had mini strokes often and her grandma and grandpa were both on blood thinners. Last night they gave her a contrast ct of her chest, blood work and d-dimer and told her she did not have a PE or lun cancer. They didn’t even check her right leg for a DVT!  She is also lightheaded and said she gets dizzy when she goes to lay straight back or when she touches or lays on a specific area on the back top of her head.  They didn’t even do an MRI!!!! They released her with a diagnosis of coughing up blood - they didn’t even do enough testing to find out wtf is going on!!!!! Please help. Before her contrast ct last night they gave her Ativan via her IV... she went to work after the hospital without sleeping even though she assured me she would sleep. Today, on the way home from work, she actually went off the road and could have Really got hurt. That was almost a full 10-12 HOURS after the Ativan. I realize lack of sleep could cause it but I know something is SERIOUSLY wrong. She has an apt. Monday at 8am. I am going to type a letter with all of her symptoms and demand they admit me her and find out what is causing all of these symptoms. I’m frustrated and disgusted with the care she is receiving. I also took her to the PCP on Monday last week who listened and said that it couldn’t be a PE because coughing blood isn’t a sign of a PE (MORON) and he ordered a CBC diff and lipid panel or whatever and a CT without contrast which he said needed a pre with from insurance."

I almost cried because I know something is wrong. Her grandma had mini strokes often and her grandma and grandpa were both on blood thinners. Last night they gave her a contrast ct of her chest, blood work and d-dimer and told her she did not have a PE or lun cancer. They didn’t even check her right leg for a DVT!  She is also lightheaded and said she gets dizzy when she goes to lay straight back or when she touches or lays on a specific area on the back top of her head.  They didn’t even do an MRI!!!! They released her with a diagnosis of coughing up blood - they didn’t even do enough testing to find out wtf is going on!!!!! Please help. Before her contrast ct last night they gave her Ativan via her IV... she went to work after the hospital without sleeping even though she assured me she would sleep. Today, on the way home from work, she actually went off the road and could have Really got hurt. That was almost a full 10-12 HOURS after the Ativan. I realize lack of sleep could cause it but I know something is SERIOUSLY wrong. She has an apt. Monday at 8am. I am going to type a letter with all of her symptoms and demand they admit me her and find out what is causing all of these symptoms. I’m frustrated and disgusted with the care she is receiving.

Detailed explanation and symptoms: I need help getting my Mom diagnosed and admitted to a hospital until they are 100% positive about her diagnosis.  My Mom has had chest pain for over 6 months, probably a year. She coughed up Blood 2 weeks ago and is not a smoker. In November, when I knew something was wrong; I told her to go the ER - I made her go quite honestly. They did an EKG, and said everything was fine and her heart looked good. I know she has a lung problem, thyroid problem and possibly a brain problem. I am positive because of handwriting analysis. I backed off for a while after her EKG was good because I was worrying her and my parents were both getting upset. She had mild and completely random - maybe once a week or once every two weeks - problems with her memory. She had random leg pain only in one leg and she didn’t know how to describe it. She had a minor and very little cough I think she has been hiding from me. In December, around Christmas, she was watching my baby and she said she reached for something behind the radio and pulled a muscle. I kept telling her to go make sure that was all it was and she just kept ignoring it. She had the pain to where at times I could tell it was bothering her and at times it hurt her to sit and feed my baby when she visited which really bugged me. This pain she had was in her upper left quadrant (near her ribs and she described it as basically from the front of the lower rib area to the back of the lower rib area). She never had it looked at! It hurt her for ATLEAST a month probably more like 2 months.  I have noticed her “tripping” or losing balance for the past 3-6 months but it is becoming more and more often.

Made me go see a doctor. Doctor lost his ***, made ultrasound, said ""yeah there is something going on there, probably have to get medications"" (talks to me nervously for 1,5 hours). Sends me to a cardiologist. Cardiologist does ultrasound too, also on the heart (+ stress ECG, looked good). He shows me 2 minimal spots where there was minimal buildup of what could be plaque in one of the carotid arteries. Says he neither understands the reaction by first doctor, nor sees any correlation between what he saw in ultrasound and that x-ray. Is genuinely baffled. Says I should exercise and quit smoking, but there is no ""stenosis"" or need for medication. Blood levels still pending. Can anybody help me? I really need to know wtf happened.

I am 28 years old and my grandfather is 72. He recently has been exhibiting memory problems.  Examples include: asking me a question and starting a conversation with me and then asking the same question again 2 more times by the end of the day, going to the grocery store and not remembering what he needed (my grandma gave him a list, he went to the store, was gone for over an hour, then returned with a pound of deli meat and told my grandma that he lost the list and couldn't remember what he was doing at the store), calling Best Buy (Geek Squad) to fix the computer and then forgetting what company he called to come fix it (he had spoken to Best Buy on the phone about 3 times that day, but couldn't remember who he called), he tried to drive to the Department of Motor Vehicles following verbal directions my grandmother gave him but he forgot where he was going and spent hours driving around before coming home (the next day my grandmother gave him written directions but he lost them and returned home again saying that he couldn't remember where to go - he has been to this DMV before) ...  These behaviors are simply NOT like him. He is usually very sharp and even witty during conversations. My grandfather has not seen a doctor more than twice in the 28 years I've been alive. He hates doctors and tells us that if he ever needs a doctor for anything to just let him die. Due to this fear of doctors, he has not and will not see a doctor for his memory problems. He admits that he is having memory issues, and seems concerned, but will not take steps to figure out the cause.  My grandfather has been an alcoholic since before I was born and is a daily marijuana smoker. I though that maybe these were to blame, but my mom told me yesterday that both of my grandfather's parents exhibited similar symptoms leading up to the day they died. We don't know the exact cause of their deaths and my family often says ""they got old, their bodies began to shut down, and they died in the hospital"".  I'd like to know what these memory loss symptoms could be. I really wish he would see a doctor, but he simply won't. Does anybody recognize these symptoms?"

I am a young woman who was diagnosed with POTS since September of 2017. It took a very long time to get this diagnosis but has me questioning the diagnosis along with another reputable doctor. I am convinced it could be a CFS leak- based on my symptoms and findings. Hear me out and I’d love feedback if this could sound like it.  My first baby was born in 2014. Prior, I had been healthy, very active and fit; a gym rat. I had an epidural which worked well. Came out of that birth fine with some minor back pain, got back to getting fit and was in the best shape of my life.  Feb of 2016, I fell pregnant again and the back pain really started up, where I had gotten my epidural over a year earlier. I saw a spinal specialist who couldn’t do much because I was pregnant. I had an extremely rough pregnancy, had home health care, very sick. Had another epidural, it was botched. I felt almost everything and it mostly numbed my right side. Coming out of that birth was rough. I started having worsening spine pain, headaches, tremors, nausea. I was convinced I had a spinal tumor. An X-ray showed nothing of my spine. I then was diagnosed Hashimoto’s, my thyroid was out of whack. I still continued to suffer from horrible headaches, tachycardia, exercise intolerance and the nausea is constant. All day, every day. That along with the horrendous fatigue, it’s hard to manage my children.  I was diagnosed with POTS and kept having horrible headaches, more like very horrible head pressure. With a family history of aneurysms, they did an MRI/MRA. The imagine showed nothing but it was very much there. I had a “seizure” (in quotes because it was not). I thought I was having a TIA, I stiffened up and started convulsing. Prior to this moment, I was feeling like I was going out of my body, I couldn’t say any words, I couldn’t move, I was frozen but very aware. I was shaking and had a horrible headache. My husband called 911 and it took me to the nearest hospital. They did a CT without contrast which showed no migraine, no seizure, no stroke. I was very happy about that but it didn’t explain what just happened. I was so scared. The neurologist brushed it off as POTS, called it a clonic seizure intractable (HCC).  I saw Dr. Jaeger, the director of autonomic disorders at Cleveland Clinic. He was the one who signed off on my tilt table test and he said it wasn’t impressive and didn’t show POTS, but my neurologist is going off of my symptoms and the poor man’s tilt table he did in his office. My neurologist said “if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck”, referring to my POTS. Dr. Jaeger is very well known in the autonomic/cardiology world and he doesn’t think I have POTS. Is it possible that I might have a CFS Leak due to my epidurals? I watched a stanford doctors video about a few women who were diagnosed with POTS, but they actually had CFS leak.  If I lay down, the pressure isn’t as horrible, but still there. The second I stand up, I get a splitting headache, horrible head pressure, mostly in the base of my skull but also goes to the front, a lot in my in temples. The pressure can get so unreal, I have to keep opening my jaw- like how you would on an airplane to relieve the pressure. It makes me nauseous, sometimes my vision gets weird, and I get overstimulated/light sensitive. It also feels like there’s burning in my head? These are not migraines either. The pressure also seems to worsen if I’ve lifted weights in the gym.

I am a young woman who was diagnosed with POTS since September of 2017. It took a very long time to get this diagnosis but has me questioning the diagnosis along with another reputable doctor. I am convinced it could be a CFS leak- based on my symptoms and findings. Hear me out and I’d love feedback if this could sound like it.  My first baby was born in 2014. Prior, I had been healthy, very active and fit; a gym rat. I had an epidural which worked well. Came out of that birth fine with some minor back pain, got back to getting fit and was in the best shape of my life.  Feb of 2016, I fell pregnant again and the back pain really started up, where I had gotten my epidural over a year earlier. I saw a spinal specialist who couldn’t do much because I was pregnant. I had an extremely rough pregnancy, had home health care, very sick. Had another epidural, it was botched. I felt almost everything and it mostly numbed my right side. Coming out of that birth was rough. I started having worsening spine pain, headaches, tremors, nausea. I was convinced I had a spinal tumor. An X-ray showed nothing of my spine. I then was diagnosed Hashimoto’s, my thyroid was out of whack. I still continued to suffer from horrible headaches, tachycardia, exercise intolerance and the nausea is constant. All day, every day. That along with the horrendous fatigue, it’s hard to manage my children.  I was diagnosed with POTS and kept having horrible headaches, more like very horrible head pressure. With a family history of aneurysms, they did an MRI/MRA. The imagine showed nothing but it was very much there. I had a “seizure” (in quotes because it was not). I thought I was having a TIA, I stiffened up and started convulsing. Prior to this moment, I was feeling like I was going out of my body, I couldn’t say any words, I couldn’t move, I was frozen but very aware. I was shaking and had a horrible headache. My husband called 911 and it took me to the nearest hospital. They did a CT without contrast which showed no migraine, no seizure, no stroke. I was very happy about that but it didn’t explain what just happened. I was so scared. The neurologist brushed it off as POTS, called it a clonic seizure intractable (HCC).  I saw Dr. Jaeger, the director of autonomic disorders at Cleveland Clinic. He was the one who signed off on my tilt table test and he said it wasn’t impressive and didn’t show POTS, but my neurologist is going off of my symptoms and the poor man’s tilt table he did in his office. My neurologist said “if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck”, referring to my POTS. Dr. Jaeger is very well known in the autonomic/cardiology world and he doesn’t think I have POTS. Is it possible that I might have a CFS Leak due to my epidurals? I watched a stanford doctors video about a few women who were diagnosed with POTS, but they actually had CFS leak.  If I lay down, the pressure isn’t as horrible, but still there. The second I stand up, I get a splitting headache, horrible head pressure, mostly in the base of my skull but also goes to the front, a lot in my in temples. The pressure can get so unreal, I have to keep opening my jaw- like how you would on an airplane to relieve the pressure. It makes me nauseous, sometimes my vision gets weird, and I get overstimulated/light sensitive. It also feels like there’s burning in my head? These are not migraines either. The pressure also seems to worsen if I’ve lifted weights in the gym. I can feel it start up in the gym, with the base of my skull brewing with heavy pressure and then when I’m done at the gym, I feel as if my head could explode, popping off from my temples.

Other symptoms are a muted ""popping"" or ""crackling"" sensation at the top of the inside of my skull (more noticeable during physical/mental activity vs rest); also declining vision, with my right eye giving blurred vision; dull pain at the back of the base of my skull and also at the left side of my neck under my jaw/ear area. I also am really fatigued lately. I've seen a neurologist, who ordered a CTA scan, MRI, EKG, EEG, and blood work... I was told the MRI showed nothing significant, except an aging brain. The other test results I haven't discussed yet with him (my followup appointment isn't for another month), but I was told they'd contact me right away if anything seemed unusual and required immediate attention. He did say my neck pain was probably due to my migraines (average 2-3 per month.) The head pressure is my main concern right now, since it seems to be getting worse the past couple weeks. I'm currently only on a multivitamin, magnesium, vitamin B, and one blood-pressure med (Propanolol) for palpitations from mitral valve prolapse.

He started at 5mg and gradually bump him up to 20mg. There are days where the meds hit him really hard and days where it really doesn't. He won't eat sometimes in till the meds were off and he does not want to do anything thru out the day. Im worried he will lose lots of weight and just get sick or something... My question is ... Is it ok for him to miss a dosage or two on weekends or non schools days?? So that I can bring his weight back up?? And to make him do things and not just be there in lamein terms be zombied out..

(Involuntary) Tics Becoming too much to bear,"I have had something happen since I was young (around 9-10) where I cycle through different types of tics or spasms. Typically they have been motor manifestations, such as a relentless series of unstoppable jolts of my head in a movement similar to a nod (the one I’m doing right now), or sharply drawing my elbow backward and inward to the point where it hurts my shoulder and makes it feel severely eroded. Others include the sharp sudden clenching of my abdominal muscles or the flicking of my big toe against my second toe out. I have dealt wih these issues for so long and they are beginning to very nearly dominate my life. They always move in a cycle, where I have a period of doing one tic for a long time until I move onto the next one a week or two-four later. It’s always a repetitive action as well. Many of these end up with me feeling great pain toward the end of the tic’s lifespan within that cycle. For instance, I am unable to angle my neck right now without experiencing significant pain. Please help me figure out what is going on with me, as I have no money to visit a doctor without first narrowing down the suspects, so to speak. A small list of personal details that may help: 1. I am 20 years old 2. I am male 3. This seems to act up more when I drink caffeine or when I play video games 4. I don’t play any contact sports that would affect my brain significantly 5. I can suppress it, with great difficulty, if I consciously try to not do it, with all my effort 6. No instances of it occuring in my sleep 7. I got a CT scan which revealed no issue with my brain 8. The majority of the tics revolve around my neck and head, and many require me to hold my breath while I do them Please Help, I am so over living this way"

By the end of each week my entire head and face feel fatigued.  At first I thought these would go away on their own. But now it's been almost two years since surgery and I'm still experiencing this. My biological father was diagnosed with mild Tourettes in his late 30s. I've never been tested myself.  I have never posted on a medical forum before, and I've always tried to manage these symptoms on my own. But now it's getting to the point that I need some advice.  I'd like to stay away from presciption medications as much as possible. I've considered maybe trying medical marijuana to allieviate some of these symptoms. But I've never tried it before and am unsure if I even qualify for a medical card. Any advice would be helpful. Thank you."

The Next day 2 days after the lightheadedness I started to know feel dizzy and nauseous and had quite a bit of neck pain the lightheadedness turned onto a full out headache. The next day now 3 days after the initial symptoms the dizziness and nauseau and neckpain got worse and I now had a fever around 104. On the 4th day the headache and other symptoms continued and my glands under my mouth were slightly enlarged. On the 5th day the fever was still going strong and the headache was extremely bad (not going to lie I cried a bit from the pain) it might be worth noting that I had no cough nor was my sinus in pain and no runny nose. The symptoms here continued for two-three more days before the fever supsides all in all it lasted about 1 week. At the end I was salivating like crazy like much much more than I have ever with other illnesses. I started to feel a bit better but the pain in my upper back where I can just reach if I put my hand back, aswell as I was extremely tired still and had a headache pretty much constantly that felt the worse around the back of my head and neck meets. I also had a rash on both of my elbows. I felt like it was hard to concentrate and had trouble sleeping even though I was extremely tired. I went back to work and had alot of trouble doing my job and concentrating so I went to the clinic now about 10 days after the symptoms started and 3 days after they ended. He suspected I had mono however the blood tests said otherwise so just moved on. About a month later now I am still feeling the headache in the back of my head and upper back pain aswell as neck pain. I also feel quite weak in my legs and kinda always feel like I'm going to fall over, like when riding the subway I used to be able to easily ride without holding on and today I was holding on for dear life and nearly tipped over 10 times. I wouldn't mind the pain but the headache is the worst because I have trouble thinking straight and sleeping, and I almost fall over every time I get up. Getting 9+ hours of sleep doesn't even feel like enough when before I could easily get away with 6. So I went back the the clinic and told him my symptoms that I still had and he recommended I went to ER for whatever reason. So I ended up going and I got a CT scan and more blood tests and they turned out to be Normal apparently. And I was released with no more information. It's been 4 days since then and I've tried to focus on keeping good posture and sleep straight on my back just incase it was some muscular issue, but it hasn't seemed to help at all. I know it's a far cry but if anyone has any idea whats going on or has had a similar experience or and thoughts o would greatly appreciate it. Thank you and sorry for the wall of text :("

So let me start by saying im 19and have beem healthy all my life i used to get dizzy spells sometimes at a young age but nothing like how ive been feeling for a while now. About 6 months ago i began have bad heart palpitations and dizzy spells and not being able to drive at certain points because i would have panic attacks and feel like i was going to faint behind the wheel. Following that i was put on betablockers and have been back and fourth to doctors and cardiologists for months doing stress tests, being on heart monitors, echocardiograms and ekgs that all came back normal but i still feel myself getting these irregular and extremely fast heart rates when i sit up or lay down (mostly worse at night) and definitely increase with anxiety. A few months went by and the betablockers seemed to help a little so i just assumed i had terrible anxiety but come this past february i was sitting eating dinner going about my normal day and suddenly i couldnt focus on anything and i felt like i couldn't remember any short term things and i felt weak and i got up went to the bathroom and went and layed down on my bed and suddenly everything went black and the next thing i remember was my mom shaking me and asking me what happend i woke up and was llaying in a pile of blood on my pillow and felt extremely hungover and completely confused as to what happened. My mom didnt see what happened to me because i was in my room but she immediately took me to the hospital and the did many tests including a CT scan an MRI artery valve ultra sounds blood tests and xrays and everything came back normal. Prior to all of this for about a week or two before this ""seizure""the doctors in the hospital told me i had , i had been experiencing horrible headaches id have to sleep off that would be throughout my whole head with sharp pains and into my ears. My ears also sometimes ring and feel clogged and ache and also i get pins and needles in my finger tips and toes once in a blue moon still to this day and same with the headaches. So from there on out i stayed at the hospital over night where they released me the next day and ordered an eeg test to have done. My neurologist got results back a few days later after they conducted the test for about 15 minutes and he called saying i had temporal lobe epilepsy and he started me on keppra and lamictal twice a day already on topof the beta bockers i already take and birth control i just started. Because i feel like my symptoms are getting worse including the headaches extreme dizziness earaches ,suttle confusion at times and worsened anxiety i went to get a second opinion at a doctor who i thought to be very intelligent and after hearing my symptoms and episodes ive been experiencing for months told me i may not have epilepsy at all considering ive only had the one seizure and no one even saw it happen. So for now im decreasing the amount of epilepsy medications im on and instead of taking two ill be taking one eventually (the lamictal) and hes going to be runing other tests including a second mri to make sure its not something they missed reading it the first time, more blood testing, a table tilt test because he thinks i may have POTS an ansar test and a 24 hour eeg to actually prove of theres abnormalities and any signs of epilepsy. With all of this my current fear day in and day out for on going months upon months now is that i have a brain tumor and its causing me to be extremely stressed and anxious all day and night because im scared i might die and waiting for test results and having follow up appointments woth all of that is making me slowly go insane because im just so scared for my health that i have cancer right now. So if anyones out there that maybe has ever felt the same way or a doctor that can maybe read this and help me or comfort me in anyway till i fet results back it would be highly APPRECIATEd because its making me so terrified all day everyday and its hard for me to focus on work school and relationships and i wish i just had answers thank you for anyone who toom the the time to read this i just want to feel better....:("

So if anyones out there that maybe has ever felt the same way or a doctor that can maybe read this and help me or comfort me in anyway till i fet results back it would be highly APPRECIATEd because its making me so terrified all day everyday and its hard for me to focus on work school and relationships and i wish i just had answers thank you for anyone who toom the the time to read this i just want to feel better....:("

When I was 22, there was a serious case of haze that happened for months and I had a severe fever.  When I recovered, suddenly my legs were feeling very itchy, and it just wouldn't go away.

Did a bunch of test like nerve conduction and etc, but nothing. I live in Malaysia, so the medical technology was obviously not as advanced as the western countries. Then, I went to a local neurologist and she managed to diagnose that I have RLS. I was eating Sifrol, I think it differs from other brands but it's medicine for Parkinson's. It worked well initially but I had to increase the dose by a lot.  In the end, I could not afford it and had to go for other methods, which is Chinese acupuncture. It helped a lot, but other problems arise.  Even when many years before I had gotten RLS, I had been a heavy bodybuilder and may have lifted too heavy over the years. I'm not sure if it's related but I think I might have damaged my nerves as well, perhaps known as peripheral neuropathy.  So currently, I will list down my problems that I have. 1. Heart palpitations to the point that sometimes it hurts 2. Unable to pee properly, sometimes I feel I could pee finish or frequently peeing. 3. I became much more clumsy. 4. I still have to spit my phlegm due to allergic rhinitis.  5. My RLS is very serious, sometimes to the point that even the arms and the neck shakes as well.  6. I am unable to focus well.

I don't even get phlegm anymore, instead it was blood. Antihistamine made my legs worse and I still didn't know I had RLS.  I went to many doctors of GP, neurologist and psychiatrist. Did a bunch of test like nerve conduction and etc, but nothing. I live in Malaysia, so the medical technology was obviously not as advanced as the western countries. Then, I went to a local neurologist and she managed to diagnose that I have RLS. I was eating Sifrol, I think it differs from other brands but it's medicine for Parkinson's. It worked well initially but I had to increase the dose by a lot.  In the end, I could not afford it and had to go for other methods, which is Chinese acupuncture. It helped a lot, but other problems arise.  Even when many years before I had gotten RLS, I had been a heavy bodybuilder and may have lifted too heavy over the years. I'm not sure if it's related but I think I might have damaged my nerves as well, perhaps known as peripheral neuropathy.  So currently, I will list down my problems that I have. 1. Heart palpitations to the point that sometimes it hurts 2. Unable to pee properly, sometimes I feel I could pee finish or frequently peeing. 3. I became much more clumsy. 4. I still have to spit my phlegm due to allergic rhinitis.  5. My RLS is very serious, sometimes to the point that even the arms and the neck shakes as well.  6. I am unable to focus well. I hope that somebody out there is able to share some info on what I should do as I live in Malaysia, I can't just do any test possible as I have to bear all of the cost.  I have been suffering badly for 2 years now, without able to work or sleep properly.  Thank you for taking your time to read my problem."

Maybe 7 months ago he started complaining about the headaches waking him up out of sleep if he were to lay on his back. Then he said he would turn on his side and they would go away. Then two months ago he started complaining about having double vision if he looked anywhere not straight ahead. Less than a week ago he went to the doctor for results on a plethora of tests he had just gotten done (tests were all clean), and while at the doctor office he lost his memory. Not complete amnesia, but he had no idea what was talked about at the doctors office. He couldn't really put words together to form a sentence. They admitted him to the hospital in the stroke unit (he didn't have a stroke) where he spent 4-5 days and got the typical MRI and blood work. Didn't show anything. He also had an EEG and they checked his carotid. All came up clean. He is now back home still having headaches and still ""Fuzzy"" as he describes since his memory loss incident.  My dad does have a mass in his head. A dermoid cyst. They discovered that over 20 years ago randomly and when compared to MRI today they said it hasn't changed at all in that time period so that is most likely not the cause. All our doctors can do is order MRI tests and refer to other people who just order another MRI and then say ""I dunno"". I am desperate for any other ideas. The doctorsc mentioned something about his excessive Advil use that can cause rebound headaches or something like that. I see where they are coming from, but I don't think that can cause memory loss and double vision. Can it? His symptoms again are awful headaches that change spots, fatigue, double vision, memory loss (blackout?), feeling fuzzy and out of it.

Now they're red af?,"So i got this ""friend"" who has been prescribed 20mg adderall ir tablets, once a day at noon ever since starting high school (though he doesn't take it everyday, just when he needs to). This friend decided to try and get high off his adderall, since hes smoked weed before many times. He took 3 tablets and crushed them up and snorted the first then the other two by halves, every 1/2 hour, to make sure he didn't take too much (he ain't THAT dumb). The thing is he didn't really feel all that high, he was still pretty much completely functional, he just felt kinda euphoric but only a very tiny tiny bit. he just knew it was time to stop because his eyes were dilated like hell. He didn't sleep that night. Then yesterday. He woke up perfectly fine, pupils where back to normal too. Then around 2 in the afternoon he had an anxiety attack. He hasn't had an anxiety attack, or even really anxiety that much (except for like tests and stuff but that's normal, right?), since junior year high school and he's a freshman in college rn which is why he stopped taking his lamotragine when the anxiety stopped and why he didn't think to bring it with me to college. But, he was in his room and his roommate (who's been a close friend since elementary school) too. His roommate helped him. Actually walking outside helped a lot. But he still had anxiety, just not severe, just constant and relentless. His heart wouldn't slow down even though he seemed calm. Finally his heart slowed down but he was still feeling a lot of anxiety. He decided to snort more adderall like the other night, like a giant idiot (which he now realizes), but his anxiety stopped and he seemed fine except for the hugely dilated pupils, which weren't too too noticeable. Then last night he noticed his eyes were getting red in the corners. Like real read. It didn't seem to be spreading so he went to bed. Didn't sleep though again. Then comes this morning where his eyes are not super red but pretty red on the outer side only of each eye and in the inside of the lower eyelid. Also his pupils were still dilated. Since he didn't have dilated pupils still the morning after that first night, he figure somethings wrong because he took the same amount of adderall as last time, 60mg total. So he looked up if adderall can do stuff to the eyes. Apparently, snorting adderall can damage the eyes. Sh*t. He also finds out that redness of the eyes and dilated pupils along with darkening around the eyes can mean chemical damage to the eyes. But it could aslo mean the adderall is still in his system for whatever reason and his eyes are bloodshot because of the insomnia. He freaked the f*ck out because around his eyes had always been slightly dark so he could tell if that was a symptom or not. He took an emergen-c, because he knows vitamin c in high doses can get help stop and get rid of the adderall still in your system quick, thus possibly avoiding continued eye damage if there was ever any. He swore to himself never to get high on adderall again and he asked his roommate to hold onto his adderall to make sure he definitely wont, even to stop the expected anxiety attack if this today is to follow the same schedule as yesterday. Now he is waiting to see if the pupils will shrink, but hes kinda obsessing rn just waiting and he doesnt want to call his parents to ask them to drop off the lamotragine because they would probably ask what happened and start getting worried since he hasn't had an attack in almost 2 years. Plus his pupils are f*cking moons and his parents would notice. Is there anything else he could to to help with the seemingly inevitable anxiety attack and do you think he should see a doctor about the eyes right away or wait to see if the pupils shrink, because he has no discomfort when moving his eyes, another common symptom of chemical eye damage, they just feel tired which is reasonable from being up 60 hours straight and still counting cuz it's day. What does he do? He's kinda sorta panicking rn which is starting to cause some anxiety.  PS: He doesn't feel high in the slightest even though his pupils are dilated."

The headache is acting like a migraine, it goes away or fades with rest and sleep and then comes back and worsens with activity, watching tv, reading, etc. The pain is mostly at the local spot where I hit and then in the back of the head along with the pressure that's all over.  I'm not having any other symptoms related to concussion or serious head injury. No confusion, slurred speech, dizziness. I've had some nausea, mostly last night. The migraines I would say range in intensity from mild to moderate. The pressure is worse when I lay down and better when I'm standing or sitting up.  Is this sort of headache normal for just a superficial bump on the head? I hear all these horror stories about bleeding and clotting and I know I shouldn't read those but they kinda scare me! I should also say that I'm very prone to migraines and have reoccurring tension headaches almost half the time. The pain and pressure feel very similar to these recurring headaches but feel a little higher in intensity."

Within the last couple of years we purchased personal medical insurance (high monthly premiums) with kaiser.  We have gone through so many doctors first testing her blood for thyroid problems which have been cleared many times, then they tried prescribing her anti depressants and later muscle relaxers which was a nightmare how she couldn't stop twitching for almost a week preventing her from sleeping. Then after changing doctors again they accused her of bulemia (she is a healthy weight and eats well) and then later tested for anemia (cleared as well) all of which make no sense for treating a condition she has had diagnosed on many previous occasions throughout her childhood and adulthood. I feel that all they were doing was taking our money. Is this a common encounter for others with ADHD?  Where can we go to get proper help?  She needs a proper treatment program to be set In place but we are at wits end with our current insurance provider. Any help or guidance is appreciated."

Very slowly, my thinking started to clear. My gait got better.  No other neurologist witnessed the cogwheel ratcheting, and I look really healthy, compared with many of their other patients. They had no interest in my complaints of cognitive difficulty, and basically told me to keep taking antidepressants...the most recent of these neurologists, who is a movement specialist, told me that my symptoms are from menopause.

Since last spring, the physical manifestations of the neurological problems have started to return very slowly, however, my cognition continues to improve.

Well...that...and, have other people had trouble getting a diagnosis even though they knew it was Parkinson's?"

Since July I have been so sick. Before I became sick, I was a healthy and active 24 year old woman who worked out in the gym everyday was a full time college student and worked part time. It all started with me becoming extremely weak, and every time I would stand up I would become very dizzy and my heart would race. I also was very nauseated, would break out into sweats, had body aches and sharp pains that felt like pins and needles sticking me all over. I thought maybe it was my blood sugar so I started to eat more before I went to the gym. When I was at work one day I felt like I was going to faint even though I had ate. I went to the ER and the doctor done a ton of blood work, CT scan of my head, EKG, and a chest x ray. Every thing came back normal except a little bacteria in my urine. The doctor said I was orthostatic because of my heart rate going up every time I would stand up so he gave me a couple bags of IV fluid and sent me home with an antibiotic. I thought my symptoms was due to the UTI, but I was wrong. I went to my family doctor and he done more blood work to check for other things like Lyme's disease and mono. He also ordered an echo of my heart and for me to wear a heart monitor for a month. The echo and blood work came back clear, except it showed I had active mono. This would be the 3rd time I've had mono in my life. Thinking that's why I was feeling this way I was relieved. I continued to wear the heart monitor over the month of August. My symptoms just kept getting worse. I went back to the ER again cause my heart rate was 150 and I couldn't even sleep. They done more blood work and tests, including an abdominal CT scan to make sure my spleen and liver wasn't enlarged due to mono. Everything came back clear. They gave me a coupe bags of IV fluid and some Ativan to help me sleep and sent me home. My symptoms only became worse. I couldn't sleep for days, my heart rate was going up to 200 bpm. My whole body was in so much pain and I began to have burning sensations. After my skin stopped burning, my whole body went numb. It started with my legs going numb and worked its way up my body. I also couldn't taste, smell, or see good. I hardly could put any weight on my legs. I literally had to hold to the walls to even get to the bathroom because I couldn't hardly walk. I thought I was going to die. My body felt like it was shutting down. I couldn't even eat because I was so nauseated. My doctor done more blood work to check for autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. He also checked my cortisol levels. Which all was normal. He ordered an MRI of my brain, and it came back normal. Gradually my sense of feeling, smelling, and taste came back. I still can't feel things like I used to. Nothing tastes the same either. Smells make me nauseated, even if its good smells. My personality as even changed. I can't hardly remember things anymore. I went from being a happy, social, and smart person to someone who has so much anger over everything, can't think or focus and hates to be around people. My hair is also falling out bad. All my friends and family think I'm crazy and its just anxiety and depression, but I know something bad happened to me. I still feel horrible and weak all the time. I can't hardly get out of the bed.

This is my first post and I'm not typically one for message boards but I am feeling a little desperate lately. Maybe someone knows of something I can mention to my doctor that we haven't yet explored.  I am a 31 y.o. female. I have Crohn's Disease that was diagnosed ~7 years ago & is currently in remission. I receive bi-monthly Remicade infusions to maintain remission.  In July 2017 my hands/forearms began going numb. The numbness would not go away despite position changes. The numbness was painful and would wake me up in the night. I saw the doctor. She did x-rays on my hands & neck (both normal), a full blood work-up was ordered (normal), and an EMG was performed. The EMG revealed mild Carpal Tunnel in my right arm, but this didn't explain the issues in my left arm or account for the severity of my symptoms. I was sent to Physicals therapy for 8 weeks, which did little to nothing. Meanwhile. The pain moved to my upper arms and began in my hips.  The pain is very much so associated with movement, not painful to the touch. It feels stiff and I've joked that it must be rigor Mortus (sp?). When I received my Remicade infusion, all the pain subsides within 24 hours. However, within 1 week the pain returned. Less in my arms and more in my hips/knees.  After another infusion, the pain subsided and returned within a week. This time solely in my feet and far worse than ever before.  I've seen my GP several times and she is at a loss. I've spoken with my GI, also at a loss. I've seen a neurologist who gave me a muscle relaxer to take before bed. This accomplished nothing. The muscle relaxer didn't even make me tired.  I'm scheduled to see a Rheumotologist in March, but worry it will be pointless. Currently, I've struggling more and more everyday to simply stand & walk. So, I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts as to things I should consider as a diagnoses.  I've considered and been tested for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Polymyalga Rheumatica, and Lyme Disease. And, as mentioned, a full bloodwork came back normal.

In autumn 2016 I had a manic episode which lasted for 3 months. In one morning I woke up and everything had changed - unbearable pressure (not really pain) in the head and depression had arrived. My doctor warned me about the depression so it wasn't a surprise. The depression passed with a couple of months but the pressure did not. I took different medication (10+) and anti-depressants and even had ECT to get rid of the feeling but nothing helped. Alongside pressure came also eczema, erectile dysfunction and several cognitive issues (loss of memory, foreign languages, focusing). I'm tired all the time and I haven't laughed from the heart for a year since the feeling disturbs me all the time. The only time I can't feel it is during sleeping. There has been a similar discussion in WebMD before but no solutions:    It's definitely the most unpleasant feeling I've ever had and I hope there's a solution.

In autumn 2016 I had a manic episode which lasted for 3 months. In one morning I woke up and everything had changed - unbearable pressure (not really pain) in the head and depression had arrived. My doctor warned me about the depression so it wasn't a surprise. The depression passed with a couple of months but the pressure did not. I took different medication (10+) and anti-depressants and even had ECT to get rid of the feeling but nothing helped. Alongside pressure came also eczema, erectile dysfunction and several cognitive issues (loss of memory, foreign languages, focusing). I'm tired all the time and I haven't laughed from the heart for a year since the feeling disturbs me all the time. The only time I can't feel it is during sleeping.

Originally the illness started in my right foot/ankle, then spread up my leg, into my hips, up to my shoulders, down my arm, and into my hand. After about a year with my pain management team at the hospital for sick children my pain reduced and was very tolerable. The only place that had pain that was intolerable was my back, but the physicians said it was from carrying around the air cast they had put on my foot (the cast was to increase mobility by applying pressure to try and reduce the amount of swelling). I had the cast on for nearly 7 months. So I understood what they were saying about my back, but they also stated that the back pain should only be there for approximately 3 months, basically until my hips realigned. But now it has been a year and a half since I got the cast off and my back is still hurting, in fact it has gotten a lot worse. I have been going to frequent doctors appointments to try and figure out what is wrong but no one is saying much. I have tried looking on the internet to see if there is any research of CRPS spreading to the back but I haven't found anything.  Does anyone know if it is possible? Please leave a comment and let me know, it would be greatly appreciated."

I sure hope someone can help. I'm a forty seven year old male in average health. I don't smoke and drink very little. I don't have any conditions that I know about. About eighteen months ago I started to experience these symptoms out of nowhere. There's a sort of heavy feeling in my head, not pain but very unpleasant and constant. I also have low energy and I'm quite tired, drowsy a lot of the time. I was on 20mg citalopram at the time and had been on it for several years without issue. The first doctor I saw put my dose up by 10mg and it got worse so I figured it was the meds. The doctor ordered blood work which all came back normal. As far as he was concerned that was it. End of story. Since then I've seen three other general practitioners, two psychiatrists, three naturopaths and none of them have been able to tell me what's wrong with me. The psychiatrists tried changing my meds but they had the same result. I also had a CT scan which came back normal. I told my psychiatrist that I'd like to try coming off the anti depressant so we worked out a plan to come off it over a few weeks, dropping the dose 5mg every two weeks. I noticed that when I reduced the dose I felt better but the symptoms reasserted themselves within a few days. I was finally off the medication completely for two months but the symptoms didn't go away completely. They got better but they were still there. I was having a hard time coping with the depression so the psychiatrist suggested I go back on them and prescribed sertraline. The symptoms immediately came back as strong as ever. I stopped again after a week. I've noticed that the anti depressant is not the only thing that triggers the symptoms. Non prescription medication such as anti histamine will do it, as will certain herbal supplements like 5HTP and St Johns Wort (for the depression), and also gluten. I don't know where else to turn I just know I can't live like this. I googled a diagnostician and contacted her in the hopes she might be able to diagnose me, I'm just waiting to hear back from her. Am I on the right track or should I see some other type of specialist? What kind of specialist would be appropriate? Thank you I'd appreciate any help and I can give more details if needed."

My moving toes started about five years ago. There was no precipitating event, no accident. I just noticed one evening that my toes were moving. In order to get my diagnosis, I saw three neurologists, a podiatrist, my PCP, and my chiropractor. The third neurologist made the call after seeing my foot for about 10 seconds. Then he said, ""I suppose I should look at all your tests and reports--they're all normal, right?"" (Right!). I feel blessed that I am relatively pain free, although I do experience extreme achiness from time to time. I wear toe separators to sleep, as the movements can be maddening and keep me awake. I don't take any medications for it, although I did try gabapentin. My biggest fear is that pain will eventually set in. My neurologist said that chances are that won't happen, but that this condition is so rare that no one really knows the prognosis in any particular case. I was in contact with a foreign doctor via email, and I speculated that painless legs and moving toes is under reported because many people probably wouldn't bother seeing a doctor if the movement was the only symptom. He agreed. I would love if this site could grow enough so that we could entice a specialist to study us for commonalities among our histories and symptoms to see if we could collectively get closer to an effective treatment."

I have asked my parents multiple times to take me to the doctor but everytime i go it never helps. I got diagnoaed with asthma and i think one doctor thought i was just a deluaional teen and just told me to drink more water. Its so frustrating especially when you live in a state with literally the worst healthcare in the us. It hurts more when your parents just keep saying its just your hormones everytime they catch me cryimg in my closet because i feel like dying. Please if anyone knows whats wrong just help me"

Slowly was able to go back to work with physical therapy, but she is always a little dizzy. Has dizziness when moving her head a certain way, with bearing down, and just in general, the physical therapist told her she thought that she also have positional vertigo that she got either at the same time as labrynthitis or after, she has done a few treatments of the eply menuever with the PT. It seemed to be at a plateau for a while with nothing worse or better. Then this weekend she had a stressful couple of days and woke up dizzy again, more dizzy then usual. She went to work for a few hours and then had to come home because the dizziness was getting so intense. She came home and lay down, laying down quickly caused her to vomit. She rested the whole day and woke up feeling better but still more dizzy then usual. My question is this: is this normal? She got an MRI and it came up clear but I am worried they missed something, should she get another? Do others have this experience? I am very worried."

It feels like I get suddenly dizzy just for a few seconds, and my vision seems to get a little ""twitchy"" - not sure how else to describe it. It's almost like there is a delay in my brain and vision as I'm looking around for a moment. My head then feels a kind of weird for a minute or two, just like a little fatigued and I have brain fog but then it goes away. I'd say it only happens once or twice a week randomly. Last night, something more intense happened. I started to get the dizzy feeling and weird ""laggy"" vision feeling, and then it progressed into my vision actually moving erratically. Everything was shaking back and forth a little, and I even asked my boyfriend if he could see it too because everything was moving so obviously that I thought I was losing my mind for a sec or thought I was going to have a seizure or something. I also felt a strong ""sinking"" feeling, which made me feel like I was going to pass out and also gave me the feeling of a potential seizure. It all slowly stopped after about 60-90 seconds and I felt foggy after but generally coherent and maybe a little slow in recalling what my boyfriend and I were just talking about. I have never had seizures before or any other brain issues/disorders. Never had any serious health issues actually. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated."

A few days ago i had donated blood which i've done successfully before. I ate a good amount before and after. About 4-5 hours after, my friend and i went to the mall. I began to sweat a lot and was dizzy and was extremely hot. Keep in mind we had literally just got there and i wasn't doing any intense activities. I lost vision and that's when I fainted. My friend said that when i fell i began to shake on the ground. A few years back I had fainted at school and i had a similar experience. Not sure if my blood sugar was just weird after giving blood or if there's something else that may have caused my fainting. Thank you!"

He's a big guy-6 foot 4 and 230 lbs. For the last two years he's been on levothyroxine for low thyroid condition-something that runs in the family. He was experiencing fatigue so he went in for blood tests and they added liothyroxine to his list of meds. I suggested he see an endocrinologist, but instead of referring him to the doctor who diagnosed and removed my lovely 72 ounce toxic nodule last year (not an exaggeration....) they did more tests and decided he had low testosterone. But now they are worried he has a brain tumor and want him to go in for an MRI. He's a single Dad and this is Christmas. He's really worried about all this, not the least of which is the cost of all the testing. Does this sound reasonable or is the doctor using defensive medicine? I want to add, this doctor was the first to listen to me in regards to my thyroid condition after 20 years of misdiagnosis so I trust him, but I am worried they're seeing zebras when they hear hoofbeats. I'm just looking for input-I realize nothing is resolved on the internet. But I'm trying to help b/c my son is literally scared to death now."

Had an investigation of what was causing the heart murmur so I did:  Thyroid eco: found several cistes on thyroid  Heart eco- all normal and functioning normal no alterations  Thyroid hormones tested- TSH, T3 and T4 all within normal range  Blood work- all normal  Nose and throat bacteria test- found a Kleibsiela bacteria on my throat (antibiotics prescribed for that) nose come back clear.  During that time I started experiencing sometimes pain on my left arm ( I thought I would have a heart attack) but it went away  I had electric shock like sensation down my right arm or shoulder sometimes but it would last miliseconds (that also stopped)  I experienced sometimes at night my temperature raising and a little bit of sweating (really minimal sometimes just between my breasts a bit)  I still have excessive hair loss and recently had to have my hair cut short (but I also been trying a new hair relaxer and dye it might be it. I just never had so much hair loss before)  I noticed jerk like movements when I'm about to fall asleep at the first it happen 3 times now I have muscle spasms constantly they are very small and last miliseconds too  My heart had no reason to be having arritmia so I was sent to the endocrinologist.  Showed all my lad work and was sent to have anti- thyroid anti-corps tested.  It takes two weeks for me to get the results so I have to wait.

It's a severely uncomfortable tingling sensation that's been going non stop. I've been examined by a physician at an urgent care and they were unable to diagnose it. It doesn't seem related to appendicitis for example. Urine testing also came back normal. They referred me to a GI which I've yet to see. It's not a painful feeling, but a highly uncomfortable feeling that I can't ignore or not notice. I'm even wondering if it's bacterial or parasitic at this point...Any thoughts on what this could be? If you think this would be more suited to another message board, please also let me know."

This helped self-medicate. But the psychosis from the thc would get really bad at times. Eventually, pot became legal and a friend recommend pure CBD oil that was not THC at all! I took some pure CBD oil and it felt like I added 50mg-100mg of lamictal to my prescription list almost as if the I up'd my dose with the CBD oil. SInce, the product was legal I try'ed some for about a week and fell in love with the benefits. It was the second time I felt so incredible. The first time being initially prescribed the lamictal back in October 15th of 2018. And the second time obtaining CBD oil from MYNT this October 2019. The combination seemed to cure everything completely. Although I want my insurance to cover the CBD oil bill.. since it is treating my illness... although my doctor wont prescribe me the dose and this makes my own dosing( if I continue and this is safe) uncontrolled.  I consulted my psychartist about the therapuetic benefits of both lamictal and CBD oil. I argued that they both point towards epilepsy based solely on the therapuetic benefits. Although, his agruement was that I have bipolar and the fact that anticolvuslants work for my illness is unrelated to the fact that they work for epilepsy. Then I argued that the theurapuetic benefits were great. He responded that he would not prescribe epidiolex on the basis that it is not needed and would not treat my illness.  My question is how do I approach MY medication and this condition. Do I try to obtain more information? What kind of information can I gather? Is this completely safe for my liver and neuro processes? Do I need to be diagnosisd epileptic instead of bipolar? Do other bipolar patients every experience a seizure in their life? Wouldn't atleast on seizure contribute to acute or minor seizure relation between bipolar and epilepsy? My goal is to either obtain 400mg of lamictal or 300mg of lamictal and some low controlled form of CBD, or 400mg lamictal and some low controlled form of CBD( if this is safe). In addition, I have a very very healthly life style. I bike to and from school.  I drink tons of water. I weightlift and practice martial arts. I drink protein (about 50 grams a day with milk blended) I drink BCAA's with that protein daily. I take multivitamins. I take natural supplement called tumeric daily as well. I am concerned with Brain health Melanin Steven Jonshons disease 0.04% chance of anyone taking lamictal can contract. Liver health Heart health Any advice, recommendations, research articles, personal experiences, and general discussions would be great."

I will get a severe headache that will only last a couple of seconds, but it's intense. I've also noticed that I have blinking spots in my vision. When this first started, it was warm out, and I honestly thought it was gnats and I would swat at them. Then I realize it was internal.....gnats, for lack of a better term.

I really wish there was more awareness about the condition, hence this long post. It reveals a lot of personal information in the hope that it will help another sufferer to feel less alone, or seek help, or maybe help a doctor/neurologist to assist in the treatment of other PLMT patients. At the expense of all the info, I really hope I do not sound too introspective. I just want, above all, to help someone in a similar position to myself. A brief medical background: I am 49, of average weight (~120lb at 5' 6""). I have never smoked, I don't drink or take illicit drugs. In my childhood I had chicken pox, very bad measles, mumps and in my mid 20's, shingles. At age 19 I was hospitalized with severe anorexia, weighing 64lb. During and after my recovery from anorexia, to the current day, I have been taking many different antidepressant medications, and other psychiatric meds, including first, second and third generation antipsychotics for severe treatment resistant depression, OCD and Bipolar disorder.   Prior to the onset of my PLMT, I was very active. I participated in advanced figure skating, ballet and yoga. In my younger years, up until my inability to walk properly due to anorexia, I was a competitive, national level figure skater with a very rigorous training regime. After my illness and a a 17 year break from the sport, I continued to skate quite rigorously and compete nationally on the adult circuit, until I tore the ACL ligament in my right knee. I did not have any PLMT symptoms at that time, and I had a successful donor transplant of the ACL in 2010.  The PLMT (undiagnosed at this stage) started approx. mid 2013. I remember the first painful spasms in my upper leg (in the quad) driving home from coaching one day. It became quite impossible to continue driving the car and I had to pull over at the nearest Med Express. Just prior to this I had been having a lot of trouble sitting due to pain in the ischium ['sit bone' area]. Doctors either told me it was all in my head or that it was piriformis syndrome and sent me to rehab. Extensive rehab was ineffective. All around the same time I had a fall and tore all three hamstrings in my upper right leg near the ischium. This was disheartening as I had recently taken up ballet and loved this new found activity so much that I continued to try and dance through the pain. Subsequently, the hamstrings did not heal well. It didn't end there. Due to the leg spasms, I started experiencing problems in my ACL again where the pin was inserted, so had to have the pin removed under anesthesia. To compound the picture further, I stopped most of my psych medications suddenly at the same time. I just remember feeling extreme pain all over my body, like a thousand little gates were opening and closing on every area. Thus, it is actually hard to define what caused the PLMT. My neurologist, Dr. Homayoun is really great, and has spent so much time trying to work out the right treatments for me and how to help this rare disorder. I too, really try and study the pattern of movement and pain. I can control the movements when I think about controlling them, but I am quickly distracted because it takes a lot of mental energy. The PLMT is worse when I am at rest or lying down, and best when my feet are on the floor, or I am standing up moving around. I have major leg spasms however, even when standing, when my medication levels drop, or I have missed my dose of Lyrica, and/or the Botox is wearing off. In fact, most of my home life when I am not standing up is conducted lying down on the bed on my belly, either with my laptop, a book, doing crafts, etc., as I cant sit down much (still experience extreme pain in both ischium).  As far as medications: Aside from my psych meds (Effexor ER, Adderal and Abilify) I take Lyrica (600mg day), clonazepam, tizanadine, and baclofen. I also have about 10 injections of Botulotoxin (botox) at one session, every 3 months in between my toes, in other foot areas, and also all up my leg. It's excruciating when given in my foot, but helps a lot with the movement disorder. Recently, after mentioning some new observations at my appointment, I found that new injection points - in the side of the calf and in the groin (where I found that movement appeared to originate in the lower and upper leg respectively) and in the ischium, helped tremendously. I would also like to say that in the beginning stages of treatment, the Botox treatments seemed useless as they would only last about 6 weeks, and the effect wasn't great. It wasn't until over a year later that the Botox started lasting almost 3 months and really quite well. So if you have started such treatment, please do not lose hope! Although all these meds and treatments perhaps work interactively to control my leg movements and pain, by observing missed doses of the various meds, I find that it is the Lyrica, probably along with Botox, that is the most beneficial med in the control of both pain and movement. In fact, when the Botox is wearing off (after about 2 months) and I miss a day of Lyrica, the pain is so impossibly bad that I curl up in bed and just cry. Recently I have been prescribed a Fentanyl patch (25ug/hr) to also assist in controlling pain. I find they are ok, but not fabulous, in treating the pain, but do help to some extent. One day if I am brave, I will miss my lyrica without a patch on. I found it amusing, that when I missed my last Botox injections, I observed my toes were still rhythmically moving when I had the Fentanyl patch on (thus had no pain). This is interesting with regards to theories on the pain-movement cycle.  Well I hope this LONG, long dialogue /info helps anyone, and please post if you want to if you are suffering from this condition or are a doctor etc - I feel so isolated! We need to build awareness of this complicated disease. I was so active and now when trying to fight back by practicing some strengthening or yoga, I find it is a big problem. I am becoming so weak and it is getting harder to dress because I am compensating by overusing other muscles which subsequently hurt more. I sometimes lose my balance and I feel like I am becoming more and more bedridden - Yikes! I look back on my skating days with great memories but it too, is so very, very painful - it hurts my psyche. I am so very thankful to my awesome psychiatrist and therapist, Dr. L Krimer. I don't know where I would be without his unconditional support. My extremities may be weak, but the center holds. Finally, please take time to read the quote I saw and loved and have attached at the bottom. It really helps you through your treatment!"

Although all these meds and treatments perhaps work interactively to control my leg movements and pain, by observing missed doses of the various meds, I find that it is the Lyrica, probably along with Botox, that is the most beneficial med in the control of both pain and movement. In fact, when the Botox is wearing off (after about 2 months) and I miss a day of Lyrica, the pain is so impossibly bad that I curl up in bed and just cry. Recently I have been prescribed a Fentanyl patch (25ug/hr) to also assist in controlling pain. I find they are ok, but not fabulous, in treating the pain, but do help to some extent. One day if I am brave, I will miss my lyrica without a patch on. I found it amusing, that when I missed my last Botox injections, I observed my toes were still rhythmically moving when I had the Fentanyl patch on (thus had no pain). This is interesting with regards to theories on the pain-movement cycle.  Well I hope this LONG, long dialogue /info helps anyone, and please post if you want to if you are suffering from this condition or are a doctor etc - I feel so isolated! We need to build awareness of this complicated disease. I was so active and now when trying to fight back by practicing some strengthening or yoga, I find it is a big problem. I am becoming so weak and it is getting harder to dress because I am compensating by overusing other muscles which subsequently hurt more. I sometimes lose my balance and I feel like I am becoming more and more bedridden - Yikes! I look back on my skating days with great memories but it too, is so very, very painful - it hurts my psyche. I am so very thankful to my awesome psychiatrist and therapist, Dr. L Krimer. I don't know where I would be without his unconditional support. My extremities may be weak, but the center holds. Finally, please take time to read the quote I saw and loved and have attached at the bottom. It really helps you through your treatment!"

I really wish there was more awareness about the condition, hence this long post. It reveals a lot of personal information in the hope that it will help another sufferer to feel less alone, or seek help, or maybe help a doctor/neurologist to assist in the treatment of other PLMT patients. At the expense of all the info, I really hope I do not sound too introspective. I just want, above all, to help someone in a similar position to myself. A brief medical background: I am 49, of average weight (~120lb at 5' 6""). I have never smoked, I don't drink or take illicit drugs. In my childhood I had chicken pox, very bad measles, mumps and in my mid 20's, shingles. At age 19 I was hospitalized with severe anorexia, weighing 64lb. During and after my recovery from anorexia, to the current day, I have been taking many different antidepressant medications, and other psychiatric meds, including first, second and third generation antipsychotics for severe treatment resistant depression, OCD and Bipolar disorder.   Prior to the onset of my PLMT, I was very active. I participated in advanced figure skating, ballet and yoga. In my younger years, up until my inability to walk properly due to anorexia, I was a competitive, national level figure skater with a very rigorous training regime. After my illness and a a 17 year break from the sport, I continued to skate quite rigorously and compete nationally on the adult circuit, until I tore the ACL ligament in my right knee. I did not have any PLMT symptoms at that time, and I had a successful donor transplant of the ACL in 2010.  The PLMT (undiagnosed at this stage) started approx. mid 2013. I remember the first painful spasms in my upper leg (in the quad) driving home from coaching one day. It became quite impossible to continue driving the car and I had to pull over at the nearest Med Express. Just prior to this I had been having a lot of trouble sitting due to pain in the ischium ['sit bone' area]. Doctors either told me it was all in my head or that it was piriformis syndrome and sent me to rehab. Extensive rehab was ineffective. All around the same time I had a fall and tore all three hamstrings in my upper right leg near the ischium. This was disheartening as I had recently taken up ballet and loved this new found activity so much that I continued to try and dance through the pain. Subsequently, the hamstrings did not heal well. It didn't end there. Due to the leg spasms, I started experiencing problems in my ACL again where the pin was inserted, so had to have the pin removed under anesthesia. To compound the picture further, I stopped most of my psych medications suddenly at the same time. I just remember feeling extreme pain all over my body, like a thousand little gates were opening and closing on every area. Thus, it is actually hard to define what caused the PLMT. My neurologist, Dr. Homayoun is really great, and has spent so much time trying to work out the right treatments for me and how to help this rare disorder. I too, really try and study the pattern of movement and pain. I can control the movements when I think about controlling them, but I am quickly distracted because it takes a lot of mental energy. The PLMT is worse when I am at rest or lying down, and best when my feet are on the floor, or I am standing up moving around. I have major leg spasms however, even when standing, when my medication levels drop, or I have missed my dose of Lyrica, and/or the Botox is wearing off. In fact, most of my home life when I am not standing up is conducted lying down on the bed on my belly, either with my laptop, a book, doing crafts, etc., as I cant sit down much (still experience extreme pain in both ischium).  As far as medications: Aside from my psych meds (Effexor ER, Adderal and Abilify) I take Lyrica (600mg day), clonazepam, tizanadine, and baclofen. I also have about 10 injections of Botulotoxin (botox) at one session, every 3 months in between my toes, in other foot areas, and also all up my leg. It's excruciating when given in my foot, but helps a lot with the movement disorder. Recently, after mentioning some new observations at my appointment, I found that new injection points - in the side of the calf and in the groin (where I found that movement appeared to originate in the lower and upper leg respectively) and in the ischium, helped tremendously. I would also like to say that in the beginning stages of treatment, the Botox treatments seemed useless as they would only last about 6 weeks, and the effect wasn't great.

Doctors either told me it was all in my head or that it was piriformis syndrome and sent me to rehab. Extensive rehab was ineffective. All around the same time I had a fall and tore all three hamstrings in my upper right leg near the ischium. This was disheartening as I had recently taken up ballet and loved this new found activity so much that I continued to try and dance through the pain. Subsequently, the hamstrings did not heal well. It didn't end there. Due to the leg spasms, I started experiencing problems in my ACL again where the pin was inserted, so had to have the pin removed under anesthesia. To compound the picture further, I stopped most of my psych medications suddenly at the same time. I just remember feeling extreme pain all over my body, like a thousand little gates were opening and closing on every area. Thus, it is actually hard to define what caused the PLMT. My neurologist, Dr. Homayoun is really great, and has spent so much time trying to work out the right treatments for me and how to help this rare disorder. I too, really try and study the pattern of movement and pain. I can control the movements when I think about controlling them, but I am quickly distracted because it takes a lot of mental energy. The PLMT is worse when I am at rest or lying down, and best when my feet are on the floor, or I am standing up moving around. I have major leg spasms however, even when standing, when my medication levels drop, or I have missed my dose of Lyrica, and/or the Botox is wearing off. In fact, most of my home life when I am not standing up is conducted lying down on the bed on my belly, either with my laptop, a book, doing crafts, etc., as I cant sit down much (still experience extreme pain in both ischium).  As far as medications: Aside from my psych meds (Effexor ER, Adderal and Abilify) I take Lyrica (600mg day), clonazepam, tizanadine, and baclofen. I also have about 10 injections of Botulotoxin (botox) at one session, every 3 months in between my toes, in other foot areas, and also all up my leg. It's excruciating when given in my foot, but helps a lot with the movement disorder. Recently, after mentioning some new observations at my appointment, I found that new injection points - in the side of the calf and in the groin (where I found that movement appeared to originate in the lower and upper leg respectively) and in the ischium, helped tremendously. I would also like to say that in the beginning stages of treatment, the Botox treatments seemed useless as they would only last about 6 weeks, and the effect wasn't great. It wasn't until over a year later that the Botox started lasting almost 3 months and really quite well. So if you have started such treatment, please do not lose hope! Although all these meds and treatments perhaps work interactively to control my leg movements and pain, by observing missed doses of the various meds, I find that it is the Lyrica, probably along with Botox, that is the most beneficial med in the control of both pain and movement. In fact, when the Botox is wearing off (after about 2 months) and I miss a day of Lyrica, the pain is so impossibly bad that I curl up in bed and just cry. Recently I have been prescribed a Fentanyl patch (25ug/hr) to also assist in controlling pain. I find they are ok, but not fabulous, in treating the pain, but do help to some extent. One day if I am brave, I will miss my lyrica without a patch on. I found it amusing, that when I missed my last Botox injections, I observed my toes were still rhythmically moving when I had the Fentanyl patch on (thus had no pain). This is interesting with regards to theories on the pain-movement cycle.  Well I hope this LONG, long dialogue /info helps anyone, and please post if you want to if you are suffering from this condition or are a doctor etc - I feel so isolated! We need to build awareness of this complicated disease. I was so active and now when trying to fight back by practicing some strengthening or yoga, I find it is a big problem. I am becoming so weak and it is getting harder to dress because I am compensating by overusing other muscles which subsequently hurt more. I sometimes lose my balance and I feel like I am becoming more and more bedridden - Yikes! I look back on my skating days with great memories but it too, is so very, very painful - it hurts my psyche. I am so very thankful to my awesome psychiatrist and therapist, Dr. L Krimer.

I really wish there was more awareness about the condition, hence this long post. It reveals a lot of personal information in the hope that it will help another sufferer to feel less alone, or seek help, or maybe help a doctor/neurologist to assist in the treatment of other PLMT patients. At the expense of all the info, I really hope I do not sound too introspective. I just want, above all, to help someone in a similar position to myself. A brief medical background: I am 49, of average weight (~120lb at 5' 6""). I have never smoked, I don't drink or take illicit drugs. In my childhood I had chicken pox, very bad measles, mumps and in my mid 20's, shingles. At age 19 I was hospitalized with severe anorexia, weighing 64lb. During and after my recovery from anorexia, to the current day, I have been taking many different antidepressant medications, and other psychiatric meds, including first, second and third generation antipsychotics for severe treatment resistant depression, OCD and Bipolar disorder.   Prior to the onset of my PLMT, I was very active. I participated in advanced figure skating, ballet and yoga. In my younger years, up until my inability to walk properly due to anorexia, I was a competitive, national level figure skater with a very rigorous training regime. After my illness and a a 17 year break from the sport, I continued to skate quite rigorously and compete nationally on the adult circuit, until I tore the ACL ligament in my right knee. I did not have any PLMT symptoms at that time, and I had a successful donor transplant of the ACL in 2010.  The PLMT (undiagnosed at this stage) started approx. mid 2013. I remember the first painful spasms in my upper leg (in the quad) driving home from coaching one day. It became quite impossible to continue driving the car and I had to pull over at the nearest Med Express. Just prior to this I had been having a lot of trouble sitting due to pain in the ischium ['sit bone' area].

Despite this, my main concerns are relating to a head sensation and eye problem that have both recently developed. First the eye sensation that has developed - I can see fine if I close one eye and then the other, however with both eyes open the vision right eye is strange and almost appears to be non existent (right again) even though it isn't and my nose is constantly in the field of vision. The head sensation - empty head/spaced out feeling. I believe this could be TMJ related (nerve problems as everything in the face/head is connected? the trigeminal nerve?). Any advice on what I can do in the meantime (I am waiting for specialist appointments) and do you believe that this IS all be connected to TMJ? Thank you, all advice appreciated."

Please read to the end as this is the tricky part. I will try to make this long story as short as possible. He started to have bilateral wrist pain 1.5 years ago. In addition he lost weight, became depressed and fatigued. He had started working at a new job that required repetitive wrist movements so we assumed it was related. We went to ortho and primary. They ruled out lymes, arthritis and a number of other viruses. EMG was negative. The second ortho found a tear through contrast mri in his right wrist which was the wrist causing the most pain. He eventually had surgery. However he continues to lose weight and have pain in both wrists and forearms. Due to the chronic pain he has become anxious and depressed. I am a very worried mom. Here is the kicker - he just told me that a week before the onset of the pain and start of the downward spiral he got electrical shock at work. Someone left a machine on that should not have been and he grabbed a part and had a minor shock go up both hands to the elbow. No burns, no horrible pain, no dizziness so he went on with his day.  I am feeling frustrated and not sure where to turn next. Could the shock have done damage that no one is picking up? what type of doctors deal with electrical shock issues? Any thoughts? -LC"

I have probably experienced more pain in the last 2 years than 99% of people do in their lifetimes and yet this headache was the worst pain I think I've ever felt. I felt extremely dizzy and like I was incapable of thought at all, I just shut my eyes put my head in my hands and waited for about 20 seconds until it passed. Since then they've been occurring more and more frequently, I cant go to the gym whatsoever now as it isn't just a 'sometimes' occurrence, if I lift weight the headache very quickly comes on (not if i lift very low weight). Also in the last 3 days they have begun occurring if I masturbate. I've done some research and apparently this is called a 'sexual headache' however mine differs to them in that it doesn't happen just before/during/after orgasm, it happens when i'm barely aroused to be honest, and I can sorta feel the buildup and explosion.  I also have had a lot of neck stiffness. I saw a doctor (although at the time I was not getting them while masturbating, so she only thought it was during weight lifting) and she said the two are likely related, and to go to a physiotherapist. I have also seen an osteopath that believes it has something to do with the way I hold my neck/head, and has told me how to hold it from now on, as well as given me some stretches to do, I have another appointment with him tomorrow.  Basically my question is this; Is it likely that the headaches are just stemming from my neck stiffness, or is it more likely/possible to be something else? Something about the suddenness and intensity of the headaches, as well as the fact that they occur during masturbation has got me very worried."

The pain area changes as well as the pain severity frequently but the area that is constant, literally daily, is upper/outer elbow down about 3"" to upper/outer forearm. Since it was changing frequently I kept telling myself it's a severely pulled muscle or nerve just needing to work itself out so I've never been to see the Dr. However, about 1-2 months ago the pain severity has become so excruciating that I literally cannot pick anything that weighs more than about a pound. The pain was originally just annoying and a step above uncomfortable...now it's always pretty much unbearable throbbing with occasional stabbing. After the 1st month I started laying on my left side with arm straight out and on top of my heating pad. Felt like it was providing relief but after a while not so much. So, I started wrapping heating pad around my arm, securing with an ace bandage but is almost hurting more. I've been getting periodic stabbing and throbbing pains through both legs, and upper shoulders for about a year but my arm pain came on so quickly and intensely that I gave in and made a Dr appointment last week but it's not until week after next.

I have been having these problems for 2 months now and no doctors are able to diagnose me. I've been having this incredibly painful sharp stabbing feeling in my head for 2 months now. This pain usually lasts only for 1 or 2 seconds and only occurs a few times a day. I usually experience this pain while I am trying to fall asleep. I have also been constantly waking up in the middle of sleep. I usually go to bed at 10:30 PM and I usually first wake up at 3:00 AM. It usually takes me a long time to fall back to sleep and it keeps happening multiple times a night. I hit the top of my head against a metal bar pretty hard a few days before these headaches occurred. The sleeping problems occurred a week after I had hit my head. I have went to multiple doctors and even did a CT Scan yet they said nothing is wrong with me."

I have slight weakness in my left arm but not tingling or shaking any where. I did have gastro a week a go so I was thinking it could be Gullian Bare syndrome? But that has even weakness doesn’t it and also tingling which I don’t have? Also I’m having muscle wasting all over my body like in my legs too and idk if that is caused by it? Doctors did urine sample and blood tests and all came back fine also had a basic neurological exam (they tapped me with this metal thing and did a strength test) and I got 5 for strength and didn’t have any hyperflexia but my left arms still feels a little weak like holding my phone. Also have lost 5kgs in like a week even though my diet is healthy and appetite is fine. The doc I spoke to said I can’t lose muscle that quickly so she thinks I’m not losing muscle, is that true? Sometimes I get really overcome with general fatigue especially when my body gets hot and later in the afternoon. That makes me think it could be MS but MS doesn’t cause muscle wasting and atrophy does it?? Correct me if I’m wrong! I’ve got an MRI scheduled for next week. Would that rule out ALS? I calculated the odds and it’s like 1 in 1 million of me having ALS due to my age but you never know?? Also does the onset of muscle atrophy in als happen really quickly like visible muscle wasting in the hands occurring daily? Lastly it’s expensive to go to the doctor in my country and just those simple tests cost $700 and the MRI would be another $600 so like that plays a role too and I’m a student so my parents are paying. They said they don’t want me to have the MRI “cause the other tests came back showing nothing is wrong”. Is that correct? Would MS or ALS show up or there be any hints from a simple neurological exam, chest x Ray and blood test or?? Many thanks in advance docs!"

Have read that age related lesions are found mostly over age 60, and only 30% at that. Referred to neurologist, who also said MRI normal, dx'ed as ""migraine"", rx for 6 days steroid pills. He wanted to give Depakote for prevention, but when I said I wasn't comfortable taking Depakote, he seemed annoyed & offered no alternative. GP wouldn't refill 7-day Fioricet rx, (which barely worked anyway), & when I asked for a migraine relief rx, he said, ""but it's not a migraine"". Waited over 2 weeks for neuro appointment with no headache pain relief. Now, I'm frustrated. No pain relief for weeks from GP, b/c ""not a migraine"", then neuro says migraine.  No headache history. I had one full-blown seizure, last year, indicated on my paperwork, & neurologist didn't ask about or acknowledge it. Noises make my headaches much worse. I've had ocular migraines 2 or 3 times/yr for years, no pain, just blindness in peripheral of one eye with ziggy black lines in vision. Lasts 1 hour or less.  I also mentioned a ""brain seizure"" type feeling that I've had regularly, to which my neurologist smirked and shrugged off, saying he has no idea what that is. I know brains don't feel anything, but that's the only way I can describe that feeling. Sometimes that feeling is relieved a little by vigorously shaking my head (which makes my headache and dizziness worse for a min.), but lessens that feeling of something rapidly vibrating or an electrical storm or whatever happens with this ""brain seizure"" feeling. (A) Is my MRI considered normal at 45 y.o., w/the notes about the white matter lesions and over-activity in that area being normal for my age? (B) Is Depakote a normally-used 1st response for migraine prevention? I've already been on zoloft for yrs. (C) Does this sound like a migraine? (D) What do I do now, since my GP left me suffering for weeks saying not a migraine, referring me to neuro who says it is a migraine?  I don't work & am under no stress. We noticed the neuro spent a little more time listening to the left side of my neck with the stethoscope & took extra time examining my left eye from the left side of the eyeball w/ his light. When I followed his finger w/my eyes, I asked him if it was relevant that following his finger hurt my eyeballs. He said, ""it might be"". Thank you in advance for any input."

Help!,"My father had a bike crash 5 days ago and hit his head.  The doctor said he has a small brain injury (hematoma he called it). They said it's too small and it'll heal over time so they are not examinating him again and they'll probably send him home soon. The problem is he's suffering from short-term memory loss: he's unable to remember anything that happened on the same day or even minutes ago, that since he had the accident.  It's been 5 days already and I cannot say he's improving. In the mornings when he wakes up he's sometimes disoriented and he can't even remember what he's doing in a hospital bed...  The doctor didn’t say much about it as my dad was hospitalized in the nearest public hospital ASAP and doctors there don’t seem to take their jobs seriously... (unfortunately this happens a lot in my country) He was getting treated of cancer before the accident but they assumed the brain injury is due to the crash. Anyway, I would really appreciate any information about this (I hardly found anything on the internet). How long until he recovers? Could be weeks, months, years even? A there any possibility he remains like this forever? Thank you"

I'm a 55-year-old man who's in pretty good health. And last night I drank some wine, too much really, about a bottle and a half. So when I woke up this morning I was not surprised to find my thinking a little fuzzy. But I felt pretty normal. I went into the kitchen, got a cup of coffee and sat down at my computer where I found myself unable to remember the last three letters of my seven-letter password. I've entered this password into my computer probably 10 times a day for at least five years. It's also a common word, not something made up. And yet I couldn't remember the last three letters. So I said to myself - aloud - something like ""What the hell is wrong with me?"" But actually I didn't really say that because I found I couldn't speak. I could make noise but I couldn't make my mouth form words. After a few minutes, I was able to force myself to say the names of some people I know - Mom, Joe, Tom, then a few simple sentences. But I sounded (and I don't mean to be insensitive here) like someone who'd had a serious stroke. And I was beginning to worry that's what had happened to me. Meanwhile, I could walk and move just fine, I'd remembered my password, and I could read normally. But I still couldn't talk. Also, my thinking was normal and, for some reason, I was pretty sure what was happening to me would be temporary. And it was. After about 20 or 25 minutes, in the space of just a second, my speech returned and I was back to normal. It was like someone flipped a switch. Maybe I should also mention that during the whole episode I had a very runny nose. So my question is, has anyone else ever experienced something like this? My theory is that part of my brain hadn't woken up yet but that's a complete guess. Anyway, I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts. And no, I haven't seen a doctor yet but I'm planning to next week. Thanks in advance, William in Brooklyn"

Is there any chance to get sick by rabbies or herpes b or any other desease after exposure to water that huge amount of aggresive monkeys that bite and scratch each other were in? Like if little bit saliva or blood touched my wound in the water? Also I have red areas near the wound"

I am now in the process of trying to get a diagnosis for other symptoms which fit Ankylosing Spondylitis. TNF inhibitors are sometimes used for treatment, however, I've read that they shouldn't be used by MS patients. I'm wondering if anyone here also has Spondylitis and what medication they're taking. Methotrexate is another drug used, which I've read may also be beneficial for MS. NSAIDS have not been effective enough, so I'm thinking I may need something stronger. I'll be seeing a rheumatologist in a couple of weeks, and want to go in with as much knowledge as possible. The first rheumatologist I saw didn't give me any diagnosis because blood work wasn't conclusive, even though the labs show I have inflammation and I have several other symptoms. Another doctor suspects Spondylitis, which is how I learned about it. I appreciate any information or advice anyone here can provide."

Joint pain along with swelling in my left first finger and sometimes left thumb for about 6 months. Hip pain on the right for about a year and now since the event, my left hip is painful. Vision in my right eye is getting very blurry the last 6 months (always had 20/20), chest pain in random areas, I think it's my lungs and doesn't hurt more or less when breathing, just random stabbing pains constantly but my chest x-ray was clear. Echo was also clear with bubble study. Blood is perfect other then my MCH and MCHC has been on a steady decline by half a point to a full point every 6 months for the last 2 years.

It is soft to the touch and not discolored. I can only see it in certain lighting but recently within the past month I have noticed it is pulsing with my heartbeat. I have felt my facial artery and followed it from the mandible and it feels larger on my left than on my right. I have gone to the dermatologist and they said they had never seen anything like that before. I then went to an oral surgeon who suggested I go and get an angiogram CT for the possibility it is a facial AVM. I have been worried about that possibility non stop and I wanted to post this because I have seen other people online post about similar pulsating bumps under the skin about the size of a pea near their mouths and I wanted to start this new thread because all the old ones were closed and didn’t allow me to post or comment. I was wondering if anyone has had a similar situation and if it was an AVM or if it was just that their facial artery was large and close to the surface in a particular area. I am a male and 21 years old so for it to be a facial AVM I feel that I would be diagnosed pretty late considering most AVM’s are formed around birth. I am looking to see if anyone could offer another possible theory on what it is and/or find people with the same condition so I can let you know what the results of my CT angiogram says because no one seems to know what is going on with this pulsing in my face. I am getting the CT next Friday so I will come back and post my results but in the meantime if anyone thinks they might have an alternate hypothesis please let me know and if you have this same issue, what did you find out."

He has a severe headache, vomiting, sometimes numbness on one side of his body, slur speech, not able to communicate well, and says things that don't make sense. He has no fever but feels very warm. CT was negative, MRI with out contrast did not show anything. The neurologist does not care that my husband symptoms are getting worse and just treats it like a migraine. He has not even looked at the MRI himself. My husband does not have a history of migraines. He had one in 2014 when he was deployed over seas and very sick. But having one does not make it a history. My husband is almost 30. His headaches wake him up at night and then the vomting starts. He has lost so much weight the past 2 weeks. He was very healthy and did not take any medication prior to 2 weeks ago. I am very worried about his lack of ability to tell me he is in pain, and the ramdom things he keeps saying. A spinal tab has not been done. The neurologist says he does not look sick enough.  My husband is very weak and very discouraged. He has never been sick like this in his life. He just wants to get better. Nothing is working."

I tend to search every crevice for an answer, most have been found.As of late, I’ve learned the meaning of helpless. My son has changed, everyday I see it. I cant fix it & I feel like I’m losing him. Last year we moved from the only place he called home to Waynesboro pa. A few months later,after dealing with passing sadness & waves of home sick crashing around us, my son began having these episodes that are best described as an autistic type meltdown. They are brought on by stressors such as frustration, or me asking him to do something he wasn't prepared to do,like me saying, “peyt bedtime, “ or his most frequent stressor from the past was accidently breaking his mouse from his fidgeting(causes worst meltdown). I can usually tell when his control is slipping or if it is going to be a troubled day. In the past, when these stressors happened the change was gradual & he could sometimes calm down if left alone. Now, he snaps first into a rage of bashing his desk, forcing his chair arm, squeezing a remote till it cracks, his strength is intensified & with it the rage, I must move him from the initial area to his bed, soft things wont cause pain. With this comes the headache, extreme sound and light sensitivity, repeating words to himself, stimming, unable to communicate in sentence form, unable to move his legs to walk or stand (brain appears stuck in a loop). When I tell him to move to the bed he doesn’t hear, he repeats loudly as if responding to the initial stressor. When finally he hears and he tries to comply, he can’t make his body move, his brain seems stuck. He tries harder to get up from his chair and his legs start to move & kick like running. Then he rocks in a hunched position and repeats,”wait, waaaaaaaait, just wait. “ He never gets his legs to move functionally but he gets to the bed, with prodding I get him to drink his chamomile tea & he begins to calm. His calm down always ends in tears, sadness of past life events and crying. He has no memory of these episodes. If he is slipping into one he cannot focus on any task & he retains no information. For instance, Peyt very much enjoys editing videos & was working on a project close to bedtime when I said, “hey lil guy almost bed time, “ he snapped into the beginnings of an episode. He repeated no no no no no & rocked. Then hes unresponsive to my words, as if he cant hear them, however during these times sound & light disturbs him to extremes. His hearing turns extraordinary & he repeats""why are you shouting, why are you shouting,"" when it was but a whisper of words I spoke.He s unable to feel normal for days after. This began last year. His anxiety has been crippling this week, any mentions of outside or future plans & he starts to slip away. He also gets headaches, cold sweats, hot chills and his vision has worsened.  When Peyton began school I took quick notice of him being 8-12in taller than every child. At 13 hes now 5.9, with a deep voice, facial & other hair (found grey hair on is scalp)also his head is almost an inch in circumference larger than the adult male standard(I hadn't noticed at the time of appointment, so it wasnt mentioned to the endocrine) This year he was tested for gigantism, I was told his hand xray revealed he was in the growth stage of a 17 year old.  From around age 7 change was an issue, but he was able to cope within a day. Once I bought him a gaming chair he had been asking for, he cried over the old one, saying he can't take it, he can't take it. We got a kitten and he cried, muttering words of, ""it's too different, I can't keep it,"" all the while he hugged and nuzzled its little furry body. I also had to advance warn/remind him of any arrangements, in countdown form, from a week away to a few days to a few hours to a few minutes. If we were going to the movies with mom-mom, I would do the usual countdown, Peyt, we’re going to the movies in 2 days, 1 day, 1hr, 30mins, 15mins... This made things easier, except for nights before, and always at bedtime, when his anxiety of what is to come upon his waking, looms over him like a blanket of dread. On such nights even if it is something that I must do & in no way involves him, the questions begin, "" how long will it take, are you sure it's just the movies, when will we/you be back, what if I can't fall asleep(but for holidays, he has never had a problem sleeping), "" &t it continues from 30mins to hours. He also had a mild ocd (turning, checking door knob & unable to not touch curious things, like smudges in the toilet bowl) he overcame parts of it quickly. Now 13 he touches things, especially in stores, just last month he asked ""mom, can you please not leave a pan soaking? I have to touch it &I know I don't want to.”  Any ideas, hunches, experiences, I’ll take them. I need direction. I had lymes and Im still symptomatic. Today, I thought, maybe a tick borne disease could be a cause of his new behaviors? He has Keystone central chip&has seen his pcp who referred him to an endocrine for possible acromegaly(told he is normal) and psychiatrist(im afraid will only treat symptoms &miss an underlying cause that may be apparent to others). I have no strength left, this week has taken all of me. I am just a mom whose only want is for her littleguy to be okay. He was okay & now he’s not & I don’t know how to help him.

A few months later,after dealing with passing sadness & waves of home sick crashing around us, my son began having these episodes that are best described as an autistic type meltdown. They are brought on by stressors such as frustration, or me asking him to do something he wasn't prepared to do,like me saying, “peyt bedtime, “ or his most frequent stressor from the past was accidently breaking his mouse from his fidgeting(causes worst meltdown). I can usually tell when his control is slipping or if it is going to be a troubled day. In the past, when these stressors happened the change was gradual & he could sometimes calm down if left alone. Now, he snaps first into a rage of bashing his desk, forcing his chair arm, squeezing a remote till it cracks, his strength is intensified & with it the rage, I must move him from the initial area to his bed, soft things wont cause pain. With this comes the headache, extreme sound and light sensitivity, repeating words to himself, stimming, unable to communicate in sentence form, unable to move his legs to walk or stand (brain appears stuck in a loop). When I tell him to move to the bed he doesn’t hear, he repeats loudly as if responding to the initial stressor. When finally he hears and he tries to comply, he can’t make his body move, his brain seems stuck. He tries harder to get up from his chair and his legs start to move & kick like running. Then he rocks in a hunched position and repeats,”wait, waaaaaaaait, just wait. “ He never gets his legs to move functionally but he gets to the bed, with prodding I get him to drink his chamomile tea & he begins to calm. His calm down always ends in tears, sadness of past life events and crying. He has no memory of these episodes. If he is slipping into one he cannot focus on any task & he retains no information. For instance, Peyt very much enjoys editing videos & was working on a project close to bedtime when I said, “hey lil guy almost bed time, “ he snapped into the beginnings of an episode. He repeated no no no no no & rocked. Then hes unresponsive to my words, as if he cant hear them, however during these times sound & light disturbs him to extremes. His hearing turns extraordinary & he repeats""why are you shouting, why are you shouting,"" when it was but a whisper of words I spoke.He s unable to feel normal for days after. This began last year. His anxiety has been crippling this week, any mentions of outside or future plans & he starts to slip away. He also gets headaches, cold sweats, hot chills and his vision has worsened.  When Peyton began school I took quick notice of him being 8-12in taller than every child. At 13 hes now 5.9, with a deep voice, facial & other hair (found grey hair on is scalp)also his head is almost an inch in circumference larger than the adult male standard(I hadn't noticed at the time of appointment, so it wasnt mentioned to the endocrine) This year he was tested for gigantism, I was told his hand xray revealed he was in the growth stage of a 17 year old.  From around age 7 change was an issue, but he was able to cope within a day. Once I bought him a gaming chair he had been asking for, he cried over the old one, saying he can't take it, he can't take it. We got a kitten and he cried, muttering words of, ""it's too different, I can't keep it,"" all the while he hugged and nuzzled its little furry body. I also had to advance warn/remind him of any arrangements, in countdown form, from a week away to a few days to a few hours to a few minutes. If we were going to the movies with mom-mom, I would do the usual countdown, Peyt, we’re going to the movies in 2 days, 1 day, 1hr, 30mins, 15mins... This made things easier, except for nights before, and always at bedtime, when his anxiety of what is to come upon his waking, looms over him like a blanket of dread. On such nights even if it is something that I must do & in no way involves him, the questions begin, "" how long will it take, are you sure it's just the movies, when will we/you be back, what if I can't fall asleep(but for holidays, he has never had a problem sleeping), "" &t it continues from 30mins to hours. He also had a mild ocd (turning, checking door knob & unable to not touch curious things, like smudges in the toilet bowl) he overcame parts of it quickly. Now 13 he touches things, especially in stores, just last month he asked ""mom, can you please not leave a pan soaking? I have to touch it &I know I don't want to.”  Any ideas, hunches, experiences, I’ll take them. I need direction. I had lymes and Im still symptomatic. Today, I thought, maybe a tick borne disease could be a cause of his new behaviors? He has Keystone central chip&has seen his pcp who referred him to an endocrine for possible acromegaly(told he is normal) and psychiatrist(im afraid will only treat symptoms &miss an underlying cause that may be apparent to others). I have no strength left, this week has taken all of me. I am just a mom whose only want is for her littleguy to be okay. He was okay & now he’s not & I don’t know how to help him. I don’t know who to ask or where to go to find him help. Katrina"

He limps a lot, has a bad back, and seems like he may fall over any moment. He is often unable to fall asleep and stay asleep; he was hospitalized briefly on his 64th birthday a few months ago with an irregular heartbeat, and went for an emergency EKG again a few weeks later after being unable to sleep all night with a severe headache, which I heard came out normal. Since then, he has not had any serious incidents. He doesn’t think it’s arthritis, but some nervous system disorder. He has been to doctors who have prescribed him Ambien, Neurontin, and a few other generics, but he says those drugs have not helped him very well.

I am partially visually impaired person. at the time of occurrence, I am partially blind, I don't know how to explain my situation. That much worst is my condition.  It's like heavy impulses of pain hitting the both sides of my head and this will last up to two days and I can't continue with my work as I need to constantly look at computer screen.   I am not that much aware of this situation and is not a wizard like you guys. The one and only relaxation from this situation for me are the pot smoking. I feel relaxed when I smoke. I know pot will not cure my situation and it is just a 'way' to escape from those pain. I am planning to resign from my current job, I know there is no permanent cure to my situation."

He had non-affected parents and 8 siblings, his condition was tentatively attributed to a heavy head trauma with brain contusion 14 years prior to the illness, and possibly lifetime diesel exhaust exposure (there was a study about truck drivers more suspectible to SALS). In August 2015, I started to feel a heaviness/subclinical weakness in my left arm and hand, which was worse in cold weather, but mostly gone into remission by now. Shortly after that, I started experiencing bodywide fasciculations, for which I had exams in September 2015. The neurological exam was unremarkable, the EMG found no abnormality in the left opponens pollicis, abductor digiti minimi and tibialis anterior. I also had negative SOD1 and C9orf72 tests. The fasciculations waxed and waned, slightly controlled by Carbamazepine and Diazepam, but somewhat worsened in the last few months, which I attributed to work-related stress. I have a hot spot over my left eyebrow which has been twitching almost non-stop for 2 years. Sometimes when I twitch, I experience an electric-shock like sensation going down the side of my neck. I have high arches (inherited from my mother) and I also experienced mild sensory symptoms, essential tremor, joint cracking, migrating back pain (scoliosis/sitting for long in an abnormal posture?) a spontaneously resolving right abducens palsy, and moderate trigeminal neuralgia-like episodes (every 3-4 months, moves from one side of the jaw to the other). Cramps were rare (once every 3-4 weeks), nightly and always happened in the calves. Prior to the onset of my disease, I had (mostly morning) nausea and vomiting for 3-4 years, which resolved appr. when the other symptoms started. I also had (and has) proctalgia fugax for years. My cervical MRI in 2015 was unremarkable (scoliosis), my cranial MRI in 2016 showed a DVA and a non specific periventricular occipital T2 lesion. In December 2016 I had a NCS, which found a mild carpal tunnel in my right hand and mild generalized temporal dispersion suggestive of demyelination. I had a clean immune test, incl. anti-GM1. In July 2017 I had a 2 week episode of left shoulder stiffness, which was found to be not spastic in a neuro exam. I also had a 2 day neck stiffness shortly after that, which I attributed to my lifestyle and work. In the last few weeks, I started to feel bilateral knee stiffness/""wobbling""/""jelly-like feeling"" (worse in the left side), which causes tremor when standing up after sitting for long. However, I was still able to hike 10+ miles in an difficult terrain even though I'm not athletic. What's more, my legs felt somewhat better after that. A follow-up EMG in this September picked up the following abnormalities, which is summarized by the EMG neurologist as ""minor abnormalities of uncertain etiology"" Mild amplitude reduction and temporal dispersion (worse than in 2016) in the left peroneus with decreased F-Wave persistence. Increased insertional activity, CRDs when moving the needle or percussion, fibs and psw in certain needle positions in the left tibialis anterior. Mild subacute neur. lesion. Incr. ins. activity, fibs when moving the needle, no spontaneous activity at rest. mild polyph. MUP in the left deltoid. This muscle was considered normal (?) in the summary Incr. ins. activity, fasciculations, fibs in multiple needle positions, active partial denervation in the left frontalis. Aplitude increase, fibs and fasciculations in some needle positions in the right longissimus thoracic. Subacute neur. lesion. Interference pattern/recruitment were otherwise normal. My questions/concerns about this EMG are the following: My understanding is that cranial and paraspinal denervation are highly specific for ALS. In that sense, and given the other findings, how valid are the ""minor"" and ""unspecific"" terms in the EMG summary My understanding from the poly MUP in my arm EMG that it's indicative of reinnervation. Is it possible in ALS to practically regain all strength for months in a muscle? Do the non-MND symptoms point to something or are they appear to be incidental findings? I strongly lean toward PMA/LMN-dominant ALS, but the onset of my symptoms, the lack of clinical weaknes, no athrophy (I have a dent in my right gluteus, but my neuro said it was pressure lipoathrophy, and I believe her), improvement in my arm and other symptoms seem very strange..."

In August 2015, I started to feel a heaviness/subclinical weakness in my left arm and hand, which was worse in cold weather, but mostly gone into remission by now. Shortly after that, I started experiencing bodywide fasciculations, for which I had exams in September 2015. The neurological exam was unremarkable, the EMG found no abnormality in the left opponens pollicis, abductor digiti minimi and tibialis anterior. I also had negative SOD1 and C9orf72 tests. The fasciculations waxed and waned, slightly controlled by Carbamazepine and Diazepam, but somewhat worsened in the last few months, which I attributed to work-related stress. I have a hot spot over my left eyebrow which has been twitching almost non-stop for 2 years. Sometimes when I twitch, I experience an electric-shock like sensation going down the side of my neck. I have high arches (inherited from my mother) and I also experienced mild sensory symptoms, essential tremor, joint cracking, migrating back pain (scoliosis/sitting for long in an abnormal posture?) a spontaneously resolving right abducens palsy, and moderate trigeminal neuralgia-like episodes (every 3-4 months, moves from one side of the jaw to the other).

Aplitude increase, fibs and fasciculations in some needle positions in the right longissimus thoracic. Subacute neur. lesion. Interference pattern/recruitment were otherwise normal. My questions/concerns about this EMG are the following: My understanding is that cranial and paraspinal denervation are highly specific for ALS. In that sense, and given the other findings, how valid are the ""minor"" and ""unspecific"" terms in the EMG summary My understanding from the poly MUP in my arm EMG that it's indicative of reinnervation. Is it possible in ALS to practically regain all strength for months in a muscle? Do the non-MND symptoms point to something or are they appear to be incidental findings? I strongly lean toward PMA/LMN-dominant ALS, but the onset of my symptoms, the lack of clinical weaknes, no athrophy (I have a dent in my right gluteus, but my neuro said it was pressure lipoathrophy, and I believe her), improvement in my arm and other symptoms seem very strange..."

For the past year or so, I have been experiencing episodes of distorted sense of smell. It happens randomly, after certain triggers. It is EXTREMELY difficult for me to describe. One moment, all is well. Then suddenly, a strange smell appears out of nowhere and stays, and all other smells, although detected, but become extremely distorted (usually pungent) e.g. a deodorant/perfume smell would feel much stronger than it really is and a bit different or pungent. This happens in both nostrils and in different frequencies, sometimes everyday, sometimes every other day, sometimes 2-3 times a week and so on. Triggers: Sharp inhale/exhale  Laughing  Sneezing Sometimes, I can feel that it is about to happen. Relieving factors: Only sleep. Otherwise, it stays even the whole day once it begins. But things become normal after I wake up. Then, a sneeze or other trigger can bring it back again for the entire day till I sleep again. Indeed, when it happens, I feel somewhat sleepy or else lose desire to do other things. There are no other symptoms and I do not have any known medical conditions (thankfully). I am also not on any drugs. No one in my family has such symptoms. Is it bothering me? Certainly yes. For one thing, food loses all its delicacy because of the weird smells. Secondly, it makes me annoyed and not want to do anything till it goes away. Other info: I do have a DNS, but I am unsure if this seems to have anything to do with it. The problem seems to be higher up, in my opinion. I also have an occasional complaint of eye flashes."

Sometimes I may not experience that pain for months. It does not feel like muscle pain, I didnt pull anything, no visible brusing or marks, did not sustain any injuries. Recently I experienced hot/cold sensations followed by pins/needles in my right foot that lasted for 20-30 minutes. A week later (last Friday) I experienced severe hot/cold sensation in my right arm from shoulder to hand, lasting 20 minutes. Followed by weakness in that same arm for a few hours. I also experience heat sensations in areas on my legs at different times. I have numbness in both big toes that seems permanent. I also have Raynaud's disease which I feel could be connected.

I'm at my wits end! I don't know what to do, I'm only a 19 year old female. Any advice or comments, suggestions, inferences or hypotheses as to what could possibly be going on with me would greatly appreciated. (writing this with shaky hands), here's a little in sight of what's been going on/ when it started and the symptoms i've been experiencing. I've wrote down the dates from day 1 to present (which might be a little off) *Prior to the first date i've listed below, I was experiencing other symptoms over the course of a month but gradually. Fatigue, feeling like I was in a fog most of the time, trouble remembering things, concentrating, just didn't feel all there. I noticed my right eye felt as if it wasn't as strong as my right one (blurriness). My right ear also felt plugged all the time followed by a pain on the right side of my face that was connected from my ear to my jaw that lasted a little more than a month but has now subsided. Things such as clumsiness, tingling in my hands and feet and weakness were also experienced. *May 27th 2017* Was when I first went to the ER for an excruciating headache, I was given an IV + headache medication, I felt this feeling of general discomfort throughout my body as the medication was going through the IV to my arm (have not felt the same since, it was like an irritable feeling that I still sometimes experience.) A few days after that I began to feel very shaky and just not okay. Was still having problems with my right eye, was also continuing to suffer from the intense headache listed above but it was now causing a burning sensation in different areas of my head and the back of my neck. This headache and feeling of pressure/ burning sensations continued on for about a week or so.  *June 3rd* was STILL experiencing this same headache/pressure and burning sensation, so I went back to the ER. After waiting for 4hrs+ at the ER just to see the doctor, he examined me and didn’t think anything too serious of the headache suggesting a possible sinus infection. I told him I didn’t think it was just a sinus infection after mentioning a history of brain tumour in my family, I asked for a CT scan of my head just to make sure. Hesitant to give me the CT scan because of his doubt that there was anything seriously wrong (such as a brain tumor) he prescribed me sinus infection medication and sent me on my way. *June 7th Went back to the ER with the same severe persistent headache and burning sensations throughout my head and neck along with a few new symptoms that presented themselves such as weakness as well as a burning sensation on the top of my legs. I was seen by a different doctor this time, who thought a CT scan was in my best interest. I agreed to the CT scan of the brain which came back as in fact sinus inflammation in the brain. I was given RAN- CLARITHROMYCIN 500MG & PMS-DEXAMETHASONE 4 MG. Although a sinus infection was the only thing to come of the CT scan, the symptoms I had been experiencing and explained to the doctor earlier ex. burning in my neck and head, trouble with my right eye, intense migraines, clumsiness, cognitive issues (poor memory, unable to concentrate) ""brain fog"", muscle weakness, suggested him to believe it could be something more, he mentioned a possibility of MS and told me he was going to order an MRI of my brain to rule it out.  *After taking the medication for the sinus infection the headaches did stop*. From June 7th - 16th awaiting the MRI of my brain the doctor from the ER had ordered I was very stressed and depressed about thinking MS was what was causing all these symptoms. I was under extreme amounts of stress. At this time I started noticing the fatigue becoming worse where I would just have to lay down due to feeling very weak and physically exhausted. Also at this time I noticed I was having sleep troubles. I would have a hard time falling asleep even to just nap even though my body was so tired, my brain would just not allow me to sleep. At night time especially I would also have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep as I would wake up every couple hours. I also noticed I'd developed a slight tremor in my right hand/arm whenever I would lay down. The tremor was not as noticeable to the naked eye as it was within my body, it would keep me awake as well due to just being uncomfortable. Within the next two weeks of experiencing these symptoms I also noticed a decrease in my weight. I lost a total of 14 pounds unintentionally, but possibly due to extreme stress.  *June 17th I had the MRI of my head. The tremor in my hand/arm got slightly worse as you could now see a slight shake with the naked eye, I also noticed my legs would twitch while laying down and feel as if they had a slight vibration to them coming from the inside. *June 19th exhausted from only getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night accompanied by the weakness in my body and tremor, I also noticed an irritable feeling in my upper back from time to time making it very uncomfortable to lay down or to sit for long periods. It felt almost as if I had restless back syndrome that persisted throughout the day and the night. Sometimes this feeling would go into my arms, as well as the burning sensations on the top of my legs continuing to persist. *June 22 Was my appointment with the neurologist to discuss my prior MRI scan of my brain to see if MS was the reason behind these symptoms or not. I and was told by the neurologist my brain scan was clear having no lesions, and that MS was ruled out. After explaining to the neurologist my still existing symptoms they did a physical neurological exam confirming it was still not MS. They then suggested an anti anxiety medication. I had an appointment with my family doctor that following day, and explained the persisting symptoms I was still having. My doctor also related it back to anxiety and prescribed me with an antidepressant/anti anxiety medication which I have not taken because I do not agree that these symptoms are from anxiety. As well as ordering more blood work, checking levels, deficiencies and ruling out any other scary things such as Lymes, Lupus, RA, & crohn's disease. *All blood work has came back normal, and negative for any autoimmune/rheumatic diseases*.  A few weeks later with still no answers and the same persisting symptoms, along with some new ones that are becoming quite concerning. I’m now experiencing widespread pain throughout my body. These pains come and go hitting my body in different areas giving me extreme muscle pain mainly in my back, forearms, shoulders, hips, knees and buttocks. The pain intensifies in different areas, the other day I woke up with my upper back aching for hours and then it would move down to my lower back. Then the next day my back wouldn't hurt any more but my left forearm would be in excruciating muscle pain as if I'd just exercised heavily the day before (which I did not). Other extremities such as my ankles, hands, feet, toes and fingers would just ache,pain and almost feel like little electric shocks(mainly in fingers and toes), throughout the day accompanied by the burning sensation. I am still not able to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night. I’ve woken up overheating and sweating, not being able to swallow. A rash that appeared out of nowhere on my neck (went away after an hour) along with a very flushed face. Restless back and leg pain (in the day and at night). At this point I just don’t know what to do!! I’m out of answers, very frustrated and in pain :( Could this be a neurological problem? brain damage? fibromyalgia?

A few weeks later with still no answers and the same persisting symptoms, along with some new ones that are becoming quite concerning. I’m now experiencing widespread pain throughout my body. These pains come and go hitting my body in different areas giving me extreme muscle pain mainly in my back, forearms, shoulders, hips, knees and buttocks. The pain intensifies in different areas, the other day I woke up with my upper back aching for hours and then it would move down to my lower back. Then the next day my back wouldn't hurt any more but my left forearm would be in excruciating muscle pain as if I'd just exercised heavily the day before (which I did not). Other extremities such as my ankles, hands, feet, toes and fingers would just ache,pain and almost feel like little electric shocks(mainly in fingers and toes), throughout the day accompanied by the burning sensation. I am still not able to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night. I’ve woken up overheating and sweating, not being able to swallow. A rash that appeared out of nowhere on my neck (went away after an hour) along with a very flushed face. Restless back and leg pain (in the day and at night).

I'm at my wits end! I don't know what to do, I'm only a 19 year old female. Any advice or comments, suggestions, inferences or hypotheses as to what could possibly be going on with me would greatly appreciated. (writing this with shaky hands), here's a little in sight of what's been going on/ when it started and the symptoms i've been experiencing. I've wrote down the dates from day 1 to present (which might be a little off) *Prior to the first date i've listed below, I was experiencing other symptoms over the course of a month but gradually. Fatigue, feeling like I was in a fog most of the time, trouble remembering things, concentrating, just didn't feel all there. I noticed my right eye felt as if it wasn't as strong as my right one (blurriness). My right ear also felt plugged all the time followed by a pain on the right side of my face that was connected from my ear to my jaw that lasted a little more than a month but has now subsided. Things such as clumsiness, tingling in my hands and feet and weakness were also experienced. *May 27th 2017* Was when I first went to the ER for an excruciating headache, I was given an IV + headache medication, I felt this feeling of general discomfort throughout my body as the medication was going through the IV to my arm (have not felt the same since, it was like an irritable feeling that I still sometimes experience.) A few days after that I began to feel very shaky and just not okay. Was still having problems with my right eye, was also continuing to suffer from the intense headache listed above but it was now causing a burning sensation in different areas of my head and the back of my neck. This headache and feeling of pressure/ burning sensations continued on for about a week or so.  *June 3rd* was STILL experiencing this same headache/pressure and burning sensation, so I went back to the ER. After waiting for 4hrs+ at the ER just to see the doctor, he examined me and didn’t think anything too serious of the headache suggesting a possible sinus infection. I told him I didn’t think it was just a sinus infection after mentioning a history of brain tumour in my family, I asked for a CT scan of my head just to make sure. Hesitant to give me the CT scan because of his doubt that there was anything seriously wrong (such as a brain tumor) he prescribed me sinus infection medication and sent me on my way. *June 7th Went back to the ER with the same severe persistent headache and burning sensations throughout my head and neck along with a few new symptoms that presented themselves such as weakness as well as a burning sensation on the top of my legs. I was seen by a different doctor this time, who thought a CT scan was in my best interest. I agreed to the CT scan of the brain which came back as in fact sinus inflammation in the brain. I was given RAN- CLARITHROMYCIN 500MG & PMS-DEXAMETHASONE 4 MG. Although a sinus infection was the only thing to come of the CT scan, the symptoms I had been experiencing and explained to the doctor earlier ex. burning in my neck and head, trouble with my right eye, intense migraines, clumsiness, cognitive issues (poor memory, unable to concentrate) ""brain fog"", muscle weakness, suggested him to believe it could be something more, he mentioned a possibility of MS and told me he was going to order an MRI of my brain to rule it out.  *After taking the medication for the sinus infection the headaches did stop*. From June 7th - 16th awaiting the MRI of my brain the doctor from the ER had ordered I was very stressed and depressed about thinking MS was what was causing all these symptoms. I was under extreme amounts of stress. At this time I started noticing the fatigue becoming worse where I would just have to lay down due to feeling very weak and physically exhausted. Also at this time I noticed I was having sleep troubles. I would have a hard time falling asleep even to just nap even though my body was so tired, my brain would just not allow me to sleep. At night time especially I would also have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep as I would wake up every couple hours. I also noticed I'd developed a slight tremor in my right hand/arm whenever I would lay down. The tremor was not as noticeable to the naked eye as it was within my body, it would keep me awake as well due to just being uncomfortable. Within the next two weeks of experiencing these symptoms I also noticed a decrease in my weight. I lost a total of 14 pounds unintentionally, but possibly due to extreme stress.  *June 17th I had the MRI of my head. The tremor in my hand/arm got slightly worse as you could now see a slight shake with the naked eye, I also noticed my legs would twitch while laying down and feel as if they had a slight vibration to them coming from the inside. *June 19th exhausted from only getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night accompanied by the weakness in my body and tremor, I also noticed an irritable feeling in my upper back from time to time making it very uncomfortable to lay down or to sit for long periods. It felt almost as if I had restless back syndrome that persisted throughout the day and the night. Sometimes this feeling would go into my arms, as well as the burning sensations on the top of my legs continuing to persist. *June 22 Was my appointment with the neurologist to discuss my prior MRI scan of my brain to see if MS was the reason behind these symptoms or not. I and was told by the neurologist my brain scan was clear having no lesions, and that MS was ruled out. After explaining to the neurologist my still existing symptoms they did a physical neurological exam confirming it was still not MS. They then suggested an anti anxiety medication. I had an appointment with my family doctor that following day, and explained the persisting symptoms I was still having. My doctor also related it back to anxiety and prescribed me with an antidepressant/anti anxiety medication which I have not taken because I do not agree that these symptoms are from anxiety.

I was seen by a different doctor this time, who thought a CT scan was in my best interest. I agreed to the CT scan of the brain which came back as in fact sinus inflammation in the brain. I was given RAN- CLARITHROMYCIN 500MG & PMS-DEXAMETHASONE 4 MG. Although a sinus infection was the only thing to come of the CT scan, the symptoms I had been experiencing and explained to the doctor earlier ex. burning in my neck and head, trouble with my right eye, intense migraines, clumsiness, cognitive issues (poor memory, unable to concentrate) ""brain fog"", muscle weakness, suggested him to believe it could be something more, he mentioned a possibility of MS and told me he was going to order an MRI of my brain to rule it out.  *After taking the medication for the sinus infection the headaches did stop*. From June 7th - 16th awaiting the MRI of my brain the doctor from the ER had ordered I was very stressed and depressed about thinking MS was what was causing all these symptoms. I was under extreme amounts of stress. At this time I started noticing the fatigue becoming worse where I would just have to lay down due to feeling very weak and physically exhausted. Also at this time I noticed I was having sleep troubles. I would have a hard time falling asleep even to just nap even though my body was so tired, my brain would just not allow me to sleep. At night time especially I would also have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep as I would wake up every couple hours. I also noticed I'd developed a slight tremor in my right hand/arm whenever I would lay down. The tremor was not as noticeable to the naked eye as it was within my body, it would keep me awake as well due to just being uncomfortable. Within the next two weeks of experiencing these symptoms I also noticed a decrease in my weight. I lost a total of 14 pounds unintentionally, but possibly due to extreme stress.  *June 17th I had the MRI of my head. The tremor in my hand/arm got slightly worse as you could now see a slight shake with the naked eye, I also noticed my legs would twitch while laying down and feel as if they had a slight vibration to them coming from the inside. *June 19th exhausted from only getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night accompanied by the weakness in my body and tremor, I also noticed an irritable feeling in my upper back from time to time making it very uncomfortable to lay down or to sit for long periods. It felt almost as if I had restless back syndrome that persisted throughout the day and the night. Sometimes this feeling would go into my arms, as well as the burning sensations on the top of my legs continuing to persist. *June 22 Was my appointment with the neurologist to discuss my prior MRI scan of my brain to see if MS was the reason behind these symptoms or not. I and was told by the neurologist my brain scan was clear having no lesions, and that MS was ruled out. After explaining to the neurologist my still existing symptoms they did a physical neurological exam confirming it was still not MS. They then suggested an anti anxiety medication. I had an appointment with my family doctor that following day, and explained the persisting symptoms I was still having. My doctor also related it back to anxiety and prescribed me with an antidepressant/anti anxiety medication which I have not taken because I do not agree that these symptoms are from anxiety. As well as ordering more blood work, checking levels, deficiencies and ruling out any other scary things such as Lymes, Lupus, RA, & crohn's disease. *All blood work has came back normal, and negative for any autoimmune/rheumatic diseases*.  A few weeks later with still no answers and the same persisting symptoms, along with some new ones that are becoming quite concerning. I’m now experiencing widespread pain throughout my body. These pains come and go hitting my body in different areas giving me extreme muscle pain mainly in my back, forearms, shoulders, hips, knees and buttocks. The pain intensifies in different areas, the other day I woke up with my upper back aching for hours and then it would move down to my lower back. Then the next day my back wouldn't hurt any more but my left forearm would be in excruciating muscle pain as if I'd just exercised heavily the day before (which I did not). Other extremities such as my ankles, hands, feet, toes and fingers would just ache,pain and almost feel like little electric shocks(mainly in fingers and toes), throughout the day accompanied by the burning sensation. I am still not able to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night. I’ve woken up overheating and sweating, not being able to swallow. A rash that appeared out of nowhere on my neck (went away after an hour) along with a very flushed face. Restless back and leg pain (in the day and at night). At this point I just don’t know what to do!! I’m out of answers, very frustrated and in pain :( Could this be a neurological problem? brain damage? fibromyalgia?

(writing this with shaky hands), here's a little in sight of what's been going on/ when it started and the symptoms i've been experiencing. I've wrote down the dates from day 1 to present (which might be a little off) *Prior to the first date i've listed below, I was experiencing other symptoms over the course of a month but gradually. Fatigue, feeling like I was in a fog most of the time, trouble remembering things, concentrating, just didn't feel all there. I noticed my right eye felt as if it wasn't as strong as my right one (blurriness). My right ear also felt plugged all the time followed by a pain on the right side of my face that was connected from my ear to my jaw that lasted a little more than a month but has now subsided. Things such as clumsiness, tingling in my hands and feet and weakness were also experienced. *May 27th 2017* Was when I first went to the ER for an excruciating headache, I was given an IV + headache medication, I felt this feeling of general discomfort throughout my body as the medication was going through the IV to my arm (have not felt the same since, it was like an irritable feeling that I still sometimes experience.) A few days after that I began to feel very shaky and just not okay. Was still having problems with my right eye, was also continuing to suffer from the intense headache listed above but it was now causing a burning sensation in different areas of my head and the back of my neck. This headache and feeling of pressure/ burning sensations continued on for about a week or so.  *June 3rd* was STILL experiencing this same headache/pressure and burning sensation, so I went back to the ER. After waiting for 4hrs+ at the ER just to see the doctor, he examined me and didn’t think anything too serious of the headache suggesting a possible sinus infection.

It has been 3 months I am suffering from tooth ache. I was handling it with clove oil. Last day when I checked it with my mirror I found a big hole. But till the day no food was entering the hall and irritating me. From yesterday onwards I am suffering from severe toothache too. When I told this to my friend, she told about tooth colored filling in Toronto (   )that can help me. I am planning to get that. Is there a need for a root canal treatment and then filling it? I guess the decay is about 4 months old, so what you guys think? Should I go for root canal treatment and then undergo filling or just filll the hall?"

It didn't seem to bad and I kept driving the car until I got a new one in the first week of October. In the last two weeks of having the car, the leak got worse. I always drove with the windows down, but I could smell the gasoline. I had headaches all the time and had trouble focusing and thinking on my feet, especially while talking to people. After I got rid of the car I started to feel better and could think more clearly. Around the end of December I started having really bad anxiety and depression and can't focus again. I'm wondering if the prolonged exposure to the gas has affected me permanently, or if I'm just having anxiety and depression causing me to not focus and understand people. Thanks for any help!"

I'm Lisa (46 years old) and I just joined. I'm seeking feedback about my medical issues because I'm beginning to wonder if I might have MS. I went to my doctor in November of 2016 because of stabbing pains in the back of my head (left side). She ordered imaging and the CT and MRI showed a large (2+ inch) lesion in my pituitary. It deforms my optic chiasm and encases arteries, etc., so I was referred to a neurosurgeon. He diagnosed it as an arachnoid cyst and told me it's congenital and I've had for a very long time. It also revealed that I have chiari malformation. Both the cyst and the chiari malformation were noted to be ""incidental findings"" by the neurosurgeon. He contacted my local eye doctor to have a visual field test done, which came back with defects in both eyes but primarily in the right eye. I was also referred to a neurologist for the head pains, which by then had moved to my eyes, forehead and other parts of my head. I was also having stinging in my head (in sort of a helmet distribution) that felt like tiny bee stings. I was diagnosed with occipital and trigeminal neuralgia which I'm currently taking gabapentin for. Because my visual field test was abnormal and because of the large cyst, my local eye doctor scheduled two VEP tests and another visual field test. He wouldn't say anything specific.. only ""I just want to make sure this isn't progressing"". The first VEP showed ""normal"" results but they were unable to get a clear signal on my right eye so the results were less than reliable. I return to my neurologist for a follow-up appointment. I had started having painless spasms in my legs so she ordered an EMG and nerve conduction study. Those were done the same day and showed normal findings so they ruled out ALS and other peripheral nerve possibilities. She was also concerned about my visual field test results. I was referred to another eye doctor who had another visual field test done and my right eye showed even more defects (mostly peripheral). She referred me to a neuro ophthamologist in case the defects are because of the cyst in my head. I have that appointment next month. I returned to my local eye doctor for the next VEP and this time they were able to get a good connection on both eyes (green signal) with two technicians working together. The VEP results were very strange. It showed only a reading for the low contrast on one eye and only high contrast for the other eye but not vice versa. The P100 did not register at all. It says ""P100 not identifed, abnormal VEP response"". The doctor was baffled with the results and said that there might be a latency but it's unclear. The doctor told me to take the printout with me to the neuro opthamolgist in June. I sent the VEP results to my neurosurgeon and my neurolgist. The neurosurgeon said that the VEP is not because of the cyst. The neurologist said, ""The VEP is not related to the conditions you are currently being treated for in our office"". I have a follow-up brain MRI in July to see if the cyst has grown as well as other possible changes. My neurologist scheduled me for three days after the MRI in case of any changes that might affect my treatment. After all of the reading I've done, I'm wondering if I might have MS. I have a shocking jolt (not really painful but uncomfortable) that goes down my spine when I bend my head too far forward (possiblly Lhermitte's sign?). I get extremely tired sometimes and can barely force myself to do basic housework. I might have more energy for a day or so and then I'm exhausted again without warning.

I'm uploading an image of my VEP results and a top view from my MRI showing the large cyst. Any comments would be appreciated. Thanks and God bless!"

I'm Lisa (46 years old) and I just joined. I'm seeking feedback about my medical issues because I'm beginning to wonder if I might have MS. I went to my doctor in November of 2016 because of stabbing pains in the back of my head (left side). She ordered imaging and the CT and MRI showed a large (2+ inch) lesion in my pituitary. It deforms my optic chiasm and encases arteries, etc., so I was referred to a neurosurgeon. He diagnosed it as an arachnoid cyst and told me it's congenital and I've had for a very long time. It also revealed that I have chiari malformation. Both the cyst and the chiari malformation were noted to be ""incidental findings"" by the neurosurgeon. He contacted my local eye doctor to have a visual field test done, which came back with defects in both eyes but primarily in the right eye. I was also referred to a neurologist for the head pains, which by then had moved to my eyes, forehead and other parts of my head. I was also having stinging in my head (in sort of a helmet distribution) that felt like tiny bee stings. I was diagnosed with occipital and trigeminal neuralgia which I'm currently taking gabapentin for. Because my visual field test was abnormal and because of the large cyst, my local eye doctor scheduled two VEP tests and another visual field test. He wouldn't say anything specific.. only ""I just want to make sure this isn't progressing"". The first VEP showed ""normal"" results but they were unable to get a clear signal on my right eye so the results were less than reliable. I return to my neurologist for a follow-up appointment. I had started having painless spasms in my legs so she ordered an EMG and nerve conduction study. Those were done the same day and showed normal findings so they ruled out ALS and other peripheral nerve possibilities. She was also concerned about my visual field test results. I was referred to another eye doctor who had another visual field test done and my right eye showed even more defects (mostly peripheral). She referred me to a neuro ophthamologist in case the defects are because of the cyst in my head. I have that appointment next month. I returned to my local eye doctor for the next VEP and this time they were able to get a good connection on both eyes (green signal) with two technicians working together. The VEP results were very strange. It showed only a reading for the low contrast on one eye and only high contrast for the other eye but not vice versa. The P100 did not register at all. It says ""P100 not identifed, abnormal VEP response"". The doctor was baffled with the results and said that there might be a latency but it's unclear. The doctor told me to take the printout with me to the neuro opthamolgist in June. I sent the VEP results to my neurosurgeon and my neurolgist. The neurosurgeon said that the VEP is not because of the cyst. The neurologist said, ""The VEP is not related to the conditions you are currently being treated for in our office"". I have a follow-up brain MRI in July to see if the cyst has grown as well as other possible changes. My neurologist scheduled me for three days after the MRI in case of any changes that might affect my treatment. After all of the reading I've done, I'm wondering if I might have MS. I have a shocking jolt (not really painful but uncomfortable) that goes down my spine when I bend my head too far forward (possiblly Lhermitte's sign?). I get extremely tired sometimes and can barely force myself to do basic housework. I might have more energy for a day or so and then I'm exhausted again without warning.

Since last November I have been having issues with blurred vision that comes and goes on a daily basis. When my vision is clear it is 20/20 or better (tested at opto) and when it's bad I can't read a stop sign when it's right in front of me. I also feel fatigued and fuzzy when this goes on. My vision fluctuates throughout the day and can change very quickly (within a couple minutes). It is blurry to some degree about 80% of the time. It all started in November of 2016 (no symptoms prior) when I had the worst migraine of my life. (I'm 26 and had migraines as a kid but was migraine free for 7 years before this). It started with visual aura and then led to incredible pain, blindness, numbness in my face and hands, fatigue, confusion, and eventually an inability to talk. I was able to speak words but they were random words, not what I wanted to say and then it got harder to speak until I couldn't speak at all. At the worst point I could barely stand and I was shaking very badly. A friend drove me to the ER on base (currently active duty) and they admitted me about 2 hours after this started. They thought I had done drugs (never have never will) so there was some delay while they did blood work to prove that it wasn't that. I was also throwing up the entire time. They did a ct scan and it came back clear on stroke, TIA, etc. so they sent me home when my symptoms began to get better (they gave me Benadryl).  Since then, the blurriness has been a constant issue and I've been working with a military neurologist to figure out what is going on. They did MRI's with contrast to check for MS etc., conductivity tests, field of vision tests, and sent me to an optomologist for a complete checkup etc. but they have all come back negative/clear. The final verdict the neurologist came up with was silent persistent migraine with aura. I would be inclined to agree with this except that when the vision is blurry, squinting clears it up as does a lense. Yet when my vision is clear, it is crystal clear. I can push through the fatigue and the fuzziness but the blurry vision is killing me and impacting my work. Does anyone have any insight to this or does anyone have a similar story with a treatment?

They did a ct scan and it came back clear on stroke, TIA, etc. so they sent me home when my symptoms began to get better (they gave me Benadryl).  Since then, the blurriness has been a constant issue and I've been working with a military neurologist to figure out what is going on. They did MRI's with contrast to check for MS etc., conductivity tests, field of vision tests, and sent me to an optomologist for a complete checkup etc. but they have all come back negative/clear. The final verdict the neurologist came up with was silent persistent migraine with aura. I would be inclined to agree with this except that when the vision is blurry, squinting clears it up as does a lense. Yet when my vision is clear, it is crystal clear. I can push through the fatigue and the fuzziness but the blurry vision is killing me and impacting my work. Does anyone have any insight to this or does anyone have a similar story with a treatment? Any help would be greatly appreciated."

I have been with a stuffy nose and my stool has been coming out looking more watered down but it’s not diarrhea. I was on amoxicillin for a month that didn’t help at all I don’t know what it could be. I believe it might be that i have an absces becuase I do get small ear pains but I’m not 100% I thought is may be stones but the white spots aren’t that hard, I just really don’t know anymore what it could be I took a blood test and everything was normal took hiv test and it was negative.

He was weak, couldn't see well, having balance issues ect... at that point he was diagnosed with MS in Febuary. He is now in a wheelchair in 9 months from being completely independent. Has anyone else had a positive west nile diagnosis and now has MS from the west nile? We are desperate for help with a doctor that may have dealt with this before. We are watching him die.

Clinical research is time consuming and underfunded. Crowdsourcing a huge databank that researchers can tap into could potentially point out trends that we didn’t know existed, and cut the amount of time and money that it takes to run clinical study. Ultimately, this will hopefully drive us towards a cure faster. iConquerMS is empowering people to take an active role in research, and helping them shape their own futures. Members of these patient power research networks (PPRNs) are doing what we really should have been doing since the beginning- interacting with researchers as equals, not just as patients or subjects in a trial. By actively participating in research we are helping to ensure that the focus is on issues that are impactful and meaningful to our communities.  PPRN’s are a relatively new and novel way of conducting research, but we are already seeing results. Nearly $20 million has been invested in four exciting new studies so far. These studies address highly relevant issues, and have the potential to have a real impact on the MS community. These include studies that will compare the effectiveness of different disease modifying drugs, and medications used to treat fatigue (which is one of the most common and most debilitating symptoms that many people with MS face). Other studies will assess whether we can use telehealth and technology to bridge the gaps in care, so that all people living with MS, not just those who live within driving distance to an MS center, have access to rehabilitation and specialists.

It's a common issue, and there are several strategies to improve both speech and swallowing difficulties. Speech MS can cause a couple different vocal issues. Dysarthria is slow, slurred, or quiet speech that is a result of poor or limited articulation. Dysphonia causes your voice change making it sound harsh, hoarse, overly nasal, or breathy. Most people take the ability to talk for granted, which can make it seem like a fairly straightforward task. However, speaking requires 100 different chest, neck, jaw, and facial muscles to work in synch. If the nerves to any of these muscle groups, or the movement of the vocal cords are affected by MS you may not be able to speak as eloquently as you once could. In most cases an evaluation by a Speech Language Pathologist (SLP) is recommended, and can be extremely helpful. They can take a careful look at how all those muscles are moving and your breath control. Then, just like a physical therapist, they can suggest exercises to strengthen the muscles that control speech.  Swallowing The same muscles that you use when you speak are also responsible for swallowing. Difficulty with initiating a swallow, choking, coughing while eating or drinking, or frequently clearing your throat during meals can be warning signs of a swallowing disorder (dysphagia). This is a potentially life-threatening issue because it can lead to choking, or even aspiration pneumonia. If you think you are experiencing dysphagia you should bring it to the attention of your neurologist immediately, and once again they will probably recommend an evaluation by a Speech Language Pathologist (SLP). Your therapist can do a couple of diagnostic tests to pinpoint your issue, and come up with a personalized treatment plan. There are several strategies for managing dysphagia such as slightly tucking your chin, alternating a bites of food with sips of liquid, and swallowing each bite twice can greatly reduce the risk of choking. Therapists can also recommend the right amount and consistency for food and liquids for you. It is also important to always eat and drink while sitting straight up, keep your tongue and teeth as clean as possible to reduce the bacteria in your mouth, and to take a break if you feel fatigued at mealtime."

Withdrawal symptoms will also significantly improve. 9 months– Your lungs begin to repair themselves resulting in less coughing and shortness of breath, as well as a decreased risk for infections. 1 year– You are officially considered a non-smoker!

You also have a reduced risk for mouth, throat, esophagus, bladder, kidney, and pancreatic cancer. 15 years– You officially have the same risk for heart disease and stroke as a non-smoker, that is a huge accomplishment! Good luck! If you are considering quitting, or have successfully quit in the past share your story with the rest of the community :)"

I got 4 impacted wisdom teeth extracted last tuesday, and found out on Friday that I had dry sockets in both of my lower teeth. The pain has been pretty bad, and one dentist said the dry sockets were very deep and the other said they were ""raging"". On friday the dentist dressed them, and the pain was lessened overnight but the next morning it was back and pretty bad. On Saturday I went back and they put what she called putty on the dry sockets instead. The pain has been on and off since then, and I have an appointment Wednesday to get them removed. I was wondering if when they are removed they will put something else on them, and if not, will the pain still be pretty bad afterwards if no skin has formed over yet?"

Exercise can help improve symptoms including fatigue and bowel/bladder dysfunction, as well as improve mood. Many of us are prone to muscle weakness and spasticity, and exercises such as yoga, tai chi, swimming, and pilates are great ways to keep our bodies performing at their best. It is also crucial to live a healthy lifestyle to avoid developing other health issues such as diabetes and heart disease- after all, MS is enough on its own!

Hydration is key, and drinking ice water during exercise will help keep your core cooler. There are also many great cooling products including vests and towels that many MSers like to use.

I am 100 lbs overweight but currently trying to lose it. I've had this lymphnode issue going on since I was eleven years old, but at the time I had only one, now currently I'm 22 with three more grown. The tongue node being the more recent and it inhibits my speech while being uncomfortably big.  Should I be worried of the issue? I have seen two doctors before.

In April I got up one morning and instead of getting up like normal my body veered to the right, I then went on to experience vertigo like symptoms for some time. It got better for a few weeks and then came back. I couldn't walk strait to save my life. LOL especially first thing in the morning. My PCP sent me to ENT, then a cardiologist, and now to the Neurologist. I had my apt on Monday. *side note, I have had other symptoms as well such as weakness in arms and legs and numbness in hands and left leg. I have had tingling and a tremor (which I have had once in the past only on the other hand) my legs feel like Jello and the muscles feel so tired.* OK my question is. Is it typical for a neurologist after completing the exam to not say one way or another how I did? what was normal, what was not?? Because this doctor didn't say a word. This is bugging me now. I mean because I know some of the things weren't normal. But he didn't elaborate or explain. Like for example my reflexes. I am not sure how all the others were, but when it came to my left leg it was VERY hyper reflexive....It scared me HA! he bopped my knee and my knee shot up like a high kick! That ""can't"" be normal ... right? Also I could not walk on my heels at all. Those were the only two things that I know of. I don't understand the results of anything else.  He did order an MRI and a EMG so maybe that should tell me something. But he did say that the balance problems and dizziness was just vertigo, which confused me. *sigh* UGH! I am so frustrated!!! A: I know from firsthand experience that searching for a diagnosis is extremely frustrating, so I'm sorry you have to go through this! In all likelihood he didn't explain what was abnormal because in neurology it is very difficult to say before seeing test results. We use the neuro exam as an initial screening, and if something seems abnormal it helps us decide what tests to order so that we can get to the bottom of things. I'm hoping you will get some answers after you have your MRI and EMG done, hang in there! In the meantime, you might find this article on the neuro exam helpful:"

I know that alcohol is not too good for my health either, so I was wondering, can I drink alcohol if I have MS? A: In general having MS doesn't necessarily mean you can't drink alcohol. However, it is very important to talk to your doctor if you are unsure! Alcohol can interact with a number of medications that we take for symptom management, like muscle relaxers, steroids, and pain medication. It can also make some of your symptoms worse because it acts on the central nervous system, so if you have difficulties with speech or balance you may notice that they are worse after drinking. The key is moderation, and because MS affects all of us differently you should focus on doing what's best for you!"

My dentist said that the filling cracked, so he replaced it. This was a few weeks ago. Despite having it adjusted 3 times, it has still been bothering me. It's not pain really, but discomfort, like a popcorn kernel is lodged there or something, and also sometimes sensitive to cold. Flossing does not bother me, and chewing and brushing my teeth actually make it feel better for a while. Ibuprofen does very little to help. They did an xray and said it looks fine, not abscessed, which makes sense I think, since it really doesn't hurt, but I'm still not adjusting to it after a few weeks, and the unrelenting discomfort is a struggle at times. The dentist says that I grind my teeth and thinks this may be the problem, so I had a bite plate started last week that I'm waiting on. This makes sense, as I have some other spots in my mouth, mainly bottom just left of center, that bother me on and off, which my dentist also thinks is grinding related. I've been using a store bought night guard for over a week while I wait, but haven't noticed any improvement anywhere, and the discomfort in the filling doesn't really feel grinding related to me. My only thought is that 9 years ago I had a filling done that bothered me. The dentist switched it from white to silver, saying I might deal with that better, and as I recall, I did. However when I mentioned that this time, he said that white composite has improved and that shouldn't be an issue.  Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated. I'm considering seeing another dentist for a second opinion but it's hard to know where to begin, and I feel sometimes like my mouth will never feel normal again. Thanks,  Matt"

Eventually the tooth died and broke apart a piece at a time, that I would usually spit out while eating. I never thought much of it as there was no pain associated with it. The roots did remain in my gum and my dentist urged me on multiple occasions to have it extracted, which I ignored. The other day I noticed what felt like a kernel of corn in the void where my molar used to be. I happened to notice it the night I had some corn with dinner and figured that's what it was. I couldn't push it out withmy tongue like i normally would with food particles in the past so today I took a tooth pick to it and discovered it was not a kernel of corn but instead a small white soft growth or sac. It appeared to have some kind of clear pus type of liquid in it similar to a blister. My gum bled pretty good for about 5 minutes at most and has since stopped with again no pain. I'm a little nervous as to what it was and was hoping for some insight. Thanks!!"

I had constant headaches, felt faint and dizzy, vomited, had trouble walking straight, etc. It seemed that the symptoms subsided a bit once I came back down the mountain. The first night back home I attributed my fatigue and faint feeling from just over exhaustion and maybe lack of calories while hiking.  But then these past two days the headaches and dizziness have continued. I will feel fine then suddenly become overtaken with a bad headache, dizziness, and an inability to focus on anything.

I recently ordered some opals from India and didn't notice until a few days after I'd purchased them that in the pictures they used to display these particular gems the man holding them had a strange mark on his finger. The mark was a small white looking bump, almost like a pimple though it did not appear red in any way and was definitely raised and not flat. Upon requesting to cancel my order they informed me they had already shipped it so I am planning to return it once it arrives however I would like to know if I run a risk of catching anything from handling the parcel and if I have placed my family along with any mailmen that came in contact with it at risk. I am aware that it usually is spread by prolonged contact with someone who had leprosy and that even then it's rare to catch it, my question is if he does have leprosy and he coughed on the paper used for the package is it possible to contract it by touching the package?  Also I am unsure what category to place this question in so please forgive me if I am in the wrong place. I also realize this could be a simple skin issue and completely unrelated to leprosy."

Is it continuous or does it come and go? Do certain symptoms not happen with others because they're in different parts of the brain? I've been having heavy health anxiety lately and haven't been able to get an MRI or see a neurologist. It started one day in class when I had pulsatile tinnitus for a brief period in one ear. I went to an urgent care clinic and they removed a lot of cerumen from my ears; I haven't had pusatile tinnitus since but I sometimes get a regular ringing for very brief periods. Since then, I've been having slight headaches from time to time on my left side and sometimes my right, but never both; my face gets warm and it hurts a bit behind my eye, but the pain is far from debilitating, just very worrying. The headaches are fairly rare and go away after some time and advil. I've since also been feeling pulsing/kicking feelings here and there in my body, usually in my feet and legs and my pink/ring fingers tend to fall asleep in the night even if I'm not lying on them. Often times, I wake up early in the morning with a strong feeling of anxiety and a chill that takes time to leave me, but not one like from a fever- just a cold feeling; this morning, I woke up and it felt like my brain in one side of my head was shaking, but it went away after about an hour and a half. I've also noticed that sometimes the sight in one of my eyes is less sharp than the other, though not enough to tell unless I check them separately and sometimes one eye seems a bit more dilated than the other but they always respond to light and when parts of my body fall asleep, they always come back with use. I sometimes feel dizzy too for brief periods. I have a lot of other weird, transient symptoms which seem either neurological or anxiety-caused (or both) but they all go away as they should.

But i don't have breathlessness or anything now. These symptoms disappear then come. Neither do i faint now, but i hear voices like ticking or clicking inside head when i run or shake it. I sometimes have muscular pain in leg calf muscle, groin etc. But they go away. I am confused but normal. No memory loss, nothing else.

The back seems fine, just partially gone on the front side I guess lol it is so hard to tell. I am pretty sure I have never noticed anything wrong with it before. The more I think about it I vauguely remember a dream where a tooth broke off or something like that. Now I wonder if it really happened while I was half asleep during the night. But I haven't had any pain with it. The problem is, I have never found a piece of it. I was thinking maybe I just swallowed it. Now I keep reading where some aspirate the tooth (went in lungs), so now I am worried about that more than anything. But wouldn't I know by now since it has been at least a week?"

Otherwise, I usually feel absolutely fine but I've been reading about what this could mean and I'm really concerned.

I am having an illness that no one seems to understand and therefore still not diagnosed. It started 10-12 years back when I felt a slight unbalance in standing while I was waiting for a bus. Initially I ignored it but since then it increased manifold and turns out to be affecting the whole right side of my body starting from the neck to foot. The right side of my body is weaker as compared to left side and appears to be not developing as it should be. Due to this I feel pain in my right leg when put body weight on it similarly the right hand also pains when I push something hard or press something hard from it. My back also pains while sitting, driving or just standing. Because of this illness and pain I am having difficulties in standing, walking, sitting and lying. Often I feel numbness in right leg and arm specially after getting up from bed in morning. Occasionally I feel headaches and sometimes when I bend down on knees it feels that all the matter in head has flown towards fore head making the head heavy. My life is getting worse due to this illness and I cannot live a normal life. I have consulted many doctors but to no avail. Most of them are unable to understand my condition and said that I am normal and perfectly alright. I am an IT professional and my job is to develop software therefore I have to sit in my office for 8-10 hours for 5 days, however, I take short breaks after every hour or two. Kindly help me identify and cure this disease. I have attached some medical tests conducted this year. Please let me know if some other medical tests are also required.   Regards"

About two months ago I started waking up with my whole body feeling like it was shaking only to not be moving at all. I figured I was pretty stressed out with school so I dropped a class that was giving me a lot of stress and although I don't wake up feeling like I'm shaking violently I always still feel the shaking when I'm falling asleep and when I wake up. Related to this I believe are these muscle spasms I have which have started this month, seemingly random muscles that I didn't even know existed will start twitching completely out of my control for 10-20 seconds and then stop. These are new symptoms. I get dull aches in my arm once in a while as well. I also get this very weird sensation in the bottom of my heel that kind of feels like someone is sticking a pin into it, it usually comes while I am laying down. I have also had this new headache and it began about a month after the aforementioned symptoms and about one month ago. Well there are two headaches, the one on the rear left side of my head has been subdued recently but when it was at its ""prime"" it was a sort of sharp pain that would come for about twenty seconds and then go away for a while at random times. Sometimes in would make the whole left side of my head feel weird. With that same headache, when I lay down on the spot or put light pressure on the headache spot it will hurt but not as bad as the headache. The second headache I have only gotten twice and only recently. It is also in the back of my head and a little to the right of the first one. Both times it happened it was after I quickly moved my head to a different position. This was a very intensely sharp headache and one that I would describe as one of the worst I've ever had. Like I said I've only gotten it twice and it goes away after twenty seconds as well. I'm sorry this was so long but if anyone has any idea if these symptoms are related and what they might be please let me know. Thanks."

I've had the whole range of tests done, but so far nothing conclusive has come up. Recently I began to experience symptoms similar to those of MS- vision problems, muscle weakness, trouble focusing and remembering words, tremors in my hands, frequent urination- and starting about two weeks ago I've been getting vertigo. It happens mainly when I'm walking, but also while sitting or standing still, and feels sort of like my eyes have suddenly unfocused without my permission. At first it was quick and infrequent, but its been happening more and more and become painful and more intense. I'll feel pain behind and above my right eye and moving to the left, traveling over the brow bone, and I'll feel nauseous and lose all train of thought. The swirling sensation lasts for a few minutes, and will repeat in waves if I try to move after the initial pain has stopped. Today it happened so abruptly that my knees gave way and I had to catch myself on a door frame to lower myself to the floor. It does seem to help if I focus on a single unmoving object?  My question is, how long do I wait before this becomes something that needs to be seen right away? I have an appointment with neurology coming up in a few weeks, but with the sensation getting worse and, frankly, scarier, I'm wondering if I should go into urgent care sooner than that. If I wait for my appointment, am I risking this developing into something less treatable? Is it an indication that something is going on that can't wait? Or should I wait until I faint to head to urgent/emergency? Thank you!"

It subsided within a minute of so and then just turned into a dull headache. It was nothing debilitating I was able to keep working out with less weight of course and It sounds like something called an exercise headache. It is not like 20 hours since that happened, I still have a very minor just dull headache and what seems to be a fever but I also have bad alegeries so those may just be from that. I work out alot so its not like my bodies not used to that amount of work, but when I do I tend to hold my breath and pressurize my head which ive heard is a bad way of working out. Im just wondering if this is something I should go to the doctor for or just a headache from exercise. The dull headache does seem to be going away. So I feel like if it was something really bad(hemorrhage) I would definitely still have a bad headache right?"

I had my first ever allergic reaction in December in the middle of the night. I experienced numbness and swelling in my mouth and tongue and went into the ER. Responded quickly to Benadryl and prednisone. I don't know what caused it as it had been 5 hours since eating or drinking anything. I did have a beer and a pseudoephedrine for a cold before bed. Anyways, now months later, I still often have numbness, tingling, and occasionally soreness in the lower part of my face (down cheeks and towards mouth). It hardly ever gets above a 2/10 on a pain scale but it is bothersome. I've considered that it may be psychological (as in I started paying too much attention to normal body variations, because I was worried about having another reaction). And, I've also considered I might be exposing myself in a small way to whatever caused the initial swelling. I do think it's a bit worse for a day or two after drinking a beer, so I've stopped that altogether in case the allergen lies within. Would it make sense for facial swelling (angioedema) to have caused some damage that is just taking a while to heal? Should I just let it go and try not to think about it?"

It mainly hurts on my top jaw and right where my top and bottom jaw meet. I cant feel a tooth poking through yet. However compared to the other side it definitely feels more tapered. I never have had wisdom teeth come in so its hard for me to tell. I dont have insurance so its hard for me to get to the doctor. The jaw pain is just freaking me out a little and i need thoughts!!

I found a mirror and those two little dots is what I found. I have eaten crawfish before and never had any type of allergic reaction.

It felt swollen, and I couldn't close my mouth. We went to the local dentist, who just filed down my upper molar, and said the pain was caused by me biting my cheek. I don't remember biting my cheek, however he said I may have done so in my sleep. For the next three or four days, it got better, to the point where I could close my mouth again. However, I still had pain when applying pressure to my bottom right molars (felt like biting on my gums). Yesterday, the pain suddenly got much worse and I couldn't sleep, it was throbbing again. In the mirror, I see a small lesion where my upper right molar caught my cheek. I also see the gums are red (inflamed?). I've attached photos that I took myself today. I am 19 years old. I have considered that this may be a wisdom tooth (it would be my second, had my first one on the left lower molar side over a year ago). I am not sure if there is an infection, I feel fine not considering the actual pain. I keep it as clean as I can, rinse with warm salt water and try only chew with my left side (which is difficult without causing pain anyway). I also know that I have a fissured, geographical tongue, I've had that since birth. I am not sure what the redness on my throat is, I don't feel any feverish symptoms. I had an ulcer there over also about a week ago, but I believe that was from drinking tea which was too hot. I will be really grateful for any information on what's going on. I will be going to a different dentist tomorrow, and I prefer to be more aware of what's going on. Thank you! Rob"

After being told this I did some research on root canals. Based on this information, I think it would be reasonable for me to opt for an extraction instead of a root canal. Using only American Endodontics Association, American Dental Association studies, and other pubmed studies, I learned the following: -Root canal teeth, even when done correctly, have higher endotoxin levels than teeth with vital pulps. The mean value of endotoxin is over 28 times greater in root canal teeth, according to a study published in the Journal of Endodontics. -Root canal teeth are much more likely (about 40% more likely) to be effected by apical periodontitis, according to studies done by the American Endodontics Association and American Dental Association. -Apical periodontitis is strongly associated with brain aneurisms and heart disease, according to pubmed. -Endotoxins are associated with depression symptoms, according to pubmed. Specifically, the study linked root canal endotoxins to depression:    -Root canal procedures are associated with heart disease. People who have a history of root canal procedures are 1.62 times more likely to suffer from heart disease, according to this study:  There are other studies linking root canal procedures with heart disease as well. Also consider that some of those people may have had their root canal teeth removed early on, and this would make those numbers even higher if they had considered this in their data. I also have reason to believe that I have a low level infection that has been going on for a while, or possibly endotoxins interfering with my health. I think this because I've had horrible brain fog and low energy levels for 2 years, but when my dentist put me on a week of penicillin for my wisdom tooth removal, I felt much, much better. Like a fog had lifted for the first time in a while. I also had tachycardia and arrhythmia that went on for 6 months, then mysteriously went away. I've been unemployed for a long time because of my health. I used to be a productive, busy student with 2 jobs and an active social life before this. I think it is more likely my health will improve in the long run if I have my tooth extracted instead of getting a root canal. I want to know if I'm being reasonable. Most of the dentists I have seen dismiss all that I have to say and all my reasons, and act like they're stupid reasons, they seem to think it's ok to ignore the research. I think root canals are something only healthy people should do, because they can take a toll on your body. Also, another dentist started a root canal on that tooth against my wishes, so the tooth is open. I had to take penicillin because my oral surgeon noticed a low level infection had started after the other dentist did that. I wanted to ask this question because I am going to lose my first (non-wisdom) tooth. I know this could possibly effect the alignment of my jaw unless I decide to get an implant, so it's a big decision."

I've always been a ""small person"" and looking back at old class photos and comparing myself to peers (both boys and girls) I was always shorter, and smaller in every aspect (including head size), but it was never an issue because I was always of normal intelligence, and although my head was small so was my body so everything looked proportionate, and in many photos my head even looked too big for my body. However around the start of puberty I finally really began growing, until I soon started getting taller than my peers, and at my current height of about 5'9-5'10 I am about the same height or taller than most of my peers. However one thing stands out and that is my head size. My head went from being slightly too big for my body as a kid, to perfectly fitting my body to now too small for my body. It is currently 21 inches in circumference, which is in fact very small. The back of my head is flat, and my forehead slopes, all characteristics of a microcephalic (although I do have a very similar head shape to my father whom also has the slightly sloping forehead and flat back of the head, his head is way larger and looks perfectly normal). Everyone in my family has a large head. My sister, my brother (23 inches), my mom, my dad, my uncles, my grandfather, aunts, cousins, so I am very confused as to why my head is like this. Around 5th grade my vision started to ""deteriorate"" and I needed glasses and I feel like this is somehow related to my head size. I also have constant 24/7 ringing in my ears. My brother who has large hands and long fingers can grip a good portion of my head and this makes me feel even worst. My hands and body are now way to big compared to my head and I look so disproportional. 2-3 years ago I never got comments on head size and no one ever noticed anything, but ever since high school and puberty the small head is becoming more apparent. I feel like somewhere along the line my head stopped growing like it was supposed to and I have no idea what could have caused this. I also notice my face is very small and shorter in size than all my peers. everyone's heads seem bigger than mine and I wish I could get a diagnosis or something because I am pretty sure that by 16 the head is done growing, and most likely my head circumference will not grow that extra inch or inch and a half that would make is average sized.

What I'm worried about is that I used to drink very heavy 15 years ago but then took a long break and did it sensibly. I stopped 3 years ago to look after my mum. Was fine for 2 years but this last year I've been getting shooting pains up and down the left side of my head. Since diagnosis I've now got tachycardia and nystagmus. Is there a chance wernicke syndrome could be the cause? My neurologist says no but I seem to have all the symptoms. Am very scared. Many thanks.

I had an MRI but have not had one since this issue discussed has started. 4 weeks ago, I thought I had a migraine. I took the prescribed Cambia and it went away. Next day, it was back and worse. Took the cambia again but it didn't help, took Advil,daily nortriptiline, muscle relaxers, more cambia. Called my neurologist after 3 days and they suggested going to the ER to get an infusion. It helped, until I stood up to leave. The headache was immediately back. This continued to go on, kept taking everything listed above. Two weeks into this unbearable headache, I saw my neurologist again, he for some reason checked my eyes and saw that my optic nerve in one eye looked larger and told me to call an opthamologist. I of course did and went to the appointment where he told me could not rule out that it was normal, but it also wasn't abnormal. So I called the neurologist with that, he asked me to come in to the office, thinking I had a pseuodotumor cerebri and wanted to do a spinal tap to check the pressure and take a sample. The opening pressure was 12. They then sent me for another infusion to help with the still unbearable headache. This was on a friday.This is now week three of this crippling headache. Fast forward to Monday, still unable to stand from unbearable presssure in my head, so bad I can't breathe, pulse racing. Call the doctor, they think it's an anuerism, rush to the ER. They run NO tests and speak with my neurologist who says it's from the spinal tap and says to give me an infusion and rest for 48 hours. Rest 48 hours, it's Wednesday and I've now missed 4 days of work and we're heading into week 4 of this headache. I drive to work, last two hours basically laying on the floor because I still can't stand, my legs and face are numb. I attempt to drive home but make it ten minutes before pulling over and calling for help because the pressure in my head is so bad I can't see and I'm nauseous.

Don't recall ever being this sick. Everything started with left hip/pelvic pain that i just woke up with about a month and a half ago. I've had pain in the same region before after sleeping on an air mattress but it would disappear within 2 weeks. i exercise on the regular, so in this case i've stopped all lower body workouts immediately. this time it hasn't dissipated and i went to a local orthopedist, who took an xray, said theres no bone damage, and prescribed diclofenac. the same day, in fact right as i was leaving his office, i started feeling nauseous, so i stopped taking diclofenac. it was barely noticeable in the beginning, but would get worse everyday, appetite disappearing. first time i went to my family doctor i was told it probably is food poisoning because there was no fever. standard blood test came back normal. in addition, i had pretty much constant intestinal movement, gases, and diarrhea for 1 day, no abdominal pain. the following day fever started, i had no appetite at all, and i was getting heavy night sweats and one night i was restless and fainted. i had emt over and their conclusion was stomach flu and malnourishment/dehydration. i went back to my doctor the following morning, and he pretty much said the same and prescribed substances with electrolytes. eventually i got a lot better and returned to work. left hip was still hurting on and off, but i never got to follow up since i was completely sick. i lasted two day at the office until same symptoms returned, now with dizziness. on my way home from work, i started feeling numbness in my hands, dizziness, near fainting sensation. went back to the doctor the same day, he took blood for a more in depth blood test (including blood cell content/count i believe) and it came back fine as well. i stayed home for another week and a half, through which i went through regular flu (what i was told) and a sinus infection (bright yellow mucus, jaw, ear, and head aches), but still experienced abdominal discomfort, slight nausea, and loss of appetite. also experienced discomfort in colon/anus/prostate, had to pinpoint. i was on antibiotics for the infection and acetaminophen, but reasonable daily doses. while i was on sick leave, i went to a few follow up appointments, including a cardiologist, internal organ sonogram, and lower back MRI. i had cardiogram and heart sonogram done, as well as wore a monitor for 24 hours, and everything showed up normal. organ sonogram (liver, kidneys, pancreas, etc.) was normal. lower back MRI showed 2 herniated disks, which can explain lower back and hip pain (i have another followup appointment for this tomorrow). also had an endoscopy procedure which revealed two minor ulcers and samples were taken. whole last week was pretty much fine, aside from some abdominal discomfort, barely noticeable or no nausea, good appetite, no dizziness, but still constant intestinal movement and gases, no abdominal pain. today at work i started feeling dizzy with chills again, this time conscious but feeling some loss of balance (some sort of vertigo without heights). experiencing some abdominal and colon discomfort also barely noticeable jaw/ear pain. i also seem to have occasional stiff neck that forces me to rotate my head and a tender point right side of neck/trap muscle that gets sore and tingly. also seldom triceps and quad ache and buttocks gets sore from extended sitting on hard surfaces (another tender point?).  i have so many symptoms that its hard to pinpoint whats going on, as well as hard to tell if theyre related or not. they seem to come and go in cycles. i want additionally check my intestine, colon, maybe prostate, neck, whats the best method? want to schedule an appointment with a neurologist. what else should be done? please advise on stenosis, infections (h pylori, staph, etc. - im an engineer in wastewater treatment), fibromyalgia, tumors... want to mention that ive had lower back problems my whole life, both parents have similar issues, so its genetic. sometimes experience numbness in limbs during sleep (another reason to visit a neurologist). also lost about 10-12 lbs since stopped exercising and eating properly, but i was bulking so this weight loss is normal."

Back in August I had a Grand Mal seizure at the tender age of 57. I've never had a seizure of any kind before this. I was sitting in bed with my wife and we had just finished a snack of blueberries and yogurt. My wife was headed to the kitchen and asked if I was done and was going to take my dish with her. I handed it to her and the next thing I remember being in a sleep like state with my wife trying to calm me down telling me it's alright and to let the EMT's do what they need to do. I remember feeling like I was having a nightmare and being frightened like I've never been frightened before. From the time I handed the dish to my wife and the time I came out of the seizure. So, jump back 1 1/2 years. My doctor switched me from Enbrel to Humira for psoriatic arthritis/psoriasis. Over the course of that year and a half I was slowly becoming more lethargic, lacking energy and feeling more and more depressed to the point that I didn't want to do anything or go anywhere. In addition to the Humira I had also been on Tramadol 50mg every 4-6 hours as needed for pain and 2 weeks prior to the seizure I went to see my GP about how I'd been feeling. He had me taken a test for depression on a tablet and even though I tested on the low end for depression he decided to prescribe Prozac 20mg once daily. If that didn't help he was going to see me again. Immediately after the seizure I stopped the Humira and Prozac because of some things I'd read online. A week after the seizure I had my first appointment with a neurologist and she agreed with us on stopping the Humira and Prozac and diagnosed it as a ""provoked"" seizure and ordered an E.E.G. Once I had the E.E.G. she said she saw ""sharp"" waves and put me on Levetiracetam 750mg twice daily which leaves me feeling a little cloudy (btw, the E.R. doc put me on Phenytoin Sodium 100mg once daily which left me feeling like crap) and I hate it. I am self employed and since this all started I've been double & triple checking my work. Anyway, between the time I had the E.E.G. and the follow up with the neuro doc my rheumatologist said the Tramadol could have also contributed to the seizure so I stopped taking that and now manage my pain with OTC medication, mostly Tylenol. At the E.E.G. follow up I asked the doctor if I should have another E.E.G. now that I was off the Tramadol and her response was ""there's no point"" and refused to order another one. Does this sound right?

Back in August I had a Grand Mal seizure at the tender age of 57. I've never had a seizure of any kind before this. I was sitting in bed with my wife and we had just finished a snack of blueberries and yogurt. My wife was headed to the kitchen and asked if I was done and was going to take my dish with her. I handed it to her and the next thing I remember being in a sleep like state with my wife trying to calm me down telling me it's alright and to let the EMT's do what they need to do. I remember feeling like I was having a nightmare and being frightened like I've never been frightened before. From the time I handed the dish to my wife and the time I came out of the seizure. So, jump back 1 1/2 years. My doctor switched me from Enbrel to Humira for psoriatic arthritis/psoriasis. Over the course of that year and a half I was slowly becoming more lethargic, lacking energy and feeling more and more depressed to the point that I didn't want to do anything or go anywhere. In addition to the Humira I had also been on Tramadol 50mg every 4-6 hours as needed for pain and 2 weeks prior to the seizure I went to see my GP about how I'd been feeling. He had me taken a test for depression on a tablet and even though I tested on the low end for depression he decided to prescribe Prozac 20mg once daily. If that didn't help he was going to see me again. Immediately after the seizure I stopped the Humira and Prozac because of some things I'd read online. A week after the seizure I had my first appointment with a neurologist and she agreed with us on stopping the Humira and Prozac and diagnosed it as a ""provoked"" seizure and ordered an E.E.G. Once I had the E.E.G. she said she saw ""sharp"" waves and put me on Levetiracetam 750mg twice daily which leaves me feeling a little cloudy (btw, the E.R. doc put me on Phenytoin Sodium 100mg once daily which left me feeling like crap) and I hate it. I am self employed and since this all started I've been double & triple checking my work. Anyway, between the time I had the E.E.G. and the follow up with the neuro doc my rheumatologist said the Tramadol could have also contributed to the seizure so I stopped taking that and now manage my pain with OTC medication, mostly Tylenol. At the E.E.G. follow up I asked the doctor if I should have another E.E.G. now that I was off the Tramadol and her response was ""there's no point"" and refused to order another one. Does this sound right?

So, I attempted to execute a tackle while running at high speed, and I did not do it correctly. The left side of my skull, just above my temple, hit the player's lower thigh/upper knee, and I heard a large popping sound. After I tackled the player, my neck began to hurt severely, and I could not turn my head even the slightest amount to the right or left without excruciating pain to the upper left and right side of my neck. My head, which took the blow did not hurt and has not since the incident, and my neck has gotten slightly better with some stretching and rest, but I feel cloudy, and I am wondering if I got a concussion. Should I go see a doctor? Thank you, anonymous"

I nervous to floss around that particular tooth right now (I usually floss everyday). I brush twice a day and usually use mouth wash once a day.  I'm worried because I haven't seen a dentist in at least five years or so. Lastly I should mention that my jaw pops when I yawn (I'm forcing myself not to do that) and I've noticed it feels sore particularly in the back of my mouth. I can feel it in my face and neck as well sometimes. Don't know if this is associated with my teeth but any help would be appreciated before I see the dentist. Thanks"

I have this small lump on the right side of my hard palate, towards the back. It has a slight reddish color when I look at it using pictures. I first noticed it around November. It doesn't really hurt, but when I become super focused on it I tend to touch it with my tongue a lot and it can get kind of sore. Some weeks I forget it's there and it doesn't bother me, but when I remember it, it's constantly present in my mind. I went to the dentist for my regualr 6 month appointment in December and my dentist was out sick so his assistant looked at it for me and she said it was just a bony growth and that they would look at it again in 6 months. My biggest fear is that it's cancer (yes, I know I'm not an at-risk individual, but crazy stuff happens) and waiting 6 months would let it get to a point where it's too late to treat it (I know I sound crazy. I can't help it).  I'm going home for spring break in two weeks and I plan on going to the dentist again, but in the meantime, I'd like some advice from strangers on the internet. If it's not cancer, what could it be? What should I do?"

A few months ago, I got a pretty bad cold and on one particular evening, I got an intense urge to sneeze and never was able to do so. It was unfathomably frustrating, and almost made me want to cry. To have that sensation in my nose for hours with no relief... it was miserable And it lasted through the next day, and the next, and the next. Here I am months later and I've maybe sneezed 4 times. I get the sensation and urge to do so multiple times a day, usually met with no relief. For some reason, this particular disappointment leaves me feeling SO angry. Having to sneeze and not being able to is one of the sensations that leaves me feeling 'cry and punch a wall' angry and frustrated. As absurd as it sounds, it's starting to take a toll on my quality of life. The frustration is becoming a constant rather than only surfacing when I lose a sneeze.  What can I do? Why is this happening?"

The seizures were 3-4 hours apart from each other and she did regain consciousness in between them. She immediately fell asleep after having her first seizure at 6am. We gave her sedatives prescribed from the doctors, but we do not know whether this helped or not. Now she is taking carbamazepine, also given to us from the doctor, does this drug contain any long lasting side effects? Should we refrain from using this drug until a full diagnosis has been done? The doctors have yet to do a full tomographic scan. I believe this happened after she ate a enokitake which is a mushroom, it also had a little bit of spice. Can a child have a seizure from consuming a certain food? Please help us, we live in Mongolia and it would mean the world to us if the international community could provide any insight.

I woke up this morning (04/06/2017) with a bump/sore underneath my tongue on that part that sort of connects the bottom of my tongue to the floor of my mouth. I am not sure if it is large or small but judging by pictures ive seen of mouth sores it seems relatively average by comparison. What worries me is that I've read mouth cancer sores are painless while canker sores are rather painful. When touching it with my tongue it does not really hurt. It definetely feels sore but not painful per se. Any feed back on this would be helpful. I am 21. I have never drank alcohol or smoked a cigarette. From my knowledge my family does not have a history of cancer in general. I imagine it is most likely a canker sore but I would like some feedback please. Edit: Just tried drinking OJ as i've read acidic things can cause pain in a canker sore but not in mouth cancer and I did not get any pain whatsoever. Really stressed out :(

She can read if the type is big enough but can't scan a page quickly. We are trying to find a treatment. We are trying to find a treatment that will use Neuroplasticity to find new pathways.

I've draw a picture, its not the best but I think it'll show it a bit better    I'm not sure how to get rid of it, it is painful when I eat or move my tongue around a lot. I've tried to pinch it like a pimple but it is extermly painful when doing so and it doesn't help. Any treatment options would be appericated."

For the last 9 - 10 years I have been on Lithium, Methadone (just changed to morphine sulfate 2 months ago), citalopram, clonazepam, amitriptyline. About six months ago my doctor had me take a blood test and found I was severely lacking Vit D, so I now take Vitamin D3 @ 1000 unit SFGL once a day. I currently have a partial, but am thinking I might be best to have all the teeth pulled and get dentures if it is my medication that is causing this horrible problem."

Her first MS attack happened when she was 14. It was in her right eye. The second one happened when she was 20 and it was in her left eye. After the second attack she was prescribed to inject a drug called CinnoVex which Iranian version similar to Avonex.  She used CinnoVex until recently. But the injections are painful and with some minor side effects. Then a few month ago she had an MRI and based on that there was no sign of MS plaques in her brain. But her doctor says that it is better for her to continue her medication as a preventive measure. The doctor has changed her drug to another one which is called Cinnumer.  The question that I have is: should she take this medication even though she is ok at the moment? Some other doctor’s here say that it is not necessary, but her own doctor which is very famous in MS field believe that she needs to be under medication for the rest of her life. We are kind of confused and would appreciate some expert opinion to help us make the best decision in this situation. Thank you all and sorry for my bad English."

The cold came from my lower back and my left side of face was causing the problem for trying to talk. Anyways I went to doctor and just said I was dissy and he said I had vertigo and gave me serc and it went away.

My left arm went a little numb again. I got sec again from another doctor. My focus problems improved but I could telll something is off and not rite. FYI I continued to take sec until June 2017!! Had bloodworm done, ct scan, stool sample and everything came back good but I still felt lightheadness, and was off and hard time to focus. Doctors just though crystals in my ears were off Went to ent in August 2016. He finally explained that I didn't have vertigo as I'm lightheadness and I didn't have vertigo which is the room is spinning around me and all ear tests came back good. He couldn't understand why sec would work as to him it should be useless. He proceeded to clean my ears and removed a large chunk of wax from left ear. two days later my left side of my face and my neck went numb. Felt very weak. I went to doctor who then thought I had nerve damage from the cold and requested I see neurologist.. I couldn't and still can't put anything in my ears such as listening to music as it makes me sick the next day Tried to give up my sec pills but when I did my left eye would vibrate and i couldn't focus so I got back on them Seen neurologist. in november 2016. He said to him everything seemed fine even though I told him I feel way of. He requested a mri I continued to feel off and lightheadness and hard to focus and if i forgot a serc pill I would feel worst November 2016, shoppers drug mart gave me the generic of serc which made me very sick and didn't work for me also Had Mri Feb 2017 on my head. Everything came back good. Then in early March I felt perfect, best i did in years then all of a sudden mid march it was like April 2017 all over again but kinda different. My left eye wouldn't stop vibrating, I couldn't focus, felt like gonna throw up, and was gonna pass out at random times. This went away (back to my new normal which still wasn't perfect). I was at work april 2017 and got very sick again. Hard to focus, but this time felt very warm and flustered like I had a fever or blood pressure was up. My legs would burn. I checked blood pressure and it was good. I would feel the worst in the mornings and feel overheated after lunch. I had severe motion sickness. I had to be driving. and if I had to stop and go a lot in traffic it would make me feel sicker. This went away after 2 weeks and back to my new normal.  I gave up sec pills June 15th to see how I would be when seeing the ent. I was a little bit worst but not totally I went back to ent last week and he said again it's not a ear problem and has referred me back to a neurologist. He cleaned my ears and now I feel very off again I do have anxiety over this all as I have a fear of getting sick and not working as I have a lot of bills. He said this could make symptoms worst. Im very tired all the time. My left arm feels weaker than right arm. If I make sharp left turns it feels worst than right turns. Hard for me to focus as I like to drift off when somebody is talking to me. This is affecting my work as I usually work at heights but have not since and my work choices are limited Anxiety does run in my family but I only have it since I got sick. Could you wake up feeling like your drunk and serc help and it be anxiety? the part with things in my ears making me sick throws off the anxiety part. Im just not sure what tests are going to be next. I am overweigh a bit (511 and 220 as I stop exercising) and have diarrhea daily since a year Sorry for the long rite up but this has been a very hard year and I have a 2 year old son and have been sick for half of his life so far any suggestions greatly apppreciated"

I couldn't and still can't put anything in my ears such as listening to music as it makes me sick the next day Tried to give up my sec pills but when I did my left eye would vibrate and i couldn't focus so I got back on them Seen neurologist. in november 2016. He said to him everything seemed fine even though I told him I feel way of. He requested a mri I continued to feel off and lightheadness and hard to focus and if i forgot a serc pill I would feel worst November 2016, shoppers drug mart gave me the generic of serc which made me very sick and didn't work for me also Had Mri Feb 2017 on my head. Everything came back good. Then in early March I felt perfect, best i did in years then all of a sudden mid march it was like April 2017 all over again but kinda different. My left eye wouldn't stop vibrating, I couldn't focus, felt like gonna throw up, and was gonna pass out at random times. This went away (back to my new normal which still wasn't perfect). I was at work april 2017 and got very sick again. Hard to focus, but this time felt very warm and flustered like I had a fever or blood pressure was up. My legs would burn. I checked blood pressure and it was good. I would feel the worst in the mornings and feel overheated after lunch. I had severe motion sickness. I had to be driving. and if I had to stop and go a lot in traffic it would make me feel sicker. This went away after 2 weeks and back to my new normal.  I gave up sec pills June 15th to see how I would be when seeing the ent. I was a little bit worst but not totally I went back to ent last week and he said again it's not a ear problem and has referred me back to a neurologist. He cleaned my ears and now I feel very off again I do have anxiety over this all as I have a fear of getting sick and not working as I have a lot of bills. He said this could make symptoms worst. Im very tired all the time. My left arm feels weaker than right arm. If I make sharp left turns it feels worst than right turns. Hard for me to focus as I like to drift off when somebody is talking to me. This is affecting my work as I usually work at heights but have not since and my work choices are limited Anxiety does run in my family but I only have it since I got sick. Could you wake up feeling like your drunk and serc help and it be anxiety? the part with things in my ears making me sick throws off the anxiety part. Im just not sure what tests are going to be next. I am overweigh a bit (511 and 220 as I stop exercising) and have diarrhea daily since a year Sorry for the long rite up but this has been a very hard year and I have a 2 year old son and have been sick for half of his life so far any suggestions greatly apppreciated"

Everything i tired to look at I couldn't. It was all a big blur. I didn't go to doctor until my left arm started to go numb and II couldn't focus on anything. Also my head was very lightheaded. (not sure if a coincidence or not but two nights before at work I got very cold, so cold in fact I couldn't talk proper afterwards for a little while. The cold came from my lower back and my left side of face was causing the problem for trying to talk. Anyways I went to doctor and just said I was dissy and he said I had vertigo and gave me serc and it went away. Before it went away I had very bad motion sickness which I never had A week later I returned home the symptoms came back (not s bad as initial drunk feeling) after I tried to clean my ears (or that's my guess). My left arm went a little numb again. I got sec again from another doctor. My focus problems improved but I could telll something is off and not rite. FYI I continued to take sec until June 2017!!
