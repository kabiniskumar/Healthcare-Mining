Someone with MS may experience weakness in an arm or leg, numbness, loss of balance, and muscle spasms, but the severity of these symptoms are unique to the individual.  Let’s stand with the more than 400,000 Americans living with MS. We are stronger together. Raising awareness, providing support, and sharing your stories does make a difference.

I am little scared and could use your thoughts. A little over three weeks ago, my right leg went numb below the knee and I started to get pins and needles in the feet and cramps in the calf. I also had a dull pain behind my left eye and very slight shaking (kind of like my whole body was on vibrate but barely noticeable to me). The pins and needles, numbness and cramps started to migrate to the left feet and calves over the next two days. The afternoon I had a really sharp pain on the right side of my neck of 30 minutes (glosseal neuralgia?) Then it went away. This happened at the same time the following two days for exactly the same time period. I haven't had that since. Then I started to get a little tingling and pins and needles in my hands and twitching in my legs and extreme FATIGUE. It felt like my legs couldn't support me. I also started to get pin pr!ck sensations all over my body but mostly below the waist. Over a few days, the twitching got a little and pin pricks got worse and my right leg and arm felt like it was sunburned, which it wasn't. The sun burn lasted a day . A couple of days later, still having tingling, cramping, twitching, and pin pricks, my right side felt like it was literally on fire. That lasted a day. About a week has past and it felt like my symptoms were very gradually decreasing and them wammmo! Yesterday morning I had severe pain on my left scapula whenever I turn or bend my head left or lift something with my right arm. My buddy did a little acupuncture and the pain went away. I also started getting electric shock sensations on my head all over but mostly on the sides and behind my ears. Today, I had very sharp pains below my calf to my heel that lasted for a second and continued for several hours, intermittently. This is really starting to freak me out. But other than urinary and bowel issues, I pretty much have every ms symptom. Can you get all of these over a 3 week period never having them before? I should point out I am a mid 40s male and in good shape. I met with my pcp and had a bunch of blood tests to include Lyme disease, vitamins, etc. Other than an Ana ab test, everything came back negative. Is my anxiety getting the best of me or is this pointing to ms."

Last Sunday, my nose and upper lip went numb. Don't recall exactly when it started. I know I sneezed really hard with my mouth shut and felt extremely light-headed suddenly. Could've been after that? Don't recall. Throughout the week or eventually spread to my bottom lip, but no further. It's not totally numb, just very decreased sensitivity.  I went to an ENT due to drainage from a previous illness. He shrugged it off, said it was likely an inflamed nerve, and said I looked fine otherwise.  I was due to go on vacation the next day but was in such a state of panic that I cancelled and went to my regular doctor instead. She had a similar conclusion, that she really wasnt that concerned about it. We did bloodwork to rule out thyroid/B12 issues, which I won't know about til next week. She said she didn't feel like an MRI was needed yet, and gave me prednisone to help with what she thought was a nerve irritated by sneezing/coughing.  My nose and lips are slightly numb with pressure in that area, almost. I have dull pain behind my 2 front teeth, but no visible oral issue. I do have some TMJ aches, but no official diagnoses.  Now yesterday, my neck up to the base of my skull has started hurting. Same ache at my forehead, with a tightness at my temples and the crown of my skull. Still happening today. I spent most of yesterday anxious/stressed/crying, so could be a tension headache? It's not debilitating pain. I'm in a panic thinking that this numbness is because I have an aneurysm bulging against a nerve. Any insight would be much appreciated. I can't focus right now and am a meltdown away from an ER bill. :("

I had not had any noticeable relapses since then. About a week ago, my right foot started to feel numb. Within two days, both hands and the left foot felt the same. Now the soles of my feet are really sensitive. When I make a fist, it feels as if my flesh is being pulled back away from my fingertips. Further, I feel as if there is a tight band around my lower chest area. Is this more likely to be an MS relapse, or an entirely new neurological illness? Thank you."

A couple of weeks after the surgery she began to experience vertigo and eye pain behind her eye, on the same side of her face as the surgery. The pain is worse when she lies on the left side (surgery side). She took two antibiotics and a steroid post-surgery to rule out or prevent infection. She has been to primary care twice, the oral surgeon twice (he says it's not related to the surgery), an ENT twice, ophthalmologist, and is doing vestibular therapy with a PT. She also had an MRI (without contrast) that came back normal. Our next step is an appointment this week with a neuro ophthalmologist, but so far no one has answers. It feels to me like it has something to do with trauma, infection, or healing needed from the oral surgery. My wife is having extreme anxiety about it because she is in constant pain with her eye (with difficulty sleeping) and she is concerned it could be MS, but it seems odd to me that it would show up at the same time as the surgery.

My wife said she was having terrible migraines that started 4 1/2 years earlier, she went to a neurologists to run numerous tests to determine causes for her severe migraines. CAT scans, MRI's X-rays, blood tests but nothing conclusive. My wife and I looked into Dementia because she was having various other symptoms associated with it. She was also have vison issues which we later corrected for the most part. He memory was going and she was getting confused very easily anymore. She used to be an Air traffic controller in the navy and later a long haul trucker, jobs that required a lot of thinking and planning. She could no longer do that anymore. We went to internet to describe symptoms she was having and thought we could help. The first Doctor just dismissed our research and kept pumping her with various drugs and families of drugs until they exhausted their course of medications and treatments and then started to repeat them again. Wasting more time. We finally went to a few more doctors (Pain specialists and Neurologist's) but they basically did the same thing and this time we brought up the possibility of Dementia or Alzheimer’s. We were dismissed of that Idea because they all said she was too young. Age 54 at the time. After about 2 years we finally went to another Neurologist's, a female doctor this time and had more tests done and expressed out concerns about Dementia. This doctor finally looked into it and did several quick tests and determined my wife did have Alzheimer’s. Why are doctors so quick to dismiss this disease? Especially when she had almost every symptom. It seems that checking for the disease early is just a waste of time if doctors are going to dismiss the patient and their symptoms because they thing the patient is too young to have this disease."

My body is getting worse every year (usually around this season). My mom was diagnosed with MS in the 90's but hers is not progressive. I have seen multiple doctors for multiple things and no one knows what's wrong with me. I'm not a hypochondriac and believe that all of these things are related, not separate problems.  Everything escalated in 2011 when I was diagnosed with optic neuritis. I had just had my son (4th child) in Sept of 2010 before experiencing a 6 month localized headache. After 6 months of suffering from the intense pain in my left eyebrow, I realized I could touch it and trigger the pain in a specific area. My doc gave me a low dose steroid and it went away eventually. Around this time, I began experiencing sensations of water dripping on me...like water dripping on my arm or the top of my foot. I'd go to wipe it and there was nothing there.  2012 began the ""pulling"" searing pain in my neck (down into my back), the tops of my hands and the tops of my feet. At random moments without warning, it feels like an electric shock sensation ""pops"" and is followed by a hot sensation. Sometimes it feels like a tendon gets ""hung up"" and snaps. It's frustrating esp when I'm driving and just ""looking both ways"" or turning to talk to someone. I go through several months with no episodes but typically when they come back, they are frequent, unpredictable and last a few months. That same year, I lost all feeling in my right hand - my pinky, ring finger and half of my palm up through my thumb - which felt like pins and needles half of the time and a dead hand the other. I also started to experience my left hand falling asleep. I could not grip a pencil to even write like normal. I also had a very hard time going down steps because of my knees. My doctor ordered a CAT scan of my head to see if there were legions. It came back mostly clean with the exception of one spot which was inconclusive. I was referred to a neurologist who did nothing for me (he barely spoke to me, just pulled on my arms, banged on my knees and I left). He ruled out MS because I could touch my chin to my chest without triggering any pain. By this point, they decided my hand issues were probably carpal tunnel. The feeling in my hand began to return after a year. For the most part, most of my symptoms were gone.  Come Fall the next year, they returned along with very irregular and heavy menstrual cycles which made me anemic. in 2014 my bladder problems began, along with mild digestive issues. I began getting UTIs quite regularly despite my efforts to avoid them. These moved quite quickly into my kidneys, hospitalizing me with a double kidney infection and potassium deficiency. My doctor ordered a cystoscopy to make sure I was able to completely empty my bladder. Everything came back normal.  At this point, everything began to occur at the same time. The pins and needles in my limbs, twitches and spasms in random places including my face, back, legs, and hands; numbness, bladder infections, stomach problems, shocking sensations, joint pain. Then, they'd subside for months.  Last year, I developed a very stiff neck and sciatica in both my neck and lower back...sometimes at the same time. I thought I had just slept wrong but a year and several chiropractic adjustments later, it's still stiff and painful and I don't have to be doing anything for my sciatica to flare up. My husband and I were in the store one day and my sciatic nerve in my lower back sent a searing sensation that caught me off guard (I wasn't moving, just standing there talking) and my husband caught me as I began to fall. 2016 I began struggling gripping with my hands again. My doc ordered a test for arthritis which was negative. Only days later, I was sitting on the couch when my right thigh and calf muscle cramped immensely causing me to jump up and I couldn't walk...the calf felt like it could have been a blood clot, which scared me and concerned my doc so she ordered an ultrasound of my leg. It came back fine. That September, I was exercising like I always do and 2 days later, both of my wrists felt fractured. My left wrist healing within a few months while my right wrist got worse, sending me yet again to the hospital. Xray showed no break but they couldn't rule out a hairline fracture. My right wrist is still sensitive and requires a brace from time to time, especially while I sleep.  I began getting very sick every time I would eat and became severely constipated regardless of how clean my diet was. I have never struggled with irregularities at all. My doc referred me to a gastro doc who diagnosed me with IBS and introduced me to the FODmap Diet. This diet cuts out fermenting foods to avoid bad gasses in the stomach. This helped but did not correct the constipation or fullness. To this day, everything I eat won't digest properly or break down. I eat no dairy, no gluten, very little sugar or starchy foods and only drink water. I even tried a 15-day colon cleanse vitamin and couldn't use the bathroom at all by day 4 and the cramps were unbearable. This year has been the worst. I now suffer with all of these things plus bladder and bowel issues and can't eat anything without getting sick. Within the past few weeks, my face ""contracts"" (tightens starting in my nose then intensifies over my whole face from my nose upward and subsides) and I can't put my head down too far without experiencing an electric shock sensation shooting down my neck to about the bottom of my shoulder blades. At random moments lately, my whole back tightens and I can't move until it subsides. It feels like an intense ""contraction"". I recently developed neuritis again. My continued menstrual problems led me to an appointment with my gynecologist. She did an ultrasound to find that my uterus is flipped and I have a fibroid tumor which is causing the anemia and heavy bleeding. She said the constipation is a result of my uterus putting pressure on my rectum so she scheduled me a hysterectomy but I am going to cancel it on the advice of my family doctor. He says a uterus cannot cause that kind of restriction. I'm the lead singer of a rock band. On the last 2 shows of tour in September, I forgot my lyrics in the middle of the songs. During both trips, there were bouts where I was trying to talk to friends or fans and knew what I was trying to say but I couldn't get my sentences right or think of some of the words. It became so frustrating that I stopped talking altogether. I had a really rough trip to a particular festival in September. I pretty much stayed in the van all day until we performed that evening. I had a burning sensation in my stomach, couldn't walk a straight line (dizzy, fatigue, loss of balance....but I didn't eat much that day due to stomach upset). I took 6 tums, 2 gas-x pills and an over the counter nausea medicine that day..nothing brought relief. It resolved on it's own after 3 days. Yesterday morning, I woke up feeling like my gut was on fire. I couldn't wait for my husband to come home so I drove myself to the ER. The pain intensified and subsided every 5-10 minutes and made me very nauseous as well as sending a searing pain through my lower right back. This went on for 6 hours and I literally wanted to die...or cut my stomach out! They checked my blood and urine, did an ultrasound of my gallbladder, pancreas, liver and kidneys. Everything came back fine so they concluded that it's probably just the IBS.  My doc is ordering a scope to see my stomach and check for celiac, ulcers, crohn's etc. It very well could be one of these things. I came home from the hospital yesterday and experienced loss of bowel control. I soiled my pants and didn't realize until it was too late. I did the same thing this morning which is why I decided to post here. I'm so embarrassed but desperate for answers. I have been constipated for a year and now I have diarrhea (which could be a side effect of the IBS meds they gave me.

My body is getting worse every year (usually around this season). My mom was diagnosed with MS in the 90's but hers is not progressive. I have seen multiple doctors for multiple things and no one knows what's wrong with me. I'm not a hypochondriac and believe that all of these things are related, not separate problems.  Everything escalated in 2011 when I was diagnosed with optic neuritis. I had just had my son (4th child) in Sept of 2010 before experiencing a 6 month localized headache. After 6 months of suffering from the intense pain in my left eyebrow, I realized I could touch it and trigger the pain in a specific area. My doc gave me a low dose steroid and it went away eventually. Around this time, I began experiencing sensations of water dripping on me...like water dripping on my arm or the top of my foot. I'd go to wipe it and there was nothing there.  2012 began the ""pulling"" searing pain in my neck (down into my back), the tops of my hands and the tops of my feet. At random moments without warning, it feels like an electric shock sensation ""pops"" and is followed by a hot sensation. Sometimes it feels like a tendon gets ""hung up"" and snaps. It's frustrating esp when I'm driving and just ""looking both ways"" or turning to talk to someone. I go through several months with no episodes but typically when they come back, they are frequent, unpredictable and last a few months. That same year, I lost all feeling in my right hand - my pinky, ring finger and half of my palm up through my thumb - which felt like pins and needles half of the time and a dead hand the other. I also started to experience my left hand falling asleep. I could not grip a pencil to even write like normal. I also had a very hard time going down steps because of my knees. My doctor ordered a CAT scan of my head to see if there were legions. It came back mostly clean with the exception of one spot which was inconclusive. I was referred to a neurologist who did nothing for me (he barely spoke to me, just pulled on my arms, banged on my knees and I left). He ruled out MS because I could touch my chin to my chest without triggering any pain. By this point, they decided my hand issues were probably carpal tunnel. The feeling in my hand began to return after a year. For the most part, most of my symptoms were gone.  Come Fall the next year, they returned along with very irregular and heavy menstrual cycles which made me anemic. in 2014 my bladder problems began, along with mild digestive issues. I began getting UTIs quite regularly despite my efforts to avoid them. These moved quite quickly into my kidneys, hospitalizing me with a double kidney infection and potassium deficiency. My doctor ordered a cystoscopy to make sure I was able to completely empty my bladder. Everything came back normal.  At this point, everything began to occur at the same time. The pins and needles in my limbs, twitches and spasms in random places including my face, back, legs, and hands; numbness, bladder infections, stomach problems, shocking sensations, joint pain. Then, they'd subside for months.  Last year, I developed a very stiff neck and sciatica in both my neck and lower back...sometimes at the same time. I thought I had just slept wrong but a year and several chiropractic adjustments later, it's still stiff and painful and I don't have to be doing anything for my sciatica to flare up. My husband and I were in the store one day and my sciatic nerve in my lower back sent a searing sensation that caught me off guard (I wasn't moving, just standing there talking) and my husband caught me as I began to fall. 2016 I began struggling gripping with my hands again. My doc ordered a test for arthritis which was negative. Only days later, I was sitting on the couch when my right thigh and calf muscle cramped immensely causing me to jump up and I couldn't walk...the calf felt like it could have been a blood clot, which scared me and concerned my doc so she ordered an ultrasound of my leg. It came back fine. That September, I was exercising like I always do and 2 days later, both of my wrists felt fractured. My left wrist healing within a few months while my right wrist got worse, sending me yet again to the hospital. Xray showed no break but they couldn't rule out a hairline fracture. My right wrist is still sensitive and requires a brace from time to time, especially while I sleep.  I began getting very sick every time I would eat and became severely constipated regardless of how clean my diet was. I have never struggled with irregularities at all. My doc referred me to a gastro doc who diagnosed me with IBS and introduced me to the FODmap Diet. This diet cuts out fermenting foods to avoid bad gasses in the stomach. This helped but did not correct the constipation or fullness. To this day, everything I eat won't digest properly or break down. I eat no dairy, no gluten, very little sugar or starchy foods and only drink water. I even tried a 15-day colon cleanse vitamin and couldn't use the bathroom at all by day 4 and the cramps were unbearable. This year has been the worst. I now suffer with all of these things plus bladder and bowel issues and can't eat anything without getting sick. Within the past few weeks, my face ""contracts"" (tightens starting in my nose then intensifies over my whole face from my nose upward and subsides) and I can't put my head down too far without experiencing an electric shock sensation shooting down my neck to about the bottom of my shoulder blades. At random moments lately, my whole back tightens and I can't move until it subsides. It feels like an intense ""contraction"". I recently developed neuritis again. My continued menstrual problems led me to an appointment with my gynecologist. She did an ultrasound to find that my uterus is flipped and I have a fibroid tumor which is causing the anemia and heavy bleeding. She said the constipation is a result of my uterus putting pressure on my rectum so she scheduled me a hysterectomy but I am going to cancel it on the advice of my family doctor. He says a uterus cannot cause that kind of restriction. I'm the lead singer of a rock band. On the last 2 shows of tour in September, I forgot my lyrics in the middle of the songs. During both trips, there were bouts where I was trying to talk to friends or fans and knew what I was trying to say but I couldn't get my sentences right or think of some of the words. It became so frustrating that I stopped talking altogether. I had a really rough trip to a particular festival in September. I pretty much stayed in the van all day until we performed that evening. I had a burning sensation in my stomach, couldn't walk a straight line (dizzy, fatigue, loss of balance....but I didn't eat much that day due to stomach upset). I took 6 tums, 2 gas-x pills and an over the counter nausea medicine that day..nothing brought relief. It resolved on it's own after 3 days. Yesterday morning, I woke up feeling like my gut was on fire. I couldn't wait for my husband to come home so I drove myself to the ER. The pain intensified and subsided every 5-10 minutes and made me very nauseous as well as sending a searing pain through my lower right back. This went on for 6 hours and I literally wanted to die...or cut my stomach out! They checked my blood and urine, did an ultrasound of my gallbladder, pancreas, liver and kidneys. Everything came back fine so they concluded that it's probably just the IBS.  My doc is ordering a scope to see my stomach and check for celiac, ulcers, crohn's etc. It very well could be one of these things. I came home from the hospital yesterday and experienced loss of bowel control. I soiled my pants and didn't realize until it was too late. I did the same thing this morning which is why I decided to post here. I'm so embarrassed but desperate for answers. I have been constipated for a year and now I have diarrhea (which could be a side effect of the IBS meds they gave me. But, my doc said it would take 2 weeks to take effect...it had only been 2 days). Obviously I don't WANT a disease of any kind! But I'm tired of going between different specialists to be told there's nothing wrong with me. I want answers so I can start an effective treatment plan.

My doctor ordered a cystoscopy to make sure I was able to completely empty my bladder. Everything came back normal.  At this point, everything began to occur at the same time. The pins and needles in my limbs, twitches and spasms in random places including my face, back, legs, and hands; numbness, bladder infections, stomach problems, shocking sensations, joint pain. Then, they'd subside for months.  Last year, I developed a very stiff neck and sciatica in both my neck and lower back...sometimes at the same time. I thought I had just slept wrong but a year and several chiropractic adjustments later, it's still stiff and painful and I don't have to be doing anything for my sciatica to flare up. My husband and I were in the store one day and my sciatic nerve in my lower back sent a searing sensation that caught me off guard (I wasn't moving, just standing there talking) and my husband caught me as I began to fall. 2016 I began struggling gripping with my hands again. My doc ordered a test for arthritis which was negative. Only days later, I was sitting on the couch when my right thigh and calf muscle cramped immensely causing me to jump up and I couldn't walk...the calf felt like it could have been a blood clot, which scared me and concerned my doc so she ordered an ultrasound of my leg. It came back fine. That September, I was exercising like I always do and 2 days later, both of my wrists felt fractured. My left wrist healing within a few months while my right wrist got worse, sending me yet again to the hospital. Xray showed no break but they couldn't rule out a hairline fracture. My right wrist is still sensitive and requires a brace from time to time, especially while I sleep.  I began getting very sick every time I would eat and became severely constipated regardless of how clean my diet was. I have never struggled with irregularities at all. My doc referred me to a gastro doc who diagnosed me with IBS and introduced me to the FODmap Diet. This diet cuts out fermenting foods to avoid bad gasses in the stomach. This helped but did not correct the constipation or fullness. To this day, everything I eat won't digest properly or break down. I eat no dairy, no gluten, very little sugar or starchy foods and only drink water. I even tried a 15-day colon cleanse vitamin and couldn't use the bathroom at all by day 4 and the cramps were unbearable. This year has been the worst. I now suffer with all of these things plus bladder and bowel issues and can't eat anything without getting sick. Within the past few weeks, my face ""contracts"" (tightens starting in my nose then intensifies over my whole face from my nose upward and subsides) and I can't put my head down too far without experiencing an electric shock sensation shooting down my neck to about the bottom of my shoulder blades. At random moments lately, my whole back tightens and I can't move until it subsides. It feels like an intense ""contraction"". I recently developed neuritis again. My continued menstrual problems led me to an appointment with my gynecologist. She did an ultrasound to find that my uterus is flipped and I have a fibroid tumor which is causing the anemia and heavy bleeding. She said the constipation is a result of my uterus putting pressure on my rectum so she scheduled me a hysterectomy but I am going to cancel it on the advice of my family doctor. He says a uterus cannot cause that kind of restriction. I'm the lead singer of a rock band. On the last 2 shows of tour in September, I forgot my lyrics in the middle of the songs. During both trips, there were bouts where I was trying to talk to friends or fans and knew what I was trying to say but I couldn't get my sentences right or think of some of the words. It became so frustrating that I stopped talking altogether. I had a really rough trip to a particular festival in September. I pretty much stayed in the van all day until we performed that evening. I had a burning sensation in my stomach, couldn't walk a straight line (dizzy, fatigue, loss of balance....but I didn't eat much that day due to stomach upset). I took 6 tums, 2 gas-x pills and an over the counter nausea medicine that day..nothing brought relief. It resolved on it's own after 3 days. Yesterday morning, I woke up feeling like my gut was on fire. I couldn't wait for my husband to come home so I drove myself to the ER. The pain intensified and subsided every 5-10 minutes and made me very nauseous as well as sending a searing pain through my lower right back. This went on for 6 hours and I literally wanted to die...or cut my stomach out! They checked my blood and urine, did an ultrasound of my gallbladder, pancreas, liver and kidneys. Everything came back fine so they concluded that it's probably just the IBS.  My doc is ordering a scope to see my stomach and check for celiac, ulcers, crohn's etc. It very well could be one of these things. I came home from the hospital yesterday and experienced loss of bowel control. I soiled my pants and didn't realize until it was too late. I did the same thing this morning which is why I decided to post here. I'm so embarrassed but desperate for answers. I have been constipated for a year and now I have diarrhea (which could be a side effect of the IBS meds they gave me. But, my doc said it would take 2 weeks to take effect...it had only been 2 days). Obviously I don't WANT a disease of any kind! But I'm tired of going between different specialists to be told there's nothing wrong with me. I want answers so I can start an effective treatment plan. I'm 33 yrs young and this has only been effecting me for 6 years...I want to get ahead of whatever it is. I have 4 kids who depend on me and I've always been very active and lead a healthy lifestyle. Thank you for taking the time to read my story and give any helpful advice."

My body is getting worse every year (usually around this season). My mom was diagnosed with MS in the 90's but hers is not progressive. I have seen multiple doctors for multiple things and no one knows what's wrong with me. I'm not a hypochondriac and believe that all of these things are related, not separate problems.  Everything escalated in 2011 when I was diagnosed with optic neuritis. I had just had my son (4th child) in Sept of 2010 before experiencing a 6 month localized headache. After 6 months of suffering from the intense pain in my left eyebrow, I realized I could touch it and trigger the pain in a specific area. My doc gave me a low dose steroid and it went away eventually. Around this time, I began experiencing sensations of water dripping on me...like water dripping on my arm or the top of my foot. I'd go to wipe it and there was nothing there.  2012 began the ""pulling"" searing pain in my neck (down into my back), the tops of my hands and the tops of my feet. At random moments without warning, it feels like an electric shock sensation ""pops"" and is followed by a hot sensation. Sometimes it feels like a tendon gets ""hung up"" and snaps. It's frustrating esp when I'm driving and just ""looking both ways"" or turning to talk to someone. I go through several months with no episodes but typically when they come back, they are frequent, unpredictable and last a few months. That same year, I lost all feeling in my right hand - my pinky, ring finger and half of my palm up through my thumb - which felt like pins and needles half of the time and a dead hand the other. I also started to experience my left hand falling asleep. I could not grip a pencil to even write like normal. I also had a very hard time going down steps because of my knees. My doctor ordered a CAT scan of my head to see if there were legions. It came back mostly clean with the exception of one spot which was inconclusive. I was referred to a neurologist who did nothing for me (he barely spoke to me, just pulled on my arms, banged on my knees and I left). He ruled out MS because I could touch my chin to my chest without triggering any pain. By this point, they decided my hand issues were probably carpal tunnel.

The pain intensified and subsided every 5-10 minutes and made me very nauseous as well as sending a searing pain through my lower right back. This went on for 6 hours and I literally wanted to die...or cut my stomach out! They checked my blood and urine, did an ultrasound of my gallbladder, pancreas, liver and kidneys. Everything came back fine so they concluded that it's probably just the IBS.  My doc is ordering a scope to see my stomach and check for celiac, ulcers, crohn's etc. It very well could be one of these things. I came home from the hospital yesterday and experienced loss of bowel control. I soiled my pants and didn't realize until it was too late. I did the same thing this morning which is why I decided to post here. I'm so embarrassed but desperate for answers. I have been constipated for a year and now I have diarrhea (which could be a side effect of the IBS meds they gave me. But, my doc said it would take 2 weeks to take effect...it had only been 2 days). Obviously I don't WANT a disease of any kind! But I'm tired of going between different specialists to be told there's nothing wrong with me. I want answers so I can start an effective treatment plan. I'm 33 yrs young and this has only been effecting me for 6 years...I want to get ahead of whatever it is. I have 4 kids who depend on me and I've always been very active and lead a healthy lifestyle. Thank you for taking the time to read my story and give any helpful advice."

My body is getting worse every year (usually around this season). My mom was diagnosed with MS in the 90's but hers is not progressive. I have seen multiple doctors for multiple things and no one knows what's wrong with me. I'm not a hypochondriac and believe that all of these things are related, not separate problems.  Everything escalated in 2011 when I was diagnosed with optic neuritis. I had just had my son (4th child) in Sept of 2010 before experiencing a 6 month localized headache. After 6 months of suffering from the intense pain in my left eyebrow, I realized I could touch it and trigger the pain in a specific area. My doc gave me a low dose steroid and it went away eventually. Around this time, I began experiencing sensations of water dripping on me...like water dripping on my arm or the top of my foot. I'd go to wipe it and there was nothing there.  2012 began the ""pulling"" searing pain in my neck (down into my back), the tops of my hands and the tops of my feet. At random moments without warning, it feels like an electric shock sensation ""pops"" and is followed by a hot sensation. Sometimes it feels like a tendon gets ""hung up"" and snaps. It's frustrating esp when I'm driving and just ""looking both ways"" or turning to talk to someone. I go through several months with no episodes but typically when they come back, they are frequent, unpredictable and last a few months. That same year, I lost all feeling in my right hand - my pinky, ring finger and half of my palm up through my thumb - which felt like pins and needles half of the time and a dead hand the other. I also started to experience my left hand falling asleep. I could not grip a pencil to even write like normal. I also had a very hard time going down steps because of my knees. My doctor ordered a CAT scan of my head to see if there were legions. It came back mostly clean with the exception of one spot which was inconclusive. I was referred to a neurologist who did nothing for me (he barely spoke to me, just pulled on my arms, banged on my knees and I left). He ruled out MS because I could touch my chin to my chest without triggering any pain. By this point, they decided my hand issues were probably carpal tunnel. The feeling in my hand began to return after a year. For the most part, most of my symptoms were gone.  Come Fall the next year, they returned along with very irregular and heavy menstrual cycles which made me anemic. in 2014 my bladder problems began, along with mild digestive issues. I began getting UTIs quite regularly despite my efforts to avoid them. These moved quite quickly into my kidneys, hospitalizing me with a double kidney infection and potassium deficiency. My doctor ordered a cystoscopy to make sure I was able to completely empty my bladder. Everything came back normal.  At this point, everything began to occur at the same time. The pins and needles in my limbs, twitches and spasms in random places including my face, back, legs, and hands; numbness, bladder infections, stomach problems, shocking sensations, joint pain. Then, they'd subside for months.  Last year, I developed a very stiff neck and sciatica in both my neck and lower back...sometimes at the same time. I thought I had just slept wrong but a year and several chiropractic adjustments later, it's still stiff and painful and I don't have to be doing anything for my sciatica to flare up. My husband and I were in the store one day and my sciatic nerve in my lower back sent a searing sensation that caught me off guard (I wasn't moving, just standing there talking) and my husband caught me as I began to fall. 2016 I began struggling gripping with my hands again. My doc ordered a test for arthritis which was negative. Only days later, I was sitting on the couch when my right thigh and calf muscle cramped immensely causing me to jump up and I couldn't walk...the calf felt like it could have been a blood clot, which scared me and concerned my doc so she ordered an ultrasound of my leg. It came back fine. That September, I was exercising like I always do and 2 days later, both of my wrists felt fractured. My left wrist healing within a few months while my right wrist got worse, sending me yet again to the hospital. Xray showed no break but they couldn't rule out a hairline fracture. My right wrist is still sensitive and requires a brace from time to time, especially while I sleep.  I began getting very sick every time I would eat and became severely constipated regardless of how clean my diet was. I have never struggled with irregularities at all. My doc referred me to a gastro doc who diagnosed me with IBS and introduced me to the FODmap Diet. This diet cuts out fermenting foods to avoid bad gasses in the stomach. This helped but did not correct the constipation or fullness. To this day, everything I eat won't digest properly or break down. I eat no dairy, no gluten, very little sugar or starchy foods and only drink water. I even tried a 15-day colon cleanse vitamin and couldn't use the bathroom at all by day 4 and the cramps were unbearable. This year has been the worst. I now suffer with all of these things plus bladder and bowel issues and can't eat anything without getting sick. Within the past few weeks, my face ""contracts"" (tightens starting in my nose then intensifies over my whole face from my nose upward and subsides) and I can't put my head down too far without experiencing an electric shock sensation shooting down my neck to about the bottom of my shoulder blades. At random moments lately, my whole back tightens and I can't move until it subsides. It feels like an intense ""contraction"". I recently developed neuritis again. My continued menstrual problems led me to an appointment with my gynecologist. She did an ultrasound to find that my uterus is flipped and I have a fibroid tumor which is causing the anemia and heavy bleeding. She said the constipation is a result of my uterus putting pressure on my rectum so she scheduled me a hysterectomy but I am going to cancel it on the advice of my family doctor. He says a uterus cannot cause that kind of restriction. I'm the lead singer of a rock band. On the last 2 shows of tour in September, I forgot my lyrics in the middle of the songs. During both trips, there were bouts where I was trying to talk to friends or fans and knew what I was trying to say but I couldn't get my sentences right or think of some of the words. It became so frustrating that I stopped talking altogether. I had a really rough trip to a particular festival in September. I pretty much stayed in the van all day until we performed that evening. I had a burning sensation in my stomach, couldn't walk a straight line (dizzy, fatigue, loss of balance....but I didn't eat much that day due to stomach upset). I took 6 tums, 2 gas-x pills and an over the counter nausea medicine that day..nothing brought relief. It resolved on it's own after 3 days. Yesterday morning, I woke up feeling like my gut was on fire. I couldn't wait for my husband to come home so I drove myself to the ER.

That same year, I lost all feeling in my right hand - my pinky, ring finger and half of my palm up through my thumb - which felt like pins and needles half of the time and a dead hand the other. I also started to experience my left hand falling asleep. I could not grip a pencil to even write like normal. I also had a very hard time going down steps because of my knees. My doctor ordered a CAT scan of my head to see if there were legions. It came back mostly clean with the exception of one spot which was inconclusive. I was referred to a neurologist who did nothing for me (he barely spoke to me, just pulled on my arms, banged on my knees and I left). He ruled out MS because I could touch my chin to my chest without triggering any pain. By this point, they decided my hand issues were probably carpal tunnel. The feeling in my hand began to return after a year. For the most part, most of my symptoms were gone.  Come Fall the next year, they returned along with very irregular and heavy menstrual cycles which made me anemic. in 2014 my bladder problems began, along with mild digestive issues. I began getting UTIs quite regularly despite my efforts to avoid them. These moved quite quickly into my kidneys, hospitalizing me with a double kidney infection and potassium deficiency. My doctor ordered a cystoscopy to make sure I was able to completely empty my bladder. Everything came back normal.  At this point, everything began to occur at the same time. The pins and needles in my limbs, twitches and spasms in random places including my face, back, legs, and hands; numbness, bladder infections, stomach problems, shocking sensations, joint pain. Then, they'd subside for months.  Last year, I developed a very stiff neck and sciatica in both my neck and lower back...sometimes at the same time. I thought I had just slept wrong but a year and several chiropractic adjustments later, it's still stiff and painful and I don't have to be doing anything for my sciatica to flare up. My husband and I were in the store one day and my sciatic nerve in my lower back sent a searing sensation that caught me off guard (I wasn't moving, just standing there talking) and my husband caught me as I began to fall. 2016 I began struggling gripping with my hands again. My doc ordered a test for arthritis which was negative. Only days later, I was sitting on the couch when my right thigh and calf muscle cramped immensely causing me to jump up and I couldn't walk...the calf felt like it could have been a blood clot, which scared me and concerned my doc so she ordered an ultrasound of my leg. It came back fine. That September, I was exercising like I always do and 2 days later, both of my wrists felt fractured. My left wrist healing within a few months while my right wrist got worse, sending me yet again to the hospital. Xray showed no break but they couldn't rule out a hairline fracture. My right wrist is still sensitive and requires a brace from time to time, especially while I sleep.  I began getting very sick every time I would eat and became severely constipated regardless of how clean my diet was. I have never struggled with irregularities at all. My doc referred me to a gastro doc who diagnosed me with IBS and introduced me to the FODmap Diet. This diet cuts out fermenting foods to avoid bad gasses in the stomach. This helped but did not correct the constipation or fullness. To this day, everything I eat won't digest properly or break down. I eat no dairy, no gluten, very little sugar or starchy foods and only drink water. I even tried a 15-day colon cleanse vitamin and couldn't use the bathroom at all by day 4 and the cramps were unbearable. This year has been the worst. I now suffer with all of these things plus bladder and bowel issues and can't eat anything without getting sick. Within the past few weeks, my face ""contracts"" (tightens starting in my nose then intensifies over my whole face from my nose upward and subsides) and I can't put my head down too far without experiencing an electric shock sensation shooting down my neck to about the bottom of my shoulder blades. At random moments lately, my whole back tightens and I can't move until it subsides. It feels like an intense ""contraction"". I recently developed neuritis again. My continued menstrual problems led me to an appointment with my gynecologist. She did an ultrasound to find that my uterus is flipped and I have a fibroid tumor which is causing the anemia and heavy bleeding. She said the constipation is a result of my uterus putting pressure on my rectum so she scheduled me a hysterectomy but I am going to cancel it on the advice of my family doctor. He says a uterus cannot cause that kind of restriction. I'm the lead singer of a rock band. On the last 2 shows of tour in September, I forgot my lyrics in the middle of the songs. During both trips, there were bouts where I was trying to talk to friends or fans and knew what I was trying to say but I couldn't get my sentences right or think of some of the words. It became so frustrating that I stopped talking altogether. I had a really rough trip to a particular festival in September. I pretty much stayed in the van all day until we performed that evening. I had a burning sensation in my stomach, couldn't walk a straight line (dizzy, fatigue, loss of balance....but I didn't eat much that day due to stomach upset). I took 6 tums, 2 gas-x pills and an over the counter nausea medicine that day..nothing brought relief. It resolved on it's own after 3 days. Yesterday morning, I woke up feeling like my gut was on fire. I couldn't wait for my husband to come home so I drove myself to the ER. The pain intensified and subsided every 5-10 minutes and made me very nauseous as well as sending a searing pain through my lower right back. This went on for 6 hours and I literally wanted to die...or cut my stomach out! They checked my blood and urine, did an ultrasound of my gallbladder, pancreas, liver and kidneys. Everything came back fine so they concluded that it's probably just the IBS.  My doc is ordering a scope to see my stomach and check for celiac, ulcers, crohn's etc. It very well could be one of these things. I came home from the hospital yesterday and experienced loss of bowel control. I soiled my pants and didn't realize until it was too late. I did the same thing this morning which is why I decided to post here. I'm so embarrassed but desperate for answers. I have been constipated for a year and now I have diarrhea (which could be a side effect of the IBS meds they gave me. But, my doc said it would take 2 weeks to take effect...it had only been 2 days). Obviously I don't WANT a disease of any kind! But I'm tired of going between different specialists to be told there's nothing wrong with me. I want answers so I can start an effective treatment plan. I'm 33 yrs young and this has only been effecting me for 6 years...I want to get ahead of whatever it is. I have 4 kids who depend on me and I've always been very active and lead a healthy lifestyle. Thank you for taking the time to read my story and give any helpful advice."

She said the constipation is a result of my uterus putting pressure on my rectum so she scheduled me a hysterectomy but I am going to cancel it on the advice of my family doctor. He says a uterus cannot cause that kind of restriction. I'm the lead singer of a rock band. On the last 2 shows of tour in September, I forgot my lyrics in the middle of the songs. During both trips, there were bouts where I was trying to talk to friends or fans and knew what I was trying to say but I couldn't get my sentences right or think of some of the words. It became so frustrating that I stopped talking altogether. I had a really rough trip to a particular festival in September. I pretty much stayed in the van all day until we performed that evening. I had a burning sensation in my stomach, couldn't walk a straight line (dizzy, fatigue, loss of balance....but I didn't eat much that day due to stomach upset). I took 6 tums, 2 gas-x pills and an over the counter nausea medicine that day..nothing brought relief. It resolved on it's own after 3 days. Yesterday morning, I woke up feeling like my gut was on fire. I couldn't wait for my husband to come home so I drove myself to the ER. The pain intensified and subsided every 5-10 minutes and made me very nauseous as well as sending a searing pain through my lower right back. This went on for 6 hours and I literally wanted to die...or cut my stomach out! They checked my blood and urine, did an ultrasound of my gallbladder, pancreas, liver and kidneys. Everything came back fine so they concluded that it's probably just the IBS.  My doc is ordering a scope to see my stomach and check for celiac, ulcers, crohn's etc. It very well could be one of these things. I came home from the hospital yesterday and experienced loss of bowel control. I soiled my pants and didn't realize until it was too late. I did the same thing this morning which is why I decided to post here. I'm so embarrassed but desperate for answers. I have been constipated for a year and now I have diarrhea (which could be a side effect of the IBS meds they gave me. But, my doc said it would take 2 weeks to take effect...it had only been 2 days). Obviously I don't WANT a disease of any kind! But I'm tired of going between different specialists to be told there's nothing wrong with me. I want answers so I can start an effective treatment plan. I'm 33 yrs young and this has only been effecting me for 6 years...I want to get ahead of whatever it is. I have 4 kids who depend on me and I've always been very active and lead a healthy lifestyle.

My body is getting worse every year (usually around this season). My mom was diagnosed with MS in the 90's but hers is not progressive. I have seen multiple doctors for multiple things and no one knows what's wrong with me. I'm not a hypochondriac and believe that all of these things are related, not separate problems.  Everything escalated in 2011 when I was diagnosed with optic neuritis. I had just had my son (4th child) in Sept of 2010 before experiencing a 6 month localized headache. After 6 months of suffering from the intense pain in my left eyebrow, I realized I could touch it and trigger the pain in a specific area. My doc gave me a low dose steroid and it went away eventually. Around this time, I began experiencing sensations of water dripping on me...like water dripping on my arm or the top of my foot. I'd go to wipe it and there was nothing there.  2012 began the ""pulling"" searing pain in my neck (down into my back), the tops of my hands and the tops of my feet. At random moments without warning, it feels like an electric shock sensation ""pops"" and is followed by a hot sensation. Sometimes it feels like a tendon gets ""hung up"" and snaps. It's frustrating esp when I'm driving and just ""looking both ways"" or turning to talk to someone. I go through several months with no episodes but typically when they come back, they are frequent, unpredictable and last a few months. That same year, I lost all feeling in my right hand - my pinky, ring finger and half of my palm up through my thumb - which felt like pins and needles half of the time and a dead hand the other. I also started to experience my left hand falling asleep. I could not grip a pencil to even write like normal. I also had a very hard time going down steps because of my knees. My doctor ordered a CAT scan of my head to see if there were legions. It came back mostly clean with the exception of one spot which was inconclusive. I was referred to a neurologist who did nothing for me (he barely spoke to me, just pulled on my arms, banged on my knees and I left). He ruled out MS because I could touch my chin to my chest without triggering any pain. By this point, they decided my hand issues were probably carpal tunnel. The feeling in my hand began to return after a year. For the most part, most of my symptoms were gone.  Come Fall the next year, they returned along with very irregular and heavy menstrual cycles which made me anemic. in 2014 my bladder problems began, along with mild digestive issues. I began getting UTIs quite regularly despite my efforts to avoid them. These moved quite quickly into my kidneys, hospitalizing me with a double kidney infection and potassium deficiency. My doctor ordered a cystoscopy to make sure I was able to completely empty my bladder. Everything came back normal.  At this point, everything began to occur at the same time. The pins and needles in my limbs, twitches and spasms in random places including my face, back, legs, and hands; numbness, bladder infections, stomach problems, shocking sensations, joint pain. Then, they'd subside for months.  Last year, I developed a very stiff neck and sciatica in both my neck and lower back...sometimes at the same time. I thought I had just slept wrong but a year and several chiropractic adjustments later, it's still stiff and painful and I don't have to be doing anything for my sciatica to flare up. My husband and I were in the store one day and my sciatic nerve in my lower back sent a searing sensation that caught me off guard (I wasn't moving, just standing there talking) and my husband caught me as I began to fall. 2016 I began struggling gripping with my hands again. My doc ordered a test for arthritis which was negative. Only days later, I was sitting on the couch when my right thigh and calf muscle cramped immensely causing me to jump up and I couldn't walk...the calf felt like it could have been a blood clot, which scared me and concerned my doc so she ordered an ultrasound of my leg. It came back fine. That September, I was exercising like I always do and 2 days later, both of my wrists felt fractured. My left wrist healing within a few months while my right wrist got worse, sending me yet again to the hospital. Xray showed no break but they couldn't rule out a hairline fracture. My right wrist is still sensitive and requires a brace from time to time, especially while I sleep.  I began getting very sick every time I would eat and became severely constipated regardless of how clean my diet was. I have never struggled with irregularities at all. My doc referred me to a gastro doc who diagnosed me with IBS and introduced me to the FODmap Diet. This diet cuts out fermenting foods to avoid bad gasses in the stomach. This helped but did not correct the constipation or fullness. To this day, everything I eat won't digest properly or break down. I eat no dairy, no gluten, very little sugar or starchy foods and only drink water. I even tried a 15-day colon cleanse vitamin and couldn't use the bathroom at all by day 4 and the cramps were unbearable. This year has been the worst. I now suffer with all of these things plus bladder and bowel issues and can't eat anything without getting sick. Within the past few weeks, my face ""contracts"" (tightens starting in my nose then intensifies over my whole face from my nose upward and subsides) and I can't put my head down too far without experiencing an electric shock sensation shooting down my neck to about the bottom of my shoulder blades. At random moments lately, my whole back tightens and I can't move until it subsides. It feels like an intense ""contraction"". I recently developed neuritis again. My continued menstrual problems led me to an appointment with my gynecologist. She did an ultrasound to find that my uterus is flipped and I have a fibroid tumor which is causing the anemia and heavy bleeding.

My name is Amber Stanley and my father was diagnosed with progressive MS when he was 30. He is now 55 and in a wheelchair. He can no longer walk. Today I noticed something really odd. My father was trying to pay a bill online and he wasn’t comprehending that the amount was 225$. He seemed very confused and I kept asking if he was ok, and he kept responding with the same answer “I can’t comprehend this”. He said his fingers wouldn’t let him type but I watched him type in the amount. My brother came in and my dad did the same thing. He seemed so confused and lost. I’m a little worried. Does MS sometimes have this affect? Is it something I should worry about if it continues? Thank you."

I'm not sure if it works but better than nothing. For the past year I have been getting muscle spasms in my left leg. I can now feel the spasms throughout my body which sort of catches my breath. I get them very frequently now. I saw my doctor yesterday and he prescribed a drug called BACLOFEN, 1/2 pill taken twice a day. I have taken two 1/2 pills so far. I haven't given them enough time to help but I feel really weak and can't concentrate on things. Yesterday I had a strong spasm in my right leg while I was driving into my driveway and couldn't take my leg off the accelerator. I crashed into my garage door and totaled it. Luckily I was going slow and didn't get hurt. I have been able to drive because I wasn't having spasms while I was sitting. I will not be driving again unless this BACLOFEN drug works. Has anyone taken this drug and had good results with spasms?"

My teeth were really messed up. The orthodontist fixed all my visible teeth, so when I smile, my teeth look good. But he didnt fix my back teeth. My back teeth on both sides curve in a lot to where my tongue barely has any space. Its always bothered me. A few days ago, I had a problem with the perminant retainer that I had put in when I was 18. While I was at the orthodontist ( a different ortho.. completely different state and I'm pretty sure my old ortho is no longer practicing), I asked him about how my back teeth curve in so much. Over the last 20 years. I've asked other orthodontist about it a few times and gotten different answers how it could be fixed. This orthodontist says he can fix it with braces. Now that I'm an adult, insurance wont cover it. Its going to be $6,000 to fix it. I keep thinking $6,000 to fix something that has bothered me my whole life isnt a big deal.  I guess what I'm wondering is how is it going to change my face profile if it works? My teeth in the back severely curve in to where my tongue has no room. I constantly bite my tongue eating. I don't chew gum for this reason. I'm hoping if my jaw is wider, my to tongue would have more room to move. I also have sleep apnea. I use a cpap to fix it, but maybe fixing my back teeth will give my tongue more room and relieve some of my sleep apnea issues.  But I guess I'm now wondering how my face is going to change. My jaw currently curves in on my back teeth then out (the opposite of what it's supposed to do.) If they fix it to have my jaw curve out, how will it change my face profile? I guess I'm self conscience of my underbite. My chin is too far back. As my teeth move straight, my jaw would move forward. But as they move my jaw so its curved out, maybe my chin will be in further than it is now. Also, does anyone know how my ortho is going to pull the teeth out? Dont understand how braces on my teeth are going to force my teeth and jaw to widen. Unless I'll have to wear head gear at night and that will pull my teeth out. I'll have to ask my ortho next time I see him. Maybe someone here knows."

The past year has been awful for me. This may be a long post because I haven't been able to really talk to anyone about this and how it is affecting me because when I first start to say something about it people usually shrug it off and say I am just tired or being lazy. With that said, here it goes. About 10 year ago, I started having difficulty dealing with cold. My hands started to turn really red. I just shrugged it off because I just thought that was a normal thing. This progressed through the years and now my fingers turn completely white, numb, and painful. I did find out this past February (after going to the dr for other symptoms) that I have Raynauds. I just want to say real quick here that I don't normally go to the doctor unless everything I try at home won't work. Three years ago, I had this black circle appear in my vision in my right eye. It was so annoying and lasted two and a half months. The eye had a bit of a yellowish tint to it and what appeared to be a raised area between the iris and the outer corner of my right eye. It also felt like there was something in it. After I freaked out, I called my eye doctor and went in to have it checked. He said he couldn't see anything out of the ordinary and sent me to a specialist. Same response from the specialist and was given eye drops for dry eyes. This went away after two and a half months. I didn't think much of it after that. This past year it has come back a few different times. By searching online I come to find out that it is called a stocoma. My current dr said that the reason the eye doctor and specialist couldn't find anything is because it is neurological. I kept getting sick easy about a year ago and was going to the dr about every three months for the cold, ear infection, and the flu. So my current dr sent me to a rheumatologist and they did some auto immune tests and they came back showing something was going on but still no diagnosis. I was sent home with a rx of vitamin d (which my current dr and I was unhappy with because my vitamin D levels were good). Then I woke up one morning in so much pain in my back last year the I couldn't even get out of bed. I was literally in tears. Had to call my mom to have her take the kids to school for me and come back and take me to the dr. I ended up at a neuro and spine surgeon and two MRIs and xrays later was told I have two degenerative discs (one in my tail bone and one in my neck). Then the nerve pain. I have had what feels like a needle prick in three different places on my head. This has been going on for a couple of years. It starts out as a quick needle prick and then spiderwebs out into a numbing sensation. These are quick and come and go. I have had constant numbness, tingling, and pain since about February of last year. This affects my arms, hands, feet, and legs. It affects my walking. I also have a constant pain going down from the top of my left thigh to the knee on the backside. Was sent for a nerve conduction and after the forth time she shocked me I told her I couldn't go through with it. It felt like sticking your finger in an electrical outlet. It was horrible! I am completely exhausted and tired all of the time. Sometimes to the point it will hit me so fast and all I can do is lay down. I also have insomnia and getting 4 hours of straight sleep is a good day. Then there is the cognitive issues. It started out as being a little forgetful. Sometimes I open the pantry door and find that I had put the milk in there or I open the fridge door and find the bag of sugar in there. I caught myself the other day in the act of putting my dirty dish in the fridge when I was actually going to put it in the dishwasher. This just happens every once in a while. If my kids have something going on like a dance performance they have to remind me everyday up until the day of. Even when it is written on the calendar I keep up in the dining room. I have speech issues. Sometimes I can't find the right word to use (even if it is a common one). I usually describe the item and add the word ""thingy"" after it. Like if I can't think of the word scissors I will say that little hand held cutting thingy. This happens a bit more often than I would like to admit. Some words I say have an extra letter in them that are not supposed to be there. The other day the letter z slipped in a word of one of my sentences. A few years ago, I told my daughter when she was finished eating lunch to through her paper plate in the garbage and her fork in the ""toaster"". I clearly meant the ""sink"". I even knew in my head I was going to say sink but to my surprise the word toaster rolled out of my mouth. When this started it was weird but we all thought it was kind of funny. Happened a few more times over the course of three weeks and then I was fine again. Now I struggle with my words throughout the day. My kids think it is still funny when I struggle to say something and I usually just shrug it off as normal for me now. I don't let them know that it really is frustrating to me. I was diagnosed with vertigo in February and am on Mecklezine now which it does help. I am also on Lyrica for nerve pain. I was on Gabapentin but it seemed to not work. I have been on Lyrica for three weeks now and can actually move more and it has helped so much with my nerve pain. I am truly thankful to have it right now. I also get a tight feeling around my lower rib cage that goes all the way around my back. It feels like a giant snake is wrapped around me and squeezes me so tight. Feels like my insides are being crushed into my spine. The worst one I had woke me up in the middle of the night I ended up in the fetal position in the middle of my bedroom floor in tears for two and a half hours. I get them here and there any time of day. But in the past year I have actually had them during work, which makes things extremely difficult. I also trip over nothing and have a hard time going up stairs. I have fallen three times in the past few years because my right leg from the knee down feels non-existent. There is a few more things but I am going to leave it at that for now. I just feel so frustrated because I have been dealing with the worst of this since last year. It is affecting my work and I have taken off so many days. I am sure they are thinking I am just lazy. I don't want to lose my job. It is a really good one and I worked so hard to get it. I even got a bachelor's degree so it would give me a leg up in the hiring process. But I am falling apart and the doctor's seem to take forever to tell me what is causing all of this. I need a diagnosis and proper paperwork to take into my boss so that they know what is going on. For now I just tell them that if I have to wait for a diagnosis so do they. Which, in all honesty, is not the best thing to say. Without the proper paper work I must look like a lazy person who is making up things. I just don't know where to go from here. I am supposed to be set up with a neurologist and have been waiting for a call from them for two weeks now. I am running out of money for dr's app and they need to figure out what is wrong fast."

This may be a long post because I haven't been able to really talk to anyone about this and how it is affecting me because when I first start to say something about it people usually shrug it off and say I am just tired or being lazy. With that said, here it goes. About 10 year ago, I started having difficulty dealing with cold. My hands started to turn really red. I just shrugged it off because I just thought that was a normal thing. This progressed through the years and now my fingers turn completely white, numb, and painful. I did find out this past February (after going to the dr for other symptoms) that I have Raynauds. I just want to say real quick here that I don't normally go to the doctor unless everything I try at home won't work. Three years ago, I had this black circle appear in my vision in my right eye. It was so annoying and lasted two and a half months. The eye had a bit of a yellowish tint to it and what appeared to be a raised area between the iris and the outer corner of my right eye. It also felt like there was something in it. After I freaked out, I called my eye doctor and went in to have it checked. He said he couldn't see anything out of the ordinary and sent me to a specialist. Same response from the specialist and was given eye drops for dry eyes. This went away after two and a half months. I didn't think much of it after that. This past year it has come back a few different times. By searching online I come to find out that it is called a stocoma. My current dr said that the reason the eye doctor and specialist couldn't find anything is because it is neurological. I kept getting sick easy about a year ago and was going to the dr about every three months for the cold, ear infection, and the flu. So my current dr sent me to a rheumatologist and they did some auto immune tests and they came back showing something was going on but still no diagnosis. I was sent home with a rx of vitamin d (which my current dr and I was unhappy with because my vitamin D levels were good). Then I woke up one morning in so much pain in my back last year the I couldn't even get out of bed. I was literally in tears. Had to call my mom to have her take the kids to school for me and come back and take me to the dr. I ended up at a neuro and spine surgeon and two MRIs and xrays later was told I have two degenerative discs (one in my tail bone and one in my neck). Then the nerve pain.

I caught myself the other day in the act of putting my dirty dish in the fridge when I was actually going to put it in the dishwasher. This just happens every once in a while. If my kids have something going on like a dance performance they have to remind me everyday up until the day of. Even when it is written on the calendar I keep up in the dining room. I have speech issues. Sometimes I can't find the right word to use (even if it is a common one). I usually describe the item and add the word ""thingy"" after it. Like if I can't think of the word scissors I will say that little hand held cutting thingy. This happens a bit more often than I would like to admit. Some words I say have an extra letter in them that are not supposed to be there. The other day the letter z slipped in a word of one of my sentences. A few years ago, I told my daughter when she was finished eating lunch to through her paper plate in the garbage and her fork in the ""toaster"". I clearly meant the ""sink"". I even knew in my head I was going to say sink but to my surprise the word toaster rolled out of my mouth. When this started it was weird but we all thought it was kind of funny. Happened a few more times over the course of three weeks and then I was fine again. Now I struggle with my words throughout the day. My kids think it is still funny when I struggle to say something and I usually just shrug it off as normal for me now. I don't let them know that it really is frustrating to me. I was diagnosed with vertigo in February and am on Mecklezine now which it does help. I am also on Lyrica for nerve pain. I was on Gabapentin but it seemed to not work. I have been on Lyrica for three weeks now and can actually move more and it has helped so much with my nerve pain. I am truly thankful to have it right now. I also get a tight feeling around my lower rib cage that goes all the way around my back. It feels like a giant snake is wrapped around me and squeezes me so tight. Feels like my insides are being crushed into my spine. The worst one I had woke me up in the middle of the night I ended up in the fetal position in the middle of my bedroom floor in tears for two and a half hours. I get them here and there any time of day. But in the past year I have actually had them during work, which makes things extremely difficult. I also trip over nothing and have a hard time going up stairs. I have fallen three times in the past few years because my right leg from the knee down feels non-existent. There is a few more things but I am going to leave it at that for now. I just feel so frustrated because I have been dealing with the worst of this since last year. It is affecting my work and I have taken off so many days. I am sure they are thinking I am just lazy. I don't want to lose my job. It is a really good one and I worked so hard to get it. I even got a bachelor's degree so it would give me a leg up in the hiring process. But I am falling apart and the doctor's seem to take forever to tell me what is causing all of this. I need a diagnosis and proper paperwork to take into my boss so that they know what is going on. For now I just tell them that if I have to wait for a diagnosis so do they. Which, in all honesty, is not the best thing to say. Without the proper paper work I must look like a lazy person who is making up things. I just don't know where to go from here. I am supposed to be set up with a neurologist and have been waiting for a call from them for two weeks now. I am running out of money for dr's app and they need to figure out what is wrong fast."

The past year has been awful for me. This may be a long post because I haven't been able to really talk to anyone about this and how it is affecting me because when I first start to say something about it people usually shrug it off and say I am just tired or being lazy. With that said, here it goes. About 10 year ago, I started having difficulty dealing with cold. My hands started to turn really red. I just shrugged it off because I just thought that was a normal thing. This progressed through the years and now my fingers turn completely white, numb, and painful. I did find out this past February (after going to the dr for other symptoms) that I have Raynauds. I just want to say real quick here that I don't normally go to the doctor unless everything I try at home won't work. Three years ago, I had this black circle appear in my vision in my right eye. It was so annoying and lasted two and a half months. The eye had a bit of a yellowish tint to it and what appeared to be a raised area between the iris and the outer corner of my right eye. It also felt like there was something in it. After I freaked out, I called my eye doctor and went in to have it checked. He said he couldn't see anything out of the ordinary and sent me to a specialist. Same response from the specialist and was given eye drops for dry eyes. This went away after two and a half months. I didn't think much of it after that. This past year it has come back a few different times. By searching online I come to find out that it is called a stocoma. My current dr said that the reason the eye doctor and specialist couldn't find anything is because it is neurological. I kept getting sick easy about a year ago and was going to the dr about every three months for the cold, ear infection, and the flu. So my current dr sent me to a rheumatologist and they did some auto immune tests and they came back showing something was going on but still no diagnosis. I was sent home with a rx of vitamin d (which my current dr and I was unhappy with because my vitamin D levels were good). Then I woke up one morning in so much pain in my back last year the I couldn't even get out of bed. I was literally in tears. Had to call my mom to have her take the kids to school for me and come back and take me to the dr. I ended up at a neuro and spine surgeon and two MRIs and xrays later was told I have two degenerative discs (one in my tail bone and one in my neck). Then the nerve pain. I have had what feels like a needle prick in three different places on my head. This has been going on for a couple of years. It starts out as a quick needle prick and then spiderwebs out into a numbing sensation. These are quick and come and go. I have had constant numbness, tingling, and pain since about February of last year. This affects my arms, hands, feet, and legs. It affects my walking. I also have a constant pain going down from the top of my left thigh to the knee on the backside. Was sent for a nerve conduction and after the forth time she shocked me I told her I couldn't go through with it. It felt like sticking your finger in an electrical outlet. It was horrible! I am completely exhausted and tired all of the time. Sometimes to the point it will hit me so fast and all I can do is lay down.

Some words I say have an extra letter in them that are not supposed to be there. The other day the letter z slipped in a word of one of my sentences. A few years ago, I told my daughter when she was finished eating lunch to through her paper plate in the garbage and her fork in the ""toaster"". I clearly meant the ""sink"". I even knew in my head I was going to say sink but to my surprise the word toaster rolled out of my mouth. When this started it was weird but we all thought it was kind of funny. Happened a few more times over the course of three weeks and then I was fine again. Now I struggle with my words throughout the day. My kids think it is still funny when I struggle to say something and I usually just shrug it off as normal for me now. I don't let them know that it really is frustrating to me. I was diagnosed with vertigo in February and am on Mecklezine now which it does help. I am also on Lyrica for nerve pain. I was on Gabapentin but it seemed to not work. I have been on Lyrica for three weeks now and can actually move more and it has helped so much with my nerve pain. I am truly thankful to have it right now. I also get a tight feeling around my lower rib cage that goes all the way around my back. It feels like a giant snake is wrapped around me and squeezes me so tight. Feels like my insides are being crushed into my spine. The worst one I had woke me up in the middle of the night I ended up in the fetal position in the middle of my bedroom floor in tears for two and a half hours. I get them here and there any time of day. But in the past year I have actually had them during work, which makes things extremely difficult. I also trip over nothing and have a hard time going up stairs. I have fallen three times in the past few years because my right leg from the knee down feels non-existent. There is a few more things but I am going to leave it at that for now. I just feel so frustrated because I have been dealing with the worst of this since last year. It is affecting my work and I have taken off so many days. I am sure they are thinking I am just lazy. I don't want to lose my job. It is a really good one and I worked so hard to get it. I even got a bachelor's degree so it would give me a leg up in the hiring process. But I am falling apart and the doctor's seem to take forever to tell me what is causing all of this. I need a diagnosis and proper paperwork to take into my boss so that they know what is going on. For now I just tell them that if I have to wait for a diagnosis so do they. Which, in all honesty, is not the best thing to say. Without the proper paper work I must look like a lazy person who is making up things. I just don't know where to go from here. I am supposed to be set up with a neurologist and have been waiting for a call from them for two weeks now. I am running out of money for dr's app and they need to figure out what is wrong fast."

My regular doctor of many many yrs has retired and I have been feeling like so bullied taking 2 ultrams a day from 4 doctors. Even my primary care that I have been seeing for over a year is telling me the ultram has to go. She also made me give up the few vicodins I got a month when pain broke through. With all this frustration, I now have anxiety. So those meds have also been manipulated away from me. They did piss tests me on for over a year and NO, i am not an addict. So what is working for people who have MS pains plus I have fibromyalgia. I had to go around my doctor, trying to find another doctor and she at last referred me to pain clinic. However, she would not take me on as new patient due to being prescribed ultrams. What is going on?? anybody got a clue. I don't do well with smoking pot. My doctor wants to put me down a rigorous mental medications treatments, and I am so allergic to any anti depressant they have tried me on for the past 20 yrs. I am not chemically depressed, but the anxiety is there at times, but my guess I am feeling bullied and my stability is at risk, which I believe in return, may put me in a tail spin of the MS> I am on no meds, I walk and fight this disease, but feel like I am losing the battle with finding a descent doctor. Even my neurologist is saying well, pain pills are the number 1 problem of opioids in this country. Well, some of us survive on a few pills a day to have a quality of life. Why punish us all that have known issues and quite documented. Any suggestions??"

I have not been diagnosed with MS and don't have a family history that I am aware of. However, I seem to have most of the symptoms associated with the disease. My memory is horrible; I can forget what a topic of a conversation was after a small pause and will often forget why I was trying to figure out something in my head, for example this morning I was trying to figure out how much I get paid per day at my job and as soon as I had the simple equation in my mind I forgot why I was doing the math. I remembered after something else slipped my mind in the same way, which I can't remember what it was. I have the worst insomnia. I get tired quickly through physical activity. Taking a shower often takes all the energy out of me and I have to force myself to finish tasks if I have multiple to accomplish. Once I'm done I will be down for the rest of the day. If I get hot I almost immediately feel dizzy and nauseated. I have a headache every day. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and take medication for those. My balance is not the best. I often trip on flat ground because I just don't lift my foot high enough. Along with that I am very clumsy. I run into door jams or tables, as well as other things, because I misjudge the space I have to go between or how sharp of a turn to make. I easily drop things for no reason. My legs easily move when I need to walk and I have no issues moving body parts when I need to. My vision is bad and I wear prescription glasses, although I have had this problem since I was in my teens and most of my relatives also wear glasses. My prescription does get slightly worse every year, however. I will not realize that my, (often left leg/foot) is asleep until after I try to walk on it. My balance is bad, especially when attempting to exercise. (I will lose balance while doing squats despite having arms stretched out and a straight back after 10 or so, for example.) Yoga is very hard solely due to balance. My strength and flexibility is improving through yoga but my balance is where it was day 1. I have a couple things I am not sure are associated but I wonder if could be: I don't have any numbness in my limbs or extremities other than the falling asleep thing described above. However, I have a weird numbing sensation in my back on the left in a very specific location, which sort of feels like a tingling sensation from like a light fabric being repeatedly brushed over the area. Quite a few months ago I had the same sensation on the right side. The last thing I am experiencing has to do with my bladder. I don't have incontinence or accidents. I actually have the opposite problem , I will unequivocally have a full bladder and as soon as I sit on the toilet, I am unable to go. It takes several minutes and when I do, the stream is weak and I have to use all the strength I have to squeeze the urine out of my bladder. During the time I am urinating if I try to just let it flow, I will stop. This is more likely to happen after I have been holding it, or don't have fluids in my system to help ease it along, such as in the middle of the night or first thing in the morning. During the day, as I drink water throughout the day, I easily go, frequently. I'm talking every 30 minutes to an hour for the first half of my day, even if I am just sipping the water. I understand that that, as well as many of the symptoms I described can be associated with many things. I just want to know if the problems with the numbness in my back and emptying my bladder could be associated with MS along with everything else I described. How should I approach my doctor with these symptoms and my suspicions?

Around April last year (2018) so started to get a few symptoms of sciatica and some numbness of the outside of my left foot. I saw my doctor and had a scan. It's showed a small protrusion, and bone spurs. I was referred back to my neurosurgeon and whilst waiting I started to lose the function of my left foot.  When I arrived to see my Neurosurgeon, he admitted me straight away for further testing.  I had nerve conduction study which showed damage/not a lot of capacity and some radiculopathy of course. But Neurology and neurosurgery said that the protrusion didn't explain the loss of function in that area and that my reflex was diminished but they would operate again. So last year around October, I had surgery again to fix the protrusion (l5.s1) as that was the only possibility causing the numbness and reduced function... or so we thought.

Weak grip, short headaches, visual problems when I stare at the floor, pain in my back when I put my chin to my chest, and a heap of memory issues (I had electroconvulsive therapy for depression about 4 months before my leg symptoms started and we had attributed the memory loss to this)  And twitching muscles every day.

Around April last year (2018) so started to get a few symptoms of sciatica and some numbness of the outside of my left foot. I saw my doctor and had a scan. It's showed a small protrusion, and bone spurs. I was referred back to my neurosurgeon and whilst waiting I started to lose the function of my left foot.  When I arrived to see my Neurosurgeon, he admitted me straight away for further testing.  I had nerve conduction study which showed damage/not a lot of capacity and some radiculopathy of course. But Neurology and neurosurgery said that the protrusion didn't explain the loss of function in that area and that my reflex was diminished but they would operate again. So last year around October, I had surgery again to fix the protrusion (l5.s1) as that was the only possibility causing the numbness and reduced function... or so we thought.  Moving on, after the surgery... I seemed to just slowly get worse. The numbness has spread to my knee now, only leaving the inside of my leg with some feeling.  My Achilles reflex is completely absent, and I have a dropped foot and issues controlling my leg. I returned back to my Neurosurgeon after 6 weeks and he said my lumbar MRI looked normal now and he couldn't understand why my function wasn't improving. He said he was sorry and that he thinks I may have a neurological disorder, or possibly a single tumor causing the problems. We went through some other symptoms that I've had (you know... Those ones that come and go that you don't usually link together) such as numbness in one finger, Numbness at the back of my arm. Weak grip, short headaches, visual problems when I stare at the floor, pain in my back when I put my chin to my chest, and a heap of memory issues (I had electroconvulsive therapy for depression about 4 months before my leg symptoms started and we had attributed the memory loss to this)  And twitching muscles every day. The surgeon just threw MS om the table... I am just confused as surely if I had MS, the surgeon would at least be able to see lesions in the lumbar part of my spine (where I have had a few MRIs) If they are just in my brain, would that cause the leg problems? Can they be microscopic and cause problems? I didn't get to ask questions as I took up so much time, and had to leave.

While riding my Bmx bike I flipped it a few times over the handle bars landing on my chest . Fast forward 6 days .....I was couldn't catch my breath for an hour and a half so I went to the hospital . upon a few tests they said that I was suffering from a pulmonary embolism in my left lung . During the x-ray the Dr. stated that I had a shadow in my right lung and wanted to take me for a biopsy the following day . As they did the biopsy (with my left lung having 1000ml of fluid ) the Dr. clipped and artery in my right lung and I spit tons of blood up . After a while I had woke up not knowing what happened . No body told me that I passed away and they had to resuscitate a few times . I was not made aware of this until I was home .  My question is , should they have done the biopsy on my right lung even though my left was full of fluid ?  I'm no Dr. but how would I be able to breath if both lungs are full of liquid ? Is this common ?"

They admitted me into hospital straight away suspecting meningitis. I was put on meds and given a cortisone injection. The symptoms were better but the headache did not go away for a couple of days. The doctors did a Lumbar Puncture and the results showed a high white blood cell count but it was just below what was required for meningitis. After 2 weeks I was pretty much back to normal and didn't think about it again. In 2017 I then started getting tonsilitis once a month for about a year and eventually they removed my tonsils. (I'm not sure if this in anyway related). After the tonsil removal I have felt constantly tired and this has not stopped. In September 2018 I got a severe headache again as well as a sensitivity to light (The sensitivity was not as severe this time but the headache was just as bad). The headache stayed for 3 days and then I started getting fever sweats and chills alternatively. I went to the doctor and tick bite fever was suspected, I was put on antibiotics and seemed to be a bit better but still had fatigue. A couple of days later my pinky and ring finger on my right hand started tingling and this worsened so I went back to the doctor and they said I had tennis elbow so put me on anti-inflammatories. A week or so later the tinglign worsened and moved to both my hands (all fingers) and my feet (all toes). I also started shaking severly throughout my entire body. A couple of days later, one side of my face went numb and I could not raise my one eyebrow or move my mouth on that side. The face paralysis only lasted 3 days. I also had very stiff muscles. I went to the doctor and they referred me to the physio. The physio refused treatment and sent me to the neurologist. The neurologist did a full blood count, lumbar puncture, MRI, a nerve conduction stud and an EEG. The only results outside of normal ranges were the inflammation markers in the blood tests, the white blood cell count was only slightly above normal and the nerve conduction study picked up an irregularity between my elbow and hand on my right hand. The neurologists suspects Multiple Sclerosis and is going to retest in a years time. In December 2018 I then went to a homeopath who put me on a high dosage of magnesium as well as a variety of other vitamins. This subtantially helped all the symptons. The numbness and shaking is almost completely gone now and only comes back very occassionally. I have not been taking any tablets for a couple of months now and feel ok. The only thing that I still battle with is the muscle stiffness and the fatigue. I have also noticed a significant increase in visability of my veins since December 2018 and this is worsening over time (not sure if this is relevant). Can anyone help me with a diagnosis and treatment?"

Read this.","I felt compelled to write this a year and a half after first experiencing neurological issues because #1, it seems that a lot of folks who have similar undiagnosed conditions simply ""disappear"" online (hopefully that means they've gotten better), and #2, I am still alive after a year and a half, so my goal is to give hope to anyone who is experiencing similar symptoms and have not had any luck with a diagnosis.  First things first. If you have not seen any neurologists, stop reading now and don't do any more research until that appointment. Otherwise, you will go through torturous anxiety and sleepless nights as you try to self-diagnose and likely settle on the worst-case scenario. My post is for those who have had all of the tests done and seen multiple doctors and still have no diagnosis.  My two biggest, longest lasting symptoms were (and occasionally still are) numbness and muscle twitching. It started off as numbness in my left toe, slowly progressing to my left foot, left leg, left arm, left side of the face and even the entire head at times (rarely all at once though). I started getting it in the right side of my body occasionally, but there it typically stayed in my right fingertips. The twitching also appeared in various parts of the body, but really chose to settle in my right arm between my triceps and elbow. It twitched nearly nonstop, 24/7 for 4-5 months straight. While these were the longest lasting symptoms, I encountered a TON of other symptoms. While concerning, these didn’t last months like the numbness and twitching. I will include that list below my signature.  During about a year’s time, I had 2 MRIs on my brain and neck, two different EMGs on both sides of the body, strength tests, probably a dozen or so various blood tests, and an EKG. Everything came back clean. I saw 2 different neurologists and 2 different general doctors. None of them could piece anything together. One of my neurologists wouldn't even look at my twitching arm. “If you can do a push up, sit up, and squat, you don't have ALS,” he assured me. So while every doctor failed to come up with what was going on, none of them seemed overly concerned. In a way, it is a relief to know your doctors aren’t concerned. On the other hand, if they don’t know what it is, then how do they know it’s not fatal?! Before I move on to what finally “cured” me, I need to pause and say… trust your doctors, esp. if they are all saying the same thing. Spending a few hours or even a few days researching WebMD, message boards, etc., does not put us on the same standing as neurologists who have spent YEARS studying these conditions. You have to trust them and have a little faith, esp. if they are saying you are OK. I also know that none of what I’m saying is truly going to convince you that you might not have a terrible disease - I wasn't able to be convinced at first either. They only thing you can truly do is wait it out.  OK, the good stuff. By a fluke chance, I shared my issues and concerns with a co-worker, who suggested that I see a particular doctor in Houston who has a knack for diagnosing things that other doctors can’t. I didn’t get my hopes up but decided to go see him anyway. He took a look at all of my test results over the past year, sent me for a couple more random blood tests, which came back clean, and then told me that he has seen what I have before. It doesn’t even have a name yet! It is a virus and has a transient nature, which explains why the symptoms manifest in different ways and in different places. Furthermore, it is going to take a couple of more years to fully get it out of my system. Annoying? Yes! But at least he gave me hope, which is something I couldn’t get anywhere else. He told me that it’s hard to do, but if I could find a way to laugh with the twitching, to do so (I know, that is impossible), because while with some diseases, twitching is a bad thing, in this case, it is a good thing and is my body’s way of rewiring itself so to speak. So, I’m still not filling confident at this point, but he said he wants to start me on prescription grade magnesium (Mag Oxide, 400 mg), and that if that doesn’t help with the twitching, that he had a less conventional idea. Well, to my surprise, one or two days after taking the magnesium, the twitching stopped almost completely! Mind you, none of my previous tests showed any sort of magnesium deficiency. As a side note, I will still get random twitches every now and then, but they are usually short-lived and nothing more than just a few seconds. But the nonstop twitching has been gone for probably 8 months or so. (I still wonder what his other idea would have been if the magnesium wouldn’t have worked!) So anyway, if you are in the same boat as I am/was, not finding any results and all of your tests coming back clean, ask your doctor if he can try you on a high dosage of magnesium. You certainly don’t have anything to lose.  I want to end this with some self-reflection that has come out of this ordeal with me. This was an extremely scary season for me and forced me to ask some tough questions about life and what really matters. What I learned was whether I have a neurological disease now or not, the fact remains that at some point, I AM going to die. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter if that happens while I am young, middle-aged, or old... the same fate awaits us all. Depressing, yes, but true nonetheless. If you are battling an unknown condition and have extreme anxiety and fear, my advice is to take this time and current health scare to settle the score now. Are you religious? Find out what you truly believe and hopefully this strengthens your faith in the end. Religious or not, try to find beauty in the day to day and focus each day on what truly matters. If and when you come out of this ordeal, be it a year or longer, come back and share your story with others to give them hope. And please don't forget those who truly are suffering with serious diseases such as ALS. Pray for them, encourage them, donate to ALS research, volunteer your time, etc. All the vows you made and said you'd do if only you didn't have the fatal disease? Do them. With whatever time you have left, love God and love others and leave the world a better place. Good luck! DC Other symptoms besides numbness and muscle twitching: Long lasting: High blood pressure; rash in left armpit that lasted months but eventually went away; Left leg tingly, almost like an internal vibration; Psychological issues (Anxiety, Stress, Detached feeling, Overwhelmed, Fear)   Shorter lived: Sensation of lump in my throat, slow swallowing, sometimes with a dull pain that came and went; Muscle and joint pain (shoulders, calves, right arm, muscle near thumb on right hand, finger joints); Waking up with right little and ring fingers completely numb; Electric jolt-like feeling in right side of neck; Loss of appetite and weight loss; Insomnia; Fatigue; Palpitations; Light headed; Stammering for words; Neck pain; Chest pains"

Read this.","I felt compelled to write this a year and a half after first experiencing neurological issues because #1, it seems that a lot of folks who have similar undiagnosed conditions simply ""disappear"" online (hopefully that means they've gotten better), and #2, I am still alive after a year and a half, so my goal is to give hope to anyone who is experiencing similar symptoms and have not had any luck with a diagnosis.  First things first. If you have not seen any neurologists, stop reading now and don't do any more research until that appointment. Otherwise, you will go through torturous anxiety and sleepless nights as you try to self-diagnose and likely settle on the worst-case scenario. My post is for those who have had all of the tests done and seen multiple doctors and still have no diagnosis.  My two biggest, longest lasting symptoms were (and occasionally still are) numbness and muscle twitching. It started off as numbness in my left toe, slowly progressing to my left foot, left leg, left arm, left side of the face and even the entire head at times (rarely all at once though). I started getting it in the right side of my body occasionally, but there it typically stayed in my right fingertips. The twitching also appeared in various parts of the body, but really chose to settle in my right arm between my triceps and elbow. It twitched nearly nonstop, 24/7 for 4-5 months straight. While these were the longest lasting symptoms, I encountered a TON of other symptoms. While concerning, these didn’t last months like the numbness and twitching. I will include that list below my signature.  During about a year’s time, I had 2 MRIs on my brain and neck, two different EMGs on both sides of the body, strength tests, probably a dozen or so various blood tests, and an EKG. Everything came back clean. I saw 2 different neurologists and 2 different general doctors. None of them could piece anything together. One of my neurologists wouldn't even look at my twitching arm. “If you can do a push up, sit up, and squat, you don't have ALS,” he assured me. So while every doctor failed to come up with what was going on, none of them seemed overly concerned. In a way, it is a relief to know your doctors aren’t concerned. On the other hand, if they don’t know what it is, then how do they know it’s not fatal?! Before I move on to what finally “cured” me, I need to pause and say… trust your doctors, esp. if they are all saying the same thing. Spending a few hours or even a few days researching WebMD, message boards, etc., does not put us on the same standing as neurologists who have spent YEARS studying these conditions. You have to trust them and have a little faith, esp. if they are saying you are OK. I also know that none of what I’m saying is truly going to convince you that you might not have a terrible disease - I wasn't able to be convinced at first either. They only thing you can truly do is wait it out.  OK, the good stuff. By a fluke chance, I shared my issues and concerns with a co-worker, who suggested that I see a particular doctor in Houston who has a knack for diagnosing things that other doctors can’t. I didn’t get my hopes up but decided to go see him anyway. He took a look at all of my test results over the past year, sent me for a couple more random blood tests, which came back clean, and then told me that he has seen what I have before. It doesn’t even have a name yet! It is a virus and has a transient nature, which explains why the symptoms manifest in different ways and in different places. Furthermore, it is going to take a couple of more years to fully get it out of my system. Annoying? Yes! But at least he gave me hope, which is something I couldn’t get anywhere else. He told me that it’s hard to do, but if I could find a way to laugh with the twitching, to do so (I know, that is impossible), because while with some diseases, twitching is a bad thing, in this case, it is a good thing and is my body’s way of rewiring itself so to speak. So, I’m still not filling confident at this point, but he said he wants to start me on prescription grade magnesium (Mag Oxide, 400 mg), and that if that doesn’t help with the twitching, that he had a less conventional idea. Well, to my surprise, one or two days after taking the magnesium, the twitching stopped almost completely! Mind you, none of my previous tests showed any sort of magnesium deficiency. As a side note, I will still get random twitches every now and then, but they are usually short-lived and nothing more than just a few seconds. But the nonstop twitching has been gone for probably 8 months or so. (I still wonder what his other idea would have been if the magnesium wouldn’t have worked!) So anyway, if you are in the same boat as I am/was, not finding any results and all of your tests coming back clean, ask your doctor if he can try you on a high dosage of magnesium. You certainly don’t have anything to lose.  I want to end this with some self-reflection that has come out of this ordeal with me. This was an extremely scary season for me and forced me to ask some tough questions about life and what really matters. What I learned was whether I have a neurological disease now or not, the fact remains that at some point, I AM going to die. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter if that happens while I am young, middle-aged, or old... the same fate awaits us all. Depressing, yes, but true nonetheless. If you are battling an unknown condition and have extreme anxiety and fear, my advice is to take this time and current health scare to settle the score now. Are you religious? Find out what you truly believe and hopefully this strengthens your faith in the end. Religious or not, try to find beauty in the day to day and focus each day on what truly matters. If and when you come out of this ordeal, be it a year or longer, come back and share your story with others to give them hope. And please don't forget those who truly are suffering with serious diseases such as ALS. Pray for them, encourage them, donate to ALS research, volunteer your time, etc. All the vows you made and said you'd do if only you didn't have the fatal disease? Do them. With whatever time you have left, love God and love others and leave the world a better place. Good luck!
