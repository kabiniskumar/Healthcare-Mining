Thinking nothing of it, I went to work and figured it was just an ear infection. About an hour into work the pain shot down into my neck and became unbearable and I almost passed out from dizziness. I was taken to our medical clinic where they required me to go get cat scans of my head, ears, and neck done. There were no abnormalities in the results per my ENT and the cat scan evaluators. I also had two hearing tests done which showed I had become partially deaf in my left ear and it is highly sensitive to high pitches and high frequency noise as well. No doctor could find an answer for my issues. After about two months the pain and dizziness subsided.  In the last two weeks the pain in my ear and neck have come back full force, and I am not sure what to do. My ENT has no answers, and no one seems to no where to go with this.  Any suggestions?"

My throat would also get infected probably from post-nasal drips, my mouth will have painful mouth ulcer, usually just one and on some occasions, my lymph node will swell.

I am new to these boards and come seeking advice. I have a close friend who is narcoleptic. He has been so for many years now. Throughout these many years he has tried many different medications, all have worked to some extent or another BUT all have ended up making him sick. Why? This is because he has a rare allergy to an ingredient that is found in a lot of common pill-form medicines. The exact name escapes me at this moment but I think it's something along the lines of Titanium Dioxide. These medications always end up getting him bladder infections.  Just in the last year he was suggested Xyrem by doctor, and as far as I know, it did help him to control his sleeping and he got better for a short period of time, however ... after a couple of months this medicine ended up getting him horribly depressed (part of the known side effects I am guessing) and he has actually had to go on anti-depressants. Unfortunately, the anti-depressants have had minimal effect in out-weighing the Xyrem. He has been struggling for the better part of the last 6 or 7 months with his narcolepsy, Xyrem and his anti-depressants. Nothing seems to work for him and he cannot seem to break himself from the funk he is currently in. The drugs together seem to be turning him into a zombie. As far as I know, he's already seen a couple of different doctors regarding the situation, but I have no idea how those visits have gone. I am fearful for his mental health at this point and am wondering if anyone else has any experience with a situation like this?  Does anyone know any good specialists in the surrounding Columbus OH area? Any kind of vitamin or diet techniques that might help?  Any kind of advice, suggestions, or feedback would be helpful.

It helped some but left me with large amounts of fatigue in the mornings not being able to focus with my work. This year has been different because now I have been using cannabis oil to manage my anxiety, depression, and sleep. What I like the most about using cannabis is that I have control over how much I am ingesting and the side effects are nothing compared to what I was experiencing with prescriptions. THC and CBD have unique healing effects on my body and I take both twice a day. Micro dosing cannabis oil is more effective in my opinion as it lasts longer and I can bypass the euphoric feeling by ingesting small amounts of THC.

It has been going on for at least 8 years and it's long overdue to finally do something about it. I constantly have phlegm in the back of my throat and it makes me uncomfortable. It's colorless. Whenever I spit it out or swallow it, it comes back in the matter of seconds. Naturally, it's the worst in the morning, when after a whole night I might spend a good 2 or 3 minutes just clearing my throat. Sometimes it hurts a bit when I speak for a longer period of time (it's not very painful but irritating). I need to use my voice as a public speaker. I always used to speak very clearly but now I’ve noticed that I have to make a conscious effort to pronounce my words correctly, because sometimes the nasal sounds come out somewhat “blurry”. Also it seems that there is too much saliva in my mouth. It’s not particularly noticeable when I’m not speaking, but when I do, I have to swallow more often then I used to.  I have to blow my nose every few hours, especially in the morning. Everyday for the last few years I wake up with a stuffy nose. During the day it’s not a big issue but it’s still there. Even after I blow my nose I feel that I’m not breathing absolutely clearly. I’m not suffocating or anything, but I know that it’s not right. My nostrils feel heavy and tight, and the inhaled air dry and stiff.  I should mention that I do suffer from seasonal allergies that intensify in the Summer, although I didn’t have them at all until 5 years ago (they came a few years after the phlegm). I do not take any prescribed medication for the allergies except some universal anti-allergy pills that you can get from your local drugstore (and they don’t work at all) and an asthma inhaler.  I’m in a good physical shape, I play sports from time to time. I don’t smoke, rarely drink. My diet is probably not the best. I’m not fat but sometimes I forget to eat vegetables and stuff.  Based on all of this, could you tell me what do you think about my condition? I would prefer to try some natural remedy first and see if it works, before I take prescription meds.  Thanks"

Been getting on/off isolated symptom since earlier this year. Otherwise in pretty good shape(health wise, I don’t exercising). My left ear will get bright red and warm, but never any pain or swelling. It encapsulates my entire left hand ear, save it for a small portion of my lobe. It always happens at night (after 7pm). It’s happened about 10 times: 5-6 times between March-April, and 3 times this past month. Each episode will last about 2 hours. I am constantly touching my left ear but it has happened without me touching it. It began during very stressful time at work with a toxic work environment with an abusive manager, and for the most part resolved entirely once she left. It started recently again after I began panicking about my ear possibly becoming red again, though I have noticed anxiety does not always accompany my red ear. I have an ENT appointment coming up in about a month, what should I bring up/tests should I ask for, and is this serious?"

For about 7 months now I have felt like there is something stuck in my throat. I am constantly clearing my throat, and when I do, the feeling goes away briefly, but returns minutes later. Some days are worse than others, but when I clear my throat there is definitely mucus in the back of it. It seems like post-nasal drip, BUT it gets worse with certain foods/drinks, such as caffeine, carbination. I have a history of acid reflux, and have been on and off antacids, but that has't helped the clogged throat at all.  I went to an ENT about 5 months ago. She did a nasal endoscopy and said everything looked fine (I had slightly excessive mucus, but nothing concerning). So she orginially thought it could be allergies. She gave me a prescription nasal spray and recommended coupling it with an over-the-counter saline spray and Allegra. I did that for about a month and didn't notice a significant difference. My throat still felt clogged nonstop.  *** I want to note that there is no pain, just EXTREME discomfort as I am feeling like a lump is in the back of my throat 24/7. So after the attempt at solving the problem with allergy medication did not work, she thought it might be the acid reflux creeping into my esophagus. She prescribed me Omerprazole, which I took for about a month or so, and still noticed no difference. The final measure I took with this ENT doctor, was a wallow scan. She sent me to a lab where I had an x-ray while I swallowed a liquid (apologies for the non-technical language). Essentially, this test would show what was happening when I swallow, i.e. is it going down and back up my throat, is it getting stuck somewhere, etc. The results came back and they said it was completely normal... stale mate. She then referred me to a gastroenterologist. He unfortunately was of no help. He basically said that this issue needs to be resolved by an ENT because the upper throat is not in ""his area."" He also said that the sensation I have in my throat may just be in my head. Not helpful and not true. He said I could take an antihistamine and that might help.  Anyway, I haven't been to another doctor yet, but I have scheduled an appointment with a new ENT next week. I just figured it would be worthwhile to post this and see if anyone has any insights or thoughts to share.  Quick breakdown of what I am experiencing:  - 24/7 feeling that something is stuck in my throat / tightness - Constant throat clearing - Heightened symptoms after drinking caffeine or carbonation - Mucus in back of throat"

I do feel a little bump when I push around which does hurt alot and then after I find the little bump the pain increases size and will persistently hurt for about an hour or so.

Not sure if it was caused by water seeping in after getting a hair cut and wash or if it was related to my ongoing sore throat and nasal congestion. I tried all the rudimentary things to relieve the pressure to no avail. When i would lean my head back, the pressure was gone. Leaning forward or straight, pressure was back. Last night i tried pinching my nostrils and breathing out. The right ear just would not pop, so i pushed harder and it finally gave way. This morning i felt the pressure was back, fiddled around in my ear with my finger and noticed some dry blood. Then i proceeded to remove it with my finger which cause new blood. After drying it up and hour later, i tried pinching my nose and blowing. I could hear it working, but it was almost as if there was something in the way and the air could pass through easily. Next thing i new my ear was bleeding again. After drying it up, my right ear is completely blocked and leaning backward doesn't even relieve it. What steps should i take to resolving this issue? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

I have an extremely pressure-like feeling in my head, as well as the kind of dizziness that feels like I'm drunk or in a boat, all of the time. Mostly, the dizziness is a feeling, but sometimes - especially recently - it is accompanied by a visual shaking, which I have noticed is usually in time with my heart beat. Around when this started, I have also suffered hearing loss and tinnitus. I have been diagnosed with several ear infections since about a year ago, the first one around this time last year, and the most recent about two months ago. I have, however, been to an ear doctor, and he said he could see nothing wrong with my ears. He did a hearing test on me, and I apparently didn't do well - I have hearing loss in my right ear in low frequencies. My ears hurt most of the time, and there is often clear fluid coming out of them, even when I have no ear infection. Mostly the pain is as if a sharp icicle has been jabbed into my ear, and mostly only my right ear, but I also feel bad pressure in both. I often close my hands tightly over them in an attempt to make the pressure stop. It rarely works at all but it's the only thing I can do. Sound often comes through ""fuzzy"", and my ears do an odd, vibrating/clenching thing in response to sound. My eyesight has been getting worse. I got glasses about a year ago, and by March this year they were no longer good enough - better than with no glasses, but still not good. It has only gotten even worse since March, I used to only have poor long distance vision only last year - now I have to squint or even put my glasses on just to use my phone. My blood pressure often goes too high or too low, usually by about 10, so around 150 or 90, give or take. I also have a high heartrate - over 90 resting, up from over 80 resting last year - and it often goes up to and beyond 150 and beats so hard that I can hear it. Sometimes it hurts really bad and feels like it stops for a few seconds. However, I have had both a heart ultrasound and a 24 hour heart monitor and they said there is nothing wrong with my heart. I also have occasional hot flushes and have been in bed red-faced and dripping with sweat even on the coldest winters night. My symptoms worsen when I am anything but lying down - within less than a minute of even just sitting up a little bit, my heart races and I feel so, so dizzy, with insane head pressure and an almost immediate headache. I often refuse to go to hospital as I know they will make me wait, sitting up in a wheelchair for hours and I cannot handle that. It's so bad that I'd honestly rather die than sit in a wheelchair for hours. Most days I can't even make it to the bathroom without help. I have had ""drop attacks"" - like passing out but without losing consciousness - several times this year, and whenever I stand up I feel like I am going to faint. Because of this, I am stuck in bed basically 24/7.  I have terrible neck and back pain, to the point that I have hired someone to come to my house to massage me. I also have lung problems that have not yet been diagnosed, my breathing is wheezy most of the time and my lungs hurt. I also have a bad cough, since early 2016. I have been tested for whooping cough and meningococcal and I don't have them. I also had a chest X-ray that came up with nothing abnormal. My nose also hurts quite often, with the same cold pain I get in my ears. I have been to a neurologist as well as the cardiologist and ear doctor. I have stayed in hospital for over a week getting tests - the heart ultrasound, 24 hour heart moniter, and two MRIs - one for the brain and one for the ears. I also had another MRI last year - nothing showed up. I have been to so many doctors, but nobody has any clue what this could be - if they even try to find out at all. I unfortunately was diagnosed with anxiety over a decade ago, and because of this, and that nothing else has been found, most doctors are convinced this is only anxiety. It is not. I know my own body - I've only lived in it for more than half a century - and I know something isn't right. I can tell the difference between an anxiety attack and whatever this is, and besides, I have taken a Valium when I have felt bad and it has done nothing but make me not care what's happening. I can still feel the symptoms. My most recent hospital trip was very unfortunate, the doctor immediately stopped taking notes as soon as I mentioned I was on anxiety medication, and when I refused to agree that this is only anxiety, he actually looked like he was going to physically lash out at me. His last words to me before I was wheeled out of the room to go home (where I violently threw up from a migraine) were that I had to accept this was anxiety. He had me speak to a psych doctor while I was there, and as we spoke she seemed to believe there was something physical, telling me I need to get a regular psych team organised because only then would doctors like him would have to listen to the physical symptoms. But when the doctor came back he said the psych doctor agreed this was just anxiety - I don't know if he was lying or if he'd convinced her it was just anxiety or if she was lying when she said she agreed with me, but I felt so utterly betrayed. Since then I haven't dared to go back to the hospital, not even when Health Direct (on-the-phone health advice) said they wanted to call an ambulance for me when my heartrate was over 150. I begged them not to as I could not sit up in a wheelchair for hours and get even sicker, only to have to go through that humilation and being condescended to like that doctor did. I have had several suggestions as to what this could be. The two that seem most likely, to me, are Intracranial Hypertension and Spontaneous Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak... however, it has been an uphill battle to try to get tested for these, I first found out about them several months ago and have suggested it to several different doctors and have come no closer to getting tested. I suggested a CSF leak to the horrid doctor at the hospital and he insisted that it cannot happen without a serious trauma, like a car accident. I will be seeing another neurologist on the upcoming Friday, but I have no faith in getting any results. I don't know what kind of a person this neurologist will be - if he will listen to me and get the tests I want, or if he will immediately give up on me the second he finds out I have anxiety. I have absolutely no quality of life at all. I haven't seen any of my friends in years, most days I can't even sit up to watch tv, or even use my phone to watch YouTube as the head pressure, headaches, dizziness and eye pain become unbearable. It has taken me several days to write this post in my memos app as I cannot stand being on my phone for long. My laptop has been used less than ten times in all of 2017 as I feel terrible using it, and I have seen only four movies at home this whole year - I am counting a Titanic documentary as a movie due to it's length. I can't even just listen to music or podcasts because of my headaches, earaches, and the fuzziness and vibrating/clenching. All I can do is lay there in the dark with my eyes closed, clutching my head and wishing I could finally die and escape this. I find myself thinking ""I don't want to be alive any more"" at least once a day. I have so much wasted potential, all I want is to do my part to help the world by offering the skills I have, but now I can barely even text my friends. My best friends have had weddings I have been unable to attend, and had children I have not met yet. I have had no love life since this started, I have never been so lonely for so long. I need my life back! I am not even thirty yet, too young to have my life stopped like this. Please, if you have any suggestions or advice, let me know. I live on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia - if anyone knows of anyone around there that will take my case seriously and will try to help, please please tell me! I am willing to travel to Sydney if needed. Recently I found out about an Undiagnosed Diseases Program in Western Australia, and briefly allowed myself to have a bit of hope that they would take me in and help me, however after many goose-chase phone calls and unanswered emails, I found out this program is only for young children who are in the Western Australian health system. I was willing to travel that far just for the possibility that they can help me. This is obviously a difficult case and it's not going to be solved with a blood test or an MRI, but nobody is willing to look hard enough, or even look past my anxiety! I just don't know what to do. Every day is an unbearable hell and it's only getting worse and worse. Please help..."

I have been tested for whooping cough and meningococcal and I don't have them. I also had a chest X-ray that came up with nothing abnormal. My nose also hurts quite often, with the same cold pain I get in my ears. I have been to a neurologist as well as the cardiologist and ear doctor. I have stayed in hospital for over a week getting tests - the heart ultrasound, 24 hour heart moniter, and two MRIs - one for the brain and one for the ears. I also had another MRI last year - nothing showed up. I have been to so many doctors, but nobody has any clue what this could be - if they even try to find out at all. I unfortunately was diagnosed with anxiety over a decade ago, and because of this, and that nothing else has been found, most doctors are convinced this is only anxiety. It is not. I know my own body - I've only lived in it for more than half a century - and I know something isn't right. I can tell the difference between an anxiety attack and whatever this is, and besides, I have taken a Valium when I have felt bad and it has done nothing but make me not care what's happening. I can still feel the symptoms. My most recent hospital trip was very unfortunate, the doctor immediately stopped taking notes as soon as I mentioned I was on anxiety medication, and when I refused to agree that this is only anxiety, he actually looked like he was going to physically lash out at me. His last words to me before I was wheeled out of the room to go home (where I violently threw up from a migraine) were that I had to accept this was anxiety. He had me speak to a psych doctor while I was there, and as we spoke she seemed to believe there was something physical, telling me I need to get a regular psych team organised because only then would doctors like him would have to listen to the physical symptoms. But when the doctor came back he said the psych doctor agreed this was just anxiety - I don't know if he was lying or if he'd convinced her it was just anxiety or if she was lying when she said she agreed with me, but I felt so utterly betrayed. Since then I haven't dared to go back to the hospital, not even when Health Direct (on-the-phone health advice) said they wanted to call an ambulance for me when my heartrate was over 150. I begged them not to as I could not sit up in a wheelchair for hours and get even sicker, only to have to go through that humilation and being condescended to like that doctor did. I have had several suggestions as to what this could be. The two that seem most likely, to me, are Intracranial Hypertension and Spontaneous Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak... however, it has been an uphill battle to try to get tested for these, I first found out about them several months ago and have suggested it to several different doctors and have come no closer to getting tested. I suggested a CSF leak to the horrid doctor at the hospital and he insisted that it cannot happen without a serious trauma, like a car accident. I will be seeing another neurologist on the upcoming Friday, but I have no faith in getting any results. I don't know what kind of a person this neurologist will be - if he will listen to me and get the tests I want, or if he will immediately give up on me the second he finds out I have anxiety. I have absolutely no quality of life at all. I haven't seen any of my friends in years, most days I can't even sit up to watch tv, or even use my phone to watch YouTube as the head pressure, headaches, dizziness and eye pain become unbearable. It has taken me several days to write this post in my memos app as I cannot stand being on my phone for long. My laptop has been used less than ten times in all of 2017 as I feel terrible using it, and I have seen only four movies at home this whole year - I am counting a Titanic documentary as a movie due to it's length. I can't even just listen to music or podcasts because of my headaches, earaches, and the fuzziness and vibrating/clenching. All I can do is lay there in the dark with my eyes closed, clutching my head and wishing I could finally die and escape this. I find myself thinking ""I don't want to be alive any more"" at least once a day. I have so much wasted potential, all I want is to do my part to help the world by offering the skills I have, but now I can barely even text my friends. My best friends have had weddings I have been unable to attend, and had children I have not met yet. I have had no love life since this started, I have never been so lonely for so long. I need my life back! I am not even thirty yet, too young to have my life stopped like this. Please, if you have any suggestions or advice, let me know. I live on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia - if anyone knows of anyone around there that will take my case seriously and will try to help, please please tell me! I am willing to travel to Sydney if needed. Recently I found out about an Undiagnosed Diseases Program in Western Australia, and briefly allowed myself to have a bit of hope that they would take me in and help me, however after many goose-chase phone calls and unanswered emails, I found out this program is only for young children who are in the Western Australian health system. I was willing to travel that far just for the possibility that they can help me. This is obviously a difficult case and it's not going to be solved with a blood test or an MRI, but nobody is willing to look hard enough, or even look past my anxiety! I just don't know what to do. Every day is an unbearable hell and it's only getting worse and worse. Please help..."

I have an extremely pressure-like feeling in my head, as well as the kind of dizziness that feels like I'm drunk or in a boat, all of the time. Mostly, the dizziness is a feeling, but sometimes - especially recently - it is accompanied by a visual shaking, which I have noticed is usually in time with my heart beat. Around when this started, I have also suffered hearing loss and tinnitus. I have been diagnosed with several ear infections since about a year ago, the first one around this time last year, and the most recent about two months ago. I have, however, been to an ear doctor, and he said he could see nothing wrong with my ears. He did a hearing test on me, and I apparently didn't do well - I have hearing loss in my right ear in low frequencies. My ears hurt most of the time, and there is often clear fluid coming out of them, even when I have no ear infection. Mostly the pain is as if a sharp icicle has been jabbed into my ear, and mostly only my right ear, but I also feel bad pressure in both. I often close my hands tightly over them in an attempt to make the pressure stop. It rarely works at all but it's the only thing I can do. Sound often comes through ""fuzzy"", and my ears do an odd, vibrating/clenching thing in response to sound. My eyesight has been getting worse. I got glasses about a year ago, and by March this year they were no longer good enough - better than with no glasses, but still not good. It has only gotten even worse since March, I used to only have poor long distance vision only last year - now I have to squint or even put my glasses on just to use my phone. My blood pressure often goes too high or too low, usually by about 10, so around 150 or 90, give or take. I also have a high heartrate - over 90 resting, up from over 80 resting last year - and it often goes up to and beyond 150 and beats so hard that I can hear it. Sometimes it hurts really bad and feels like it stops for a few seconds. However, I have had both a heart ultrasound and a 24 hour heart monitor and they said there is nothing wrong with my heart. I also have occasional hot flushes and have been in bed red-faced and dripping with sweat even on the coldest winters night. My symptoms worsen when I am anything but lying down - within less than a minute of even just sitting up a little bit, my heart races and I feel so, so dizzy, with insane head pressure and an almost immediate headache. I often refuse to go to hospital as I know they will make me wait, sitting up in a wheelchair for hours and I cannot handle that. It's so bad that I'd honestly rather die than sit in a wheelchair for hours. Most days I can't even make it to the bathroom without help. I have had ""drop attacks"" - like passing out but without losing consciousness - several times this year, and whenever I stand up I feel like I am going to faint. Because of this, I am stuck in bed basically 24/7.  I have terrible neck and back pain, to the point that I have hired someone to come to my house to massage me. I also have lung problems that have not yet been diagnosed, my breathing is wheezy most of the time and my lungs hurt. I also have a bad cough, since early 2016.

It has taken me several days to write this post in my memos app as I cannot stand being on my phone for long. My laptop has been used less than ten times in all of 2017 as I feel terrible using it, and I have seen only four movies at home this whole year - I am counting a Titanic documentary as a movie due to it's length. I can't even just listen to music or podcasts because of my headaches, earaches, and the fuzziness and vibrating/clenching. All I can do is lay there in the dark with my eyes closed, clutching my head and wishing I could finally die and escape this. I find myself thinking ""I don't want to be alive any more"" at least once a day. I have so much wasted potential, all I want is to do my part to help the world by offering the skills I have, but now I can barely even text my friends. My best friends have had weddings I have been unable to attend, and had children I have not met yet. I have had no love life since this started, I have never been so lonely for so long. I need my life back! I am not even thirty yet, too young to have my life stopped like this. Please, if you have any suggestions or advice, let me know. I live on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia - if anyone knows of anyone around there that will take my case seriously and will try to help, please please tell me! I am willing to travel to Sydney if needed. Recently I found out about an Undiagnosed Diseases Program in Western Australia, and briefly allowed myself to have a bit of hope that they would take me in and help me, however after many goose-chase phone calls and unanswered emails, I found out this program is only for young children who are in the Western Australian health system. I was willing to travel that far just for the possibility that they can help me. This is obviously a difficult case and it's not going to be solved with a blood test or an MRI, but nobody is willing to look hard enough, or even look past my anxiety! I just don't know what to do. Every day is an unbearable hell and it's only getting worse and worse. Please help..."

I have an extremely pressure-like feeling in my head, as well as the kind of dizziness that feels like I'm drunk or in a boat, all of the time. Mostly, the dizziness is a feeling, but sometimes - especially recently - it is accompanied by a visual shaking, which I have noticed is usually in time with my heart beat. Around when this started, I have also suffered hearing loss and tinnitus. I have been diagnosed with several ear infections since about a year ago, the first one around this time last year, and the most recent about two months ago. I have, however, been to an ear doctor, and he said he could see nothing wrong with my ears. He did a hearing test on me, and I apparently didn't do well - I have hearing loss in my right ear in low frequencies. My ears hurt most of the time, and there is often clear fluid coming out of them, even when I have no ear infection. Mostly the pain is as if a sharp icicle has been jabbed into my ear, and mostly only my right ear, but I also feel bad pressure in both. I often close my hands tightly over them in an attempt to make the pressure stop. It rarely works at all but it's the only thing I can do. Sound often comes through ""fuzzy"", and my ears do an odd, vibrating/clenching thing in response to sound. My eyesight has been getting worse. I got glasses about a year ago, and by March this year they were no longer good enough - better than with no glasses, but still not good. It has only gotten even worse since March, I used to only have poor long distance vision only last year - now I have to squint or even put my glasses on just to use my phone. My blood pressure often goes too high or too low, usually by about 10, so around 150 or 90, give or take. I also have a high heartrate - over 90 resting, up from over 80 resting last year - and it often goes up to and beyond 150 and beats so hard that I can hear it. Sometimes it hurts really bad and feels like it stops for a few seconds. However, I have had both a heart ultrasound and a 24 hour heart monitor and they said there is nothing wrong with my heart. I also have occasional hot flushes and have been in bed red-faced and dripping with sweat even on the coldest winters night. My symptoms worsen when I am anything but lying down - within less than a minute of even just sitting up a little bit, my heart races and I feel so, so dizzy, with insane head pressure and an almost immediate headache. I often refuse to go to hospital as I know they will make me wait, sitting up in a wheelchair for hours and I cannot handle that. It's so bad that I'd honestly rather die than sit in a wheelchair for hours. Most days I can't even make it to the bathroom without help. I have had ""drop attacks"" - like passing out but without losing consciousness - several times this year, and whenever I stand up I feel like I am going to faint. Because of this, I am stuck in bed basically 24/7.  I have terrible neck and back pain, to the point that I have hired someone to come to my house to massage me. I also have lung problems that have not yet been diagnosed, my breathing is wheezy most of the time and my lungs hurt. I also have a bad cough, since early 2016. I have been tested for whooping cough and meningococcal and I don't have them. I also had a chest X-ray that came up with nothing abnormal. My nose also hurts quite often, with the same cold pain I get in my ears. I have been to a neurologist as well as the cardiologist and ear doctor. I have stayed in hospital for over a week getting tests - the heart ultrasound, 24 hour heart moniter, and two MRIs - one for the brain and one for the ears. I also had another MRI last year - nothing showed up. I have been to so many doctors, but nobody has any clue what this could be - if they even try to find out at all. I unfortunately was diagnosed with anxiety over a decade ago, and because of this, and that nothing else has been found, most doctors are convinced this is only anxiety. It is not. I know my own body - I've only lived in it for more than half a century - and I know something isn't right. I can tell the difference between an anxiety attack and whatever this is, and besides, I have taken a Valium when I have felt bad and it has done nothing but make me not care what's happening. I can still feel the symptoms. My most recent hospital trip was very unfortunate, the doctor immediately stopped taking notes as soon as I mentioned I was on anxiety medication, and when I refused to agree that this is only anxiety, he actually looked like he was going to physically lash out at me. His last words to me before I was wheeled out of the room to go home (where I violently threw up from a migraine) were that I had to accept this was anxiety. He had me speak to a psych doctor while I was there, and as we spoke she seemed to believe there was something physical, telling me I need to get a regular psych team organised because only then would doctors like him would have to listen to the physical symptoms. But when the doctor came back he said the psych doctor agreed this was just anxiety - I don't know if he was lying or if he'd convinced her it was just anxiety or if she was lying when she said she agreed with me, but I felt so utterly betrayed. Since then I haven't dared to go back to the hospital, not even when Health Direct (on-the-phone health advice) said they wanted to call an ambulance for me when my heartrate was over 150. I begged them not to as I could not sit up in a wheelchair for hours and get even sicker, only to have to go through that humilation and being condescended to like that doctor did. I have had several suggestions as to what this could be. The two that seem most likely, to me, are Intracranial Hypertension and Spontaneous Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak... however, it has been an uphill battle to try to get tested for these, I first found out about them several months ago and have suggested it to several different doctors and have come no closer to getting tested. I suggested a CSF leak to the horrid doctor at the hospital and he insisted that it cannot happen without a serious trauma, like a car accident. I will be seeing another neurologist on the upcoming Friday, but I have no faith in getting any results. I don't know what kind of a person this neurologist will be - if he will listen to me and get the tests I want, or if he will immediately give up on me the second he finds out I have anxiety. I have absolutely no quality of life at all.

Mostly, the dizziness is a feeling, but sometimes - especially recently - it is accompanied by a visual shaking, which I have noticed is usually in time with my heart beat. Around when this started, I have also suffered hearing loss and tinnitus. I have been diagnosed with several ear infections since about a year ago, the first one around this time last year, and the most recent about two months ago. I have, however, been to an ear doctor, and he said he could see nothing wrong with my ears. He did a hearing test on me, and I apparently didn't do well - I have hearing loss in my right ear in low frequencies. My ears hurt most of the time, and there is often clear fluid coming out of them, even when I have no ear infection. Mostly the pain is as if a sharp icicle has been jabbed into my ear, and mostly only my right ear, but I also feel bad pressure in both. I often close my hands tightly over them in an attempt to make the pressure stop. It rarely works at all but it's the only thing I can do. Sound often comes through ""fuzzy"", and my ears do an odd, vibrating/clenching thing in response to sound. My eyesight has been getting worse. I got glasses about a year ago, and by March this year they were no longer good enough - better than with no glasses, but still not good. It has only gotten even worse since March, I used to only have poor long distance vision only last year - now I have to squint or even put my glasses on just to use my phone. My blood pressure often goes too high or too low, usually by about 10, so around 150 or 90, give or take. I also have a high heartrate - over 90 resting, up from over 80 resting last year - and it often goes up to and beyond 150 and beats so hard that I can hear it. Sometimes it hurts really bad and feels like it stops for a few seconds. However, I have had both a heart ultrasound and a 24 hour heart monitor and they said there is nothing wrong with my heart. I also have occasional hot flushes and have been in bed red-faced and dripping with sweat even on the coldest winters night. My symptoms worsen when I am anything but lying down - within less than a minute of even just sitting up a little bit, my heart races and I feel so, so dizzy, with insane head pressure and an almost immediate headache. I often refuse to go to hospital as I know they will make me wait, sitting up in a wheelchair for hours and I cannot handle that. It's so bad that I'd honestly rather die than sit in a wheelchair for hours. Most days I can't even make it to the bathroom without help. I have had ""drop attacks"" - like passing out but without losing consciousness - several times this year, and whenever I stand up I feel like I am going to faint. Because of this, I am stuck in bed basically 24/7.  I have terrible neck and back pain, to the point that I have hired someone to come to my house to massage me. I also have lung problems that have not yet been diagnosed, my breathing is wheezy most of the time and my lungs hurt. I also have a bad cough, since early 2016. I have been tested for whooping cough and meningococcal and I don't have them. I also had a chest X-ray that came up with nothing abnormal. My nose also hurts quite often, with the same cold pain I get in my ears. I have been to a neurologist as well as the cardiologist and ear doctor. I have stayed in hospital for over a week getting tests - the heart ultrasound, 24 hour heart moniter, and two MRIs - one for the brain and one for the ears. I also had another MRI last year - nothing showed up. I have been to so many doctors, but nobody has any clue what this could be - if they even try to find out at all. I unfortunately was diagnosed with anxiety over a decade ago, and because of this, and that nothing else has been found, most doctors are convinced this is only anxiety. It is not. I know my own body - I've only lived in it for more than half a century - and I know something isn't right. I can tell the difference between an anxiety attack and whatever this is, and besides, I have taken a Valium when I have felt bad and it has done nothing but make me not care what's happening. I can still feel the symptoms. My most recent hospital trip was very unfortunate, the doctor immediately stopped taking notes as soon as I mentioned I was on anxiety medication, and when I refused to agree that this is only anxiety, he actually looked like he was going to physically lash out at me. His last words to me before I was wheeled out of the room to go home (where I violently threw up from a migraine) were that I had to accept this was anxiety. He had me speak to a psych doctor while I was there, and as we spoke she seemed to believe there was something physical, telling me I need to get a regular psych team organised because only then would doctors like him would have to listen to the physical symptoms. But when the doctor came back he said the psych doctor agreed this was just anxiety - I don't know if he was lying or if he'd convinced her it was just anxiety or if she was lying when she said she agreed with me, but I felt so utterly betrayed. Since then I haven't dared to go back to the hospital, not even when Health Direct (on-the-phone health advice) said they wanted to call an ambulance for me when my heartrate was over 150. I begged them not to as I could not sit up in a wheelchair for hours and get even sicker, only to have to go through that humilation and being condescended to like that doctor did. I have had several suggestions as to what this could be. The two that seem most likely, to me, are Intracranial Hypertension and Spontaneous Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak... however, it has been an uphill battle to try to get tested for these, I first found out about them several months ago and have suggested it to several different doctors and have come no closer to getting tested. I suggested a CSF leak to the horrid doctor at the hospital and he insisted that it cannot happen without a serious trauma, like a car accident. I will be seeing another neurologist on the upcoming Friday, but I have no faith in getting any results. I don't know what kind of a person this neurologist will be - if he will listen to me and get the tests I want, or if he will immediately give up on me the second he finds out I have anxiety. I have absolutely no quality of life at all. I haven't seen any of my friends in years, most days I can't even sit up to watch tv, or even use my phone to watch YouTube as the head pressure, headaches, dizziness and eye pain become unbearable. It has taken me several days to write this post in my memos app as I cannot stand being on my phone for long. My laptop has been used less than ten times in all of 2017 as I feel terrible using it, and I have seen only four movies at home this whole year - I am counting a Titanic documentary as a movie due to it's length. I can't even just listen to music or podcasts because of my headaches, earaches, and the fuzziness and vibrating/clenching. All I can do is lay there in the dark with my eyes closed, clutching my head and wishing I could finally die and escape this. I find myself thinking ""I don't want to be alive any more"" at least once a day. I have so much wasted potential, all I want is to do my part to help the world by offering the skills I have, but now I can barely even text my friends. My best friends have had weddings I have been unable to attend, and had children I have not met yet. I have had no love life since this started, I have never been so lonely for so long. I need my life back! I am not even thirty yet, too young to have my life stopped like this. Please, if you have any suggestions or advice, let me know. I live on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia - if anyone knows of anyone around there that will take my case seriously and will try to help, please please tell me! I am willing to travel to Sydney if needed. Recently I found out about an Undiagnosed Diseases Program in Western Australia, and briefly allowed myself to have a bit of hope that they would take me in and help me, however after many goose-chase phone calls and unanswered emails, I found out this program is only for young children who are in the Western Australian health system. I was willing to travel that far just for the possibility that they can help me. This is obviously a difficult case and it's not going to be solved with a blood test or an MRI, but nobody is willing to look hard enough, or even look past my anxiety! I just don't know what to do. Every day is an unbearable hell and it's only getting worse and worse. Please help..."

I often refuse to go to hospital as I know they will make me wait, sitting up in a wheelchair for hours and I cannot handle that. It's so bad that I'd honestly rather die than sit in a wheelchair for hours. Most days I can't even make it to the bathroom without help. I have had ""drop attacks"" - like passing out but without losing consciousness - several times this year, and whenever I stand up I feel like I am going to faint. Because of this, I am stuck in bed basically 24/7.  I have terrible neck and back pain, to the point that I have hired someone to come to my house to massage me. I also have lung problems that have not yet been diagnosed, my breathing is wheezy most of the time and my lungs hurt. I also have a bad cough, since early 2016. I have been tested for whooping cough and meningococcal and I don't have them. I also had a chest X-ray that came up with nothing abnormal. My nose also hurts quite often, with the same cold pain I get in my ears. I have been to a neurologist as well as the cardiologist and ear doctor. I have stayed in hospital for over a week getting tests - the heart ultrasound, 24 hour heart moniter, and two MRIs - one for the brain and one for the ears. I also had another MRI last year - nothing showed up. I have been to so many doctors, but nobody has any clue what this could be - if they even try to find out at all. I unfortunately was diagnosed with anxiety over a decade ago, and because of this, and that nothing else has been found, most doctors are convinced this is only anxiety. It is not. I know my own body - I've only lived in it for more than half a century - and I know something isn't right. I can tell the difference between an anxiety attack and whatever this is, and besides, I have taken a Valium when I have felt bad and it has done nothing but make me not care what's happening. I can still feel the symptoms. My most recent hospital trip was very unfortunate, the doctor immediately stopped taking notes as soon as I mentioned I was on anxiety medication, and when I refused to agree that this is only anxiety, he actually looked like he was going to physically lash out at me. His last words to me before I was wheeled out of the room to go home (where I violently threw up from a migraine) were that I had to accept this was anxiety. He had me speak to a psych doctor while I was there, and as we spoke she seemed to believe there was something physical, telling me I need to get a regular psych team organised because only then would doctors like him would have to listen to the physical symptoms. But when the doctor came back he said the psych doctor agreed this was just anxiety - I don't know if he was lying or if he'd convinced her it was just anxiety or if she was lying when she said she agreed with me, but I felt so utterly betrayed. Since then I haven't dared to go back to the hospital, not even when Health Direct (on-the-phone health advice) said they wanted to call an ambulance for me when my heartrate was over 150. I begged them not to as I could not sit up in a wheelchair for hours and get even sicker, only to have to go through that humilation and being condescended to like that doctor did. I have had several suggestions as to what this could be. The two that seem most likely, to me, are Intracranial Hypertension and Spontaneous Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak... however, it has been an uphill battle to try to get tested for these, I first found out about them several months ago and have suggested it to several different doctors and have come no closer to getting tested. I suggested a CSF leak to the horrid doctor at the hospital and he insisted that it cannot happen without a serious trauma, like a car accident. I will be seeing another neurologist on the upcoming Friday, but I have no faith in getting any results. I don't know what kind of a person this neurologist will be - if he will listen to me and get the tests I want, or if he will immediately give up on me the second he finds out I have anxiety. I have absolutely no quality of life at all. I haven't seen any of my friends in years, most days I can't even sit up to watch tv, or even use my phone to watch YouTube as the head pressure, headaches, dizziness and eye pain become unbearable. It has taken me several days to write this post in my memos app as I cannot stand being on my phone for long. My laptop has been used less than ten times in all of 2017 as I feel terrible using it, and I have seen only four movies at home this whole year - I am counting a Titanic documentary as a movie due to it's length. I can't even just listen to music or podcasts because of my headaches, earaches, and the fuzziness and vibrating/clenching. All I can do is lay there in the dark with my eyes closed, clutching my head and wishing I could finally die and escape this. I find myself thinking ""I don't want to be alive any more"" at least once a day. I have so much wasted potential, all I want is to do my part to help the world by offering the skills I have, but now I can barely even text my friends. My best friends have had weddings I have been unable to attend, and had children I have not met yet. I have had no love life since this started, I have never been so lonely for so long. I need my life back! I am not even thirty yet, too young to have my life stopped like this. Please, if you have any suggestions or advice, let me know. I live on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia - if anyone knows of anyone around there that will take my case seriously and will try to help, please please tell me! I am willing to travel to Sydney if needed. Recently I found out about an Undiagnosed Diseases Program in Western Australia, and briefly allowed myself to have a bit of hope that they would take me in and help me, however after many goose-chase phone calls and unanswered emails, I found out this program is only for young children who are in the Western Australian health system. I was willing to travel that far just for the possibility that they can help me. This is obviously a difficult case and it's not going to be solved with a blood test or an MRI, but nobody is willing to look hard enough, or even look past my anxiety! I just don't know what to do. Every day is an unbearable hell and it's only getting worse and worse. Please help..."

I have an extremely pressure-like feeling in my head, as well as the kind of dizziness that feels like I'm drunk or in a boat, all of the time. Mostly, the dizziness is a feeling, but sometimes - especially recently - it is accompanied by a visual shaking, which I have noticed is usually in time with my heart beat. Around when this started, I have also suffered hearing loss and tinnitus. I have been diagnosed with several ear infections since about a year ago, the first one around this time last year, and the most recent about two months ago. I have, however, been to an ear doctor, and he said he could see nothing wrong with my ears. He did a hearing test on me, and I apparently didn't do well - I have hearing loss in my right ear in low frequencies. My ears hurt most of the time, and there is often clear fluid coming out of them, even when I have no ear infection. Mostly the pain is as if a sharp icicle has been jabbed into my ear, and mostly only my right ear, but I also feel bad pressure in both. I often close my hands tightly over them in an attempt to make the pressure stop. It rarely works at all but it's the only thing I can do. Sound often comes through ""fuzzy"", and my ears do an odd, vibrating/clenching thing in response to sound. My eyesight has been getting worse. I got glasses about a year ago, and by March this year they were no longer good enough - better than with no glasses, but still not good. It has only gotten even worse since March, I used to only have poor long distance vision only last year - now I have to squint or even put my glasses on just to use my phone. My blood pressure often goes too high or too low, usually by about 10, so around 150 or 90, give or take. I also have a high heartrate - over 90 resting, up from over 80 resting last year - and it often goes up to and beyond 150 and beats so hard that I can hear it. Sometimes it hurts really bad and feels like it stops for a few seconds. However, I have had both a heart ultrasound and a 24 hour heart monitor and they said there is nothing wrong with my heart. I also have occasional hot flushes and have been in bed red-faced and dripping with sweat even on the coldest winters night.

I suggested a CSF leak to the horrid doctor at the hospital and he insisted that it cannot happen without a serious trauma, like a car accident. I will be seeing another neurologist on the upcoming Friday, but I have no faith in getting any results. I don't know what kind of a person this neurologist will be - if he will listen to me and get the tests I want, or if he will immediately give up on me the second he finds out I have anxiety. I have absolutely no quality of life at all. I haven't seen any of my friends in years, most days I can't even sit up to watch tv, or even use my phone to watch YouTube as the head pressure, headaches, dizziness and eye pain become unbearable. It has taken me several days to write this post in my memos app as I cannot stand being on my phone for long. My laptop has been used less than ten times in all of 2017 as I feel terrible using it, and I have seen only four movies at home this whole year - I am counting a Titanic documentary as a movie due to it's length. I can't even just listen to music or podcasts because of my headaches, earaches, and the fuzziness and vibrating/clenching. All I can do is lay there in the dark with my eyes closed, clutching my head and wishing I could finally die and escape this. I find myself thinking ""I don't want to be alive any more"" at least once a day. I have so much wasted potential, all I want is to do my part to help the world by offering the skills I have, but now I can barely even text my friends. My best friends have had weddings I have been unable to attend, and had children I have not met yet. I have had no love life since this started, I have never been so lonely for so long. I need my life back! I am not even thirty yet, too young to have my life stopped like this. Please, if you have any suggestions or advice, let me know. I live on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia - if anyone knows of anyone around there that will take my case seriously and will try to help, please please tell me! I am willing to travel to Sydney if needed. Recently I found out about an Undiagnosed Diseases Program in Western Australia, and briefly allowed myself to have a bit of hope that they would take me in and help me, however after many goose-chase phone calls and unanswered emails, I found out this program is only for young children who are in the Western Australian health system. I was willing to travel that far just for the possibility that they can help me. This is obviously a difficult case and it's not going to be solved with a blood test or an MRI, but nobody is willing to look hard enough, or even look past my anxiety! I just don't know what to do. Every day is an unbearable hell and it's only getting worse and worse. Please help..."

Not a typical sleep apnea candidate. 5'8, 155 pounds and quite in shape/muscular. Only a 15"" neck size. Possibly a larger tongue than normal. Since I was in my early teenage years (possibly even before), I've felt exhausted every day no matter how much I slept. Later elementary school and high school was awful for me. I have days when I feel so tired that it seems hard to focus enough to say my words without slurring them or speaking with a lisp. I have never been able to focus enough mentally to feel that I can drive safely, so I haven't. I wake up some mornings with very deep tooth impressions on the sides and top edge of my tongue. I've had all sorts of blood tests and medical checks, including thyroid. All were fine. I had an in-lab sleep study. They noted a 4.7AHI and an 18.1RDI with 50 unclassified breathing events. My SPO2 levels were said to not drop like someone with sleep apnea, yet the sleep doctor said that my scalloped tongue is a classic sign of sleep apnea. I only slept a total of 2.75 hours for the entire night of the study. I had a brain MRI, which showed nothing usual. My ENT doctor requested a CT scan of my sinuses and noted a deviated septum right right-sided spurring and enlarged turbinates. I had surgery for both of those (successful) in July 2018. Still have awful sleep issues. I get 10-12 hours of sleep and wake up feeling like I've had 4-5 with no energy. The sleep doctor said I don't have sleep apnea because I'm 0.3 away from the 5.0 AHI required to officially diagnose sleep apnea. I have wondered if I have UARS or some other sleep condition. I'm waiting on the results to come back from my home sleep study that I requested for myself (didn't need a doctor to schedule it) because I felt like the sleep lab was incompetent in diagnosing me. My sleep efficiency in the in-lab study was noted at 40%. Over the 2.75 hours that I slept for the whole night of the study, I got like 44 minutes of N1 sleep, 86.5 minutes of N2 sleep, 28.5 minutes of N3 sleep and 7.5 minutes of R sleep. I woke up one night a few weeks ago and let out a big gasp for air and my entire body felt tingly all over, but that has only happened one time (that I am aware of, but could be happening more). What else could be causing me to feel so awful? If I sit in my computer chair at home, I'm prone to falling asleep. I also drift while on a city bus or as a passenger in a car. Fortunately, my job is standing up and moving around all day. The sleep doctor told me, ""If you had a desk job, you'd be falling asleep"" but they won't help me get CPAP to try."

I am male, early 40s, generally very healthy. I suffer daily from nasal and facial pain, usually starting in the left side of my nose and progressing to the left side of my face. Right side is never affected. The pain starts every day when I enter the air-conditioned office at work, but can also be triggered by pollutants such as smoke. The pain diminishes when I leave the office, but does not disappear entirely. Some history: Until about 20 years ago I never had any nasal problems. And then I had a cold, followed by sinusitis which caused stinging pain below both eyes - I think maxillary sinus area. After a week or so, the pain on the right side disappeared, but the pain on the left persisted. This did eventually stop, but I then had a period of about 3 years with regular sharp pain in the inside corner of my left eye (lacrimal sac / lower ethmoid sinus area). Antibiotics had no effect, and nasal endoscopy revealed no abnormalities. Eventually the pain went away, but reappeared intermittently for short spells triggered (I think) by dry or smoky air. Not sure if it's relevant, but I also suffer from hayfever in the summer (and have always done so). No other allergies that I'm aware of. And then about 3 years ago, I moved to a new (sealed and air-conditioned) office at work. Within 15 minutes of entering the room for the first time, I began to get the familiar pain in the left side of my nose, and during the day the pain spread across my face. I have since moved to another office, but the problem persists. The pain often diminishes overnight when I am sleeping, but returns the next day. One thing I have noticed is that the skin between the corner of my left eye and my nose (where the pain first originated) seems to protrude very slightly. If I hold my nostrils closed and inhale, the skin gets sucked inwards to become the same as it is around the other eye. Similarly if I breathe out with my nostrils closed, that area swells. The effect is small but perceptible, and is left-side only. I have had another nasal endoscopy, which again revealed nothing abnormal. I have tried antihistamines and beconase nasal spray (beclometasone dipropionate), and also a capsaicin (pepper) spray. Steam inhalation and massage of the area may help very slightly. I have been on low dose amitriptyline for pain management for the last couple of years. The amitriptyline I think helps a bit. I use a pure saline nasal spray every hour or so at work, which definitely helps somewhat in the short-term, particularly with a prolonged spray action and holding my head upside down. The only time I have no pain at all is if I have a heavy cold with runny nose - this miraculously causes all symptoms to disappear, however it does cause a bit of postnasal drip when sleeping, such that I wake up coughing. I'd be grateful for any opinions or advice! I'm also unsure whether top of nose/corner of eye falls under ENT or opthalmology."

I am male, early 40s, generally very healthy. I suffer daily from nasal and facial pain, usually starting in the left side of my nose and progressing to the left side of my face. Right side is never affected. The pain starts every day when I enter the air-conditioned office at work, but can also be triggered by pollutants such as smoke. The pain diminishes when I leave the office, but does not disappear entirely. Some history: Until about 20 years ago I never had any nasal problems. And then I had a cold, followed by sinusitis which caused stinging pain below both eyes - I think maxillary sinus area. After a week or so, the pain on the right side disappeared, but the pain on the left persisted. This did eventually stop, but I then had a period of about 3 years with regular sharp pain in the inside corner of my left eye (lacrimal sac / lower ethmoid sinus area). Antibiotics had no effect, and nasal endoscopy revealed no abnormalities. Eventually the pain went away, but reappeared intermittently for short spells triggered (I think) by dry or smoky air. Not sure if it's relevant, but I also suffer from hayfever in the summer (and have always done so). No other allergies that I'm aware of.

I've had a recurring nosebleed (daily) that lasted 2-3 months. I've since done cauterisation. However, I realised that I've been picking at my nose on a daily basis, and it bled everyday. The nose picking happened randomly and my hands were definitely not cleaned or washed. Considering that it was daily for a couple of months, and bleeding everyday, what is the likelihood that I contract Hepatitis C and HIV through the wounds in my nose (from daily surfaces that my hands come into contact with like subway railings, public tables, toilets, etc.)?"

A week later, I saw my family doctor who was acting as my OB/GYN. He noted that both of my lymph nodes were swollen. My flu was gone. I no longer had pregnancy symptoms. He didn't offer any explanation or treatment. 5 days later I had a traumatic miscarriage. It was extremely painful and bloody. I had my first appointment with the Maternal Fetal doctor a few days later. She could not determine the reason for the miscarriage. She discovered I was anemic from the blood loss during the miscarriage and prescribed me Iron. I didn't see my family doctor until July 24th because his office scheduled me the wrong day in June and couldn't get me in until July 24-- yeah, they still thought I was in the middle of a troubled pregnancy (3 prior miscarriages during the previous 12 months) when they didn't promptly reschedule me. On July 24, my lymph nodes in my neck were even larger. When I turn my neck, they 'pop' with a movement as my neck 'innards' move to make room for them. I told my family doctor. He told me he had no idea and would have to ask a more knowledgeable doctor and get back to me. He said he'd recheck my iron levels and call me. No one called me, so I called the nurse and the receptionist told me it must be fine or someone would have called me. On August 25, I saw my family doctor. My lymph nodes were still huge. He told me he forgot to ask another doctor and would get back to me next month about it. In the meantime, he noted my Iron levels in July were still only at a 9, so he told me to keep taking the Iron supplements and he'd call another doctor to ask about my lymph nodes and he'd call me about my iron levels. That was his only treatment for me. He took blood for my iron level but no other testing was done. The next day, the nurse called me about my iron levels from July. I told her I'd already seen the doctor in the meantime, so she called me a month too late. (smh).  Obviously my doctor and his support staff are incompetent. It took the nurse 5 weeks to send my records to the maternal fetal clinic so they'd see me, even though the doctor said I was at such high risk that I needed to be seen immediately.

He didn't offer any explanation or treatment. 5 days later I had a traumatic miscarriage. It was extremely painful and bloody. I had my first appointment with the Maternal Fetal doctor a few days later. She could not determine the reason for the miscarriage. She discovered I was anemic from the blood loss during the miscarriage and prescribed me Iron. I didn't see my family doctor until July 24th because his office scheduled me the wrong day in June and couldn't get me in until July 24-- yeah, they still thought I was in the middle of a troubled pregnancy (3 prior miscarriages during the previous 12 months) when they didn't promptly reschedule me.

For my Otoacoustic Emissions (Type DPOAE) test the result was ""Partial"" for left ear and ""Partial"" for right ear. What does ""Partial mean? Then the Audiologist stated in his comments, ""Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (1.6-8 KHz) suggested cochlear outer hair cell involvement in the 5-8 KHz frequency region.""

I go to a sensory deprivation lounge about once a month just to relax in the water and clear my head.

If I did happen to have hepatitis C would it be possible for me to transfer it to the next person that uses the tank after I do?

However, about two years ago I started to notice the hearing in my right ear sort of deteriorating. I didn't think much of it at first, but now that I'm in college and constantly around people it's very noticeable. It's extremely hard to follow along with conversations and even sometimes hear things one on one. I've had my hearing checked (a couple of months ago) and they told me that I did have some hearing loss but it wasn't enough for hearing aids. But I honestly feel like my hearing has gotten worse in my ear and I'm starting to notice some dizzy spells occasionally. For example, yesterday I was sitting down and not even moving around and suddenly it felt like I was spinning and it was hard to hold my head up. I chalked it up to just being tired, but now I'm wondering if it might be related. I have also been getting ear aches more frequently in the past couple of months. Am I being paranoid, or do I need to see a doctor about this?"

However, one week ago today, I woke up coughing early in the morning and could not breathe for a good minute or two. The same thing happened this morning, one week later. I have been to the doctor's office twice and the ER, but was not able to get any answers other than it may be a bronchial infection. They even performed a CT Scan on me. They have given me antibiotics, steroids, which I have been taking for more than a week now, and I still have the same symptoms. I have also been given a respiclick inhaler which I can use if I cannot breathe. I also moved from my apartment to my father's home for the past week, and could notably tell a difference in the quality of the air. What is concerning me the most is that I still had a massive fit where I could not breathe, for the second time. Back in June, my roommate and I found some black mold on the outside of our A/C unit and were concerned. We notified our apartment community office and they came and cleaned it, but not totally, and did not seem to think it was an issue that should be alarming at all. There was also water leaking through the wall where our A/C unit and hot water is. I have attached photos of the mold that was found. Now, they have come to clean it again this week, with bleach, and I was also able to convince them to hire a mold inspection company to come and inspect the apartment. I showed the inspector the pictures of the mold and clearly explained where it was found. Although I have no official documentation yet, the mold inspection test that was done yesterday did not return any results like I expected. Whenever I have these coughing fits I have been seriously concerned for my life. I do not know what to do now. Could I be allergic to something other than black mold in my apartment?

I lived in Madagascar for a year and am quite disappointed in the medical treatment, especially where she was located (Southern Madagascar- very poor). She has a 20 month old daughter and I am concerned that the child and the 5 family members that cared for her during this time may have had exposure. Should this be a concern? Should I inform them to be watchful for any signs? I do not want to loose another close friend of this family!"

I have no background on medicine (I am an engineer) so maybe my questions and thoughts are very basic and solved but I will give them a try. My main query is about the mechanism that underlies the process of getting cold as well as some extra questions on the subject. To my understanding and judging by experience solely, getting cold is a matter of bacteria growth rate and temperature (conditions). I am not talking about illnesses that are contagious and we get them when someone sneezes on us for example. I am just examining common advice that states ´wear a jacket dont get cold´. What always bothered me is what happened really when we are exposed to cold and our temperature drops. Why would we get sick ? Is it that our immune system gets weaker and it is time for bacteria to step up? If that is true is it bacteria that are already in the air or inside us? If we would lower our temperature in a controlled sterilized environment we can stay at lower temperature for very long times without getting sick?  Does this also mean (if true) that we are talking about bacteria right? But the flu is a virus correct? so we can get it from others only (unless it is also inside us already). Too many questions I know, but most of them are rhetorical. The main question is whether the above is true or not. Is it a matter of rates? At normal body temperature there is a certain bacteria growth that we can always fight but when we go to lower Ts the bacteria rate increases and our system gets weaker so the numbers go up in terms of bacteria? If that, could we say there is a threshold to reach before we get really sick ? (we all have felt almost ill but managed to overcome it before going down with it). The effects of the above could be local I suppose from what I have seen. When I was younger I got a very bad case of throat illness (dont know the name) and now I am sensitive.  If I drink e.g. cold water fast the next day I will have a problem and if I dont pay attention it will evolve and I will get throat-sick needing antibiotics to get well. That has to be bacteria right? (believe me I tried avoiding them but if I dont take them I am finished withing 4 days). This happens once per two years but I have noticed that it seems to migrate. Starts from throat and when it retreats it goes to lungs (softer) to ears and then nose. So here is the second part of my question. Can a bacterial  condition evolve and migrate ? Is that possible or am I getting sicker catching different kinds of bacteria or viruses from the environment (while I am a little weak due to the initial condition). Is any of the above true for bacteria (and/or viruses)? Are they inside us and they are temperature dependent with an optimum growth at lower Ts?

I'm only 18 and I have a very small mouth so it's terribly hard to remove them. Every time I try, I gag. And even loosening them to some extent gags me when they finally come out.

So my question to you is could all of these factors mainly the dirty room and constant mucus/phlegm in the vocal chords, in any way effect the development of my vocal chords (i.e could the phlegm/ mucus in the throat some how of interfered with the testosterone entering my vocal chords which is needed in order to enlarge the vocal chords and the larynx?)i also know it is a possibility that my voice has finished developing but i have noticed that is still cracking and has gotten deeper recently(also even if my voice has finished developing i still want an opinion if these factors could have inhibited the development) .also could these factors also have damaged my vocal chords?

He stopped what he was doing numerous times in order to try to regather himself, as he complained of feeling like the whole room around him was spinning. He was able to proceed with undressing, showering, & getting dressed for the show, but by the end of this process did agree with us that he needed to be taken to the ER. Just prior to getting into the car to go, he did feel thirsty, took a drink of water, and vomited within a matter of seconds. Even after vomiting, he complained of feeling nauseous. He also complained of feeling like his right ear was badly blocked, had a loud ringing noise in it, and he really couldn't hear much at all with that ear. He said his left ear felt only a little blocked & he could hear pretty well with it. When we arrived (around 6:30 pm.), theER nurse & physician's assistant examined my father and took him for a CT scan (based upon the signs/symptoms he told of and they witnessed, they didn't think he'd had a stroke, but wanted to rule out anything of the sort). Shortly after the CT scan was performed, the PA can in to tell us it looked perfectly normal and they were diagnosing him w/an inner ear infection/vertigo. They sent him home w/prescriptions for ear drops, as well as for pills to suppress the nausea & dizziness. As it turned out, he never did need to take any more pills for his nausea (they gave him 1 in the ER) and from Thursday (Aug. 3) until today (Aug. 7), he stopped taking the pills to lessen the dizziness (this morning our family dr. recommended he resume taking them). Then, the day after my father's visit to the ER, he still felt very dizzy (although he began describing the sensation as being more like on a very rocky cruise ship, as opposed to the whole room spinning) and was extremely tired, as he slept for much of the day. The next day, my mother & I took him to our family dr., who prescribed a lower dose of the medication for dizziness (the pills he resumed today) & instructed him to continue using the ear drops. During this visit, my father told our dr. of all of the symptoms I've mention previously, but he also said both sides of his head (mostly in the area of his temples) felt blocked and like he had some minimal mucous running down the back of his throat. Then, after not seeing much (if any) improvement at all by Wed., my father called the family dr., who then recommended he see a ENT specialist. The next day (Aug. 3), we drove my dad to the ENT's office. The ENT examined his ears, reported seeing no signs of blockage nor infection and gave him a hearing test, after which he confirmed the pretty noticeable hearing deficit in the right ear & normal hearing in the left. He told my mother & father it's possible the auditory nerve in the right ear ""just shorted out"", in which case the hearing's not very likely to return & balance may continue to be an issue. W/that said, he did also give my dad prescriptions for a ""Z-Pack"", steroid, & another large blue pill that's supposed to knock out both viral & bacterial infections. He told him to come back in 1 week. In the meantime, now in his 5th day of taking these prescribed meds., my father still feels his right ear is pretty blocked and has ringing in it (although both of these things did ease a bit for much of Saturday & this morning, but otherwise returned & remained fairly constant). He also still feels pretty of balance when walking (still like e's on a rocky ship), although he did also see some improvement on Sat., only to have much of it return yesterday & today. . . . He also describes it as feeling like he's having trouble focusing w/his eyes, especially when he first starts walking, but says it does improve a little once he takes a few steps. Much of the hearing deficit is still present in his right ear. He also says he still feels some pressure in both of his temples, though it's the most improved symptom. Finally, I should mention that on July 10 my father did complain of cold-like symptoms, but they were completely gone by the next day w/o an medication. He has also had a history of sinus infections in the past & often sneezes a lot (especially when he 1st wakes up in the morning during spring, summer, & fall). However, he's had no history at all of vertigo/dizziness prior to July 29. So w/all of this said and the fact he really had no warning signs of any of this, but has been experiencing these frightening symptoms for the last 10 days w/only marginal improvement since he began the meds prescribed by the ENT specialist, I'm concerned he may not ever really get better (although today our family dr. did seem extremely certain he will make a full recovery, as he strongly believes it's just a bad case of labyrinthitis (not a dead auditory nerve nor Meniere's Disease). What light can you shed on this involved & somewhat mysterious case of an inner ear pathology? Please help!"

Finally, I should mention that on July 10 my father did complain of cold-like symptoms, but they were completely gone by the next day w/o an medication. He has also had a history of sinus infections in the past & often sneezes a lot (especially when he 1st wakes up in the morning during spring, summer, & fall). However, he's had no history at all of vertigo/dizziness prior to July 29. So w/all of this said and the fact he really had no warning signs of any of this, but has been experiencing these frightening symptoms for the last 10 days w/only marginal improvement since he began the meds prescribed by the ENT specialist, I'm concerned he may not ever really get better (although today our family dr. did seem extremely certain he will make a full recovery, as he strongly believes it's just a bad case of labyrinthitis (not a dead auditory nerve nor Meniere's Disease).

He stopped what he was doing numerous times in order to try to regather himself, as he complained of feeling like the whole room around him was spinning. He was able to proceed with undressing, showering, & getting dressed for the show, but by the end of this process did agree with us that he needed to be taken to the ER. Just prior to getting into the car to go, he did feel thirsty, took a drink of water, and vomited within a matter of seconds. Even after vomiting, he complained of feeling nauseous. He also complained of feeling like his right ear was badly blocked, had a loud ringing noise in it, and he really couldn't hear much at all with that ear. He said his left ear felt only a little blocked & he could hear pretty well with it. When we arrived (around 6:30 pm.), theER nurse & physician's assistant examined my father and took him for a CT scan (based upon the signs/symptoms he told of and they witnessed, they didn't think he'd had a stroke, but wanted to rule out anything of the sort). Shortly after the CT scan was performed, the PA can in to tell us it looked perfectly normal and they were diagnosing him w/an inner ear infection/vertigo. They sent him home w/prescriptions for ear drops, as well as for pills to suppress the nausea & dizziness. As it turned out, he never did need to take any more pills for his nausea (they gave him 1 in the ER) and from Thursday (Aug. 3) until today (Aug. 7), he stopped taking the pills to lessen the dizziness (this morning our family dr. recommended he resume taking them). Then, the day after my father's visit to the ER, he still felt very dizzy (although he began describing the sensation as being more like on a very rocky cruise ship, as opposed to the whole room spinning) and was extremely tired, as he slept for much of the day. The next day, my mother & I took him to our family dr., who prescribed a lower dose of the medication for dizziness (the pills he resumed today) & instructed him to continue using the ear drops. During this visit, my father told our dr. of all of the symptoms I've mention previously, but he also said both sides of his head (mostly in the area of his temples) felt blocked and like he had some minimal mucous running down the back of his throat. Then, after not seeing much (if any) improvement at all by Wed., my father called the family dr., who then recommended he see a ENT specialist. The next day (Aug. 3), we drove my dad to the ENT's office. The ENT examined his ears, reported seeing no signs of blockage nor infection and gave him a hearing test, after which he confirmed the pretty noticeable hearing deficit in the right ear & normal hearing in the left. He told my mother & father it's possible the auditory nerve in the right ear ""just shorted out"", in which case the hearing's not very likely to return & balance may continue to be an issue. W/that said, he did also give my dad prescriptions for a ""Z-Pack"", steroid, & another large blue pill that's supposed to knock out both viral & bacterial infections. He told him to come back in 1 week. In the meantime, now in his 5th day of taking these prescribed meds., my father still feels his right ear is pretty blocked and has ringing in it (although both of these things did ease a bit for much of Saturday & this morning, but otherwise returned & remained fairly constant). He also still feels pretty of balance when walking (still like e's on a rocky ship), although he did also see some improvement on Sat., only to have much of it return yesterday & today. . . .

He also describes it as feeling like he's having trouble focusing w/his eyes, especially when he first starts walking, but says it does improve a little once he takes a few steps. Much of the hearing deficit is still present in his right ear. He also says he still feels some pressure in both of his temples, though it's the most improved symptom. Finally, I should mention that on July 10 my father did complain of cold-like symptoms, but they were completely gone by the next day w/o an medication. He has also had a history of sinus infections in the past & often sneezes a lot (especially when he 1st wakes up in the morning during spring, summer, & fall). However, he's had no history at all of vertigo/dizziness prior to July 29. So w/all of this said and the fact he really had no warning signs of any of this, but has been experiencing these frightening symptoms for the last 10 days w/only marginal improvement since he began the meds prescribed by the ENT specialist, I'm concerned he may not ever really get better (although today our family dr. did seem extremely certain he will make a full recovery, as he strongly believes it's just a bad case of labyrinthitis (not a dead auditory nerve nor Meniere's Disease).

He stopped what he was doing numerous times in order to try to regather himself, as he complained of feeling like the whole room around him was spinning. He was able to proceed with undressing, showering, & getting dressed for the show, but by the end of this process did agree with us that he needed to be taken to the ER. Just prior to getting into the car to go, he did feel thirsty, took a drink of water, and vomited within a matter of seconds. Even after vomiting, he complained of feeling nauseous. He also complained of feeling like his right ear was badly blocked, had a loud ringing noise in it, and he really couldn't hear much at all with that ear. He said his left ear felt only a little blocked & he could hear pretty well with it. When we arrived (around 6:30 pm.), theER nurse & physician's assistant examined my father and took him for a CT scan (based upon the signs/symptoms he told of and they witnessed, they didn't think he'd had a stroke, but wanted to rule out anything of the sort). Shortly after the CT scan was performed, the PA can in to tell us it looked perfectly normal and they were diagnosing him w/an inner ear infection/vertigo. They sent him home w/prescriptions for ear drops, as well as for pills to suppress the nausea & dizziness. As it turned out, he never did need to take any more pills for his nausea (they gave him 1 in the ER) and from Thursday (Aug. 3) until today (Aug. 7), he stopped taking the pills to lessen the dizziness (this morning our family dr. recommended he resume taking them). Then, the day after my father's visit to the ER, he still felt very dizzy (although he began describing the sensation as being more like on a very rocky cruise ship, as opposed to the whole room spinning) and was extremely tired, as he slept for much of the day. The next day, my mother & I took him to our family dr., who prescribed a lower dose of the medication for dizziness (the pills he resumed today) & instructed him to continue using the ear drops. During this visit, my father told our dr. of all of the symptoms I've mention previously, but he also said both sides of his head (mostly in the area of his temples) felt blocked and like he had some minimal mucous running down the back of his throat. Then, after not seeing much (if any) improvement at all by Wed., my father called the family dr., who then recommended he see a ENT specialist. The next day (Aug. 3), we drove my dad to the ENT's office. The ENT examined his ears, reported seeing no signs of blockage nor infection and gave him a hearing test, after which he confirmed the pretty noticeable hearing deficit in the right ear & normal hearing in the left. He told my mother & father it's possible the auditory nerve in the right ear ""just shorted out"", in which case the hearing's not very likely to return & balance may continue to be an issue. W/that said, he did also give my dad prescriptions for a ""Z-Pack"", steroid, & another large blue pill that's supposed to knock out both viral & bacterial infections. He told him to come back in 1 week.

Hypersomnia? I need help...,"As a teenager, I slept a lot. My family assumed it was normal. However, looking back, I would sleep 12-14 hours at times, never feeling rested.  In my Early 20's.... I spent a lot of late nights partying and often didn't sleep but a few hours. For years, I equated my exhaustion with my life style.  Now that I am in my 30's, I've become quite tame. I hardly drink alcohol and I entertain myself with house work. I have a great job and a wonderful wife. No kids and 3 cats.  My exhaustion has never left. Several years ago - my ""Sleep attacks"" started. Typically it was after a heavy meal - especially a big bowl of pasta! soon afterwards, I visited a Gastro Doctor and found out that I had a Gluten intolerance. Removing the Gluten from my diet defiantly helped with my stomach issues but the Sleep attacks persisted and gradually got worse.  For the last few years I started having trouble driving andfalling asleep. I would wake up and instantly feel the need to lay on the floor (in the shower) and take a nap. The morning lethargy was the worst for sure although it would sometimes effect me in the afternoon and more than not around 8 or 9 O'clock at night.  After a 2 week run of falling asleep at the wheel daily, I went to a neurologist who diagnosed me with sleep apnea. I was given a APAP and Nuvigil for Daytime sleepiness. 6 months of APAP Theropy had shown significant progress in my sleep,although I still suffered from Lethargy and daytime exhaustion. There were a few days I forgot To take my Nuvigil in the morning and experienced terrifying Sleep attacks. One of the more recent was an episode of 5 different attacks with in a two hour span on my way to work. The others have included sleep attacks, a single Vivid hallucination and vision issues.  As for hallucinations - I do not typically have vivid visual hallucinations - I typically see movement out of the corner of my eye. More than not my Hallucinations are auditory. I will hear my name called or a single word or music while I am falling asleep or having a sleep attack! This auditory hallucination will often cause me alarm and I will jump at the sound but my alertness quickly changes back to lethargy in seconds.  When I do have visual hallucinations - they are Typically while falling asleep or awaking from a dream. Again this is rare and I have only recently experienced these visual hallucinations during daytime sleep attacks. Specifically the vivid one - where I saw a man crossing the road with a blue plaid shirt, holding a 2x6 under his arm going to check the mail... While I looked for him as not to hit him (I was driving), I believe what I saw was the side of a house. I realize this seems crazy and I really can't explain it.  My Neurologist has asked me several times about Cataplexy and I don't believe I have experienced this. Then again, I am not one to be easily excited by laughter or anger. I have always been very even keel and laid back. However, I never mentioned this to my doctor but when I am dealing with a sleep attack, I feel like i could fall over. My head will nod and have a need to sit or lay down. I would compare the feeling to being up for days and finally standing in front of your bed. Is that lose of muscle control? I also notice that when I am in the midst of a sleep attack and trying to fight it, I feel a sudden jolt sensation - like a mild warm electrical current run through my arms, my hands and my upper torso. I just assumed that it was my body trying to keep me awake.  In the evenings, I typically become so tired that it I lack the energy to even sit up. Sometimes, I slump over and often struggle to keep awake. I have noticed that in this state, I have trouble comprehending what someone is saying to me. I also have trouble stringing words together to answer or express myself to the person I am talking to. I often express this state of being as feeling drugged or drunk. My eyes cross and when I speak my words tend to be slightly slurred or not crisply pronounced. I often will replace words with other words that aren't even in the context of what I am talking about (i.e. while talking recently about a cabinet - I referred to the hinge as a ""faucet"") or I will tell my wife I am going to bed because I am ""Sleep"".  I am scared to miss a dose of my medication. I typically take my medication in the morning and sit for a little while and wait for it to kick in before I leave for work. With my Medication (250 Mg Nuvigil) - Its not like being on a medication like Adderall or Concerta where I feel awake and energized. I still feel tired at times during the day but the sleep attacks (if any) are very mild and I don't ever need to worry about falling asleep behind the wheel.  So here is my problem, I have no diagnosis. I was told that it could be Narcolepsy or Idiopathic Hypersomnia. Unfortunately, there is additional testing needed, Including a 2 day sleep study (or one night and one day). So at the moment, no one seems to know exactly why I experience what I do. I have read up on both and where I do see similarities in both - I don't feel that I am exactly 100% either.  This is effecting my work and my home life. My wife has implied that I am lazy and all I need to do is get up and move around. My boss has seen some changes is the quality of work I put out. I love my wife more than anyone in the world and I have a great job. I have a good life and I am scared this issue I am dealing with could destroy it all.  I NEED HELP! Is there anything I can do in the meantime that will help me feel more awake? The Nuvigil has been a god send - but in the morning I have to wait for it to kick in and in the evenings after work, I come home, do a few chores and then sit until I feel my condition start to take over - then I don't move from the couch.  I currently don't exercise and haven't for about 3-4 years. I use to Workout religiously! People told me it would make me feel better. Except it never did... I always felt exhausted after working out at the gym. My wife tried waking me up in the morning and make me walk around the neighborhood but prior to my medication, it didn't help... I would still have sleep attacks while driving to work. I have a diet that primarily consists of Vegetables, the occasional chicken breast or fish, No gluten or processed foods, limited alcohol (and if I do have a drink it is some sort of vodka drink 1 or 2 oz) - very limited soda intake (1 can a month or less). I am 34 years old, Male and I weigh 172 lbs.  Other Diagnosis that I have- Anxiety disorder (controlled with medication- although recently hasn't done a great job) Sleep apnea (controlled with APAP)  Gluten Intolerance (controlled with diet) Pre-Hypertension (controlled with Diet - Typical blood pressure reading is 117-122 over 71-78)  Trichotillomania and Dermatillomania (disorders probably related to my anxiety but have gotten worse over the past year)  Attention Deficit Disorder (Not controlled since taking Nuvigil)  Any insight or help on this issue would be great. I do have a sleep study coming up in January and I have been referred to John Hopkins Sleep Disorder Center but I am waiting to hear from my neurologist to see how to go about transitioning to another sleep center.  I realize this all seems pretty bad (and it is) but I also feel that it is not as bad as it appears to be from this synopsis. These few paragraphs are so condensed and I have hit on the extremes of my condition. I Suffer every day but most are tolerable. I would even say hardly noticeable - It's the one day out of 10 or 20 that scares me half to death.  Sorry to write a book but I feel the more information I can provide, the better advice I receive.

I spent a lot of late nights partying and often didn't sleep but a few hours. For years, I equated my exhaustion with my life style.  Now that I am in my 30's, I've become quite tame. I hardly drink alcohol and I entertain myself with house work. I have a great job and a wonderful wife. No kids and 3 cats.  My exhaustion has never left. Several years ago - my ""Sleep attacks"" started. Typically it was after a heavy meal - especially a big bowl of pasta! soon afterwards, I visited a Gastro Doctor and found out that I had a Gluten intolerance. Removing the Gluten from my diet defiantly helped with my stomach issues but the Sleep attacks persisted and gradually got worse.  For the last few years I started having trouble driving andfalling asleep. I would wake up and instantly feel the need to lay on the floor (in the shower) and take a nap. The morning lethargy was the worst for sure although it would sometimes effect me in the afternoon and more than not around 8 or 9 O'clock at night.  After a 2 week run of falling asleep at the wheel daily, I went to a neurologist who diagnosed me with sleep apnea. I was given a APAP and Nuvigil for Daytime sleepiness. 6 months of APAP Theropy had shown significant progress in my sleep,although I still suffered from Lethargy and daytime exhaustion. There were a few days I forgot To take my Nuvigil in the morning and experienced terrifying Sleep attacks. One of the more recent was an episode of 5 different attacks with in a two hour span on my way to work. The others have included sleep attacks, a single Vivid hallucination and vision issues.  As for hallucinations - I do not typically have vivid visual hallucinations - I typically see movement out of the corner of my eye. More than not my Hallucinations are auditory. I will hear my name called or a single word or music while I am falling asleep or having a sleep attack! This auditory hallucination will often cause me alarm and I will jump at the sound but my alertness quickly changes back to lethargy in seconds.  When I do have visual hallucinations - they are Typically while falling asleep or awaking from a dream. Again this is rare and I have only recently experienced these visual hallucinations during daytime sleep attacks. Specifically the vivid one - where I saw a man crossing the road with a blue plaid shirt, holding a 2x6 under his arm going to check the mail... While I looked for him as not to hit him (I was driving), I believe what I saw was the side of a house. I realize this seems crazy and I really can't explain it.  My Neurologist has asked me several times about Cataplexy and I don't believe I have experienced this. Then again, I am not one to be easily excited by laughter or anger. I have always been very even keel and laid back. However, I never mentioned this to my doctor but when I am dealing with a sleep attack, I feel like i could fall over. My head will nod and have a need to sit or lay down. I would compare the feeling to being up for days and finally standing in front of your bed. Is that lose of muscle control? I also notice that when I am in the midst of a sleep attack and trying to fight it, I feel a sudden jolt sensation - like a mild warm electrical current run through my arms, my hands and my upper torso. I just assumed that it was my body trying to keep me awake.  In the evenings, I typically become so tired that it I lack the energy to even sit up. Sometimes, I slump over and often struggle to keep awake. I have noticed that in this state, I have trouble comprehending what someone is saying to me.

I often will replace words with other words that aren't even in the context of what I am talking about (i.e. while talking recently about a cabinet - I referred to the hinge as a ""faucet"") or I will tell my wife I am going to bed because I am ""Sleep"".  I am scared to miss a dose of my medication. I typically take my medication in the morning and sit for a little while and wait for it to kick in before I leave for work. With my Medication (250 Mg Nuvigil) - Its not like being on a medication like Adderall or Concerta where I feel awake and energized. I still feel tired at times during the day but the sleep attacks (if any) are very mild and I don't ever need to worry about falling asleep behind the wheel.  So here is my problem, I have no diagnosis. I was told that it could be Narcolepsy or Idiopathic Hypersomnia. Unfortunately, there is additional testing needed, Including a 2 day sleep study (or one night and one day). So at the moment, no one seems to know exactly why I experience what I do. I have read up on both and where I do see similarities in both - I don't feel that I am exactly 100% either.  This is effecting my work and my home life. My wife has implied that I am lazy and all I need to do is get up and move around. My boss has seen some changes is the quality of work I put out. I love my wife more than anyone in the world and I have a great job. I have a good life and I am scared this issue I am dealing with could destroy it all.  I NEED HELP! Is there anything I can do in the meantime that will help me feel more awake? The Nuvigil has been a god send - but in the morning I have to wait for it to kick in and in the evenings after work, I come home, do a few chores and then sit until I feel my condition start to take over - then I don't move from the couch.  I currently don't exercise and haven't for about 3-4 years. I use to Workout religiously! People told me it would make me feel better. Except it never did... I always felt exhausted after working out at the gym. My wife tried waking me up in the morning and make me walk around the neighborhood but prior to my medication, it didn't help... I would still have sleep attacks while driving to work. I have a diet that primarily consists of Vegetables, the occasional chicken breast or fish, No gluten or processed foods, limited alcohol (and if I do have a drink it is some sort of vodka drink 1 or 2 oz) - very limited soda intake (1 can a month or less). I am 34 years old, Male and I weigh 172 lbs.  Other Diagnosis that I have- Anxiety disorder (controlled with medication- although recently hasn't done a great job) Sleep apnea (controlled with APAP)  Gluten Intolerance (controlled with diet) Pre-Hypertension (controlled with Diet - Typical blood pressure reading is 117-122 over 71-78)  Trichotillomania and Dermatillomania (disorders probably related to my anxiety but have gotten worse over the past year)  Attention Deficit Disorder (Not controlled since taking Nuvigil)  Any insight or help on this issue would be great. I do have a sleep study coming up in January and I have been referred to John Hopkins Sleep Disorder Center but I am waiting to hear from my neurologist to see how to go about transitioning to another sleep center.  I realize this all seems pretty bad (and it is) but I also feel that it is not as bad as it appears to be from this synopsis. These few paragraphs are so condensed and I have hit on the extremes of my condition. I Suffer every day but most are tolerable. I would even say hardly noticeable - It's the one day out of 10 or 20 that scares me half to death.  Sorry to write a book but I feel the more information I can provide, the better advice I receive.

I spent a lot of late nights partying and often didn't sleep but a few hours. For years, I equated my exhaustion with my life style.  Now that I am in my 30's, I've become quite tame. I hardly drink alcohol and I entertain myself with house work. I have a great job and a wonderful wife. No kids and 3 cats.  My exhaustion has never left. Several years ago - my ""Sleep attacks"" started. Typically it was after a heavy meal - especially a big bowl of pasta! soon afterwards, I visited a Gastro Doctor and found out that I had a Gluten intolerance. Removing the Gluten from my diet defiantly helped with my stomach issues but the Sleep attacks persisted and gradually got worse.  For the last few years I started having trouble driving andfalling asleep. I would wake up and instantly feel the need to lay on the floor (in the shower) and take a nap. The morning lethargy was the worst for sure although it would sometimes effect me in the afternoon and more than not around 8 or 9 O'clock at night.  After a 2 week run of falling asleep at the wheel daily, I went to a neurologist who diagnosed me with sleep apnea. I was given a APAP and Nuvigil for Daytime sleepiness. 6 months of APAP Theropy had shown significant progress in my sleep,although I still suffered from Lethargy and daytime exhaustion. There were a few days I forgot To take my Nuvigil in the morning and experienced terrifying Sleep attacks. One of the more recent was an episode of 5 different attacks with in a two hour span on my way to work. The others have included sleep attacks, a single Vivid hallucination and vision issues.  As for hallucinations - I do not typically have vivid visual hallucinations - I typically see movement out of the corner of my eye. More than not my Hallucinations are auditory. I will hear my name called or a single word or music while I am falling asleep or having a sleep attack! This auditory hallucination will often cause me alarm and I will jump at the sound but my alertness quickly changes back to lethargy in seconds.  When I do have visual hallucinations - they are Typically while falling asleep or awaking from a dream. Again this is rare and I have only recently experienced these visual hallucinations during daytime sleep attacks. Specifically the vivid one - where I saw a man crossing the road with a blue plaid shirt, holding a 2x6 under his arm going to check the mail... While I looked for him as not to hit him (I was driving), I believe what I saw was the side of a house. I realize this seems crazy and I really can't explain it.  My Neurologist has asked me several times about Cataplexy and I don't believe I have experienced this. Then again, I am not one to be easily excited by laughter or anger. I have always been very even keel and laid back. However, I never mentioned this to my doctor but when I am dealing with a sleep attack, I feel like i could fall over. My head will nod and have a need to sit or lay down. I would compare the feeling to being up for days and finally standing in front of your bed. Is that lose of muscle control? I also notice that when I am in the midst of a sleep attack and trying to fight it, I feel a sudden jolt sensation - like a mild warm electrical current run through my arms, my hands and my upper torso. I just assumed that it was my body trying to keep me awake.  In the evenings, I typically become so tired that it I lack the energy to even sit up. Sometimes, I slump over and often struggle to keep awake. I have noticed that in this state, I have trouble comprehending what someone is saying to me.

I am scared to miss a dose of my medication. I typically take my medication in the morning and sit for a little while and wait for it to kick in before I leave for work.

So here is my problem, I have no diagnosis. I was told that it could be Narcolepsy or Idiopathic Hypersomnia. Unfortunately, there is additional testing needed, Including a 2 day sleep study (or one night and one day). So at the moment, no one seems to know exactly why I experience what I do.

I currently don't exercise and haven't for about 3-4 years. I use to Workout religiously! People told me it would make me feel better. Except it never did... I always felt exhausted after working out at the gym. My wife tried waking me up in the morning and make me walk around the neighborhood but prior to my medication, it didn't help... I would still have sleep attacks while driving to work. I have a diet that primarily consists of Vegetables, the occasional chicken breast or fish, No gluten or processed foods, limited alcohol (and if I do have a drink it is some sort of vodka drink 1 or 2 oz) - very limited soda intake (1 can a month or less). I am 34 years old, Male and I weigh 172 lbs.  Other Diagnosis that I have- Anxiety disorder (controlled with medication- although recently hasn't done a great job) Sleep apnea (controlled with APAP)  Gluten Intolerance (controlled with diet) Pre-Hypertension (controlled with Diet - Typical blood pressure reading is 117-122 over 71-78)  Trichotillomania and Dermatillomania (disorders probably related to my anxiety but have gotten worse over the past year)  Attention Deficit Disorder (Not controlled since taking Nuvigil)  Any insight or help on this issue would be great.

I realize this all seems pretty bad (and it is) but I also feel that it is not as bad as it appears to be from this synopsis.

I spent a lot of late nights partying and often didn't sleep but a few hours. For years, I equated my exhaustion with my life style.  Now that I am in my 30's, I've become quite tame. I hardly drink alcohol and I entertain myself with house work. I have a great job and a wonderful wife. No kids and 3 cats.  My exhaustion has never left. Several years ago - my ""Sleep attacks"" started. Typically it was after a heavy meal - especially a big bowl of pasta! soon afterwards, I visited a Gastro Doctor and found out that I had a Gluten intolerance. Removing the Gluten from my diet defiantly helped with my stomach issues but the Sleep attacks persisted and gradually got worse.  For the last few years I started having trouble driving andfalling asleep. I would wake up and instantly feel the need to lay on the floor (in the shower) and take a nap. The morning lethargy was the worst for sure although it would sometimes effect me in the afternoon and more than not around 8 or 9 O'clock at night.  After a 2 week run of falling asleep at the wheel daily, I went to a neurologist who diagnosed me with sleep apnea. I was given a APAP and Nuvigil for Daytime sleepiness. 6 months of APAP Theropy had shown significant progress in my sleep,although I still suffered from Lethargy and daytime exhaustion. There were a few days I forgot To take my Nuvigil in the morning and experienced terrifying Sleep attacks. One of the more recent was an episode of 5 different attacks with in a two hour span on my way to work. The others have included sleep attacks, a single Vivid hallucination and vision issues.  As for hallucinations - I do not typically have vivid visual hallucinations - I typically see movement out of the corner of my eye. More than not my Hallucinations are auditory. I will hear my name called or a single word or music while I am falling asleep or having a sleep attack! This auditory hallucination will often cause me alarm and I will jump at the sound but my alertness quickly changes back to lethargy in seconds.  When I do have visual hallucinations - they are Typically while falling asleep or awaking from a dream. Again this is rare and I have only recently experienced these visual hallucinations during daytime sleep attacks. Specifically the vivid one - where I saw a man crossing the road with a blue plaid shirt, holding a 2x6 under his arm going to check the mail... While I looked for him as not to hit him (I was driving), I believe what I saw was the side of a house. I realize this seems crazy and I really can't explain it.  My Neurologist has asked me several times about Cataplexy and I don't believe I have experienced this. Then again, I am not one to be easily excited by laughter or anger. I have always been very even keel and laid back. However, I never mentioned this to my doctor but when I am dealing with a sleep attack, I feel like i could fall over. My head will nod and have a need to sit or lay down. I would compare the feeling to being up for days and finally standing in front of your bed. Is that lose of muscle control? I also notice that when I am in the midst of a sleep attack and trying to fight it, I feel a sudden jolt sensation - like a mild warm electrical current run through my arms, my hands and my upper torso. I just assumed that it was my body trying to keep me awake.  In the evenings, I typically become so tired that it I lack the energy to even sit up. Sometimes, I slump over and often struggle to keep awake. I have noticed that in this state, I have trouble comprehending what someone is saying to me.

Eventually one ER provided a homebrewed ""gastro"" solution of lidocaine and antacid that seemed, after several hours, to help. Ever since then after multiple visits to ENTs and gasto doctors, as well as having two CT scans and an endoscopy, the discomfort/pain in the back of the throat persists and hardly improves.

This condition does not appear to respond to any conventional antacids (Pepcid, liquid antacids), nor large doses of omeprazole or even stronger antacids (Dexilant). About two months ago my lymph nodes under my jaw my neck became swollen and have not gone down. I feel lymph pain in the nodes on the back of my head, under my arm, and (occasionally) around my groin area. The ENT read the radiology report of the last CT scan (with contrast) and said ""everything is fine"".  This is frustrating to me because clearly not everything is fine! The throat pain continues to worsen and the lymph nodes are not going down in size. When i asked for specifics he said they were ""less than 1.5 cm"". Which presumably is the threshold for biopsy. Both nodes are swollen, and painful, which i guess? is a good sign. He recommended only coming back when i get ""night sweats"" and ""significant weight loss""; ie, clear signs of cancer. But he didn't (and frankly no doctor has) has addressed the constant pain nor the lack of response to prescription antacids my condition exhibits. So what should i do in this situation? IE., what course of action? Are there certain keywords or phrases i should use with doctors? Should i try getting treatment at a specialty clinic? It just seems to me that if this condition really was GERD i would 1) have heartburn and 2) respond positively to antacids."

I know I’ll just keep breaking bones. I’m starting nursing school but I can’t have my bones snapping there so I can’t, can I?

I was referred to a bone mineralist specialist who ran a new bunch of tests, 24 hour urine collection, Mg, calcium and parathyroid levels included. The whole 9 yards. Never had this done before. I followed the testing criteria to the T.  That was the revelation I needed. I got the test results online before following up with my bone mineralist dr. I finally saw that my parathyroid level was elevated at the same time my blood calcium was elevated. I did a lot of research on the Internet and discovered I probably had hyperparathyroid DZ. So after more testing and medical HX reviewed, I was accepted as a pt at the Norman Parathyroid Center in Tampa, FL and they found and excised my parathyroid tumor and left the other 3 normal parathyroid glands intact as they were behaving and were normal in hormone production. Day surgery by very skilled doctors. The Norman Parathyroid Center does about 15 parathyroid surgeries a day. I flew there from Dallas, TX.  So I expect my bone density test to be much improved one year after this neck surgery and I take vit D/Calcium supplements, work out, stay active. That is it. Of course, watch the alcohol, diet sodas...normal advice for anyone. When the parathyroid is stealing calcium from your bones, there is no amount of oral calcium or bone building drug that can over come that powerful hormone effect. There is some medical discussion (from a chemo nurse presenter at a Br Ca support group) that chemotherapy can have an effect on the endrocrine system and may have played a part in my one parathyroid tumor, but my Tampa, FL surgeon, Dr. Daniel Ruan, said it was just my bad luck and I could live my life w/o worrying about this problem recurring. Hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed, though relatively infrequent in the gen pop.  So bottom line, go to a bone mineralist specialist and get all your labs and Look at them to see what is going on with your bones... Don't let the drs assume you are just old or just a Br Ca survivor and that is just a normal part of your situation. My bone mineralist dr did not agree with my lay person diagnosis and he wanted to put me back on Fosamax again for a year then check me again. With my bone density on the line, I said no, I need a 2nd opinion and that is how I finally got the right diagnosis for me. People, you need to know your lab results and take charge of your health. Good luck to you in your pursuit of good health and strong bones. Without the bones, life is not too rosy."

At the beginning of this summer, i started to have small coughing fits and sneezing a lot. I figured this was due to allergies. I live in Central Illinois. The coughing continued, and it still happens. I don't feel like I have anything to cough up, just a dry cough. It almost always ends with a sneeze or two. The reason i'm asking is because I've noticed that doing certain things, such as bending over, will cause it. It always happens when i swallow when I'm bending over or if there's pressure on my chest. I have been in West Virginia, a totally different region, for 4 days now and it has not let up at all, so I'm not sure if it's allergies. I'd like to think it's no cause for alarm, but it's starting to bug me now."

My last Tcell count was -2.5. I am age 64 and weigh 115lbs. I had 3 metatarsal stress fractures (both feet involved) in the 4 years leading up to this diagnosis, each episode caused just by walking too many hours in the mall or on pavement in medium-supportive shoes (Skechers and others).  I was scared to death to go on an 8-day London vacation this past June, which was to include a lot of walking. First I packed my giant orthopedic boot, which took up a third of my suitcase (I didn't want to be shopping for one in London while in extreme pain from a broken foot). Then I tried on an entire store full of women's ""walking"" shoes, also many other expensive walking shoes in other stores, with and without various inserted arch supports. I didn't find anything any better than my existing walking shoes with added arch support which, while comfortable enough just for standing, always made the metatarsal area of my feet feel dangerously achy-breaky after any serious walking.  Long story short: the dream shoes I finally found are Hoka One One brand running shoes, their model called Clifton 4. They have the most marshmallow-cushy sole I've ever felt, with a slightly rounded rocker-like bottom surface that prevents the ""slap-down"" motion of the front part of my foot that happened when I walked in all those other shoes. But most noticeable was the unique amount of extra cushion precisely under my metatarsal bones, that I had felt in no other shoe I tried on. I bought them in a half-size larger than my street shoes, in Wide width that gave my toes plenty of room to stretch out side to side and up and down. I laced them very loose over the metatarsal area, and tight at the top to prevent slipping on the heel. The shoestrings stayed loose and tight where I needed them to. I walked my legs off in London, and felt like I was bounding along the whole time. At the end of a day, my leg muscles were sore from more walking than I'm used to, but my actual feet were not sore at all. And that has NEVER happened to me. These shoes are literally worth their weight in gold! So if you're in my boat, I recommend looking in shoe stores dedicated to serious runners. I've read there are other runners' brands now offering the same sort of extra cushion and rocker motion."

I do not believe I have been screened for Cystic Fibrosis, as my birth was extremely early, and at that point in time I wouldn't have been able to produce enough sweat for a proper sweat test. Once as an infant I stopped breathing and the doctors couldn't figure out why I had stopped. (I have no more information of this event, only what my parents have recalled to me.) I have been coughing up phlegm regularly now, for as long as I can remember. However, it has gotten worse within the last few years, to the point where I have to cough it up almost every day, and sometimes multiple times a day. Sometimes, when I cough up this phlegm, it has traces of blood in it, however it is never enough to be considered alarming or to the point where I think there might be something damaged in my lungs or airway. I tend to cough up more during or immediately after I exercise, and if left un-dealt with, can even cause me to go into a long coughing fit. I overheat constantly, am almost always dehydrated, and for the most part, underweight despite my considerably healthy diet and constant exercise. I am prone to getting sick, and I am constantly congested despite whether I am sick or not. This happens all year, every year, but gets worse during the summer when I overheat far more, inhale more pollen (allergies), and exercise more. This has gotten so bad, in fact, that I now normally have to stay inside, and even then I still feel the effects almost constantly. I have yellow-tinted skin, which has only appeared within the last seven years or so, and often my skin is rather salty (or at least I assume, considering my dog licks my arms so much). I have tried bringing my concerns up with my mother, however she continues to insist that it is normal to cough up phlegm as often as I do. I insisted that certainly it couldn't be normal to cough up phlegm with traces of blood, however she continued to insist that it was normal, and that she does too have a similar problem at times. My parents do want what is best for me and care for me deeply, however they continue to insist that this is not a large problem. I respect and trust them, however I felt that I should get an opinion from a medical professional.

Yesterday, I went to see a doctor assistant and she couldn't feel any lumps on my neck and tested for strep throat, which came out negative. She said that everything was normal and that it could be a pulled muscle from the adjustment. She didn't prescribe me any medicine and told me to take 3 200mg of Advil every 6 hours (I felt like she should have prescribed me something more powerful against inflammation, as it feels like it's inflamed and it kind of feels like I have a lump in my throat (when I try to eat or drink).

I should also note that when I try to pop my ears, the problem right ear will delay in popping. I am not sure what to do here and am feeling at a loss with this. Any ideas or suggestions? Thank you."

Twisted my ankle and ended up with a nice scrape on my knee. I thought I had a normal sprained ankle but I didn't. I had a slight limp but could still walk. Unlike normal ones you can't walk on it at all. Well, I looked it up and from what I could find its a high ankle sprain but its still hurts. I can put weight on it but I can't stand on tippy toes without pain or just coming back down quickly. If I put pressure/weight on the inside of my ankle, like if I'm trying to move around in bed, it hurts like a *** on the outside of my ankle and somewhat in the back. I know this may be a waste of time to post but I don't know what exactly is wrong. Is it a muscle, a tendon, I don't know. When I was in high school I had a similar thing happen but it was in the middle of my leg but I was on crutches cause I could not walk on it at all. Even then, I don't know what it actually was. My guess is that my muscle tore or something. That healed within a week or 2. Still had a tiny bit of pain depending but nothing like what I'm having now. I don't know how to keep from making it worse and wrenching it. I know xrays will be a waste of time cause I if anything was broken I'd know, I've been there with my hand, so I guess I don't know what the hell to do."

Since my blood work routinely comes back as bad, regardless of how well or how much of my supplements I take and my broken toe shows it must be worse as it's the first time I've ever broken a bone just stubbing a toe (low impact).  I wondered what the future holds for me at 32 if this keeps getting worse? What will happen to my body? My GP has never explained the long term effects of worsening osteoporosis at my age. Is there anything that can be done? I have been looking at injectables and infusions but my GP (I'm in the UK) has never suggested such things. Are they available over here yet (privately or on the NHS)? Could I ask for them? Could I pay for them? Are they any good? I'm in no pain, have no postural issues, just a tendency to kick stuff and break bones it seems!! :)  Any help would be good. Thanks! Jenn"

This affects my ability to absorb vitamins, fats and minerals (I think I read somewhere with a 75cm common channel (the working bit of my small intestine) I will only absorb 25% of everything I orally take). I've lost 11 stone and I'll be on various supplements for the rest of my life including large doses of calcium and vit D. I have to have B12 injections every 3 months (looking forward to my ""fix"" on Tuesday - I always feel like a new person after it!)

The pain is only on my right side of the neck closer to my larynx. The pain is there when I swallow, cough or sneeze. Occasionally when it gets really bad it slightly radiates to my right ear but not frequently. About a week ago the pain was almost completely gone, but recently returned after I had a season allergy attack and was sneezing a whole lot. Now the pain is worse than ever when I swallow. Ibuprofen feels as if it helps if not sometimes takes the pain completely away, but recently it hasn't been able to in the last 2 days since the pain returned. I don't notice any swelling or bulging in my neck from the outside. Temp seems normal. No changes in voice etc. I don't have access to an ENT or any medical clinic for that matter for another 3.5 weeks. Any help would be appreciated!!"

I sure hope someone out there can point me in the right direction. I'm 35, and all my life I've been very active and agile, and I've had great coordination and balance. Over the past few years (maybe 4-5?) I've noticed that my tendency toward car sickness has increased, to the point that I usually avoid being a passenger if at all possible, but nothing else seemed out of the ordinary and I didn't think much of it.  About 8-9 months ago I started dancing (salsa, etc), and I really fell in love with it. When I began to devote regular time to practicing, and attempted to apply proper technique to my turns, I found that keeping my balance was nearly impossible. At first I thought I just needed more practice, and I'm sure I do, but the more turns I practiced in any one session, the worse I became, to the point that I would have to catch myself on walls and furniture in order not to fall. I feel so unbalanced - like my brain thinks that the floor is somewhere other than where it is. This is always accompanied by a sensation of terrible motion sickness and nausea, which sometimes lasts for hours. Now that I'm aware of it, I notice it more. Any time I change the position of my head quickly, I get very dizzy. Someone gave me an exercise ball for Christmas, and I tried sitting on it at my desk. Within seconds I was nauseous from the slight rocking motion, and I had to stop using it immediately. The other part of the story is that my ears feel...weird. One thing that may be important is that I've been sleeping with OTC ear plugs almost every night for the past 4-5 years. Whether that is related to any of this, I have no idea. As to my ears...I have the sensation that there is fluid in them, often. When I use q-tips to get the water out of them after a shower (please don't lecture me about this; I am very careful), if I press the q-tip gently to the wall of the ear canal, there is a sensation of pressure changing that is really hard to describe - the way it feels when you have water in your ears, before the pressure seal pops. But this sensation feels deeper, and it is always there when I insert a q-tip and move it around...it is like a wall of pressure and it alters as I move the q-tip, but it never disappears - like fluid deep inside my ear that won't budge. I don't know if that made sense, but I definitely did not feel this sense of fluid in the past. Occasionally my right ear will hurt mildly when I blow my nose, for a few days at a time. Then it stops. And then there are bizarre occurrences now and then - like the last time I was in the ocean, I wiped out with a surfboard and got tossed around a bit, and when I came out of the water and I was so dizzy I could barely walk. My head felt completely full of water, and my ears squealed and trumpeted like crazy when I blew my nose. This lasted for quite a while, and the dizziness/motion sickness lasted the rest of the day.  I saw a primary care doc a few months ago, and her examination of my ears was unremarkable, which surprised me, because they really feel like they have too much fluid in them, or something. She referred me to an ENT specialist, and I ended up canceling my appointment, as I really couldn't afford it at the time, and I had a sinking feeling it was going to be another unproductive visit. I started taking ginkgo about 3 months ago after reading an article about its positive effects on circulation and vertigo in some people, and I do think it's helped my circulation but I don't think it's done much of anything for my balance. Other than that, I'm just trying to be careful not to make myself nauseous. I can do all the things I need to do for work, etc, without any trouble, and if I didn't love dancing so much I would probably be ignoring this issue. But something is definitely not right, and i'm so frustrated every time I turn or spin and end up staggering away from my partner and having to catch myself...So. Sorry to write a novel here. I'm just hoping someone out there is going to be like, ""Yes! I know exactly what the problem is!""

Pressure in ears and head. Very fatigued. Posted 12 days ago Looking for an opinion on my last 2 years of being ill. I'm 46 years old, male, and in a good state of fitness. I'm not over-weight, have never smoked, and rarely drink. I've seen numerous doctors and don't seem to be any closer to a diagnosis. I started visiting my GP with what felt like a lingering flu. Early symptoms included being over tired, pressure in ears, and generally not feeling well. I'd been dealing with a very stressful business situation in the 12-18 months before the symptoms started and was advised that I was probably run-down. Each time I went to the doctor they would take a blood test. Over at least 6 tests they would always tell me something different, but it always seemed to be that I had some unknown virus. At times my blood cell count was too many white cells, or too many red cells. The frustration was they could never tell me what was wrong. I had stress tests for my heart, CT scan and MRI. All came back normal. During this period I would sometimes have 2-3 weeks where I felt normal and was able to work and exercise. These periods of good health never lasted. Fast forward to about 6 months ago. My [now new] doctor referred me to an endocrinologist as it was thought there may be a thyroid problem. My first test did indicate that I may be hypothyroid but they didn't want to give me any medication as they thought it wasn't required. I didn't get any better over the next few months with the same symptoms continuing - pressure in my head and ears, fatigued, unable to concentrate etc. At my next visit to the endocrinologist my thyroid function had worsened slightly and I was put on 50mg of euthyroxine. My blood pressure was also fluctuating a lot with periods where it was around 150/104. I was prescribed medication to try and bring this under control. Around 4 weeks ago I was on a trip away from home and started to feel really awful. I felt my head pressure was increasing and when I shut my eyes the only thing I could hear was my heart beating with a pulsing feeling my head. I had frequent hot flushes, dizzy spells, and never ending ear pressure. I was sleeping frequently for hours during the day, but struggling to get a good nights sleep, perhaps due to building anxiety about what was wrong with me.  Now back home, I went back to the doctor and explained how bad I was feeling. The main symptoms now being extreme fatigue, constant pressure in my ears, and a very strange feeling at the top of my head. I felt on a few occasions that I was going to faint, especially in the morning. I had tried exercising [cycling] one morning, and had to abandon after only a short time. I had also started to feel aches and pains in my legs and back. I explained to the doctor that the main symptoms that were worrying me were the inability to work [tired and no concentration span], the pressure in my head and ears, and the strange pounding sensation from my heart. I was thinking at this time that these may all be connected to being hypothyroid. The doctor ordered a new thyroid function test which came back right in the middle of the normal range. That has scared me as I feel dreadful, and have been pretty much consigned to bed for the last week. When I do get up I feel dizzy. My eyesight has changed. Hard to explain but it's just not feeling normal. I also feel that driving has a different sensation and I don't feel entirely safe. I still have episodes of feeling like I will faint, but never do. My doctor had asked me to take Zoloft [as she felt I was over anxious]. I didn't want to take them but did, thinking it would do no harm. The morning after taking it I felt even worse, with the dizzy feelings increased. Even 2 days later I still feel the effects.  I'm trying to find out what could cause my symptoms and came up with various reports on labyrinthitis. As this seems to be a viral problem that can cause the feeling of ear fullness it seems to be a possibility. It's all I've come up now that it doesn't look thyroid is the source of the problem. Right now, I'm in the worst health I've been in years. I can't work, exercise and need to sleep 4-5 hours during the day. I have constant ear pressure, pressure in my head, dizziness, lack of energy, and muscle pain. Can anyone suggest what this could be. It's been 2 years now and I just seem to get worse.

I felt on a few occasions that I was going to faint, especially in the morning. I had tried exercising [cycling] one morning, and had to abandon after only a short time. I had also started to feel aches and pains in my legs and back. I explained to the doctor that the main symptoms that were worrying me were the inability to work [tired and no concentration span], the pressure in my head and ears, and the strange pounding sensation from my heart. I was thinking at this time that these may all be connected to being hypothyroid. The doctor ordered a new thyroid function test which came back right in the middle of the normal range. That has scared me as I feel dreadful, and have been pretty much consigned to bed for the last week. When I do get up I feel dizzy. My eyesight has changed. Hard to explain but it's just not feeling normal. I also feel that driving has a different sensation and I don't feel entirely safe. I still have episodes of feeling like I will faint, but never do. My doctor had asked me to take Zoloft [as she felt I was over anxious]. I didn't want to take them but did, thinking it would do no harm. The morning after taking it I felt even worse, with the dizzy feelings increased. Even 2 days later I still feel the effects.  I'm trying to find out what could cause my symptoms and came up with various reports on labyrinthitis. As this seems to be a viral problem that can cause the feeling of ear fullness it seems to be a possibility. It's all I've come up now that it doesn't look thyroid is the source of the problem. Right now, I'm in the worst health I've been in years. I can't work, exercise and need to sleep 4-5 hours during the day. I have constant ear pressure, pressure in my head, dizziness, lack of energy, and muscle pain. Can anyone suggest what this could be. It's been 2 years now and I just seem to get worse.

Pressure in ears and head. Very fatigued. Posted 12 days ago Looking for an opinion on my last 2 years of being ill. I'm 46 years old, male, and in a good state of fitness. I'm not over-weight, have never smoked, and rarely drink. I've seen numerous doctors and don't seem to be any closer to a diagnosis. I started visiting my GP with what felt like a lingering flu. Early symptoms included being over tired, pressure in ears, and generally not feeling well. I'd been dealing with a very stressful business situation in the 12-18 months before the symptoms started and was advised that I was probably run-down. Each time I went to the doctor they would take a blood test. Over at least 6 tests they would always tell me something different, but it always seemed to be that I had some unknown virus. At times my blood cell count was too many white cells, or too many red cells. The frustration was they could never tell me what was wrong. I had stress tests for my heart, CT scan and MRI. All came back normal. During this period I would sometimes have 2-3 weeks where I felt normal and was able to work and exercise. These periods of good health never lasted. Fast forward to about 6 months ago. My [now new] doctor referred me to an endocrinologist as it was thought there may be a thyroid problem. My first test did indicate that I may be hypothyroid but they didn't want to give me any medication as they thought it wasn't required. I didn't get any better over the next few months with the same symptoms continuing - pressure in my head and ears, fatigued, unable to concentrate etc. At my next visit to the endocrinologist my thyroid function had worsened slightly and I was put on 50mg of euthyroxine. My blood pressure was also fluctuating a lot with periods where it was around 150/104. I was prescribed medication to try and bring this under control. Around 4 weeks ago I was on a trip away from home and started to feel really awful. I felt my head pressure was increasing and when I shut my eyes the only thing I could hear was my heart beating with a pulsing feeling my head. I had frequent hot flushes, dizzy spells, and never ending ear pressure. I was sleeping frequently for hours during the day, but struggling to get a good nights sleep, perhaps due to building anxiety about what was wrong with me.  Now back home, I went back to the doctor and explained how bad I was feeling. The main symptoms now being extreme fatigue, constant pressure in my ears, and a very strange feeling at the top of my head. I felt on a few occasions that I was going to faint, especially in the morning. I had tried exercising [cycling] one morning, and had to abandon after only a short time.

It's different than my ears popping on a plane or something, because pinching my nose and inhaling will make it go away, but swallowing or blowing my nose will pop them again. Right now, it's only the left ear. There is no pain with it popping, and I can still hear everything fine. However, I can't tell how loud I am when they pop. Any ideas?"

One day, I noticed that my right ear was feeling a little stuffy. I had some hearing loss and I could hear my voice kind of echo in the back of my ear. Then I noticed that occasionally my hearing would get more sensitive, so I held my nose and blew air into my ear and it popped. A lot. It popped like a machine gun (is the only way I can think to describe it). Then, once I had finished blowing air in, it popped like that again even though I wasn't trying to pop it. I would end up having to pop it several times before it would stop. Even after it stopped, only minutes later it would need to be popped like that again. After days of dealing with this, I went to the doctor and he told me that I had fluid build up behind my eardrum that wasn't draining. He said that there was no wax at all (like I had originally thought there might be). He called it something, but I don't remember what exactly he said. He recommended me some over the counter medicine and gave me a steroid shot to help. My ear didn't pop like that for 2 or 3 days afterwards, but today it started acting up again. I'm at a loss for what to do. I've been taking the medicine like I'm supposed to, but it hasn't been working. I thought the shot helped for a while, but I guess it didn't. I haven't had any pain, but it's getting very bothersome. I've had to wear an earplug in that ear all day so that it won't bother me. Even then it still pops a lot. I should probably mention that I'm 17 and have had ear problems since I was little. I have had tubes in my ears multiple times and I get wax blockages very easily."

My left ear I hear a high-pitched a hissing sound similar to that of a noise cancellation headphones, in addition to the feeling/pain sensation of that of when you leave a back window open in a car and drive down a high way. Sounds in general have a metallic after-sound, that is, when people talk (for example) their word (especially those that contain t's and s's) come with almost like a symbol of a drum set sound and makes it slightly painful.  In both my ears I sometimes hear something like chimes going of or like hundreds of birds chirping at once or the sound of cicadas in the summer. Also in both my ears, though I think moreso my right, common sounds have a ring/whistle to them. For example, from inside my house, the sound of gardeners mowing the lawn I can still hear that sound, but it comes along with another high-pitched ring to it. Another example is my bathroom fan or when I flush the toilet and it fills up with water; I hear the normal fan and water refil sound, but I hear a high-pitched ring/whistle along with it. It's as if my brain is adding extra sounds when not necessary. This is been going on for a week and I'm crying hysterically. If anyone could tell me what this is from or how I can go about treating and I greatly appreciate it. I've had 2 hearing test in the past week and they both came back 100%. I feel somewhat congested however I went to two at EMTs both did not see congestion. The second ENT suggested allergies may play a small roll but I've never had allergies in the past so I don't know if I believe this and have no other symptoms of allergies. I took Allegra this morning and have not noticed a difference either. I also have TMJ though I don't know if the sound is coming from it because it came on suddenly and nothing changed with my jaw. Please someone help me. :( Thank you."

HELP!!,"Hello all, this is a long story but I’ll try and make it short. So about 5 days ago, I started experiencing hearing issues in my right ear, in that everything sounded distorted. I am studying abroad in Tokyo, Japan and went to a Japanese ear and nose doctor. The first time he couldn’t find anything wrong with my ear and I passed the sound test (the one with the headphones and silent room). He removed a large amount of earwax and thought that was the issue. Two days later the issue persisted and I went back to the same doctor. He checked my ear and I did the sound test again, nothing could be found wrong with my ears. 	It was at this point the main subject of this post begins. At this point, (yesterday, during the second appointment) he proceeded to do something I have not been able to even research about on the internet. He stuck a long, very thin, metal tube up my nose. This was accompanied by him blowing air through said tube. This was very painful, but the stranger thing is what happened next. While blowing air through, he sort of ‘connected’ his ear and my ear with a tube (maybe he was listening for something or using vacuum pressure??). The tube was maybe 2.5 feet long, and had fittings at each end that were made for ears. After said task was completed he still couldn’t find anything wrong with my ear, and thought maybe my hearing issue was caused by stress. He prescribed me some medicine (which I haven’t taken, seemed sketchy as they were “stress lowering pills”). Anyways my nose/nasal cavity was sore afterwards for the rest of the day. I am awake at 6:00AM now and my nasal cavity is a lot sorer, it feels like the pain in the onset of a sore throat.  	What should I do? Go to another hospital for this new nasal injury? Can it heal on its own? Moreover, has anyone even heard of a doctor doing something like this before? Any help is greatly appreciated, I feel scared right now. Thank-you for your time"

After the pain passed I couldn't see the board from 30ft way and had to move up to the front. My vision in my right eye slowly gets worse as time passes, this happens usually when I experience the same pain again or force my eye to focus on something more than a few seconds which causes that same pain. The pain usually ends with more floaters in my eye and worse vision. I also can not feel the air/wind on my eye the same. If they blow a puff of air on it will blink. However, most of the time it feels numb. My right eye will also go through phases were it constantly goes into and out of focus resulting in more migraine level pain. Side Note: My forehead also has become numb, and I have started to develop memory and hearing problems in my right ear."

Desperate For Answers.,"Good evening, I will try and be compact. In 2013, after a long period of emotional difficulty in which I used extended video gaming as a balm, I experienced an intense migraine. Ever since, I have not been able to look at a computer screen for more than 20mins - 2hrs without suffering the same visual attack. This has affected my life enormously and I have been unable to pursue most avenues of employment, especially those related to my skillset and education. The migraine begins with a feeling or soreness around the eyes. The veins on my head begin to pump. My eyes feel strained and then painful. It feels like they are trying to focus on something that isn’t there. This results in nausea, confusion and then escalates into a full-blown migraine, lasting on average 3 days. Under these circumstances working with a computer is out of the question. I am tormented by this and it has defined my experiences over the last half a decade to a horrifying degree. Here are the facts: I am male, 27. I wear glasses for close work (prescription correct), otherwise healthy. I had a squint in my right eye that was surgically corrected in Janruary. We were hoping that this would fix the issue but it unfortunately has not. These visual attacks occur only when I look at computer screens/laptop screens and sometimes under intense lighting (office lighting is often particularly bad) I have tried Migralens and various computer glasses to see if blocking out harmful light waves would help, but the symptoms remain the same. I work to adjust screen brightness/contrast/colour and my posture and environment, have used f.lux, but this only increases my buffer before a migraine by a small amount. I am unaffected by kindle screens, books, and other close work. Textured, colourful images such as computer games or videos are much more manageable than information. Reading and writing on the screen will result in a quick deterioration.  I am desperate. I have seen so many ophthalmologists and opticians who, whilst professional, simply are dumbfounded. Very few have any idea how to help or what to suggest and pass me along to the next department or person. This has been years of fruitless hospital visits. Whilst I am currently awaiting transfer back to a neurology department, I simply have lost faith that there will be a close enough investigation to get to the root cause of this. I must, must take control of my life again and this is my obstacle. If there is anyone at all who has lived with this and come out the other side, please get into contact and let me know that there’s light at the end of this miserable tunnel.

It helped and all was well until about 3 months later- same symptoms. Prescribed steroid drops again. All was ok after that.  Then 2-3 months later, same situation. It gets better for a while and then comes back. Starts with very sore upper eyelid and then eye gets very irritated.  I saw a retinal specialist and he didn’t see anything they concerned him from the vision plane test or from the exam when dilated.

Three bands played over the course of about three hours, all of which I practically had a front-row spot for. It was a heavy metal show, so it goes without saying that it was absurdly loud, but I didn't think anything of it at the time. I had been to several concerts before, and had only experienced a ringing for about three or four hours afterwards. In addition, the noise level wasn't painful to me, so I figured I'd just have the normal side effects of concert-going. This time, things have been a little different though. My hearing has been a bit muffled and there's still a constant ringing in my ears almost 24 hours after the show. My hearing has noticeably improved (although it's still not as great as it once was), but the ringing doesn't seem to be subsiding much, if at all. I'm getting worried as this is something that I've never had to deal with before. Should I see a doctor about this? Is there any chance that my condition will improve on its own if I let it go for a couple more days (without exposing myself to any more loud noise)?"

I have been suffering with these tension like headaches and ear pain for 3 months. I took a ct in and a mri in December a sinus ct in January and In February I took a second ct with contrast and noticed a posterior lymph node swollen to 9mm.

When I was on this course of antibiotics I became very fatigued there were days I would sleep for 15 hours. I got a yeast infection from the meds as well as I feel like I now have a bladder infection. I have too many symptoms going on and I cant get a dr to help guide me to at least figure out why I am having these daily headaches and ear pain. I have crusting in my nose. I believe the lymph node swelling is from a scalp infection but a hair strand test pulled from a dermatlogists read negative. There were small pimples in my head and I did have a lot of itching when all of this started. I have been washing my hair with ketoconazole shampoo DAILY and this seems to have helped with the itching. My hair is very dry though. The pimples on my head still remain. This is weird for me because I havent had acne since I was 18 Im 33 and all of this acne appeared when I started getting sick. My dr wants me to take a mri of my neck with contrast tomorrow. I am worried that all of these scans with contrast is damaging me. My dr wants me to schedule another ct scan with contrast of my neck to see if we should biopsy the lymph node.

I was put on a couple of daily drops which have kept my pressure in the normal range. The literature for these drops says they treat glaucoma.  So, my question is, if I have no vision loss or nerve damage, and only high pressure, do I have glaucoma, or do I just have a condition that could potentially lead to glaucoma? Thank you."

My right eye is by far more worse than my left, these floaters in my right eye make me miserable especially in white lights, they're gigantic and when I move my eyes they just throw them selves everywhere, when I squint I see even more of them! I did end up going to a optometrist in May and I had imaging and a vision exam done. 20/20 vision, no peripheral vision problems and my retinas looked completely fine.

I returned Jan 7th, 2017 and had a bout of cold that lasted a couple of weeks fizzlign out with a course of mucinex and some nasal saline drops. A slight dry cough persisted along with some chest congestion which I ignored. Then some 2 weeks ago, I went back to Austin for a week. This time I caught a strep throat that made me miserable all week. After the trip, the strep went away but left the same niggling deep throat irritation with occasional cough. Well, that has now become much more persistent, with pain in ears, and my chest hurts constantly. I instinctively tend to avoid conversations as a defense mechanism. Oddly enough, my trip to the doctors during last week of Feb showed no strep, no infection, clear lungs. They took blood samples and called in last week with out of spec results on thyroid, liver, and high cholesterol. Just like that, out of nowhere!

My grandma hasn't slept in 15 days!!!! Roughly a month ago she starting taking some joint pills which I believe led to her stomach acid coming up to her throat (I think). Anyway now she has a very irritated throat. According to the doctor's, she has bronchitis. They gave her some medicine and that didn't help. We went all over the place looking for medicine or looking for a cure but we can't find one that works. Sometimes the medicine makes her condition worse! Nothing is working! Every time she tries to fall asleep her irritation gets worse, whether she lies down and or sits up sleeping. We've taken her to the hospital 3 times and they refuse to do anything other then take tests and send her away!!!!!! The other day she said she was feeling very weak and we took her to the hospital and again they did absolutely nothing! They wouldn't even help her sleep at all!  I'm very desperate right now. I don't know what else to do. If anyone can give me answers or give me any advice on what to do I would very grateful. I am crying so much because she has to suffer like this and her lack of sleep could lead to the worst. Please help me!"

I’ve been given the option of going through the stapedectomy surgery or using hearing aids. I met with Dr. Harris at UCSD who seems to have considerable experience with this surgery. I’m still in two minds about going for the surgery because of the 1% chance of failure and complications. So, I’m reaching out to see if anybody else has got the surgery done in San Diego, through him or someone else and how the experience was or if you faced any complications or lasting discomforts. If the surgery was successful, how soon did the improvement in hearing show up? Thanks for all the support and info on this forum."

If I move my jaw side to side I hear air squeezing out from what I guess is in my ear. I also hear like a plastic crinkling sound. This does not happen in my other ear. Also frequently my ear will feel like it needs to pop, but if I use the technique where you hold your nose and blow my ear will fill up but wont pop.

I'm 5'2"" and weigh 110. I have many medical issues, so I'm going to list my history before I get to my question(s). I've had Athsma my whole life and I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis at 16. I also have acid reflux, and I've been sick for the last week and a half now. I don't smoke, I don't drink alcohol, shoot I'm Mormon. I don't even drink tea or coffee. I do have a family history of cancer. Known cancers in my family have been cervical, lung, and colon. As far as being sick for the last week an a half, when I went to urgent care they told me I had a viral infection in my bronchial tubes. It is contagious, but not influenza. Over the last couple days my Athsma stopped kicking up because of it. Now I just have a wheeze when I breathe, and my lungs are rattling when I cough. Sometimes I cough up mucus, sometimes I don't. My chest feels like daggers, and I feel completely drained of energy. I'm feeling lightheaded, especially after blowing my nose. My nose is not stuffed. My ears do occasionally feel full, but only when I move. They pop and go back to normal while resting. Now to get to the point... 2 years ago I went to the dentist and he pointed out that I had a lump on my uvula. It looks white in color, but is obviously covered by skin. He told me not to worry about it unless it got bigger or I got more. About 2 months back I noticed a red dot forming below the white lump. It just looks like a tiny cluster of veins. I wasn't feeling too sure about getting it checked out since I work minimum wage, and have a $100 copay to see a specialist. About two or three weeks ago (before I got sick) I noticed that the soft palate of my mouth had turned a yellowish color. It's never been yellow before. I thought it might go away. It hasn't. Two days ago I looked in the back of my throat again wondering if I was developing strep throat. I've had it before, so I know what it looks like (unless it can somehow change form). I know have two lumps on my right tonsil that are identical to the lump on my uvula. They're almost tucked into a corner, so they can be hard to see. Please note, I have on occasion coughed up tonsil stones. However, I don't think that's what these are. I can usually feel tonsil stones when they get that big, and they break off. These spots are white tinted bulges in the flesh. My questions are... What are they? What could they be? Should I worry about them? How do I get rid of them? What's the cheapest route to Handle this? If I go see my primary care physician, what will he do? Send me to the ENT? Or will he recommend something else? Where would the ENT or PCP send me for testing? Could any of this be related to my illness? AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, I KNOW I HAVE A SUPPRESSED iMMUNE SYSTEM, BUT WHY AM I STILL SICK AFTER A WEEK AND A HALF?! Meds for arthritis: Ibuprofen 600MG (as needed) Plaquinol Mobic Other Meds: Bacoflen (at bedtime as needed for neck muscle spasms) Zantac Singulair Sprintec  Dulera (used only if I know I'm going to be around animals) Ventolin (as needed) Albuterol (as needed, which is not often) When I got sick with the virus I stopped taking Plaquinol and Mobic immediately. I've only been using ibuprofen as needed while my body fights off the infection.  Meds prescribed for current illness: Medrol Zithromax I've already completed full course of Medrol. Two days left for the antibiotic. My ears have been clearing up, but my chest is still crap. Thoughts?"

Currently posterior chamber intraocular lenses are both with mild central posterior capsular plaque, and I also have severe dry eyes. Everything else is OK. My doctor has recommended YAG laser to clear the plaques, and thinks that it may be the plaques that are causing my horrible post-op vision, but I am hesitant as I understand it may be difficult to change my IOL later on if I have the YAG laser treatment. I also wonder if the doctor maybe put in the wrong power lenses? Doctor has ‘concluded’ that I will need glasses/another Lasik procedure done to correct my vision rather than him trying to re-calculate the Toric placements or try a different lens and is trying to scare me with all the risks by going back into the operating room...blah..blah..blah. But why would I want glasses or Lasik when I have paid for the premium lenses? And how in the heck is it possible that my vision is still actually worse after surgery 2 months later? This makes no sense to me! I wonder if DMO doctors get into trouble (or get pressured) into not going back to the surgery room with patients (for costs)? I honestly am not looking for 20/20 vision correction, heck I would be happy with 20/30!   Below is a break down what my exams showed:   I had Acrysoft IQ torics put in both eyes with the power 18.5D/1.50CYL   Day 1, post-op exam for left eye: 20/25-2 with no pinhole test done at this time (At this time I was happy and thought that it was a successful surgery for being the day after for this eye) (pre-op was 20/40, no pinhole test done at this time either) 1 month post-op exam for left eye:  20/60-1 with pinhole at 20/25-1 (Yikes! What happened here?)     Day 1, post-op exam for right eye: 20/50 -1 (pre-op was 20/40 with pinhole at 20/30-2) Uh Oh, not nearly where I was with the left eye 1 day post op. 1 month post-op exam for right eye: 20/60 with pinhole at 20/30 (Ugh!)     My current manifest refraction: Right -1.00 (sphere) Cylinder -.075 Left -0.75 (sphere) Cylinder -.050   I am going to get a second opinion to see what a different doctor says before I try the YAG laser to clear up my plaques…..sigh…I’m just beyond broken here….any help or insight given is much appreciated! And if able I will post info from second opinion Doctor on this."

This is the situation: my mother was diagnosed with this condition. Indeed, she shares a lot of the symptons, like redness in the eye, blurred vision, itching sensation and the feeling of a foreign body in the eye. Her doctor suggested that, before going right to surgery, she used some eye drops of mytomicin to see if this works. Now her eye is really swoolen (actually her eyelid and that little bag below the eye). The other eye is fine. We asked our doctor what to do, but he said he wants to keep with the treatment. If it doesn't work, he will do the surgery. I just want to know if all of this is right: is mytomicin really used against pterygium? Is this swoolen of the eye a commom side effect of mytomicin ?(or perharps the pterygium, although this only appeared after she started with the eye drops)"

As I wait for insurance to come through before I go back to the doctor, I’d like to open this up to the knowledge of the masses. I’ll try to keep this long story as short as possible. My symptoms are as follows: For at least the past four years, I’ve been experiencing an intense concentrated pressure in my right temple behind my right eye. It’s chronic, altering between quite intense to rather mild, and it often spreads to the rest of my head, face, and neck. It almost feels as if some huge wrestler like Andre the Giant had his hand on my head and is squeezing, with his thumb on my right temple providing the most pressure there. I can feel a kind of twisting of the nerves in the pressure, as if there is something is alive in there, an unsettling thought. If I’m working or generally keeping myself busy, then I barely notice the pressure. However, if I’m still, for example during meditation, when I’m watching a movie, or lying in bed at night, it’s very potent. I wouldn’t describe it as painful, just very intense, and it’s there pretty much all the time. However, once every three weeks or so, it does get strong enough that it actually becomes quite painful. Generally speaking, the pressure is more intense at night. This pressure has also affected the vision in my right eye which has decreased significantly over the past couple of years and is often blurry. Oddly, when the pressure is strong, massaging the temple or even simple touching it makes it go away almost instantly, only to return in full force when I remove my hand. There is no bulging or anything unusual I can feel on the temple - from the outside, it seems normal. Last year, I had a brain MRI scan which did not show any obvious problems. My doctor believed it was due to anxiety and prescribed medication which did seem to reduce the pressure initially, but only about 25% or so, and it has since returned in full force even with the meds. My eye doctor has also told me that there is nothing wrong with my right eye (having only checked with equipment in his office). In my online research of this problem, I’ve seen many postings of similar symptoms, but never any that matched entirely. The possible causes also do not seem to match completely. Migraines, cluster headaches, and a sinus infection have been ruled out by my doctor. The MRI I suppose (and certainly hope) means that a tumor is probably not the cause (knock on wood). I assume glaucoma is out after my eye doctor gave my right eye a clean bill of health. A primary suspect, anxiety, is something that I live with daily but it does not stop me from living a normal life. Tension headaches are possible, but I have a hard time believing they could be chronic and could manifest themselves so specifically to such a small area. And even during times when the rest of me feels quite relaxed, the pressure remains, which leads me to believe that it is independent of the anxiety, that there’s something wrong behind my eye. Even when I was recently in a luxurious hotspring and my body had rarely felt so relaxed, the pressure raged as strong as ever. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Is it possible they missed anything with the MRI? Do brain MRI scans cover the eyes as well? Could anxiety really manifest itself so strongly? Is it possible that eyestrain from working with computers over the past 15 years could be the culprit?  Thanks a lot for your time."

As I wait for insurance to come through before I go back to the doctor, I’d like to open this up to the knowledge of the masses. I’ll try to keep this long story as short as possible. My symptoms are as follows: For at least the past four years, I’ve been experiencing an intense concentrated pressure in my right temple behind my right eye. It’s chronic, altering between quite intense to rather mild, and it often spreads to the rest of my head, face, and neck. It almost feels as if some huge wrestler like Andre the Giant had his hand on my head and is squeezing, with his thumb on my right temple providing the most pressure there. I can feel a kind of twisting of the nerves in the pressure, as if there is something is alive in there, an unsettling thought. If I’m working or generally keeping myself busy, then I barely notice the pressure. However, if I’m still, for example during meditation, when I’m watching a movie, or lying in bed at night, it’s very potent. I wouldn’t describe it as painful, just very intense, and it’s there pretty much all the time. However, once every three weeks or so, it does get strong enough that it actually becomes quite painful. Generally speaking, the pressure is more intense at night. This pressure has also affected the vision in my right eye which has decreased significantly over the past couple of years and is often blurry. Oddly, when the pressure is strong, massaging the temple or even simple touching it makes it go away almost instantly, only to return in full force when I remove my hand. There is no bulging or anything unusual I can feel on the temple - from the outside, it seems normal. Last year, I had a brain MRI scan which did not show any obvious problems. My doctor believed it was due to anxiety and prescribed medication which did seem to reduce the pressure initially, but only about 25% or so, and it has since returned in full force even with the meds. My eye doctor has also told me that there is nothing wrong with my right eye (having only checked with equipment in his office). In my online research of this problem, I’ve seen many postings of similar symptoms, but never any that matched entirely. The possible causes also do not seem to match completely. Migraines, cluster headaches, and a sinus infection have been ruled out by my doctor. The MRI I suppose (and certainly hope) means that a tumor is probably not the cause (knock on wood). I assume glaucoma is out after my eye doctor gave my right eye a clean bill of health. A primary suspect, anxiety, is something that I live with daily but it does not stop me from living a normal life. Tension headaches are possible, but I have a hard time believing they could be chronic and could manifest themselves so specifically to such a small area. And even during times when the rest of me feels quite relaxed, the pressure remains, which leads me to believe that it is independent of the anxiety, that there’s something wrong behind my eye. Even when I was recently in a luxurious hotspring and my body had rarely felt so relaxed, the pressure raged as strong as ever. Does anyone have any thoughts on this?

I think I just feel like talking and getting it out. If anyone would like to respond, though, it would be most appreciated! Four years ago, I had a retinal detachment in my left eye that was successfully treated through surgery. Thing were going along fine, eye-wise, until last year when my optometrist diagnosed me with high eye pressure, which is a risk factor for glaucoma (which runs a bit on my mom's side of the family). Anyway, I received laser treatment in April 2017 (also on my left eye) to lower the pressure -- it actually worked so well that the pressure was decreased in both eyes, something that's not all that unusual. Anyway, fast forward to a couple weeks ago. I'm not sure how I discovered it, but i noticed that the vision in my left eye was really blurry. I had no other symptoms, but got my glaucoma specialist routine appointment moved up a few days and she super-dilated my eyes and did all kinds of tests, noting that not much ad changed from our last visit (retina and optic nerve looked fine, etc.) and that I had a cataract in my left eye (and a lesser one in my right), something that we already know. She seemed to think that that's what the trouble was. Honestly, my vision has seemed to be going downhill slowly since the laser treatment, especially when I would wear my contacts and i was expecting a prescription change at my next optometrist appointment. SO, since then, I have been experiencing symptoms that I've attributed to a possible brain tumor-- but, as I've been told, could also be anxiety. I'd like to point out, that I don't really suffer from health anxiety in general, but when something goes wrong, it seems to kick in. Last January (due to stress I think) I had a headache for a month and was convinced it was a brain tumor. My PCP prescribed supplements, etc., and the headaches eventually went away. But for the last week or so I've been headachy (nothing too bad), occasionally nauseous with a really gurgly stomach, my ears are really ringing, I feel generally blah (better in the AM, worse as the day goes on), when I wake up during the night, my hands are usually asleep (something that's been going on for a while, actually). I don't think these things would bother me as much if I hadn't experienced the somewhat sudden vision change in my one eye. Put together, these symptoms seem to point to a brain tumor. The only think keeping me sane is the knowledge that this is the eye I've had trouble with in the past and it would make some kind of sense if something went wrong there again. But part of me thinks that since I started worrying about it, that's what started these odd symptoms. Part of me also thinks that I just have some kind of low-grade bug that's hanging on. I don't know. I just know that if it doesn't start improving, I'm going to go insane and grown further convinced that something is really wrong. My appointment with my retina doctor, my glaucoma doctor and the cataract surgeon aren't until the end of this month! What does everyone think? Thank you for listening.

I had no other symptoms, but got my glaucoma specialist routine appointment moved up a few days and she super-dilated my eyes and did all kinds of tests, noting that not much ad changed from our last visit (retina and optic nerve looked fine, etc.) and that I had a cataract in my left eye (and a lesser one in my right), something that we already know. She seemed to think that that's what the trouble was. Honestly, my vision has seemed to be going downhill slowly since the laser treatment, especially when I would wear my contacts and i was expecting a prescription change at my next optometrist appointment. SO, since then, I have been experiencing symptoms that I've attributed to a possible brain tumor-- but, as I've been told, could also be anxiety. I'd like to point out, that I don't really suffer from health anxiety in general, but when something goes wrong, it seems to kick in. Last January (due to stress I think) I had a headache for a month and was convinced it was a brain tumor. My PCP prescribed supplements, etc., and the headaches eventually went away. But for the last week or so I've been headachy (nothing too bad), occasionally nauseous with a really gurgly stomach, my ears are really ringing, I feel generally blah (better in the AM, worse as the day goes on), when I wake up during the night, my hands are usually asleep (something that's been going on for a while, actually). I don't think these things would bother me as much if I hadn't experienced the somewhat sudden vision change in my one eye. Put together, these symptoms seem to point to a brain tumor. The only think keeping me sane is the knowledge that this is the eye I've had trouble with in the past and it would make some kind of sense if something went wrong there again. But part of me thinks that since I started worrying about it, that's what started these odd symptoms. Part of me also thinks that I just have some kind of low-grade bug that's hanging on. I don't know. I just know that if it doesn't start improving, I'm going to go insane and grown further convinced that something is really wrong. My appointment with my retina doctor, my glaucoma doctor and the cataract surgeon aren't until the end of this month! What does everyone think? Thank you for listening. If nothing else, it felt good to write it down."

Four years ago, I had a retinal detachment in my left eye that was successfully treated through surgery. Thing were going along fine, eye-wise, until last year when my optometrist diagnosed me with high eye pressure, which is a risk factor for glaucoma (which runs a bit on my mom's side of the family).

I've been to the ear doctor. told me my ears were clean. At the time my vertigo was really bad. Then he ordered some tests. A hearing test and a pressure and Crystal test. Everything came back OK. Told me nothing more I can do. referred me to a neurological doctor. This doctor then ordered a MRI with and without contrast. follow up visit on my MRI tells me everything looks OK. Except for something in the sinus cavity. He went on so fast it was over before I know it. So now what. do something with my sinus cavity have something to do with my ear being clogged. Now make another appointment to go back to the ear Doctor Who told me there's nothing more he can do or just go to an emergency room. I don't have a runny nose or feel congested in anyway. Just a reminder I am a uninsured person. No health insurance. All these fees have been put on a credit card. It's in the thousands of dollars. I don't know what else to do. Please help anybody. i'm going back *** crazy. I'm lost for words right now.

The next day, I developed a fever and tender lymph nodes. By the evening of the 18, I was feeling much better. Now today that same tonsil area felt a bit irritated, and I felt warm about 5 hours later. I currently have a temp of 99.7. As soon as I developed a higher than normal temp, the irritated feeling went away.  My question is - at what point do I pay my doctor a visit?

I have had asthma for all my life so I'm used to taking these but they are not even helping I was told to take the orange one 2 inhalations twice daily one at night and one in the morning for 14 days, and the blue one for when I have shortness of breathe or for when I'm wheezing.. its not helping one bit to help me breathe and my whole body feels very weird I feel confused very tired, having bad body aches still my tonsils do not feel better one bit, my throat is in so much pain that I can barely handle it anymore. I do not know what to do anymore.."

A few months ago, I got a pretty bad cold and on one particular evening, I got an intense urge to sneeze and never was able to do so. It was unfathomably frustrating, and almost made me want to cry. To have that sensation in my nose for hours with no relief... it was miserable And it lasted through the next day, and the next, and the next. Here I am months later and I've maybe sneezed 4 times. I get the sensation and urge to do so multiple times a day, usually met with no relief. For some reason, this particular disappointment leaves me feeling SO angry. Having to sneeze and not being able to is one of the sensations that leaves me feeling 'cry and punch a wall' angry and frustrated. As absurd as it sounds, it's starting to take a toll on my quality of life. The frustration is becoming a constant rather than only surfacing when I lose a sneeze.  What can I do?

So I went back to my doctor and she then gave me clarithromycin for 7 days. I just finished them off yesterday and now this strange pain has started lower in my throat.

They sting both when my eyes are open and closed however it feels more painful when I open them and I think they may be sensitive to light - being in the dark doesn't take away the pain but I'm sure they feel worse in the light, especially blue light like on a laptop or watching the TV screen. It can take hours for my eyes to go back to normal - if they even do - and during this time my vision is blurry especially when reading. I don't have glasses but when my eyes aren't burning I seem to be able to read fine. I got my eyes checked out however didn't actually have an appointment so I was only told that it didn't look like an infection as my eyes look perfectly normal and they didn't have time to do a full check. This was about 2 months ago. I've stopped wearing makeup and changing what I put on my face/around my eyes to see if something was irritating them but nothing has changed. I also bought eye drops specifically for irritated/dry eyes but they haven't seemed to help. I have so much work to do on my laptop as I'm at uni and also have exams in a week and there's no way I'll be able to see what I'm writing in my exam if that day my eyes decide to be a pain!

During workdays, typically after about 6-7 hours that I've been at work, my eyes suddenly feels tired and then a bit later it starts watering uncontrollably, feels very stingy like I just cut up some onions, and doesn't go away unless I rub my eyes with tissues. Sometimes it happens when I'm driving and it really becomes a dangerous problem then. This seems to only happen when I'm working or driving for long periods of time. Other informations I could provide that might help are, I do wear glasses, 2 pairs, symptoms occur with both glasses, strong near sighted prescription. I work indoors, in a clinic, no windows, 9 hours a day This occurs on both eyes at the same time. I look at my glasses right after this happens and I see tiny numerous dried up droplets of water/tear on the lens surface.. I did get my eyes dilated for other reason, and my optometrist told me I have a congenital cataract, but said it won't really become a problem. I have used eye drops to see if the symptoms gets relieved, but it didn't. I was wondering if it's because of dry eyes but why would my eye shed more liquid if it's dry..? so that didn't make sense. Is there anything I can do temporarily or permanently to fix this problem?"

He is well for a few days, then he is sick, with a bad cough that is sometimes accompanied by viral/bacterial infection. The cycle continues like this, the attacks becoming more frequent with age. He lives in a polluted city which definitely does not help. He takes steam vapors, gurgles with salt and other symptom relieving measures but they do not help with cough. The cough goes from bad to worse, then gets better, then picks up again. The slightest change in seasonal temperature triggers it. What can he do to relieve the cough? He has sometimes a fever, but mostly he is just feverish and weak from all the coughing."

I was waiting for an important email see (which I didn't even get during that 7 days), and I preferred using the computer instead of my phone since it's faster more reliable. The problem is once I start, I couldn't leave the computer, and before I know it, it's afternoon. Anyway, after getting off online, I needed to help with the chores because one of us at home is sick in the hospital. The thing is I am already tired from my computer use, but I still have to force myself to wash the dishes by hand, attend to the dog, and cook dinner. I did this for the whole week. Anyway, after that week, I noticed that my dizziness (the light-headed-ness sort and not the world-is-turning-around kind), won't leave even if I stop using computer for a long amount of time. I have noticed that whenever I strain my eyes (read a book, watch TV, computer use, but especially computer use), this light-headed-ness intensifies. And this is with me until the next day. Lately though I've noticed that my recovery time have improved, but the dizziness is still there. I have already visited the doctor twice. Took the prescribed anti-vertigo pills for three days, changed the prescription of my glasses, and had my blood tested. My blood content is normal, my BP normal, my heart and breathing okay, I don't know what's wrong with me. I hope I get well soon. I can't forever avoid computers, since they are a necessity. And I'm not saying that because I'm fond of the internet. School and jobs rely on the internet after all. Please help. Thank you. Update: Light-headed-ness is 24/7 though it doesn't bother me much while on the computer. It's more felt while I'm walking or moving. Feels like I'm floating somehow, almost camera-fish-eye feel but not quite."

Please Help,"I am experiencing bright flashing spots in my eyes (more prominent in my right eye) when I run or jump (or even cough really hard). This is not after I exercise but during the actual act itself. I just went to a retina specialist who performed a through exam and said my retinas look healthy. I asked him if I had any eye diseases and he said no. He also took a picture (OCT) of my retinas and they appeared normal.  I am so scared that I am going blind and that this is the beginning stages of retina pigmentosa. He said thatI do not have it and that he would be able to see if I did. I have a follow up in 3 months and I'm too scared to go because I think they will find RP. If this is tugging on my retina, why is it in both eyes? Why didn't the doctor see anything? I am so scared that I haven't eaten in 2 days and cannot stop crying. I have considered paging the doctor on call, as its the weekend and the evening, to ask him if they could have missed RP or if it takes time to show up.  I really do not know what to do and there is no one who shares these bizarre symptoms. The spots also appear if I press on my eye and they pulsate. There seems to be veins or streaks that I can see as well. I do not know what to do or what this is. I feel if it were just tugging, that I would have found similar stories but I haven't. Im female, 35, 5'9 and 135. I exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet. Thanks"

All these uncommon/rare things happening to her it is making me so worried for my daughter's life! I would just like as much info on possible treatments and what we will be looking to deal with in the long run and what type of important things that I might miss should I ask the doctor. I am not clinical but I work in a family care office so I get the gist of most medical terms but a lot is over my head at this point. She has also had her tonsils removed and her adenoids TWICE as they grew back! She had sleep apnea and multiple tonsilitis/strep cases before the procedures.

A couple of times since then I have used nasal spray to clear my sinuses when flying, however I noticed that this seemed to only block up my nose despite it being clear before, resulting in a pseudo-cold for a few days, which I believe was as a result of rhinitis medicamentosa brought on by nasal spray overuse. Luckily as I had not been dependent on the spray for a particularly long time, the symptoms were not too severe and disappeared after 2-3 days. However I have now got another actual cold unrelated to this, with another very blocked nose. I am trying to use alternatives to nasal spray but they are not helping much. Do you think that by now (approximately three weeks since last use) I should be OK to use the recommended amount of nasal spray without experiencing a rebound effect?

I have one now that seems to have roots in me cutting my 50-types of desert weeds I have that grow 4 feet tall! I didn't wear a mask...which was stupid but now I have a sinus infection. Started with congestion day after and 5 days later have full head congestion and yellow thick mucus in sinuses, bad temple and forehead headache, slight fever of 100ish degrees F sometimes. Is this regiment okay? Thank you in advance! I want to know for my kids too because some times they get ear, nose and throat things also and I'd like to avoid commercial antibiotics and OTC meds. Sinus thing I started today: I was going to do this every 4-5 hours, 4 times a day until cleared and then another 3-4 days longer, maybe twice or three times a day. 1. First I mix up a plain pure salt mix, about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon per 6oz clean distilled or purified water a little warmer than room temp, about 80deg F, and set to the side. 2. Then I swish and gargle with 2.5ml Povidone-Iodine mixed with 8.5 to 10ml water or natural mouthwash for 60-120 seconds and spit. 3. Next I'm using a nebulizer (aka essential oil diffuser from Young Living) and I get close to the outlet hole, and breathe long deep slow breaths with a towel over the diffuser and my head for 5 minutes. I do this before and after the sinus irrigation procedures (next) to help better coat and open my sinuses. I fill the diffuser with 2-3oz clean water and add: 2 drops viral essential oil mix like Thieves or On-Guard, 2 drops essential oil mix like Breathe, 1oz pure full strength edible Aloe Vera juice, 6 drops Nascent Iodine, 4 drops white Iodine (has potassium Iodide too, NOT Potassium Chloride). I then fill remainder of reservoir with water. It holds about 4oz total. 4. Then I sinus irrigate with these: Mixed saltwater as above into 6oz squirt bottle, or cup, or neti-type pot, Plus 6 drops Nascent Iodine, Plus 3 drops white Iodine/Potassium Iodide, Plus 1/2 teaspoon 3% hydrogen peroxide. 5. I blow out and then I use the nebulizer / diffuser again for 5 minutes. 6. Then I paint my cheeks, forehead and temples with a cotton ball and Povidone. 7. Before or after I put a congestion rub like Vick's or any other menthol like rub on my chest, shoulders and neck. Does this regiment sound okay to do for 10 days or until the infection is gone, no more than 12 days I'd hope? I don't want to overtake Iodine or irritate anything. So far it doesn't sting & I only notice a loss of taste & smell, but that could be the stuffiness as well I suppose. Lastly if my kids (9 to 14, all healthy) or I had an ear infection also, could I use any of these in the ear? Thank you!"

I just got done taking the Ceftin Friday night but now though the pressure in my cheek is gone, I have been really stuffed up the past couple days with a headache and still some ear pain ( I can feel the fluid moving around too) in addition to my stomach feeling bad and very tired all the time( no fever though) . I thought that maybe it was the Flonase making me feel bad so I quit taking that a couple days ago but I still feel bad.

I noticed that when I put headphones on I can't hear as well, and also it seems like I can't hear low frequency as well.  For example, one morning there was a lawnmower outside of my dorm. Now I was rather far away so I could only hear the low rumble of it. And when I covered my left ear, I could clearly hear it in my right in. When I covered my right, I could barely hear it at all.  This appears to be most noticeable in the morning right when I woke up and it eventually seems a little less noticeable as the day goes on. And alongside this in the morning, my right ear will sound weird for a few hours too. To best explain it, its sounds like when I'm sick and my ears are all weird and I can hear myself really loud. Only in my right though. Now more recently, my left ear is making these subtle but intense wind sounds almost. This is so hard to explain, but it is almost like when you put a cup or sea shell up to your ear. It's harder to hear the stuff around you, but there is that intense low rumble in your ear. And I can feel this throughout my entire head and it's very distracting, especially in class. This has been happening more recently. And today when I was doing homework, my left ear got a lot quieter all of a sudden and this happened for like a hour. It was so weird.  I've been having bad headaches for the last 2-3 days. I don't know if this is related, but I can only assume. Lastly, my grandma asked some pharmacist how to drain my ear because I thought maybe I had fluid in it, so I tried taking Zrytec-D, but it didn't really help. Any advise on what this could be? I was thinking maybe my ear is just clogged with ear wax bc I tend to use Q-tips, but it seems like it's something more than that."

If i dont take meds, the ulcers in my intestines can lead to colon cancer. (How my doctor puts it) I am 22.  Anyway here it goes. About 2 years ago I made a stupid mistake to sleep with a guy a barley knew. We hungout for about a week and at that time he had a red eye, he claimed he scratched it, and eventually got antibiotic drops. We stopped seeing each other shortly after so idk what happened to him overall. About a week or so later I ended up waking up with a red eye thinking it was just irritated I put my contacts in. The next day I had two red eyes. I then went to my doctor who prescribed me drops and pill form antibiotics. Cant recall if i completely finished the drops but I remember thinking that they wernt helping. I was in pain and my eyes were swollen and red. I was told it would go away in a few days and was givin some over the counter pink eye drops redness drops which burned so bad i stopped using them. At this point i think u had been suffering over a week or so. I could not bare the pain anymore and was desperate, so i found some home remedies for pink eye. I found that deluded lemon juice or deluded apple cyder vinegar helped to fight pink eye, so i tried it. ( probably huge mistake) this didn't work but I do wonder if this caused some of the issues I had. Things got so bad I ended up going to the hospital where they found a few spots on my cornea (I was having light sensitivity) and prescribed me with steroid drops. I think at that time they diagnosed me with EKC.  Things after though never got better. I ended up developing true membranes (ones that bleed when cut) in the lower and upper part of my eye.  I went home that night and read something about putting green tea bags on eyes to help inflammation so I gave that a try. The next morning I woke up and coule not see. Everything was blurry and every light had a halo around it. (This eventually subsided as the day went on but vision was still blurry) but in a panic, i was yet again taken to the hospital.  I got there and the doctor flipped over my eye lid to look and it just started bleeding. At this point nobody knew what was going on. i was referred to a surgeon. I did forget to mention I was tested for trachoma and I think ghonorea ( im not sure) and both came back negative. When I got the the surgeon I was then prescribed more steroids and a heavy antibiotic drop to take for a couple weeks when things finally started to clear up.  I now have symblepheron in both eyes where membranes were, dry eyes. I also have a blocked tear duct in right eye. The surgeon diagnosed me with Stevens Johnson's syndrome due to taking previously asacol and the sulfa in it. (Although this is not a sulfa drug)  I need help. Because of this diagnosis I have been suffering with my ulcerative colitis and am limited in medications i can take. Currently on steroids now.  I never developed a rash or symptoms in my mouth which is common in this syndrome. What do you guys think this was?? I need opinions so I can MAYBE start my medication again. But I am afraid.

We stopped seeing each other shortly after so idk what happened to him overall. About a week or so later I ended up waking up with a red eye thinking it was just irritated I put my contacts in. The next day I had two red eyes. I then went to my doctor who prescribed me drops and pill form antibiotics. Cant recall if i completely finished the drops but I remember thinking that they wernt helping. I was in pain and my eyes were swollen and red. I was told it would go away in a few days and was givin some over the counter pink eye drops redness drops which burned so bad i stopped using them. At this point i think u had been suffering over a week or so. I could not bare the pain anymore and was desperate, so i found some home remedies for pink eye. I found that deluded lemon juice or deluded apple cyder vinegar helped to fight pink eye, so i tried it. ( probably huge mistake) this didn't work but I do wonder if this caused some of the issues I had. Things got so bad I ended up going to the hospital where they found a few spots on my cornea (I was having light sensitivity) and prescribed me with steroid drops. I think at that time they diagnosed me with EKC.  Things after though never got better. I ended up developing true membranes (ones that bleed when cut) in the lower and upper part of my eye.  I went home that night and read something about putting green tea bags on eyes to help inflammation so I gave that a try. The next morning I woke up and coule not see. Everything was blurry and every light had a halo around it. (This eventually subsided as the day went on but vision was still blurry) but in a panic, i was yet again taken to the hospital.  I got there and the doctor flipped over my eye lid to look and it just started bleeding. At this point nobody knew what was going on. This will be a long post so i apologize, but i need opinions.  Ill start with this. I have ulcerative colitis and have previously taken asacol on and off. If i dont take meds, the ulcers in my intestines can lead to colon cancer. (How my doctor puts it) I am 22.  Anyway here it goes. About 2 years ago I made a stupid mistake to sleep with a guy a barley knew.

The surgeon diagnosed me with Stevens Johnsons syndrom due to taking previously asacol and the sulfa in it. (Although this is not a sulfa drug)  I need help. Because of this diagnosis I have been suffering with my ulcerative colitis and am limited in medications i can take. Currently on steroids now.

I found that deluded lemon juice or deluded apple cyder vinegar helped to fight pink eye, so i tried it. ( probably huge mistake) this didn't work but I do wonder if this caused some of the issues I had. Things got so bad I ended up going to the hospital where they found a few spots on my cornea (I was having light sensitivity) and prescribed me with steroid drops. I think at that time they diagnosed me with EKC.  Things after though never got better. I ended up developing true membranes (ones that bleed when cut) in the lower and upper part of my eye.  I went home that night and read something about putting green tea bags on eyes to help inflammation so I gave that a try. The next morning I woke up and coule not see. Everything was blurry and every light had a halo around it. (This eventually subsided as the day went on but vision was still blurry) but in a panic, i was yet again taken to the hospital.  I got there and the doctor flipped over my eye lid to look and it just started bleeding. At this point nobody knew what was going on. This will be a long post so i apologize, but i need opinions.  Ill start with this. I have ulcerative colitis and have previously taken asacol on and off. If i dont take meds, the ulcers in my intestines can lead to colon cancer. (How my doctor puts it) I am 22.  Anyway here it goes. About 2 years ago I made a stupid mistake to sleep with a guy a barley knew. We hungout for about a week and at that time he had a red eye, he claimed he scratched it, and eventually got antibiotic drops. We stopped seeing each other shortly after so idk what happened to him overall. About a week or so later I ended up waking up with a red eye thinking it was just irritated I put my contacts in. The next day I had two red eyes. I then went to my doctor who prescribed me drops and pill form antibiotics. Cant recall if i completely finished the drops but I remember thinking that they wernt helping. I was in pain and my eyes were swollen and red.

I went home that night and read something about putting green tea bags on eyes to help inflammation so I gave that a try. The next morning I woke up and coule not see. Everything was blurry and every light had a halo around it. (This eventually subsided as the day went on but vision was still blurry) but in a panic, i was yet again taken to the hospital.  I got there and the doctor flipped over my eye lid to look and it just started bleeding. At this point nobody knew what was going on. This will be a long post so i apologize, but i need opinions.  Ill start with this. I have ulcerative colitis and have previously taken asacol on and off. If i dont take meds, the ulcers in my intestines can lead to colon cancer. (How my doctor puts it) I am 22.  Anyway here it goes. About 2 years ago I made a stupid mistake to sleep with a guy a barley knew. We hungout for about a week and at that time he had a red eye, he claimed he scratched it, and eventually got antibiotic drops. We stopped seeing each other shortly after so idk what happened to him overall. About a week or so later I ended up waking up with a red eye thinking it was just irritated I put my contacts in. The next day I had two red eyes. I then went to my doctor who prescribed me drops and pill form antibiotics. Cant recall if i completely finished the drops but I remember thinking that they wernt helping. I was in pain and my eyes were swollen and red. I was told it would go away in a few days and was givin some over the counter pink eye drops redness drops which burned so bad i stopped using them. At this point i think u had been suffereing over a week or so. I could not bare the pain anymore and was desperate, so i found some home remedies for pink eye. I found that deluted lemon juice or deluted apple cyder venigar helpped to fight pink eye, so i tried it. ( probably huge mistake) this didnt work but I do wonder if this caused some of the issues I had. Things got so bad I ended up going to the hospital where they found a few spots on my cornea (I was having light sensitivity) and prescribed me with steroid drops. I think at that time they disognosed me with EKC.  Things after though never got better. I ended up developing true membranes (ones that bleed when cut) in the lower and upper part of my eye.  I went home that night and read somthing about putting green tea bags on eyes to help imflamation so I gave that a try. The next morning I woke up and coule not see. Everything was blurry and every light had a halo around it. (This eventually subsided as the day went on but vision was still blurry) but in a panic, i was yet again taken to the hospital.  I got there and the doctor flipped over my eye lid to look and it just started bleeding. At this point nobody knew what was going on. i was reffered to a surgeon. I did forget to mention I was tested for trachoma and I think ghonorea ( im not sure) and both came back negative. When I got the the surgeon I was then prescribed more steroids and a heavy antibiotic drop to take for a couple weeks when things finally started to clear up.  I now have symblepheron in both eyes where membranes were, dry eyes. I also have a blocked tear duct in right eye. The surgeon diagnosed me with Stevens Johnsons syndrom due to taking previously asacol and the sulfa in it. (Although this is not a sulfa drug)  I need help. Because of this diagnosis I have been suffering with my ulcerative colitis and am limited in medications i can take. Currently on steroids now.  I never developed a rash or sympotoms in my mouth which is common in this syndrom. What do you guys think this was?? I need opinions so I can MAYBE start my medication again. But I am afraid. He said if it was SJS I could die.  Symptoms Red eyes Itchy eyes Discharge Watery eyes Severe burning Photosensitivity Swelling True membranes Corneal spots Foggy vision Blurry vision Was suffering with this maybe for 2-3 months. I appriciate any feedback. Thank you"

At the exam, I was told that I have a small reading prescription of 0.75 both eyes with astigmatism in one eye. I had this same prescription some 10 years ago. But I never wore the reading glasses. Then the doc went on to dilate my eyes.  The dilation effects didn't seem to go away for many hours. At the 24 hour mark I went back to the opthalmologist and he said maybe there is dry eye and asked me to put drops in there. at the 72 hour mark I still had blurriness for my phone etc and I was told to keep putting dry eye drops every 4 hours. I did that for 1 day and one night I did some eye exercises moving my eyes from left to right , up and down and I had to put a lot of pressure to do that. Next morning I woke up with a bay eye pain with increased heart rate on my eye. I put ice on it and stopped the dry eye drops. I took an ibuprofen a day later.  I went to a new eye doc two days ago on wednesday and he checked me up and said my eyes look fine. I didnt get dilated this time.  I told him about what the earlier doc said and he said I can put the dry eye drops twice a day no need to do them every 4 hours.  Somehow, I feel that when I did the strenous eye exercises I may have done some damage to them.  The blurriness has not gone and I am having light sensitivity and I feel like I am not seeing images of people very clearly. Like the outline of people don't seem sharp, kind of blurry, kind of double. I feel my eye focus is messed up. Also seeing black patches.  Few people have told me that I should just wear the reading glasses and everything will settle down. I am also getting some blood tests to check sugar etc.  Please reply with thoughts and anybody gone through this.

A couple of weeks after the surgery she began to experience vertigo and eye pain behind her eye, on the same side of her face as the surgery. The pain is worse when she lies on the left side (surgery side). She took two antibiotics and a steroid post-surgery to rule out or prevent infection. She has been to primary care twice, the oral surgeon twice (he says it's not related to the surgery), an ENT twice, ophthalmologist, and is doing vestibular therapy with a PT. She also had an MRI (without contrast) that came back normal. Our next step is an appointment this week with a neuro ophthalmologist, but so far no one has answers. It feels to me like it has something to do with trauma, infection, or healing needed from the oral surgery.

I'm an 18 year old female and for the last 6/7 months I have been experiencing severe joint pain mostly in my knees, shoulders, ankles and wrists. I feel it's important to add that I had a coil fitted around this time and shortly after became pregnant, unfortunately I had a termination and had my coil removed. However it has now been 3/4 months since this has happened and I still have these pains.  I've been tested for absolutely everything and it's all come back negative (e.g. Thyroid, arthritis) I was told I am perfectly healthy and that it could be down to stress. I'm at my wits end because the pain is unbearable, although it comes and goes it's awful, but I don't know if it could've been brought on by stress due to my situation. I've also experienced swelling in my ankle and I couldn't walk on it for a few days until eventually the pain goes and moves to another joint. I really don't know what it could be or what I should do. Thanks"

""Favor,"" ""cookie,"" and ""papa"" to name a few. Although this clicking is not particularly noticeable to others, it is indeed audible if they know to be listening for it or if we are in a quiet space. It is very audible to myself and, more importantly, very audible to a microphone. As an aspiring voice actor, this issue has caused me much consternation. I can't bring myself to submit auditions: the post production effort required to clean up my audio is excessive, much too excessive to expect clients to do for raw voice requests (which is the majority of what I can get from my agency). That's if the audio is even salvageable...sometimes the click falls on the very end of a word and it cant be edited out without damaging the word. I can't make the click not happen but I can control (to an extent) when it ""drops"" by keeping my soft palate in whatever position the the word I just spoke had it in, with the click then occurring when the palate relaxes. The click also occurs upon blowing air or upon release of puffing out my cheeks. A month or so after the clicking began, I developed an additional issue. My ears began to pop or crackle upon swallowing. This may have been spurred by sticking a cue tip too far in my ear, it may be unrelated. It occurs mostly in my right ear, sometimes my left, once in a while both ears. If its happening , its happening each time I swallow until it doesn't. It occurs more frequently if I've eaten dairy or something greasy. Sometimes I can stop the ear popping by hocking, flexing my soft palate, sucking back to clear my saliva from my palate or by whipping my head towards my shoulder. Occasionally my ears may softly ring for no more than 20 seconds. I saw a local ENT who performed a hearing test and measured the health of my ear drums. Tests show I have above average hearing and my eardrums seem to be in decent health with no perforations or fluid behind them. He shrugged and said he had no idea what was wrong and sent me to a neurotologist. The neurotologist inserted a long camera-type device and didn't see much out of the ordinary outside of my uvula flipping up when I swallow (this is not a noticeable sensation to me). He said my Eustachian tubes looked fine. He was able to visually correlate my theory that the clicking occurred upon relaxation of the soft palate. He did not know what the issue was but recommended I see an otolaryngologist and speech pathologist and that they consider a botox injection to my palate. This was a misguided recommendation on the line of thought I could be dealing with palatal myoclonus. My clicking is not the rhythmic, repeating clicking of PM, it is cause and effect: soft palate engagement -> relaxation-> click. The otolaryngologist and speech language pathologist quickly ruled out the botox idea, did the camera look, again correlated the click to the soft palate, and decided TMJ was very unlikely but still had no idea why my ears might be popping. They did notice the odd bubble forming close to my eustacian tube opening. We also found out that the click was much less likely occur if I had my head chin to my chest. They recommended I try to cut back on caffeine and try a nasal saline spray. I have had a hard time cutting back caffeine but I have tried saline nasal spray and steroid nasal spay to no effect. I have also tried Neilmed sinus rinse twice daily to no effect. I have also tried twice daily steam inhalation to no effect. I have searched online for other cases like mine and have found very little except the odd person crying out for help. I did find this forum thread from 9 years ago (that died about 2 years ago) with a bunch of people who were dealing with the same or similar problem.     In all that time that thread was going, only one person said it more or less went away and even then he couldn't say why accept that he dealt with it for three years, gave up on fixing it, and it just went away one day. One of the more depressing patters I've noticed from that thread and other isolated cries for help I've come across is that we keep going to professionals and everyone either inserts their own area of expertise so they can say they came up with a diagnosis or they just flatout admit they have no idea what's wrong. Information about me: - male, 26 - lost 47 lbs in the last 10 months and had lost around 15-20 lbs by the time the clicking began (weight loss connection?) - uvula flips up when I swallow - I did not have any recent ear, sinus or throat infections or other issues that precipitated the clicking/popping - Clicking from speaking feels like its coming from a right ""side"" for the most part. Can occur from a left feeling ""side"" when speaking occasionally. I've noticed that clicking from both ""sides"" can occur when I swallow, blow air or just engage my palate. Audio of Clicking:"

For instance, when I go for a run, my knee becomes stiff and I have to bend it(click it). However, while doing leg exercises at the gym like squats my knee does not click.

I'll begin with the very beginning I started a job as a Meat clerk at a grocery store. I would just put meat into the cases and clean the saw room where everything was cut. After a few months on this job I developed a really bad eye twitch in the skin of the lower part of my eyelid, this was only happening on my right eye. It eventually progressed where when I tried to focus with that eye whatever I was focusing on was moving left and right very fast. Then I lost the ability to move the top half of my lip on the right side. I also was breaking out in cold sores maybe every other week at this time. I went to the doctor and they said the twitch and breakouts were stress, the lip was bellspalsy and put me on acyclovir after a week I had regained control and the twitching stopped as well as the breakouts. I went months symptom free and now I have this going on. I started a job where I was standing stationary on a mat and just matching work gloves together and wrapping them in bundles to be cleaned. My first day on this job caused my a lot of neck pain and soreness in the legs and lower back. I ended that day and went home and took some ibuprofen and ate protein hoping to heal what I worked so i'd be ready for the next day. I started the next days shift and 1-2 hours in the pain became unreal in my neck so I took another dose of ibuprofen. I lasted another hour while the pain was getting worse to the point of anxiety and uncomfortably just trying to do the job. It got so bad I had to sit down in the restroom and I remember almost throwing up as well. I explained to my boss what was going on and asked If I could leave for the day, he said that was fine. I punched out and on the walk to my car It felt like everything was moving and I remember just walking and randomly falling to the right. The actual drive home was even worse, it felt I was looking at the rode with my head tilted and my head wasn't tilted. I had gotten a call shortly after and was relieved from the job. So I've been trying figure out whats going on. I went to a chiropractor for an adjustment and explained to him what happened. They took xrays of my neck and said the top of my spine was curving. He had me do a test where he wanted me to keep my right arm elevated in front of me at a certain height and with my eyes closed lift the left arm to the same height, I did what I thought was the same level and the left one was about a hand length lower than the right. He wanted to look at my legs as well because of my balance and after putting my legs together he said my right leg was 3/4 of an inch out of place. He did some adjustments in my legs and neck which helped things a lot. The tilted vision got better but now I have something else going on. I'm walking really goofy, a friend described it as stiff leg or drunk walk. My vision is fine looking at something straight ahead until it gets far then my vision wants to look down. I lay in bed watching tv from the side of my eyes and words will sometimes be doubled on top of the word, and just trying to keep my eyes looking at one specific thing its like everything is slowly sliding up or my eye keep wanting to drag down im not sure which is happening. Now just trying to stand in place my legs get shaky and I'll even just fall to the right or forward, never backward or left. So I don't know whats going on and I wont see a doctor for 2 weeks but I am concerned letting whatever is going on go for another 2 weeks. I just dig some digging and things like Brain Tumor, Parkinson, and Nystagmus all had symptom that seemed close to what was happening which has me worried.  Other information: I'm also only a 21 year old male. Which seems like a young age to have this much going on with me. I hope it's all because of one thing and that its curable.

I'll begin with the very beginning I started a job as a Meat clerk at a grocery store. I would just put meat into the cases and clean the saw room where everything was cut. After a few months on this job I developed a really bad eye twitch in the skin of the lower part of my eyelid, this was only happening on my right eye. It eventually progressed where when I tried to focus with that eye whatever I was focusing on was moving left and right very fast. Then I lost the ability to move the top half of my lip on the right side. I also was breaking out in cold sores maybe every other week at this time. I went to the doctor and they said the twitch and breakouts were stress, the lip was bellspalsy and put me on acyclovir after a week I had regained control and the twitching stopped as well as the breakouts. I went months symptom free and now I have this going on. I started a job where I was standing stationary on a mat and just matching work gloves together and wrapping them in bundles to be cleaned. My first day on this job caused my a lot of neck pain and soreness in the legs and lower back. I ended that day and went home and took some ibuprofen and ate protein hoping to heal what I worked so i'd be ready for the next day. I started the next days shift and 1-2 hours in the pain became unreal in my neck so I took another dose of ibuprofen. I lasted another hour while the pain was getting worse to the point of anxiety and uncomfortably just trying to do the job. It got so bad I had to sit down in the restroom and I remember almost throwing up as well. I explained to my boss what was going on and asked If I could leave for the day, he said that was fine. I punched out and on the walk to my car It felt like everything was moving and I remember just walking and randomly falling to the right. The actual drive home was even worse, it felt I was looking at the rode with my head tilted and my head wasn't tilted. I had gotten a call shortly after and was relieved from the job. So I've been trying figure out whats going on. I went to a chiropractor for an adjustment and explained to him what happened. They took xrays of my neck and said the top of my spine was curving. He had me do a test where he wanted me to keep my right arm elevated in front of me at a certain height and with my eyes closed lift the left arm to the same height, I did what I thought was the same level and the left one was about a hand length lower than the right. He wanted to look at my legs as well because of my balance and after putting my legs together he said my right leg was 3/4 of an inch out of place. He did some adjustments in my legs and neck which helped things a lot. The tilted vision got better but now I have something else going on. I'm walking really goofy, a friend described it as stiff leg or drunk walk. My vision is fine looking at something straight ahead until it gets far then my vision wants to look down. I lay in bed watching tv from the side of my eyes and words will sometimes be doubled on top of the word, and just trying to keep my eyes looking at one specific thing its like everything is slowly sliding up or my eye keep wanting to drag down im not sure which is happening. Now just trying to stand in place my legs get shaky and I'll even just fall to the right or forward, never backward or left. So I don't know whats going on and I wont see a doctor for 2 weeks but I am concerned letting whatever is going on go for another 2 weeks. I just dig some digging and things like Brain Tumor, Parkinson, and Nystagmus all had symptom that seemed close to what was happening which has me worried.

Now I'm @ 270, and steadily losing weight, however in most of my workouts as well as more often anywhere it happens more frequently and progresses quicker.... its coupled with a spindley( grinding maybe) kind of feeling around knee especially when doing squats(sometimes with popping) and treadmill.

Mostly during the night,"I have a couple ideas and a couple fears about what might be happening but i also don't know what kind of doctor i'm supposed to see about this. my symptoms are isolated to both of my hands. I find that they fall asleep very easily in what i can only think of as restricted circulation positions such as my hands on a mouse or my elbow firmly bent. This isn't the main issue however. When i'm sleeping most nights my hands will cramp sometimes even be in quite a lot of pain. When i first wake up the strength in my hands is gone, sometimes they're not even able to close completely. Soaking in hot water helps alleviate these symptoms but they go away on their own pretty quickly. half an hour to an hour. I thought it could be repetitive strain disorder considering i work construction and use my hands a lot but notice no correlation, if not complementary signs of hand pain and work performed. what i mean is the days where my hands receive the most trauma is not the most painful nights i have. I am a recovering addict with 3 years clean but i was a heavy intravenous user and i used to inject into my hands mostly. These symptoms are new, a few months maybe, and as i said i haven't used drugs in a long time. When i'm asleep like everyone else my heart rate is slower and if there is an obstruction due to drug use it would make sense for my hands to fall asleep but not cramp and unlikely to affect both hands equally. If it's muscle related why is it not worse when i'm, for example, operating a jack hammer all day which causes vibration trauma. Any ideas on what's going on would be great but most importantly what kind of doctor am i supposed to see about this?"

I had a car accident in December last year where I was left with a shoulder injury and under the circumstances I thought my car had come off second best, being written off (the other driver was unharmed and her car had just a little dent) Little did I know that 7 months later an xray would show my injury has developed post traumatic osteoarthritis.

I’m a 17 year male old drama student from Scotland. I have been suffering from chronic back and neck pain since my 4th year of high school. I am now in my first year of university. I am still suffering. The pain is intense. Each day when I wake up my neck feels so tight and I have to crack it really hard and also crack my back. Sometimes I feel a pulsating pain in my ears and my shoulders hurt too. I spent most of my day twisting my head around trying to relieve the pain but it doesn’t work, it just makes me look stupid and it is embarrassing. I have been told I have a slight bend in my spine, but not extreme scoliosis, just slightly. I have had physio therapy which hasn’t worked and have been taking useless pills for months to no avail (dihydrocodeine and etoricoxib). I have all the symptoms of spine arthritis / neck spondylitis but I am 17 (15 when it started so surely it can’t be that at this age?!) I have seen a chiropractor and have been told to go on a gluten free diet which I have tried (I have been off gluten for about 2 months) and I’ve had slight relief however the pain is still extreme! If I feel the back of my neck I can feel my upper vertebrae (below my head) moving and crunching as if it’s crumbling away like sandstone. I’m worried it’s really affecting my life. I’ve lost my job due to the pain. I am a fit person; I am an actor in training so I do a lot of exercise and also try yoga a lot.

For about a year I have experienced recurring itchy hive like rashes on my arms, hips, back, and thighs. It usually starts out in one spot and slowly then very quickly spreads causing a pink hive like looking rash that can be rather itchy. It last a month or so then clears up on its own only to come back a few months later. I finally broke down and saw the dermatologist because I was worried it could be a side effect of my RA. He did several biopsies but said the results were inconclusive so he couldn’t make an official diagnoses which was more then frustrating. I have been using a prescription strength ointment he prescribed and it does not seem to be doing much. Does anyone have any idea what this might be or what I can do to help. Any help would be greatly appreciated because this is no fun. Thanks in advance and I will see if I can post pictures."

I have been to the doctor several times seeking resolve but to no avail. The pain gets worse with every week and I don’t see an end in sight. I’ve had several tests done. I tested negative for arthritis but my mother still has the notion I have it. Can I still have arthritis but test negative from a blood test? The pain is making it harder to do things I could do in the past like going up the stairs without problems. Also a description of my symptoms are constant malaise and pain as well as certain points of my body getting agonizing stabbing pains if touched. My skin sometimes becomes extremely sensitive and uncomfortable to touch. I’m not very active but I do try to walk on the treadmill for a bit, but I’ll feel a good amount of pain after a short while. I’ll also still feel pain even when I’ve taken drugs like ibuprofen and aleve. ( Not sure if this is related but sometimes when I walk my knees give out on me so I bump into things frequently )  In short: Can I have arthritis without testing positive in a blood test? My symptoms have been goin on for a long time and getting worse."

Sorry, I'm very new to this forum, so I'm not aware of any kind of unwritten rules. For awhile now I've been having a whitish discharge from my right eye, roughly constantly. About a week now, stopped for awhile, and then came back again. Left eye did it for about a day and then stopped and hasn't come back, but the right eye is still going to town. When it's worse I can't really see out that eye, everything's cloudy. It also crusts close when I sleep which it doesn't normally do, and the left one is fine. I would have a picture but it's decided to dry up right now so I'll have to grab it later, when it's running again. I can say it likes to get in both corners of my eye in coagulated blobs, along my eyelashes more likely on the inner (towards nose area), and if it gets out it will harden into a crust that I have to fight to wipe away. I'm worried this could be an infection, I really don't have money for a doctor or I wouldn't be here right now :P Don't really know what I'm doing here but I figure it's better then nothing. Thanks."

Also, I might need to inform you that I have astigmatism and I lost my glasses a few months back (no insurance to get new ones and can't pay out of pocket at the moment). I am always squinting and straining to see and I'm not sure if this increases my eye pressure because of the strain. My eyes feel really sore at the end of the day.  Could it really be glaucoma when I'm only 23? What are the symptoms?"

I havent worn my glasses in a while due to breakage. Anyone know whats wrong? Thanks

Recently I got US done done which revealed bicep Tendon rupture in the Rt shoulder which comes down close to elbow. I went to the Surgeon and also a competent concerned Rehabilitation Specialist. Surgeon and I agreed not for any surgery etc. The other Specialist felt that it is a partial rupture of a Tendon coming down from shoulder to elbow. Due to rupture being partial, my arm is still working almost OK. He advised me not to lift any thing even small with rt arm besides using Fastum Gel/ pain killer when needed. Can I have the views of others who had some what similar experience and what precautions/ medications/exs etc were/are being taken by them and their results? DOs/Don'ts for this situation?

I sit and occasionally get up and move a bit every 2 hours, but after lunch the pain gets intense. I have kyphosis in my mid-back and I think that increases my pain along with minimal movement during my work day. Would CBD oil help with my pain level? I have also been taking Kratom with some success that lasts for about 4 hours, but the pain returns more intensely after. Eleve helps a bit after Kratom wears off. Also, the Kratom leads to constipation due to heavy fiber. Would rather have pain relief AND no constipation. Can CBD help me? What kind, brand? Thanks."

After finishing all my treatment, I went back to my rheumatologist, who asked how I was feeling. I said fine. No symptoms. So he said just stay off the RA meds until such time as you need them again. So I guess I have been in remission for at least 10 months. But starting about five days ago, I am getting a general feeling of malaise, feeling tired and kind of swollen and puffy, and my hands, feet, knees and shoulders hurt. I almost don't want to even say it, but I am afraid I am coming out of remission. Has anyone else gone in and out of remission? Does it sound like that is what is happening?"

Then, it swells up a bit and gets really red. It dries, the redness goes away and it flakes off. But the swelling never eases and then the process will repeat itself all over again.  It started as a small itchy spot on my lower inner corner, but it has now spread to the entire eye area and a little bit further to the side.

Also had sniffles, no fever, little weak in the legs, etc.  Next AM, said the same thing. So since Flu season is here, figured another day of rest, no big deal.  He felt good during the day however with zero headaches other than feeling ""tired"" type of thing.  So this went on for 2 more days. Took him to the doctor, they did full exam looking for sinus issues, etc. Did blood test for mono and flu. Came back negative. Told me to give him Sudafed and tylenol for the headaches.  Happened 2 more nights in a row.  My wife and I started to get a little nervous. He missed 5 days of school from the same thing.  So he will go to sleep around 10:30-11pm and wake up around 12-1am with this really intense headache that actually wakes him up from sleep. It keeps him awake for 3-4 hours so by the time it fades away, it's 4:30-5am and he has school at 7am and he's exhausted from the ""battle"" of it.  Doctor said to get to hospital and have them do a CT scan. Took him there, they did a CT scan and 5 different blood tests. All came back negative and they said the CT scan was clean.  Doctor then suggested that right before bed, take 2 advil and 4 tylenol at the same time to try and knock it out. I also put a humidifier in the room as well since the air was a little dry.  Nothing worked. At all. Same nights, same results and almost all at the same time frames.  During the day he is fine. He has gone out with friends in the afternoon, has his GF over, no issues at all. It just starts at night right after he falls asleep. He is only able to stay asleep for 45 min or so before it starts.  Went back to his doctor. BTW - They tested for Lyme as well and that came back negative. His doctor said that because of the acute nature of this, starting out of nowhere and there being no history of head injury or anything else, she thinks it's an infection of some kind most like Sinus.  Again, he is a little stuffy but nothing over the top. So she gave us antibiotic 2 nights ago and still there's been no change. We have a neurologists appt in 10 days but I don't know if he can keep this up for that long.  Anyone else ever have these same symptoms and found either relief or a diagnoses of some kind?

I have gone through various treatments and seen a handful of doctors in which not one of them have successfully diagnosed or treated my injury and the pain to which it causes. For those who are interested I will break this post down by the accident, my symptoms, my treatment, testing performed, diagnoses and where I am today. The Accident: I was rear ended while stopped at a traffic light by a much larger SUV that was traveling at a high rate of speed. The impact was not straight on, front to back, rather it was their passenger front corner to my driver's rear corner. At the moment of impact my left arm was on the top of my steering wheel and my head was turned to the left looking at oncoming traffic. Due to the angle of the vehicles and my body position in the car, I whip-lashed sideways. My body went to the right and then to the left causing my head to strike my driver's side door window which resulted in a laceration to my left eyebrow. I was wearing a seat belt which ""deployed"" and I was pinned into my seat; it took both hands and all of my strength to unbuckle after the accident. My Symptoms: Middle back pain, to the left of my spine around t10 vertebrae. I have a constant pain of 1-2 on the left side of my back.   This pain can be increased if I twist to the left. The most severe of my pain comes if I hold my left arm straight out and rotate it to the left while twisting my torso. I also experience random and intermittent ""clicking"" in my back to the left of my spine in the area of pain. I had no history of middle back pain or the clicking prior to the accident. My Treatment: The day of the accident my left eyebrow was sutured and no other treatment was provided by the urgent care. I was experiencing back pain immediately following the accident but anticipated it due to the force of the impact. Two weeks after the accident my back pain had not subsided, so my Primary Care Physician prescribed me an anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxers which after 10 days of taking them religiously did not help. I was then referred to a Neurosurgeon who prescribed Physical Therapy. I went through 12 sessions of PT which included warm-up exercises, thoracic matrix, heat, stimulation and ultrasound therapy, but in the end the PT only made the pain in my back worse. I was then referred back to the Neurosurgeon who then passed me to a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Doctor (Physiatrist) who then prescribed me additional PT which I opted to take through another clinic. PT this time included exercises, ultrasound therapy using lidocaine cream, stretches and core strengthening. After almost 3 months of PT I had not experienced relief of my pain. The Physiatrist then sent me to Pain Medicine for steroid injections. Over the last 5 months I have had Medial Branch Pain Blocks in my facet joints, Medial Branch Radio Frequency Ablation (RFA) in my facet joints and most recently a set of Intercostal Nerve Blocks, all of which are in the same areas of t8 through t10. I have received minor but temporary relief from the injections/ablation, but the pain is still present and at times feels worse than ever before. From months 0-12 I limited my physical activity due to onset of pain with certain movements or extended periods of activity. My level of activity increased slightly after my RFA procedure but I am still not to the level of activity that I was prior to the accident. Testing Performed: Throughout the course of treatment I have had 3 sets of x-rays, an MRI of my C and T spine and a Bone Scan. The x-rays did not show any abnormalities. The MRI of my C spine was clean but he MRI of my T spine found herniations at T3-T5 although unrelated to my middle back pain which is lower than those levels. The bone scan did not find any rib fractures or bone tumors but did show slight uptake in the left 10th rib/spine articulation. The bone scan was performed 12 months after my accident but somehow still showed some activity where my pain is. Diagnoses: Early on it was believed that I simply had a muscle strain in my back that wasn't healing. The Physiatrist pointed towards Facet Syndrome since my pain is exacerbated by twisting. One of my Physical Therapists thought that I might have torn a set of muscles in my back that are involved in twisting (serratus posterior inferior). Throughout this entire process I am not entirely sure that any doctor has given me a definitive diagnosis or one that has proved to be correct. Subsequently I have been treated for many things of which no treatment has healed my injury or stopped the pain. Where I Am Today: After 16 months of pain and ongoing treatments I am still searching for answers. I have a theory as to what my injury is and a lot of ""evidence"" to support it. I believe that I have Slipping Rib Syndrome (SRS). Why? The pain is only on one side of my back; It has never been in the center of my spine, rather to the left of it. The pain is made worse when the rib articulates (twisting to the left). Most recently that pain radiates across my back and around my ribs all the way to the front near my sternum. The ""clicking"" that I am experiencing to the left of my spine only started after my accident. Prior to my RFA procedure the more my back clicked throughout the day, the more pain I would feel. While not significant according to the Nuclear Medicine, the slight uptake of blood shown on my bone scan might be the result of ongoing irritation (inflammation) in the area of my rib/spine articulation that continues to ""click"" throughout the day. The head of the 10th rib has 3 joints, any of which might be causing the clicking and my pain. I have consulted with a Thoracic Surgeon and an Orthopedic Surgeon, but neither of them along with any of the other doctors that I have seen are familiar with SRS let alone have the ability to properly diagnose it. A history of trauma, clicking in my rib/back and unsuccessful Intercostal Nerve Blocks all point to SRS. I am hoping that someone who reads this post is either familiar with SRS, or has been through a similar situation and successfully treated. I would greatly appreciate any advice or a referral to a doctor who can properly diagnose SRS in or around Michigan. Thank you for reading my post and any support you can provide."

PT this time included exercises, ultrasound therapy using lidocaine cream, stretches and core strengthening. After almost 3 months of PT I had not experienced relief of my pain. The Physiatrist then sent me to Pain Medicine for steroid injections. Over the last 5 months I have had Medial Branch Pain Blocks in my facet joints, Medial Branch Radio Frequency Ablation (RFA) in my facet joints and most recently a set of Intercostal Nerve Blocks, all of which are in the same areas of t8 through t10. I have received minor but temporary relief from the injections/ablation, but the pain is still present and at times feels worse than ever before. From months 0-12 I limited my physical activity due to onset of pain with certain movements or extended periods of activity. My level of activity increased slightly after my RFA procedure but I am still not to the level of activity that I was prior to the accident. Testing Performed: Throughout the course of treatment I have had 3 sets of x-rays, an MRI of my C and T spine and a Bone Scan. The x-rays did not show any abnormalities. The MRI of my C spine was clean but he MRI of my T spine found herniations at T3-T5 although unrelated to my middle back pain which is lower than those levels. The bone scan did not find any rib fractures or bone tumors but did show slight uptake in the left 10th rib/spine articulation. The bone scan was performed 12 months after my accident but somehow still showed some activity where my pain is. Diagnoses: Early on it was believed that I simply had a muscle strain in my back that wasn't healing. The Physiatrist pointed towards Facet Syndrome since my pain is exacerbated by twisting. One of my Physical Therapists thought that I might have torn a set of muscles in my back that are involved in twisting (serratus posterior inferior). Throughout this entire process I am not entirely sure that any doctor has given me a definitive diagnosis or one that has proved to be correct. Subsequently I have been treated for many things of which no treatment has healed my injury or stopped the pain. Where I Am Today: After 16 months of pain and ongoing treatments I am still searching for answers. I have a theory as to what my injury is and a lot of ""evidence"" to support it. I believe that I have Slipping Rib Syndrome (SRS). Why? The pain is only on one side of my back; It has never been in the center of my spine, rather to the left of it. The pain is made worse when the rib articulates (twisting to the left). Most recently that pain radiates across my back and around my ribs all the way to the front near my sternum. The ""clicking"" that I am experiencing to the left of my spine only started after my accident. Prior to my RFA procedure the more my back clicked throughout the day, the more pain I would feel. While not significant according to the Nuclear Medicine, the slight uptake of blood shown on my bone scan might be the result of ongoing irritation (inflammation) in the area of my rib/spine articulation that continues to ""click"" throughout the day. The head of the 10th rib has 3 joints, any of which might be causing the clicking and my pain. I have consulted with a Thoracic Surgeon and an Orthopedic Surgeon, but neither of them along with any of the other doctors that I have seen are familiar with SRS let alone have the ability to properly diagnose it. A history of trauma, clicking in my rib/back and unsuccessful Intercostal Nerve Blocks all point to SRS. I am hoping that someone who reads this post is either familiar with SRS, or has been through a similar situation and successfully treated. I would greatly appreciate any advice or a referral to a doctor who can properly diagnose SRS in or around Michigan. Thank you for reading my post and any support you can provide."

I have gone through various treatments and seen a handful of doctors in which not one of them have successfully diagnosed or treated my injury and the pain to which it causes. For those who are interested I will break this post down by the accident, my symptoms, my treatment, testing performed, diagnoses and where I am today. The Accident: I was rear ended while stopped at a traffic light by a much larger SUV that was traveling at a high rate of speed. The impact was not straight on, front to back, rather it was their passenger front corner to my driver's rear corner. At the moment of impact my left arm was on the top of my steering wheel and my head was turned to the left looking at oncoming traffic. Due to the angle of the vehicles and my body position in the car, I whip-lashed sideways. My body went to the right and then to the left causing my head to strike my driver's side door window which resulted in a laceration to my left eyebrow. I was wearing a seat belt which ""deployed"" and I was pinned into my seat; it took both hands and all of my strength to unbuckle after the accident. My Symptoms: Middle back pain, to the left of my spine around t10 vertebrae. I have a constant pain of 1-2 on the left side of my back.   This pain can be increased if I twist to the left. The most severe of my pain comes if I hold my left arm straight out and rotate it to the left while twisting my torso. I also experience random and intermittent ""clicking"" in my back to the left of my spine in the area of pain. I had no history of middle back pain or the clicking prior to the accident. My Treatment: The day of the accident my left eyebrow was sutured and no other treatment was provided by the urgent care. I was experiencing back pain immediately following the accident but anticipated it due to the force of the impact. Two weeks after the accident my back pain had not subsided, so my Primary Care Physician prescribed me an anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxers which after 10 days of taking them religiously did not help. I was then referred to a Neurosurgeon who prescribed Physical Therapy. I went through 12 sessions of PT which included warm-up exercises, thoracic matrix, heat, stimulation and ultrasound therapy, but in the end the PT only made the pain in my back worse. I was then referred back to the Neurosurgeon who then passed me to a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Doctor (Physiatrist) who then prescribed me additional PT which I opted to take through another clinic.

When I woke I had dried blood on my face. About 20min after I woke, my eye had a little bright red blood coming out along my lower lid. I took out my contacts (I wear extended wear, sometime a little longer than I should) and it stopped. The following night I bled a small amount 2 times. I have no known health problems, no diabetes, good BP. My eye looks fine. It's not red or inflamed or sore or anything! I went to the eye doctor today and my eye looked healthy, my lids look fine. He did not know what would cause this and seemed a little skeptical it actually bled.  About an hour later a small amount of blood came out again. My eye feels slightly dry but that's about it.  Any idea what it could be? I really can't find anything describing this online. Please help! Thanks!"

Took it as prescribed for 5 days and my vision started getting blurry really bad. I stopped taking them because my eyes got so bad I can barely see anything and can no longer drive myself anywhere because of it. It has been a week since I have stopped taking the Flexeril and my vision hasn't gotten any better if anything it seems worse. I had near perfect vision before I started taking this medication now I feel like i can't see anything clearly. I know blurry vision is one of the side effects but can it permanently mess my eyes up? Has this happened to anyone else? Please let me know because I don't know what to do.

My hand feels numb and it hurts to use my arm. I went to the doctor about a week after the pain started. She thought I had strained my shoulder and organised some physio for me and some pain relief. My doctor said she could give me some time off work but I felt I was still able to work as I am right-handed and I can hold my left arm in front of me. She advised against the use of a sling as its best to keep using your arm to keep it moving. I was able to work for the first couple of weeks but then the pain became unbearable and I was unable to move my arm from resting in front of me. I had to get my Mum to take me to the doctor because i could not drive. They gave me a cortisone injection to relieve the pain and 5 days off work. The injection did not relieve my pain at all but it did give me some more movement back to how it was before the injection. During this time I have had difficulty doing everyday tasks. I can't do dishs, any kind of housework, wash my hair (I have very long hair), tie my hair up, hang washing out, put on a bra (even in the front and turn it around) or undo my bra. I have had my partner who lives with me to help with my bra and other household tasks. After the 5 days were up I couldnt go back to work I could barely move my arm again. I work as a support worker for an aged care community organisation caring for the elderly doing personal care and house work. There are no light duties involved in my work and I very much need my left arm to do my job. I went back to my doctor and she put me off for 3 weeks, gave me a codeine prescription and referred me to an orthopaedic surgeon at Grace Hospital. I rang to make an appointment and I was told they send it in the mail. I have had an ultrasound on my shoulder that came back clear. I have had an x-ray on my neck and shoulder that also came back clear. I have had blood tests to rule out infection and they have also came back clear. Yet the pain is still there. I have had physio but I don't think that is helping due to the cause being unknown. I have good days and bad days. Yesterday was an extremely bad day. I woke up barely being able to move my arm. I rang my doctor that morning as it was very painful and I didn't know when I would get the letter from Grace Hospital. She told me to go to the Tauranga Hospital immediately as she was concerned that it wasn't improving and it had been going on too long. She had rung ahead to the orthopaedics department so they knew I was coming. Thankfully when I got there I didn't have to wait long. I was seen by the orthopaedic registrar. He ordered more blood tests and an x-ray. He moved my arm around to test how the shoulder was. It appeared to be working normally and he couldnt work out where my pain was coming from. Although he did think it was possibly a pinched nerve which i thought it could be from Dr Google. Both tests came back clear. I was then seen by the orthopaedic consultant. He also moved my arm around to test the shoulder. He said he could not work out where my pain was coming from either. He is going to send me off for a M.R.I in a couple of weeks. He thinks I did not need to be in hospital and off he went. I was in so much pain and felt distressed after he left. I felt like I was no closer to finding out what was causing my pain. Now im just waiting for my M.R.I. I can't understand why they couldn't give it to me while I was there. I understand its a public system but i just dont think he took my pain seriously as he also said it would probably just go away on its own. In the mean time my relationship is under immense pressure. I suffer from Bipolar Disorder and am at risk of having a relapse. Being away from work for so long about 10 days so far is no good for my mental health. I dont have a reason to get up in the morning and I don't have contact with my clients. I feel very isolated and lonely."

I rang to make an appointment and I was told they send it in the mail. I have had an ultrasound on my shoulder that came back clear. I have had an x-ray on my neck and shoulder that also came back clear. I have had blood tests to rule out infection and they have also came back clear. Yet the pain is still there. I have had physio but I don't think that is helping due to the cause being unknown. I have good days and bad days. Yesterday was an extremely bad day. I woke up barely being able to move my arm. I rang my doctor that morning as it was very painful and I didn't know when I would get the letter from Grace Hospital. She told me to go to the Tauranga Hospital immediately as she was concerned that it wasn't improving and it had been going on too long. She had rung ahead to the orthopaedics department so they knew I was coming. Thankfully when I got there I didn't have to wait long. I was seen by the orthopaedic registrar. He ordered more blood tests and an x-ray. He moved my arm around to test how the shoulder was. It appeared to be working normally and he couldnt work out where my pain was coming from. Although he did think it was possibly a pinched nerve which i thought it could be from Dr Google. Both tests came back clear. I was then seen by the orthopaedic consultant. He also moved my arm around to test the shoulder. He said he could not work out where my pain was coming from either. He is going to send me off for a M.R.I in a couple of weeks. He thinks I did not need to be in hospital and off he went. I was in so much pain and felt distressed after he left. I felt like I was no closer to finding out what was causing my pain. Now im just waiting for my M.R.I. I can't understand why they couldn't give it to me while I was there. I understand its a public system but i just dont think he took my pain seriously as he also said it would probably just go away on its own. In the mean time my relationship is under immense pressure. I suffer from Bipolar Disorder and am at risk of having a relapse. Being away from work for so long about 10 days so far is no good for my mental health. I dont have a reason to get up in the morning and I don't have contact with my clients. I feel very isolated and lonely."

My hand feels numb and it hurts to use my arm. I went to the doctor about a week after the pain started. She thought I had strained my shoulder and organised some physio for me and some pain relief. My doctor said she could give me some time off work but I felt I was still able to work as I am right-handed and I can hold my left arm in front of me. She advised against the use of a sling as its best to keep using your arm to keep it moving. I was able to work for the first couple of weeks but then the pain became unbearable and I was unable to move my arm from resting in front of me. I had to get my Mum to take me to the doctor because i could not drive. They gave me a cortisone injection to relieve the pain and 5 days off work. The injection did not relieve my pain at all but it did give me some more movement back to how it was before the injection. During this time I have had difficulty doing everyday tasks. I can't do dishs, any kind of housework, wash my hair (I have very long hair), tie my hair up, hang washing out, put on a bra (even in the front and turn it around) or undo my bra. I have had my partner who lives with me to help with my bra and other household tasks. After the 5 days were up I couldnt go back to work I could barely move my arm again. I work as a support worker for an aged care community organisation caring for the elderly doing personal care and house work. There are no light duties involved in my work and I very much need my left arm to do my job.

It is heavy work on my wrists and shoulders, but I never experience any pain during work. I'm realising, however, that every morning I wake up with swollen knuckles and hands. It is only slighlyt painful, more of a discomfort really, but the swelling takes a while to go down. Usually goes down after my morning shower.  I'm worried this might be rheumatism. Does it sound like it? If so, is it dangerous for me to keep working (this is my secondary job, so i can find another if need be)? Could it be something else and is there anything I can do to prevent the swelling?  Thank you for your help!"

I never got surgery, only physio. Over the last 14 years or so, I've been able to largely function by doing lots of exercise, stretching, and could function at a high level in basketball. As I've gotten older and less active, I've noticed more knee clicking and irritation only when I play sports, or on intense hikes Last month I went for an MRI under surgeons guidelines, and he says the MRI shows partial tears in the vascular and non-vascular interior part of the meniscus, as well as a cyst that has formed, which is probably causing the irritation. I know partial removal of the meniscus is an option, however, I am concerned about: 1. Whether removal will ACTUALLY improve the clicking/irritation and restore full pain free mobility to the knee 2. The probability of developing arthritis/disability and needing a knee replacement I'd like to understand: 1. Is non-surgery an option? 2. If I do nothing, am I exposing the knee to increased probability of arthritis anyways? 3. Is it possible to do only repair, remove the cyst and not remove any parts of the meniscus? 4. Is repair of any worth at this point since the injury is about 14 years old? Thanks so much!"

I am sorry this is so long. I've been pursuing a diagnosis for a longtime but haven't been given anything definite yet. I have seen a rheumatologist for the first time. He gave me several prescriptions and lab orders for blood work and x-rays and I was to return for the results in two weeks. But while at the pharmacy trying to get the prescriptions filled I found out that my insurance had dropped me. This put a hold on it all for almost 2 months while I had to get all of that straightened out. I was able to get my insurance reinstated finally. I've now had all of the tests that the doctor ordered completed and I go back June 5th to see the doctor to find out the results. But at this point I am so sick and my skin is so bad that I am scared that time may not be on my side right now. The joint pain has completely disabled me. The issues that are happening with my skin are disfiguring me. There are several issues that I think may be contributing factors. I think I may have a connective tissue auto immune disorder. But I also have a history of severe constipation. I am talking really really bad. I often get impacted. I've became really sick over this several times. I've read how the poisons that can get backed up into your system from this can cause all kinds of skin conditions. I also have a habit of compulsive skin picking. I do pick until I make sores but these sores are sorta self inflicted. The problem originates from the chemical response in my brain that stimulates my reaction to pick until I make a sore. But I've got a lot of scarring from it and I am wondering if what's going on now could be a reaction to the damage that's been done to my skin tissue from the picking. It can be common to develop calcium deposits inside of damaged scar tissue. The only other thing that I can think of that could possibly be a contributing factor is the stress I've experienced. I've went through some extremely traumatic events. I've been diagnosed with PTSD. Is it possible that this could have triggered a response from my immune system?? The mornings are the worst. It takes me about an hour and a half before I am able to function after I've woke up. My hands and feet are always swollen. I am always stiff as a board all over. In order to just be able to move it's like I have to break every single joint out of a frozen state. But this happens anytime I am sitting still for a long period of time. My neck gets really bad. Sometimes I wish I had arm slings to free my shoulder sockets from the weight of my arms. I also have had issues with my throat. By the end of the day I started losing my voice. But then my eyes started getting so dry that for the first time in my life I bought eye drops. After this started happening I went to the doctor. We didn't focus as much on how my joints were doing cause the doctor was more concerned with my throat because there was swelling. An ultrasound showed nodules on my thyroids. I had tests done where they stick a needle in the nodules and draw fluid out. The doctor wanted to eliminate cancer. It was benign. But I do have several nodules on my thyroids. This may be causing some of this because your thyroids affect so many things. But I am also aware that dry throat and eyes are symptoms of connective tissue diseases also. I have extreme fatigue. By 3pm everyday my day is over with regardless. But out of everything it is my skin thats the worst. I have noticed that my sweat has became different. At certain times it's like I sweat a lot more and it's stickier. I've also noticed a weird smell. It smells like peroxide. That may sound crazy but it's true. But this seems to happen right before my skin goes through the phases that it does. The texture becomes different like plastic. It seems like thicker pads of skin have developed over my elbows, finger joints and knee caps. Sometimes the sores will appear exactly like little paper cuts. It literally looks like perfectly straight little cuts. At first I did pick at them until I got so overwhelmed with fear because of the whole ordeal. When I did if I squeezed them its like they opened up to little wart like sores inside. But what's so weird is that they usually appear in groups of three and develop into 3 perfect circle sores. Then they become like embedded rocks in my skin. I think it is calcium deposits. The skin gets really hard and red all around the area. It becomes really tender. I have these places all over me. When its all inflamed its the worst pain I have ever felt in my entire life. I literally feel like a raw exposed nerve that's been rolled into broken pieces of glass all over. I am wondering if it's doing this inside of me also. When I look into what kind of sores these could be everything refers to calcium. I did have kidney stones years ago really bad. The stones were sent off and came back as calcium oxalate. They ran tests on my kidneys and determined that I had a condition with calcium in my kidneys. Could all of this just be the result of how my body handles calcium? I don't know what to do. I am trying to figure out what I can do to at least prevent as much damage as possible.

We didn't focus as much on how my joints were doing cause the doctor was more concerned with my throat because there was swelling. An ultrasound showed nodules on my thyroids. I had tests done where they stick a needle in the nodules and draw fluid out. The doctor wanted to eliminate cancer. It was benign. But I do have several nodules on my thyroids. This may be causing some of this because your thyroids affect so many things. But I am also aware that dry throat and eyes are symptoms of connective tissue diseases also. I have extreme fatigue. By 3pm everyday my day is over with regardless. But out of everything it is my skin thats the worst. I have noticed that my sweat has became different. At certain times it's like I sweat a lot more and it's stickier. I've also noticed a weird smell. It smells like peroxide. That may sound crazy but it's true. But this seems to happen right before my skin goes through the phases that it does. The texture becomes different like plastic. It seems like thicker pads of skin have developed over my elbows, finger joints and knee caps. Sometimes the sores will appear exactly like little paper cuts. It literally looks like perfectly straight little cuts. At first I did pick at them until I got so overwhelmed with fear because of the whole ordeal. When I did if I squeezed them its like they opened up to little wart like sores inside. But what's so weird is that they usually appear in groups of three and develop into 3 perfect circle sores. Then they become like embedded rocks in my skin. I think it is calcium deposits. The skin gets really hard and red all around the area. It becomes really tender. I have these places all over me. When its all inflamed its the worst pain I have ever felt in my entire life. I literally feel like a raw exposed nerve that's been rolled into broken pieces of glass all over. I am wondering if it's doing this inside of me also. When I look into what kind of sores these could be everything refers to calcium. I did have kidney stones years ago really bad. The stones were sent off and came back as calcium oxalate. They ran tests on my kidneys and determined that I had a condition with calcium in my kidneys. Could all of this just be the result of how my body handles calcium? I don't know what to do. I am trying to figure out what I can do to at least prevent as much damage as possible. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

I am sorry this is so long. I've been pursuing a diagnosis for a longtime but haven't been given anything definite yet. I have seen a rheumatologist for the first time. He gave me several prescriptions and lab orders for blood work and x-rays and I was to return for the results in two weeks. But while at the pharmacy trying to get the prescriptions filled I found out that my insurance had dropped me. This put a hold on it all for almost 2 months while I had to get all of that straightened out. I was able to get my insurance reinstated finally. I've now had all of the tests that the doctor ordered completed and I go back June 5th to see the doctor to find out the results. But at this point I am so sick and my skin is so bad that I am scared that time may not be on my side right now. The joint pain has completely disabled me. The issues that are happening with my skin are disfiguring me. There are several issues that I think may be contributing factors. I think I may have a connective tissue auto immune disorder. But I also have a history of severe constipation. I am talking really really bad. I often get impacted. I've became really sick over this several times. I've read how the poisons that can get backed up into your system from this can cause all kinds of skin conditions. I also have a habit of compulsive skin picking. I do pick until I make sores but these sores are sorta self inflicted. The problem originates from the chemical response in my brain that stimulates my reaction to pick until I make a sore. But I've got a lot of scarring from it and I am wondering if what's going on now could be a reaction to the damage that's been done to my skin tissue from the picking. It can be common to develop calcium deposits inside of damaged scar tissue. The only other thing that I can think of that could possibly be a contributing factor is the stress I've experienced. I've went through some extremely traumatic events. I've been diagnosed with PTSD. Is it possible that this could have triggered a response from my immune system?? The mornings are the worst. It takes me about an hour and a half before I am able to function after I've woke up. My hands and feet are always swollen. I am always stiff as a board all over. In order to just be able to move it's like I have to break every single joint out of a frozen state. But this happens anytime I am sitting still for a long period of time. My neck gets really bad.

I just assumed that sitting in a dark room for a while was just irritating. I'm starting to think that isn't it. I have a double astigmatism and have prescription glasses for it, but I hardly notice the difference with my glasses on or off. The main reason why I even wear my glasses is because my eyes will get tired easily. I guess you could say it is like a pressure in my eyes that makes my whole body and mind feel like it should be tired. For the past year, it feels like my glasses aren't working anymore. My eyes get tired more regularly almost as if I'm not wearing my glasses. I had my vision checked and my prescription is the same. I'm also having a little harder time focusing on the road when it is dark out. I am still safe at driving at night, but if it gets worse then I will have to limit my driving to daytime only. I have started to get migraines as well, but those are genetic in my family and I've noticed they are only triggered when I'm stressed, so I don't think that it relates to my eye troubles. Could all of these be symptoms of something? I'm a college student and I'm taking anatomy and physiology right now and I tried asking my teacher, but he doesn't know why the movie theaters hurt my eyes and why my vision with and without my glasses doesn't matter too much. We just discussed glaucoma and how it is increased pressure on the eyes. Could I have a version of this? I don't want to pay for a doctor unless I have a good educated guess of what they can be looking for."
