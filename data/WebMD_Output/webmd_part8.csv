I respect my doctors and other medical professionals immensely, but I am genuinely desperate. In October (about 5 months ago) I visited my PCP after feeling sickly for weeks on end. I had been having low-grade fevers on a daily basis, joint pain and general aches, and fatigue so bad I would sleep for 16 hours. My blood work came back with normal CBC, but positive for mono. I was given prednisone (which did nothing) and told I would feel better in a week or two. 5 months later, my symptoms have only gotten worse. With my fevers come a bright red butterfly shaped rash across my face, and I am often too sick to get out of bed. I visited the doctor once again, who agreed that the fevers were not likely caused by the mono I had five months ago. She thought there was a chance of an autoimmune condition, so tested my ANA, CRP, CBC, ESR, and for lyme (for good measure). Yet, every single test came back within the normal range. I had been treated for kidney pain recently as well, but all that showed up in my urine was a little protein and white blood cells (but not an amount too excessive). With having tested negative for lupus, lyme, and any sort of infection, I do not know what to think. My fevers have not subsided, and the rash on my face shows up a few times a week at least (it's not itchy, just hot). I also continuously break out in hives, despite having had allergy testing (not sure if this is related). If I don't have an autoimmune condition, lyme, mono, or any infection, why on earth am I feeling so sick and what can I do to feel better? I feel like I have tried everything, and I eat and exercise well. Even pain meds do a poor job of relieving my symptoms. If anyone has any ideas on what I can do to feel better or what the issue is, it would be greatly appreciated."

His presentation of this disorder has been very mild in comparison to other patients but he has had one significant surgery so far and that was a Mitral Valve Replacement. About two months ago, he appeared to have contracted a stomach virus. He had the usual nausea, vomiting, fever, and stomach pain associated with the run of the mill stomach virus, along with severe dehydration and ten pounds of weight loss. His spleen was also significantly swollen, with no obvious reason. He seemingly recovered from the acute symptoms in a few days but he has had continued pain in the right upper quadrant of his stomach/abdominal region that comes and goes with no particular pattern and has gotten substantially worse over time. The nausea has also not relented and he is having a great deal of difficulty having bowel movements. He 1.) cannot have one at all, 2.) can have one, but it is mainly diarrhea or ""rabbit turds"" as he calls them (Haha :-)) and there is very little of that.  His primary care physician has run all manner of blood tests, performed an ultrasound and a CT scan, and has found no physical evidence that there is anything wrong other than a swollen spleen. We were referred to a Hematologist/Oncologist, who ran more blood tests and performed an exam. Everything came back totally normal. That doctor referred us to a Gastroenterologist, who performed an upper endoscopy scope. There was some mild inflammation along his digestive tract and the doctor took biopsies. A few days later, a hepatobiliary scan (HIDA scan) was performed to measure the function of his gallbladder and liver. Again, the results of both tests were completely normal. As a preventative measure, the doctor prescribed Protonix once a day and Sucralfate twice a day. My fiance is now scheduled for a colonoscopy later on this month.  On his own, he has tried a liquid diet, removing dairy from his diet and probiotics to no avail. This entire ordeal has been very draining on my fiance. He has not been able to eat, sleep or function normally for the majority of the last two months. He is in constant fear of when the pain and nausea will strike again, as there is no discernible pattern.  No one seems to have a clue what maybe causing this and we are at our witts end at this point. Is there anyone out there that has had or has been a witness to anything with any similarity? Any information would be very, very appreciated!  Thank you."

Then I noticed the pain would go back and forth between under my ribs, similar to where my gall bladder and pancreas are and then back down low. I had tons of testing done and everything was either negative or inconclusive. I was 5 pregnant so they did not do a CT but they did do a MRI and lots of blood work and took a stool sample. Then, the pain slowly dissipated in the next two weeks. Yesterday, the pain appeared again, this Time even worse. I am nauseous and In lots of pain and have horrible painful gas. I am also extremely and noticeably bloated and it happened within one day so I know it’s not the pregnancy. It seems to sit on my lower right side but will move up occasionally.

I have 5 siblings. Among us, there is also history of psoriasis, IBS, asthma-like symptoms, and more. But the main things we all have in common are the chronic migraines and the associated potent meds to alleviate the pain. After having an extraordinarily unpleasant reaction to a dinner consisting of mainly fondue (washed down with 2 fermented cider beverages), I did some research. I found that histamine Intolerance is a strong possibility where I'm concerned. When I realized there appears to be a genetic component to this and I'm part of a family who displays many of the key symptoms, I started to wonder if there's someone in the U.S. who's actively studying this disorder. Is anyone taking it seriously yet based on the European research? Starting to think my family would make a great case-study! I'd like to know if anyone is aware of any active or proposed research on this condition in the USA. Anyone have a clue?"

A lot of the time my symptoms are things that you can't see on the outside like joint pain and migraines, so I also don't want them to think that I'm just faking it. I don't think that there is a lot of understanding about lupus and what it's like to have it so I worry people won't be as sympathetic and just won't understand. Has anyone here made this decision and how did it play out?"

First only cigarettes then marijuana as well. I started travelling more and my healthy living declined. I would overdose on Marijuana until I got panic attacks. I would only do it just so I could forget about my depression and then feel better after getting over those panic attacks. After a pretty heavy one I decided to cut down on the weed. But then, in late 2016 just as I was getting over the breakup I had the weirdest pain I ever experienced. This happened a week after I got some tooth fillings at the dentist. I was in the office at work and all of a sudden I felt a weird feeling in my stomach, sharp pain, difficulty breathing and my heart racing. I got completely confused and told my manager think I am having a heart attack. Went to the A&E where they told me to take some Nexium (40 mg a day) and Gaviscon. I kept on having similar attacks every couple of days for another week or so. Then I gradually got better (not all symptoms had diminished but at least the panic attacks had stopped) . However, after I stopped the Nexium, I got an awful acid rebound. Pain got back worse and so did panic attacks which I used to get at night time. I was put on Pantoprazole 40 mg and Ranitidine 300 MG. Took about 2 months until I got a bit better and the panic attacks at night stopped too. I had an endoscopy done and all the doc could see was mild gastritis. Had parasite testing done as well as stool tests to look for parasites and potential IBD antigens . All came back clear.  I went back on a healthy diet, quit smoking (including the weed), started doing sports again (exercising twice a day 5 times a week) and also started travelling almost every month (as it took my mind off the pain, distracted and relaxed me) The pain diminished I would say by 70%. I stopped the Pantoprazole, and only continued to take the 300mg Ranitidine. I still experienced abdominal pain almost daily (not heartburn pain, rather just a dull pain just above my navel) so I thought I was on the right path.  Earlier this year I went to the dentist, had a tooth filling done and then back home. I took my usual pills before bedtime (Ranitidine and Tenofovir - the hep b medication) without water. The following morning I got up with bad heartburn and a feeling a lump in throat. The following, day, however, the lump feeling in my throat turned into excruciating pain, so bad I could barely swallow my own saliva. I was referred for an endoscopy and the doc saw a bad ulcer in my mid esophagus. (although interestingly, my stomach was completely fine - no more gastritis - despite the ongoing abdominal pain) I was put on PPIs again (Pantoprazole - 80 mg/ day this time) but after 2 months the pain in my throat still didn't go away. I was also given dihydrocodeine to help me with the pain . So then my doc switched my PPIS from Pantoprazole to Esomeprazole (Nexium). He gave me 120 MG a day. After a few days taking the esomeprazole I went out and noticed my ears were ringing really bad. I thought this might be a side effect of Nexium so I went back to my doc. He told me he thinks it was just a coincidence - that the tinnitus was probably due to the loud music - and even if it was caused by Nexium it would wear off after I stopped it - but for the time being he advised me keep on the Nexium. I kept on taking the Nexium for 3 weeks without any improvement. But the tinnitus stayed. I stopped taking the Nexium and went for another endoscopy. The doc said the ulcer healed completely so there was no point in PPIs anymore.  The conclusion of the doc was that what I have is neuropathic pain, pain coming from the damaged nerves in the stomach and esophagus so now he put me on amitriptyline (30 mg/a day) but he said this would take a few weeks to work. However, this only a symptomatic treatment - to treat the nerve pain (if indeed what I have is just nerve pain) So basically I have 3 symptoms now : abdominal dull pain, lump in my throat feeling/pain and loud tinnitus. Has anyone experienced anything like this? Could there be any connection between the 3?  I was considering doing an expensive comprehensive stool analysis test to check for additional harder to find parasite (costs about 300 pounds) Do you think that's worth it? Also do you think the tooth fillings might have had anything to do with the symptoms or was it pure coincidence? I've been really depressed lately and I don't really know where to go anymore. NHS seems to be failing me so I am considering a private clinic. If you know of a good private clinic please let me know.  I'd be grateful for any input"

I went back on a healthy diet, quit smoking (including the weed), started doing sports again (exercising twice a day 5 times a week) and also started travelling almost every month (as it took my mind off the pain, distracted and relaxed me) The pain diminished I would say by 70%. I stopped the Pantoprazole, and only continued to take the 300mg Ranitidine. I still experienced abdominal pain almost daily (not heartburn pain, rather just a dull pain just above my navel) so I thought I was on the right path.  Earlier this year I went to the dentist, had a tooth filling done and then back home. I took my usual pills before bedtime (Ranitidine and Tenofovir - the hep b medication) without water. The following morning I got up with bad heartburn and a feeling a lump in throat. The following, day, however, the lump feeling in my throat turned into excruciating pain, so bad I could barely swallow my own saliva. I was referred for an endoscopy and the doc saw a bad ulcer in my mid esophagus. (although interestingly, my stomach was completely fine - no more gastritis - despite the ongoing abdominal pain) I was put on PPIs again (Pantoprazole - 80 mg/ day this time) but after 2 months the pain in my throat still didn't go away. I was also given dihydrocodeine to help me with the pain . So then my doc switched my PPIS from Pantoprazole to Esomeprazole (Nexium). He gave me 120 MG a day. After a few days taking the esomeprazole I went out and noticed my ears were ringing really bad. I thought this might be a side effect of Nexium so I went back to my doc. He told me he thinks it was just a coincidence - that the tinnitus was probably due to the loud music - and even if it was caused by Nexium it would wear off after I stopped it - but for the time being he advised me keep on the Nexium. I kept on taking the Nexium for 3 weeks without any improvement. But the tinnitus stayed. I stopped taking the Nexium and went for another endoscopy. The doc said the ulcer healed completely so there was no point in PPIs anymore.  The conclusion of the doc was that what I have is neuropathic pain, pain coming from the damaged nerves in the stomach and esophagus so now he put me on amitriptyline (30 mg/a day) but he said this would take a few weeks to work. However, this only a symptomatic treatment - to treat the nerve pain (if indeed what I have is just nerve pain) So basically I have 3 symptoms now : abdominal dull pain, lump in my throat feeling/pain and loud tinnitus. Has anyone experienced anything like this? Could there be any connection between the 3?  I was considering doing an expensive comprehensive stool analysis test to check for additional harder to find parasite (costs about 300 pounds) Do you think that's worth it? Also do you think the tooth fillings might have had anything to do with the symptoms or was it pure coincidence? I've been really depressed lately and I don't really know where to go anymore. NHS seems to be failing me so I am considering a private clinic. If you know of a good private clinic please let me know.  I'd be grateful for any input"

I have chronic bloating (most significantly at night and upon waking up). I have had many tests done and have not found the cause of this. About 3 years ago I noticed my ribcage was protruding significantly on the left side, which is the side where I experience most of the bloating and discomfort. In addition to this pronounced protrusion I have a tingling feeling in my back behind my left ribs, however I don't have any pain. Doctors have remarked on my protruding rib but have not been able to find a cause for it. So my question is, does anyone know if bloating or other digestive disorders could cause a swelling or protrusion of the ribcage, or do you think my two issues are separate? Just seems like a strange coincidence! I am hoping someone may have some insights as I am quite frustrated.  Many thanks to anyone who takes the time to reply x"

Whenever I am on a bus or light rail, I get intestinal cramping, increased flatulence, faster/harder heartbeat, and feel as if I have the urgent need to use the bathroom. Deep, controlled breathing doesn't help. Several of these situations did result in me having borderline diarrhea once I got myself to a toilet, but most of the time I find that I am constipated, needing to strain to get anything out at all (if anything at all). This does NOT occur when I am riding in a car, while walking, or when sitting someplace stationary (home, work, even a sports game). In those situations, I might feel a completely normal need to have a bowel movement, but nothing to the degree that I feel on buses.  I have dealt with constipation for most of my life and have been trying to find ways to treat it, and as of one year ago I've been improving my diet with more water and fiber. But I don't believe this diet change is what's been causing this horrible feeling, since it's only been happening for over a month (and the diet changes have not made any positive impact on my constipation, either). As a result, I've been having to take ride share services to get around instead of the bus, resulting in me spending waaaay more money than I should be (my bus pass is at a discounted price through my employer and grants me unlimited bus rides each month, so it's a great deal). I do not know how to drive and never have had to own a car. If this is some sudden flare-up of IBS that I've been unaware of, then there's little I can do since I've been doing everything that would naturally be suggested for IBS in the first place: More fiber, more water, and regular (light) exercise. I've been seeing a nutritionist and am about to talk to my gastroenterologist in two weeks, and the only advice I've been given so far has been to try probiotics (nutritionist) or a fiber supplement (gastro). The first time I tried the probiotic I was recommended, it made me feel horribly sick the following morning, giving me nausea, gas, and diarrhea, so I didn't take it again after that. But last night (almost 2 weeks after I first tried the probiotic) I finally got around to opening the capsule so that I could pour 1/4 of the contents into a glass of water (as recommended by not only my nutritionist but also the probiotic's developer), and I had no side effects this morning. So, I will see if that does anything over the next few months. And if that fails to help my constipation and random urgency, then I will resort to the fiber supplement (Cetracel was the one my gastro mentioned). But of course, if the probiotic helps at all, it will take some time, so I am posting here to see if anyone has any suggestions in the meantime. Please note that this uncomfortable, anxiety-inducing feeling has ONLY been happening on public transportation. That leads me to believe that whatever is wrong with my gut right now is becoming agitated/stimulated by the often exaggerated motions of buses, whereas a car and even walking are far smoother and controlled. But...why the heck would that be happening in the first place? Especially if the urgency is not always related to diarrhea/soft stools? This has been causing tons of unnecessary stress/anxiety and I feel I am burning my money away."

Several of these situations did result in me having borderline diarrhea once I got myself to a toilet, but most of the time I find that I am constipated, needing to strain to get anything out at all (if anything at all). This does NOT occur when I am riding in a car, while walking, or when sitting someplace stationary (home, work, even a sports game). In those situations, I might feel a completely normal need to have a bowel movement, but nothing to the degree that I feel on buses.  I have dealt with constipation for most of my life and have been trying to find ways to treat it, and as of one year ago I've been improving my diet with more water and fiber. But I don't believe this diet change is what's been causing this horrible feeling, since it's only been happening for over a month (and the diet changes have not made any positive impact on my constipation, either). As a result, I've been having to take ride share services to get around instead of the bus, resulting in me spending waaaay more money than I should be (my bus pass is at a discounted price through my employer and grants me unlimited bus rides each month, so it's a great deal). I do not know how to drive and never have had to own a car. If this is some sudden flare-up of IBS that I've been unaware of, then there's little I can do since I've been doing everything that would naturally be suggested for IBS in the first place: More fiber, more water, and regular (light) exercise. I've been seeing a nutritionist and am about to talk to my gastroenterologist in two weeks, and the only advice I've been given so far has been to try probiotics (nutritionist) or a fiber supplement (gastro). The first time I tried the probiotic I was recommended, it made me feel horribly sick the following morning, giving me nausea, gas, and diarrhea, so I didn't take it again after that. But last night (almost 2 weeks after I first tried the probiotic) I finally got around to opening the capsule so that I could pour 1/4 of the contents into a glass of water (as recommended by not only my nutritionist but also the probiotic's developer), and I had no side effects this morning. So, I will see if that does anything over the next few months. And if that fails to help my constipation and random urgency, then I will resort to the fiber supplement (Cetracel was the one my gastro mentioned). But of course, if the probiotic helps at all, it will take some time, so I am posting here to see if anyone has any suggestions in the meantime. Please note that this uncomfortable, anxiety-inducing feeling has ONLY been happening on public transportation. That leads me to believe that whatever is wrong with my gut right now is becoming agitated/stimulated by the often exaggerated motions of buses, whereas a car and even walking are far smoother and controlled. But...why the heck would that be happening in the first place? Especially if the urgency is not always related to diarrhea/soft stools? This has been causing tons of unnecessary stress/anxiety and I feel I am burning my money away."

I have never experienced this in my life so I went to get blood tests done and everything came back completely normal and I was told I didn't have any cold or flu. The doctor was puzzled and could not come up with any possibilities of a diagnosis. I suspected I was having a bad reaction to the Wellbutrin so my psychiatrist has put me on a taper plan to get off this medication (I have 4 days left). This morning I woke up in tears because the joints and muscles in my arms and hands were hurting so bad they felt like they were on fire.

After extensive research online, I have several reasons to believe that I am one of the few male suspects with lupus.  At age 8, I began losing hair in splotches along the back of my head which would soon be diagnosed as alopecia areata. Shortly after, strange reoccurring rashes began forming along my knees and random places around my arms and neck. These rashes were diagnosed as both a dermatitis and eczema by different dermatologists. These rashes and stints of alopecia have occurred randomly and consistently throughout my life.   At age 14, I began to notice widespread rashes forming on both arms below the line of my shirt sleeves anywhere my skin was exposed to the sun. These rashes continue to occur every spring and summer and slowly retract during the fall and winter months. This was also when I realized the excessive dryness of my hair, scalp and face. I began treatment with certain prescription soaps and shampoos, all of which were unsuccessful. These symptoms still exist today. This was also the approximate time in which the lymph node behind my left ear began swelling at random times, often 3-5 times per month, followed by a feverish feeling up to an hour or two. This swelling and fever still occurs today.   At age 18, I began experiencing crippling depression and fatigue for no apparent reason as I have always been a fairly happy person. These periods of suicidal thoughts, depression and fatigue come about unprovoked and make almost any normal activity impossible. These streaks will come to an abrupt end and I will wake up feeling 100% normal and happy. I was diagnosed bipolar type II by my psychiatrist at age 23 with minimal help from a variety of anti-depressants and anti-psychotics, which I chose to stop taking after 2 years due to fatigue, foggy mind and the risk of dependence.  At age 22, I began experiencing unprovoked chronic low back pain. An MRI showed 2 bulged discs as well as abnormal narrowing of the spine for someone of that age. After 3 epidural injections I was advised to undergo surgery by my primary physician. I was referred to a spine surgeon at OU Medical Center who upon consultation suggested surgery would not relieve much pain as his diagnosis leaned toward osteoarthritis.   At age 25, I lost over 60 lbs in a matter of two months after no change in diet or physical activity. I began experiencing intense reoccurring joint pain in my knees, hips, and hands, especially in the morning and late at night, along with consistent nerve pain stemming from my left buttox down into my quad. Various anti inflammatory drugs were prescribed to subdue the pain, although I soon developed stomach ulcers and rectal bleeding.  Now, at age 26, I continue to deal with all symptoms listed above on either a consistent or reoccurring basis, and new symptoms have emerged. In the last three months, I have started experiencing constant constipation, hemmeroids, rectal bleeding and abdominal pain. The most recent symptom, which began a few months ago, is the ""butterfly"" rash on my face notoriously associated with lupus. It produces redness and elevation of the skin with a burning sensation rather than an itching sensation, lasting several days or up to a week. Lupus seems to coincide the best with my research, but I would like outside opinions."

After extensive research online, I have several reasons to believe that I am one of the few male suspects with lupus.  At age 8, I began losing hair in splotches along the back of my head which would soon be diagnosed as alopecia areata. Shortly after, strange reoccurring rashes began forming along my knees and random places around my arms and neck. These rashes were diagnosed as both a dermatitis and eczema by different dermatologists. These rashes and stints of alopecia have occurred randomly and consistently throughout my life.   At age 14, I began to notice widespread rashes forming on both arms below the line of my shirt sleeves anywhere my skin was exposed to the sun. These rashes continue to occur every spring and summer and slowly retract during the fall and winter months. This was also when I realized the excessive dryness of my hair, scalp and face. I began treatment with certain prescription soaps and shampoos, all of which were unsuccessful. These symptoms still exist today. This was also the approximate time in which the lymph node behind my left ear began swelling at random times, often 3-5 times per month, followed by a feverish feeling up to an hour or two. This swelling and fever still occurs today.   At age 18, I began experiencing crippling depression and fatigue for no apparent reason as I have always been a fairly happy person. These periods of suicidal thoughts, depression and fatigue come about unprovoked and make almost any normal activity impossible. These streaks will come to an abrupt end and I will wake up feeling 100% normal and happy. I was diagnosed bipolar type II by my psychiatrist at age 23 with minimal help from a variety of anti-depressants and anti-psychotics, which I chose to stop taking after 2 years due to fatigue, foggy mind and the risk of dependence.  At age 22, I began experiencing unprovoked chronic low back pain. An MRI showed 2 bulged discs as well as abnormal narrowing of the spine for someone of that age. After 3 epidural injections I was advised to undergo surgery by my primary physician. I was referred to a spine surgeon at OU Medical Center who upon consultation suggested surgery would not relieve much pain as his diagnosis leaned toward osteoarthritis.   At age 25, I lost over 60 lbs in a matter of two months after no change in diet or physical activity. I began experiencing intense reoccurring joint pain in my knees, hips, and hands, especially in the morning and late at night, along with consistent nerve pain stemming from my left buttox down into my quad.

I'm a 25 year old female who has been having a myriad of gastrointestinal issues for the last almost two years.

Obviously this was not the case as this symptom and (new ones to follow) has become pervasive in my life. Here are my symptoms as well as diagnoses/treatments/procedures mentioned as they occurred chronologically.  -I have been having mouth sores since I was in elementary school. During high school & then college years they progressed.  -July 2014: Heart palpitations began SUDDENLY. They lasted for 24/7 for five months straight. EKG normal. I was severely underweight at this time & advised to gain weight, which should resolve symptoms. They eventually subsided, but would come back suddenly & randomly, lasting for short periods of time.  -Diagnosed with a gluten intolerance November 2014 - began a GF diet, which I still adhere to now.  -Mouth sores went away for maybe a year and then reappeared worse than before. - Summer of 2016: GI issues, namely - bloating, cramping, lower abdominal pain (esp. right quadrant), frequent watery diarrhea, inability to ""wait"" to use the bathroom, weight loss. -September 2016: Heart palpitations resumed. First referral to Cardiologist & Gastroenterologist. Full cardiac work-up (EKG, Echo, Stress Test, 24-hr holter monitor) normal.  -Diagnosed with GERD by GI doctor. Began omeprazole 20 mg daily. -Feb. 2017 Follow up with GI scheduled upper GI endo as symptoms did not resolve. -March 10, 2017 Endoscopy with six biopsies negative for Celiac disease. Evidence of gastritis was diagnosis.  -Began having bloody diarrhea and weight loss again. Colonoscopy performed May 3rd, 2017. Negative for microscopic colitis.  -June 2017: Pillcamera was negative for Celiac. Showed delayed transit.  -August 1, 2017 diagnosed with IBS.  The same symptoms persisted. I stopped visiting this GI doctor because he didn't test biopsies for Crohn's like I had asked & I know IBS does NOT cause bleeding. I disagree with this dx.  -October 2017: diagnosed with Sicca (Dry eye) & eye inflammation.  -Rheumatology visit in October 2017 wherein I had genetic blood testing. I was found to have a positive HLA-B27 & two mutations of NOD2/CARD15/IBD1. Also found to be severely iron deficient. -November 30, 2017: Diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis. Started Celebrex 2x daily. Sulfasalazine recommended, but I have not taken it. -February 2017: Saw new GI doctor. Upped my dosage of Omeprazole to 40mg daily when it failed to work anymore.  -April 2017: x-ray of abdomen revealed what appears to be constipation. I can't imagine how I could have such horrible diarrhea with this. Also revealed Kidney stone. Sonogram revealed tumor in kidney believed to be angiomyolipoma. I am currently following up with a Nephrologist.  This is where I am at currently. As we speak, I have two ulcers in my mouth. These are the third & fourth ulcers I have had in about four weeks, one of which took up nearly half of my tongue & caused such severe swelling. I am in sheer agony & cannot eat, chew, and struggle to talk. I am at the end of my rope.  My main issues right now are severe diarrhea, sometimes bloody, usually always yellow in color (it is reminiscent to me of when I was doing the bowel prep for my colonoscopy), severe bloating wherein my pants cannot be buttoned, oral ulcers, heart palpitations, severe fatigue, shortness of breath upon exertion - I cannot use the stairs, frequent urination. I am so spent. I seriously cannot live like this anymore. I know something is wrong with me. Anyone have similar experience? Please, please share. I can't stress how badly I want answers. I almost don't even care what they are anymore.  My guess is Crohn's. They just can't seem to find it, but I know it can take years to diagnose. My genetic profile suggests Crohn's as NOD2 is also called IBD1 (Inflammatory Bowel Disease). I know oral ulcers are a manifestation of Crohn's & I've had mine swabbed for herpes, infectious disease, etc. all negative. Does anyone know, can they be swabbed for Crohn's?"

I'm a 25 year old female who has been having a myriad of gastrointestinal issues for the last almost two years. During the summer of 2016 I had my first bout with severe diarrhea, which I honestly thought originated from food poisoning. Obviously this was not the case as this symptom and (new ones to follow) has become pervasive in my life. Here are my symptoms as well as diagnoses/treatments/procedures mentioned as they occurred chronologically.  -I have been having mouth sores since I was in elementary school. During high school & then college years they progressed.  -July 2014: Heart palpitations began SUDDENLY. They lasted for 24/7 for five months straight. EKG normal. I was severely underweight at this time & advised to gain weight, which should resolve symptoms. They eventually subsided, but would come back suddenly & randomly, lasting for short periods of time.  -Diagnosed with a gluten intolerance November 2014 - began a GF diet, which I still adhere to now.  -Mouth sores went away for maybe a year and then reappeared worse than before. - Summer of 2016: GI issues, namely - bloating, cramping, lower abdominal pain (esp. right quadrant), frequent watery diarrhea, inability to ""wait"" to use the bathroom, weight loss. -September 2016: Heart palpitations resumed. First referral to Cardiologist & Gastroenterologist. Full cardiac work-up (EKG, Echo, Stress Test, 24-hr holter monitor) normal.  -Diagnosed with GERD by GI doctor. Began omeprazole 20 mg daily. -Feb. 2017 Follow up with GI scheduled upper GI endo as symptoms did not resolve. -March 10, 2017 Endoscopy with six biopsies negative for Celiac disease. Evidence of gastritis was diagnosis.  -Began having bloody diarrhea and weight loss again. Colonoscopy performed May 3rd, 2017. Negative for microscopic colitis.  -June 2017: Pillcamera was negative for Celiac. Showed delayed transit.  -August 1, 2017 diagnosed with IBS.  The same symptoms persisted. I stopped visiting this GI doctor because he didn't test biopsies for Crohn's like I had asked & I know IBS does NOT cause bleeding. I disagree with this dx.  -October 2017: diagnosed with Sicca (Dry eye) & eye inflammation.  -Rheumatology visit in October 2017 wherein I had genetic blood testing. I was found to have a positive HLA-B27 & two mutations of NOD2/CARD15/IBD1. Also found to be severely iron deficient. -November 30, 2017: Diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis. Started Celebrex 2x daily. Sulfasalazine recommended, but I have not taken it. -February 2017: Saw new GI doctor. Upped my dosage of Omeprazole to 40mg daily when it failed to work anymore.  -April 2017: x-ray of abdomen revealed what appears to be constipation. I can't imagine how I could have such horrible diarrhea with this. Also revealed Kidney stone. Sonogram revealed tumor in kidney believed to be angiomyolipoma. I am currently following up with a Nephrologist.  This is where I am at currently. As we speak, I have two ulcers in my mouth. These are the third & fourth ulcers I have had in about four weeks, one of which took up nearly half of my tongue & caused such severe swelling. I am in sheer agony & cannot eat, chew, and struggle to talk. I am at the end of my rope.  My main issues right now are severe diarrhea, sometimes bloody, usually always yellow in color (it is reminiscent to me of when I was doing the bowel prep for my colonoscopy), severe bloating wherein my pants cannot be buttoned, oral ulcers, heart palpitations, severe fatigue, shortness of breath upon exertion - I cannot use the stairs, frequent urination. I am so spent. I seriously cannot live like this anymore. I know something is wrong with me. Anyone have similar experience? Please, please share. I can't stress how badly I want answers. I almost don't even care what they are anymore.  My guess is Crohn's. They just can't seem to find it, but I know it can take years to diagnose. My genetic profile suggests Crohn's as NOD2 is also called IBD1 (Inflammatory Bowel Disease). I know oral ulcers are a manifestation of Crohn's & I've had mine swabbed for herpes, infectious disease, etc. all negative. Does anyone know, can they be swabbed for Crohn's?"

During high school & then college years they progressed.  -July 2014: Heart palpitations began SUDDENLY. They lasted for 24/7 for five months straight. EKG normal. I was severely underweight at this time & advised to gain weight, which should resolve symptoms. They eventually subsided, but would come back suddenly & randomly, lasting for short periods of time.  -Diagnosed with a gluten intolerance November 2014 - began a GF diet, which I still adhere to now.  -Mouth sores went away for maybe a year and then reappeared worse than before. - Summer of 2016: GI issues, namely - bloating, cramping, lower abdominal pain (esp. right quadrant), frequent watery diarrhea, inability to ""wait"" to use the bathroom, weight loss. -September 2016: Heart palpitations resumed. First referral to Cardiologist & Gastroenterologist. Full cardiac work-up (EKG, Echo, Stress Test, 24-hr holter monitor) normal.  -Diagnosed with GERD by GI doctor. Began omeprazole 20 mg daily. -Feb. 2017 Follow up with GI scheduled upper GI endo as symptoms did not resolve. -March 10, 2017 Endoscopy with six biopsies negative for Celiac disease. Evidence of gastritis was diagnosis.  -Began having bloody diarrhea and weight loss again. Colonoscopy performed May 3rd, 2017. Negative for microscopic colitis.  -June 2017: Pillcamera was negative for Celiac. Showed delayed transit.  -August 1, 2017 diagnosed with IBS.  The same symptoms persisted. I stopped visiting this GI doctor because he didn't test biopsies for Crohn's like I had asked & I know IBS does NOT cause bleeding. I disagree with this dx.  -October 2017: diagnosed with Sicca (Dry eye) & eye inflammation.  -Rheumatology visit in October 2017 wherein I had genetic blood testing. I was found to have a positive HLA-B27 & two mutations of NOD2/CARD15/IBD1. Also found to be severely iron deficient. -November 30, 2017: Diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis. Started Celebrex 2x daily. Sulfasalazine recommended, but I have not taken it. -February 2017: Saw new GI doctor. Upped my dosage of Omeprazole to 40mg daily when it failed to work anymore.  -April 2017: x-ray of abdomen revealed what appears to be constipation. I can't imagine how I could have such horrible diarrhea with this. Also revealed Kidney stone. Sonogram revealed tumor in kidney believed to be angiomyolipoma. I am currently following up with a Nephrologist.  This is where I am at currently. As we speak, I have two ulcers in my mouth. These are the third & fourth ulcers I have had in about four weeks, one of which took up nearly half of my tongue & caused such severe swelling. I am in sheer agony & cannot eat, chew, and struggle to talk. I am at the end of my rope.  My main issues right now are severe diarrhea, sometimes bloody, usually always yellow in color (it is reminiscent to me of when I was doing the bowel prep for my colonoscopy), severe bloating wherein my pants cannot be buttoned, oral ulcers, heart palpitations, severe fatigue, shortness of breath upon exertion - I cannot use the stairs, frequent urination. I am so spent. I seriously cannot live like this anymore. I know something is wrong with me. Anyone have similar experience? Please, please share. I can't stress how badly I want answers. I almost don't even care what they are anymore.  My guess is Crohn's. They just can't seem to find it, but I know it can take years to diagnose. My genetic profile suggests Crohn's as NOD2 is also called IBD1 (Inflammatory Bowel Disease). I know oral ulcers are a manifestation of Crohn's & I've had mine swabbed for herpes, infectious disease, etc. all negative. Does anyone know, can they be swabbed for Crohn's?"

My 14 y.o. daughter has had some markers for autoimmune show up in her bloodwork twice in the past year and is just being monitored periodically by our rheumy at this point. ( I am diagnosed with lupus). She had a bizarre episode Wednesday night that took us to the ER and was admitted but they didn't find anything. She was cheering at football game Wednesday, just fine one minute, then suddenly was in intense abdominal pain, in the center of her stomach. We went to leave, and she could barely walk, was doubled over. I sat her down to get the car and within less than the minute it took me to get back to her she had vomited and become extremely lethargic. She said everything went blurry, she was very unaware of her surroundings, and really dizzy. I put her in the car and she was in and out of being awake (passed out?!) Drove to the ER, they did bloodwork, blood pressure pretty low, iv with fluids to hydrate, her pain levels went down within an hour significantly. No fever, did an ultrasound on her ovaries and appendix which showed a minimally enlarged appendix. They monitored her over night, and as nothing really showed up and pain went down to a 1-3 by yesterday afternoon and she pepped back up, they released her. Other than 2 bloodynoses in the last 24 hours, that's it! Following up with pediatrician this afternoon. Do I also check in with rheumatologist? New to this with her. No idea if this has anything to do with autoimmune and I know a lot of doctors never correlate anything to that. Sorry for the novel, just concerned. Thank you for any thoughts on this."

I've had bowel trouble for a number of years but recently I'm going to the toilet too frequently (up to 6 times a day) and the constitution is really loose.  I'm losing some feeling in my colon and back passage and am often having to rush to the toilet. The need to go to the toilet doesn't come gradually, it comes intensely and suddenly often resulting in near misses and even after going to the toilet my bowels still feel full. I thought it would be mostly down to my diet so I made some changes, It's not the healthiest diet but it's not bad enough that it should affect my bowels this much, it seems no matter what I eat it results in my spending most of the next day on the toilet. The problem isn't really how many times I'm going to the toilet, the problem is that when I go to the toilet my bowel movements are so unhealthy and foul smelling that no matter how much toilet paper I use to clean myself (and I really do clean myself, to the point where there's blood) the smell is still tends to linger, I personally can't smell it due to how much I smoke but I can see by other people's reactions that they can smell it, such as family members covering their noses when I'm around or over hearing the people I walk past in the street saying that I smell like I've *** myself.  It's the same even if I've had a shower and properly scrubbed myself clean, I still hear people I walk past comment on it. I'm also having bladder issues but I'm not sure as to whether the issues are related, much like with my bowels I'm losing some feeling resulting in some leakage which largely goes unnoticed until I hear other people comment on the smell. The need to urinate doesn't come urgently, instead it feels like my bladder is only slightly full, like I only need the toilet a little bit but when I go there's a lot more urine than I thought there would be. Much like the issue with my bowels this also results in me smelling bad if I've sat in my clothes for too long, I'm having to change my underwear a few times a day to avoid smelling of urine. I've been to my doctor about this and he gave me 3 days of anti-biotics in case it was an infection but they didn't seem to work. I've asked my family members out right if I smell dirty and they say I smell fine, but the people saying I smell fine are the ones that are covering their noses when I'm around, I often catch my brother sniffing me when I'm walking past him or something but when I ask if I smell he says no. Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this and had a diagnosis? I'm too scared to go to appointments to find out what''s wrong for fear of having accidents while I'm out. Any information on what could possibly be causing these symptoms and how to alleviate them would be much appreciated, I'm currently using loperamide to relieve the bowel symptoms which helps a bit."

I've been to my doctor about this and he gave me 3 days of anti-biotics in case it was an infection but they didn't seem to work. I've asked my family members out right if I smell dirty and they say I smell fine, but the people saying I smell fine are the ones that are covering their noses when I'm around, I often catch my brother sniffing me when I'm walking past him or something but when I ask if I smell he says no. Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this and had a diagnosis? I'm too scared to go to appointments to find out what''s wrong for fear of having accidents while I'm out. Any information on what could possibly be causing these symptoms and how to alleviate them would be much appreciated, I'm currently using loperamide to relieve the bowel symptoms which helps a bit."

Might i add, all of my general abdominal pain started after I went from 270lb to 175lb in 8 months just from working out with a stupid, very malnourished diet.  I grew very wary with the extreme ignorance of the doctors I visited (all seemed to think I was out to get their precious drugs :) so I started researching home remedies, not the greatest move for someone that didn't know anything about what was going on with my body at the time, ill admit. But I did it anyways and one of the first things I did was the famous liver/gallblader flush. It worked, and was pleased with the results of what i passed and how I felt afterwords, so I did a few more flushes within a couple month period. Well i ran into a problem a couple flushes before my last, a problem all liver flushers fear, a stone got stuck right were a duct empties into the stomach. I followed with 2 flushes and passed the mothership of stones, followed by several bowel movements of just stones.  Since then I've chilled out with home remedies and have gotten better insurance and a proper referral to one of the best gastroenterologist in my area which I can't see till May 23rd. The problem is i have a mass growing since the flushing incident, approximately 3"" below my sternum (first person viewing), positioned 1/8"" to the right of the rectus abdomens downward line. The mass is about the size of a quarter, soft but not lipomas soft and seems spherically shaped. The mass is manageable painwise , only when I don't eat proper and consistently does it get out of control. My stomach also tends to hold onto food far longer then its suppose to, which sometimes results in me feeling like my blood sugar is dropping, shaky, cold sweats, etc...not sure if this related to the mass or not.

This is a problem because my job does not allow me go when I want . I have even had to break my job policy on five occasions over the last five years to avoid having an accident. I have my first bowel movement at about 5:30 AM. Then, regardless of the size of the movement, I nearly always need a 2nd movement about 75-90 minutes later, even though I have had nothing to eat, but only a few sips of coffee. Even after the 2nd movement, I cannot have even a small breakfast, or there will be better than a 50/50 chance I will need a 3rd bowel movement. It is not until about 10 AM after at least two bowel movements that I feel comfortable having a small breakfast or snack. I get nervous in the morning having my morning coffee at McDonalds on my way to work, because all the restaurants have only one stall which has been occupied over 30 minutes on two occasions, forcing me to use the women's room. Only one stall in men's rooms should be illegal, but over 98% of all fast food restaurants have only one. My question is: Is there anything I can do to increase the chances of having one huge bowel movement at 5:30 AM to completely clear me out, so I don't need to go two or three more times over the nest two hours, even with nothing to eat?  I did make things much better by stopping my AM dose of metformin for my diabetes, so I rarely feel an urgent need, but I do not want ANY need after 5:30 AM, for at least another 10-12 hours. Any advice would be welcome. I have no idea how people can eat a huge meal in the morning, and then get in their cars without any concern for an emergency pit stop."

She was advised not to take anything for it. 5 days went by and she felt worse and was not eating much due to being sick and on the toilet regularly. She went back to the doctors and a day later after not sending me anything she was in hospital. She talked for 2 days whilst in hosiptal, told me she would be getting out and then i find out another day after from her little sister that she was put in a coma because the doctors couldnt get her iron levels up. The sister said that the coma could be 8+ weeks long. Now im not sure what i think of it all and wondered if this sounds legit or if this isnt common practice at all? As far as i know she doesnt have a history of anemia and this us the 1st time shes had anything like this before. Any advice, help or guidance and what are your opinions? Thank you"

I was treated for H Pylori a little over a year ago and recall the GI doc say I would probably have GI issues the rest of my life. I started taking omeprazole which has made that pressure under my rib go away but just recently I started feeling bloated, loss of appetite every couple days, and my stomach just different from usual. After searching on the web I found that the symptoms match those of gastric cancer. I had an endoscopy before I was diagnosed with H Pylori and am scheduled to have another one done in the next couple months, my worry is that if it is cancer a couple months could make a difference. Am I overthinking this?"

It was like I was waking up in the wrong body every day and trying to figure out how to get back to being me. My gastroenterologist recommended that I try the Low FODMAP diet and report back to her after 3 weeks to discuss possible solutions. During this elimination phase I completely dumped all Soy, Dairy, Wheat, Gluten, HFCS, Garlic, Onions, and Sugar Alcohols. This isn't a complete list, but these were the biggies! I didn't realize how addictive the substances were in the foods I was consuming or what they were doing to my body! For 3 weeks I went through food withdrawals, mood swings, and just felt like a total crazy lady! But, once my body detoxed from all that stuff, something amazing happened! I felt 10 years younger, had more energy, was able to reduce most of my meds, the brain fog was gone, and smaller meals filled me up faster.

I'm new to the idea of joining online communities, but I'm game for anything that helps encourage and inspire others. A friend of mine actually suggested that I get out there (web) and tell my story. In July of 2017 I weighed 267 pounds. I had problems with brain fog, depression, asthma, vit D deficiency, GERD, and was diagnosed with IBS with inflammation. It was like I was waking up in the wrong body every day and trying to figure out how to get back to being me. My gastroenterologist recommended that I try the Low FODMAP diet and report back to her after 3 weeks to discuss possible solutions. During this elimination phase I completely dumped all Soy, Dairy, Wheat, Gluten, HFCS, Garlic, Onions, and Sugar Alcohols. This isn't a complete list, but these were the biggies! I didn't realize how addictive the substances were in the foods I was consuming or what they were doing to my body! For 3 weeks I went through food withdrawals, mood swings, and just felt like a total crazy lady! But, once my body detoxed from all that stuff, something amazing happened! I felt 10 years younger, had more energy, was able to reduce most of my meds, the brain fog was gone, and smaller meals filled me up faster. One of the things I learned was that HFCS is highly addictive and is designed to shut off your ""full switch"" in your brain. Now, my body's metabolism has reset! I've dropped down from a size 24 to size 14/15. I've dropped 58 lbs so far! Yesterday I weighed myself and was down to 209! My goal weight is 150. When I reach my goal weight I'm going to reward myself with a mommy make-over and full-body tuck, since my weight loss will be more than 100lbs. Last November, I plateaued around 40lbs of weight lost. That's when I discovered Arbonne! Arbonne's healthy living program has helped me lose 18 more pounds and continues to help me steadily lose 1 to 2 pounds every week! I drink meal replacement shakes for breakfast and lunch. My shakes taste amazing - are soy free, dairy free, Organic, Kosher, Vegan, and NonGMO certified. I loved them so much that I actually joined the company to help others experience the same life changing results that I had experienced, and to get the discount, lol!

Couple of weeks later they come back this time I also got Ill with zebra I think was a bad cold, I had fever of 38, headaches and mucus. I noticed it took me a long time recovering from that cold. When I got better 2 weeks after since I was still having palpitations I went to the cardiologist. He listened to my heart and told I had a heart murmur I/II degree, did a 24 hour Holter and found I was having tachycardia, and sinusal breathing arritmia. The Dr said it was nothing serious so prescribed nothing. Meanwhile I had lost 5kg in a month ( probably because of the cold). Had an investigation of what was causing the heart murmur so I did:  Thyroid eco: found several cistes on thyroid  Heart eco- all normal and functioning normal no alterations  Thyroid hormones tested- TSH, T3 and T4 all within normal range  Blood work- all normal  Nose and throat bacteria test- found a Kleibsiela bacteria on my throat (antibiotics prescribed for that) nose come back clear.  During that time I started experiencing sometimes pain on my left arm ( I thought I would have a heart attack) but it went away  I had electric shock like sensation down my right arm or shoulder sometimes but it would last miliseconds (that also stopped)  I experienced sometimes at night my temperature raising and a little bit of sweating (really minimal sometimes just between my breasts a bit)  I still have excessive hair loss and recently had to have my hair cut short (but I also been trying a new hair relaxer and dye it might be it. I just never had so much hair loss before)  I noticed jerk like movements when I'm about to fall asleep at the first it happen 3 times now I have muscle spasms constantly they are very small and last miliseconds too  My heart had no reason to be having arritmia so I was sent to the endocrinologist.  Showed all my lad work and was sent to have anti- thyroid anti-corps tested.  It takes two weeks for me to get the results so I have to wait.  Since this first started I have eye discomfort but for the past 3 days I sometimes had something ""flow"" on my peripheral vision but bothers me. It's like I can catch any movement or light and it is just a weird perception and I see even small particles floating on the air.

The first time I recall having this issue was on Christmas Eve when I was 5 years old.  Here is what I can tell you. Stabbing pain, top right of the stomach lasts from 7PM - 7AM (with early symptoms starting around 4-5, weird taste in my mouth.) I take extremely hot baths, rock my body, rub my feet, sit with a heating pad until I pass out from exhaustion. (As I type this I am sitting with the heating pad preparing for the rocky night.)  Also, I do not have regular bowel movements. Sometimes its every other day. And about once every 3-4 months this happens. What I think is happening and maybe there is a reason why is this. My body is not digesting food as normal stomachs would. When I have these ""Stomach episodes"" I will force myself to vomit (ONLY during these episodes do I self-purge.) What I have noticed when purging is that the food I have eaten from the morning is still solid. **when I get the early symptoms I stop any and all food intake for that day.**  I have been to doctors, I have been tested and scoped. I have spent many nights in the ER where the only thing that stops the pain is an IV. Pills do not work during these episodes (because the food is not digesting.)  Any and all help with this would be lovely. 27 Years of these episodes are enough."

At the hospital they took blood test, and a bed side ultrasound over my bottom right abdomen and everything came back fine so they sent me home at which point the pain died down. The next day i had a very very weird variety of diaheara I have never had before, very oily and thick. A couple days later i noticed abdominal pain throughout my abdomen returning, not like the initial pain but more like a dull aching and tenderness. During this time I also started to notice that I wasnt able to have a bowel movement normally. I would have to strain extensively just to get a couple small pebbles. I went to the doctor a couple days after i noticed the bowel movement changes,and he initially thought I had gastro which he later changed to just constipation since i no longer has anymore cases of diarrhea. He prescribed me an osmotic laxative, which i took as directed. It didnt start working until about 4 days after taking and even when I say "" working "" i would still have to strain for very small peices of stool.  I returned to my doctor for more blood test which still showed nothing, he gave me more laxative and told me to return if doesnt clear up. During this time i was still constipated and the tenderness in my abdomen turned more to a numbing feeling that was only felt on the left side of my abdomen, espeically when standing up and moving quickly like going up and down stairs. I returned to my doctor two weeks ago and finally he sent me to get ultrasounds done by a separate company and he sent for blood work and stool samples. The ultrasound came back normal, blood work came back normal and i still haven't recieved the stool samples results back. Now im at the point where the past week ive been having pain going down through my right leg and my bowel movements need to be triggered by things like coffee, and their still just hard smaller stools. If anyone has every had anything similar or any advice on what could be going on id much appreciate, thanks"

At the hospital they took blood test, and a bed side ultrasound over my bottom right abdomen and everything came back fine so they sent me home at which point the pain died down. The next day i had a very very weird variety of diaheara I have never had before, very oily and thick. A couple days later i noticed abdominal pain throughout my abdomen returning, not like the initial pain but more like a dull aching and tenderness. During this time I also started to notice that I wasnt able to have a bowel movement normally. I would have to strain extensively just to get a couple small pebbles. I went to the doctor a couple days after i noticed the bowel movement changes,and he initially thought I had gastro which he later changed to just constipation since i no longer has anymore cases of diarrhea. He prescribed me an osmotic laxative, which i took as directed. It didnt start working until about 4 days after taking and even when I say "" working "" i would still have to strain for very small peices of stool.  I returned to my doctor for more blood test which still showed nothing, he gave me more laxative and told me to return if doesnt clear up. During this time i was still constipated and the tenderness in my abdomen turned more to a numbing feeling that was only felt on the left side of my abdomen, espeically when standing up and moving quickly like going up and down stairs.

Everybody has had moments of overeating in their lives. In this article, I’m not here to push a ketogenic diet upon you, but I am here to give you some tips that may help you regardless of whichever diet you’re on usual overeating. If you’re not eating enough or you’re not getting enough calories in your day that often leads to a binge episode. I guess you could say you could have two days of eating perfectly hitting your calorie goal every single day and then on the third day just have a complete blowout.

Substantial Eat Drink More Water Exercise and Get Moving Plan Your Meals Reduced Snacking or Limit Snacking Intermittently Fast Keep Busy Keep Moving Ditch The Cheat Days Don’t Overtrain Acknowledging That You Have Substantial Eat Tip for binge eating is it something that is substantially eating a bigger meal something that will keep you fuller for longer incorporating fats into your diet. Definitely do this because fats suppress your appetite again not trying to sell the diet. But as somebody on the ketogenic diet I probably two meals a day sometimes three. I’ll have my first meal at midday and I’m never ever hungry I’m full and completely satisfied with incorporating more fat into your diet. You don’t have to go full ketogenic extremists by adding oils to absolutely everything. It could be just as simple as incorporating nuts avocado and some olive oil to your dressing and your salad and things like that. I promise you that you will notice a difference with your appetite. Drink More Water I find if I have a big drink of water before a meal I will then eat less in the meantime. It’s because I’m often thirstily dehydrated rather than actually hungry. It will kind of fill my stomach a little bit before I do begin to eat. I drink around 4 liters of water and I genuinely do believe this has something to do with my appetite suppression. Exercise and Get Moving I find if I’m drawn to the kitchen and want to graze around and looking side the fridge in the cupboards. I get out and about if I go and do some exercise it will make me completely forget about the fact that I’m drawn and wanting to snack. Plan Your Meals"

So, last colonoscopy after a confirmation of diverticulitis diagnosis via CT, my GI doc, whom I like and respect very much, recommends a colectomy, due to the frequency of the flares and worry about perforation and peritonitis requiring emergency treatment. Yikes. And my health insurance has a $2,100 deductible and 20% copay, so the hospital costs would be considerable and would have to come from my very small $11,000 401k.

Histologic sections reveal gastic mucosa with increased infilintrate of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells within the lamina propria. There is focal neutrophilic infiltration of foveola epitheliem. All biopsies came back negative for dysplasia and malignancy, Praise God. My problem is, the helicobater pylori diagnosis. I have been drinking the same tap water for years. Nobody else in my family is affected. I've had it before and I was very tempormental and treated with antibiotics. No big deal. I've done some research and it ranges from IBS, Ulcerative Colitis, Chrone's, to nothing(which would make no sense considering im only 22 and lost 40lbs) Id like to note I have severe anxiety/depression and have been screened on eating disorders and my thyroid doctor ran a full endocrine test so my thyroid isn't to blame. I stuff my face every day trrying to gain weight, just for it to run through me. During prep day for my colonoscopy, it was like an average day for me. The drinks ran through me within an hour, like everything else I ingest.  The notes of inflamation and immune cells has me questioning things. I follow up with my specialist August 1 and it seems like forever away.  I have had to apply for disability at 22, because I was fired because my boss didn't think I was ""mentally capable of working."" My anxiety has been high during this time, and running to and from the bathroom all day at work landed me jobless. I am staying home with my 1 year old now(which is a job technically, but my income was needed.) I am ashamed to admit I am very prideful for my age and disability seems like the easy way out, but at this point in my life, I don't have a choice. My anxiety and depression became ""unhandled"" once the weight started falling off, as if they werent as effective or something. I'm sitting at home crying most of the time, and running to and from the bathroom while trying to be a good attentive mother. I am struggling to stay above 100lbs, and not being dramatic(even though im a 22 year old girl hehe) I truly feel like im withering away. Every day I have less and less energy. The histology report has me very discouraged because it doesn't seem like anything was found. Has anybody on here had the same case, or similiar and received a diagnosis? Or is there a GI on here that could give some insight? I would greatly apprecate it."

As my title suggests I'm having trouble with blood in my stool. For the past three days I've been having bright red blood in my stool without any kind of discomfort such as cramping or fissures. I feel no pain during the day and it feels completely normal. The first two days I had very hard stools so I thought I was just cramping because of that, and yesterday I had a bit of pain from straining but it only lasted an hour afterwords. Today I made sure to drink a lot of water so as to see if that was the problem and the stool I passed today (I drink coffee daily so I have an almost daily BM) was loose, but still bright red. I felt completely normal passing it.  Some important things to note, recently I had my very first vaginal yeast infection and took Monistat 3 for it. On the second day after my first dose is when the problem started. I've been off Monistat for almost two days now and my infection is cleared up. Another thing is that yesterday I had a 'perceived' migraine with a mild tension headache, 'pins-and-needles' skin sensitivity mostly in my arms, and mild nausea. I took some Anacin (2 capsules, I've taken it before and haven't gotten any bad side effects). I lied down for a few hours and mostly got rid of it and woke up this morning with only the skin sensitivity and kind of an 'echo' of the headache and nausea. I took a dose of Anacin as well about 15 hours after my first dose to help with the 'postdrome'.   Sometime after my BM today I felt somewhat tight in my chest (more like my stomach feels a bit too full, not bloated, and my gut feels too empty). Within the last hour and a half I've eaten a lot of Fudge Stripes (they're very addictive), and about seven hours ago I had a salad for lunch. My diet and the things I've eaten recently always go down very well with me. Another thing to note is that I have been undergoing a high-stress situation where one of my caretakers is in the hospital and I am left to take care of the house, and just today I have started back school and it has been mentally grueling for me. I'm preparing a mild meal now to see if I can eat a bit. However I try I can't seem to relax. Maybe it's because of the Anacin, because the caffeine effect of it lasts a few hours for me, or because of my high anxiety and stress.   So, what do you think? Could the blood today just be leftover from the strain/medication from the past few days? Do I have cancer (this is WebMD after all)? I have no symptoms of blood loss (lightheadedness, pale skin, etc.) Should I see a doctor or talk to a caretaker?  Thank you for your time."

Maybe it's because of the Anacin, because the caffeine effect of it lasts a few hours for me, or because of my high anxiety and stress.   So, what do you think? Could the blood today just be leftover from the strain/medication from the past few days? Do I have cancer (this is WebMD after all)? I have no symptoms of blood loss (lightheadedness, pale skin, etc.) Should I see a doctor or talk to a caretaker?  Thank you for your time."

I would say probably 2003 or so. It's been a while, and I wish things were a bit more under control.. some days are worse than others. but... i'm still here..  so about 3 years ago, my ex wanted to take me back to court for 50/50 custody of my kids.. he wasn't there for about 4 yrs.. he did it for child support reasons, my opinion.. anyway.. my mom decided to go into cahoots w/ him, and help him. mind you, he abused me for 20 years in every way. and she knew it. he cheated, had a kid w/ his friends wife and my mom was asked to be the nanny/gramma of that kid.. she agreed.. total betrayal to me in every way..  anyway.. fast forward to today.. my mom has been very involved w/ my ex and his new ""family""..so much so, that she has managed to turn my oldest against me, calling me toxic and telling me that I have to do ""better"" as a mother.. I left the abuse in 2013, clothes on my back, with my three kids. did all I could to support them.. and did.. so now, my oldest is 20.. she decided to move in w/ dad about 6 months ago, dad and girlfriend actually. they have ""loose"" rules, I have regular standard rules and my oldest decided that it was best for her to leave and go there, even though dad pretty much deserted her for 5 years.. my son.. my son is 18 on March 4th.. very disrespectful.. doesn't like my rules. he ran to gramma, and gramma basically coddles him, doesn't make him be responsible for his actions. he called my 12 yr old a *** on her birthday, I told him he can't join us for her bday and he got violent w/ me.. so now, he's about to graduate and wants to live carefree w/ gramma.. she manipulates and is a classic narcissist.. my son also told me that he wants me dead.. i'm just at a loss.. and I have been dealing w/ this feeling of betrayal for years, and have been ganged up on.. and i'm tired.. I can't even begin to write everything that's happened ."

It hurts pretty bad, enough to wake me up early in the morning though I work nights, and pretty much consistently throughout the day. It helps when I drink warm drinks, but otherwise it's bad enough to make me lose my appetite.  Although I'm aware you have to eat if it is an ulcer, the first time I tried to eat when it happened I throw it up a while later so I haven't managed to eat much at all the past week, is there any way to treat this if it is indeed an ulcer?"

My daughter is a freshman at a large university. She has always been what I called ""high strung"" and very emotional. In high school she was dealing with a lot of changes. For most of her first year she was very anxious and became depressed. Then she began having problems with eating. After the first year of hs, her anxiety improved but She developed an eating disorder. By her junior year she was diagnosed with EDNOS (Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified) and Anxiety. She worked hard with a therapist and nutritionist to get her life on track with great results. Fastforward to this year. She began college in September. One of the reasons we chose the university was the availability of mental health and eating disorder counseling. Her therapist thought she would benefit from living on campus to begin to be independent from us. She was so excited to go away, did not want to live at home and commute. She has been a MESS. Several full blown panic attacks. MANY crying phone calls. Several visits to campus to see her. She went to mental health clinic 4 weeks ago and so far no therapy, they are going to outsource her to an off campus dr which gives her more stress not knowing how she is going to get there. They did provide her with a small group class in calmness. Her grades are suffering. She loves college and hates it at the same time. There are many things she enjoys and has made a lot of new friends. When she comes home to visit she cry about going back. Hopefully she will begin therapy soon. So far, none of the eating behaviors have come but so much anxiety. Has anyone else dealt with anxiety in college either as a parent or student? How do you help someone you love who is in pain???? I feel like I am on the brink of losing it myself. Thanks for listening."

It is a long description but I think it was important to include.  I have tried to make it as readable as possible.  My father who is 70 years old has been experiencing continuous hiccups for a year now.  This is obviously very painful as he is unable to eat or even sleep properly. After testing countless home remedies, we got him checked by medical experts about 6 months ago.  Almost all of them informed us it is due to prolonged stress, which might be true due to certain events in our lives. ********** BACKGROUND INFO ********** Age = 70 years. Ethnicity = South Asian. He has had high blood pressure and high cholesterol for more than 25 years, has been gout patient too for that amount of time. He has been obese as well for 25+ years, current weight = 245 lb, height = almost 6 feet. He also had type 2 diabetes probably for 15+ years. He can barely walk and is not active at all, mostly due to back and joint pains. He has avoided almost all meat products for 10+ years, but I think he gained weight due to more consumption of carbohydrates, specifically white flour and rice. No smoking/drinking or recreational drugs habits thankfully. He has also been experiencing cough and weakness and loss of appetite for the last 20 days or so. None of the doctors were 100% sure about the solution and prescribed the following tests and medications:  ********** TESTS DONE ********** All information is within 3 months range. -Uric Acid = 7 [normal] -All Cholesterols Total/HDL/LDL within range -Triglycerides 10-20% above normal range -ALT normal -Blood sugar controlled by 2 medicines, Glucophage and Glucobay -His ultrasound was i think normal too. -In a very recent test, it was shown his heart walls have become thick due to prolonged stress and cholesterol.  ********** DOCTORS CURRENT CONSENSUS ********** Out of the 5 doctors consulted, 2 are Cardiologists, 2 General Practitioner and a very recent one is Neurologist. Should I also consult Gastroenterologist? -Doctors ruled out existence of tumors or cancers etc based on ultrasound and long history of hiccups. Few doctors also suggested it might be GERD or acid reflux but he does not have all the symptoms. ********** ANY OTHER TESTS NEEDED? ********** I wonder now why no doctor asked to check his ""cortisol"" range? Is it not important to test to measure stress? Any other important factors to test for his stress levels? Is ENDOSCOPY really needed? No doctor so far suggested it but after researching online it seems very important? **********RECENT MEDICATIONS FOR HICCUPS********** Medications for hiccups he has been using regularly since the past 3-4 months -Motilium tablet [4 months][1+1+1 before each meal] -Nexum capsule [3 months][1+0+1 before each meal] -Gaviscon syrup [3 months] [1+0+1, 1 tbsp after each meal]  -Motival tablet [1 month][1, in the night] for stress/anxiety -RIVOTRIL for stress management prescribed by a neurologist for 3 weeks. ******OTHER DAILY LONGTERM MEDICATIONS HE TAKES REGULARLY******* These are additional medications he has to take daily for heart, blood pressure, sugar, uric acid and pain killers etc. -COEZIDAY 100mg 1x  -CAPOTIN 50mg 2x [0.25+0.25mg] -GLUCOPHANGE 500mg 1x -GLUCOBAY 50mg 1x -DISPIRIN 300mg 1x -ZYLORIC 100mg [URIC ACID] **********THE ONLY TEMPORARY REMEDY THAT WORKS********** A very temporary cure [30 minutes to 1 hour] is drinking any cola [higher the carbonation, better] while standing and bending low.

It is a long description but I think it was important to include.  I have tried to make it as readable as possible.  My father who is 70 years old has been experiencing continuous hiccups for a year now.  This is obviously very painful as he is unable to eat or even sleep properly. After testing countless home remedies, we got him checked by medical experts about 6 months ago.  Almost all of them informed us it is due to prolonged stress, which might be true due to certain events in our lives. ********** BACKGROUND INFO ********** Age = 70 years. Ethnicity = South Asian. He has had high blood pressure and high cholesterol for more than 25 years, has been gout patient too for that amount of time. He has been obese as well for 25+ years, current weight = 245 lb, height = almost 6 feet. He also had type 2 diabetes probably for 15+ years. He can barely walk and is not active at all, mostly due to back and joint pains. He has avoided almost all meat products for 10+ years, but I think he gained weight due to more consumption of carbohydrates, specifically white flour and rice. No smoking/drinking or recreational drugs habits thankfully. He has also been experiencing cough and weakness and loss of appetite for the last 20 days or so. None of the doctors were 100% sure about the solution and prescribed the following tests and medications:  ********** TESTS DONE ********** All information is within 3 months range. -Uric Acid = 7 [normal] -All Cholesterols Total/HDL/LDL within range -Triglycerides 10-20% above normal range -ALT normal -Blood sugar controlled by 2 medicines, Glucophage and Glucobay -His ultrasound was i think normal too. -In a very recent test, it was shown his heart walls have become thick due to prolonged stress and cholesterol.  ********** DOCTORS CURRENT CONSENSUS ********** Out of the 5 doctors consulted, 2 are Cardiologists, 2 General Practitioner and a very recent one is Neurologist. Should I also consult Gastroenterologist? -Doctors ruled out existence of tumors or cancers etc based on ultrasound and long history of hiccups. Few doctors also suggested it might be GERD or acid reflux but he does not have all the symptoms. ********** ANY OTHER TESTS NEEDED? ********** I wonder now why no doctor asked to check his ""cortisol"" range? Is it not important to test to measure stress? Any other important factors to test for his stress levels? Is ENDOSCOPY really needed? No doctor so far suggested it but after researching online it seems very important? **********RECENT MEDICATIONS FOR HICCUPS********** Medications for hiccups he has been using regularly since the past 3-4 months -Motilium tablet [4 months][1+1+1 before each meal] -Nexum capsule [3 months][1+0+1 before each meal] -Gaviscon syrup [3 months] [1+0+1, 1 tbsp after each meal]  -Motival tablet [1 month][1, in the night] for stress/anxiety -RIVOTRIL for stress management prescribed by a neurologist for 3 weeks. ******OTHER DAILY LONGTERM MEDICATIONS HE TAKES REGULARLY******* These are additional medications he has to take daily for heart, blood pressure, sugar, uric acid and pain killers etc. -COEZIDAY 100mg 1x  -CAPOTIN 50mg 2x [0.25+0.25mg] -GLUCOPHANGE 500mg 1x -GLUCOBAY 50mg 1x -DISPIRIN 300mg 1x -ZYLORIC 100mg [URIC ACID] **********THE ONLY TEMPORARY REMEDY THAT WORKS********** A very temporary cure [30 minutes to 1 hour] is drinking any cola [higher the carbonation, better] while standing and bending low. Drinking warm water helps a little bit as well. Please tell me what can we do about it? This has been very painful not only to the patient but for all family members as well.

Initially I was not aware that I am going through anxiety or stress until physical sign starts showing, a ten years ago whenever I have to travel for a day or two I start feeling cramps in my stomach, due to this increasing issue I like to avoid travelling, now after this period of time whenever I have to go to see a friend or go out for a longer I feel the same. it is so obvious that whenever I have to give some presentation or go into meeting with new people and specially to a new place or even a seminar at a hotel which I had never visited before I have a sever diarrhea, and this is so embarrassing for me and I don't know how to deal with it. I had seen few doctors in past, some of them prescribed me with Librex and to defuse the current situation provide me with antibiotics. But this issue is taking me no where.  recently I traveled to another city for 15 days and during travelling diarrhea hits me badly and I was unable to control it with the medication. after coming back to home town this diarrhea problem is off and on for me. I went to see my doctor again and he performed few stool tests in which I have H. pylori Antigen (Stool) Positive, I am not sure how this happened or how much my situation contributes towards it. He again gave me antibiotics for seven days which includes Flaygel 400mg and Amoxil three times in a day along with Librex, a two days ago the antibiotics course is completed and I am having same diarrhea and went to rest room like 3 times and having watery stool in the last one.  I am so afraid of my situation as I have to go office, I almost stop socialization and due to this people are not happy with my attitude as I have to say no without any reason. Please help me if you have any advise for me. I feel stuck in this situation."

I have been on Suboxone 8mgs for past 2 years. I am 31 male. 5""10, 220lbs so overweight. I developed constipation where I would go every 3 days. The constipation got better to going everyday but now I feel as if I have gas stuck all the time in my intestines. I can most of the time feel stool moving through my intestines. I hearing gurgling a lot and am always bloated. I have been to my doctor last November. He did all types of blood tests, everything was clear. He did an MRI thought maybe Diverticulosis because felt like very little stool would get past my lower left side. That was clear.  I have in the past had pencil like stools and starting using Metamucil which thickened up my stool. Have since stopped using Metamucil and back to going mostly once a day. Seems only go in morning with coffee."

But in the past few months it’s become almost unbearable. This is the direct result of me uncovering a memory of sexual abuse in my childhood, ever since then nothing has felt real. My body and mind feel disconnected, and my mind is in this constant fog. When i’m with friends or even family i can’t think of what to say or i’ll completely zone out of conversations and have no idea how to reply, as a result i try to be alone as much as possible which has put a strain on my friendships. Because of this my anxiety has heightened, even with my mom and brothers making it almost impossible to escape, which is extremely draining. On top of this, my depression has worsened, and even taken on physical symptoms, and i struggle to complete assignments, shower and go to school. I can’t even sleep properly because the memory persists in my dreams just as bad as when i’m awake, it’s as if i’m still in that day so i stay up all night with anxiety and can’t to handle all of my responsibilities because of a constant fatigue. I feel trapped and so alone. I’m only 17 and my life feels over already, i just want to give up and stop fighting this. I dont feel like my life is worth living anymore and i don’t know what else to do."

Starting last year, freshman year of high school, I getting sick when I'd eat at restaurants. There was a really cute popular girl I had a chance with, but I was suffering from social anxiety then so every time I'd think about her when I'd eat, I'd either almost throw up, or actually throw up, usually the latter. But now she moved and I'm not suffering from social anxiety nearly as bad this year and I've started blooming, but the sickness never left. When I eat even my favorite foods like steak I can get sick, almost every single time I eat at a restaurant, I want to throw up so I have to go to the bathroom. But when i get sick during the meal is incredibly inconsistent, I can start feeling nauseous after the first bite, the last bite, or in the middle. The weirdest part, what makes me believe its almost a texture thing, is the instant I chew a piece of food in my mouth once or twice, I can tell if i swallow it, I will throw up. I won't know beforehand if it's coming but the second i start chewing, i do. After I attempt swallowing it to avoid spitting chewed food into my napkin or my plate, I will feel as if i will throw up for the rest of the meal. If I do end up throwing up, it's like a breath of fresh air and I can eat the rest of the meal no problem."

I just joined. I hope this isn’t too long. I’m 34. Ive had problems with anxiety since 3, depression since 14. Both come and go. However, this last episode started 3 years, triggered by a bad breakup. I had a mental breakdown, and can’t seem to get my life back. I’m talking like, you don’t know how to get dressed in the morning, you don’t know how to go out of the house, function? I go months without going anywhere but therapy bc of crippling social anxiety.  I can’t look in mirrors because I hate myself so much.  I forget how to be human, honestly. I’ll go days without showering. And I’m embarrassed typing this. I’ve been in therapy since 2nd grade. I’m on antidepressants, I have treatment resistant depression. I’ve tried ketamine infusions, hypnosis type stuff, wasn’t a candidate for TMS. Several other things. Everything I can think of I honestly wake up every day, sad that I’ve woken up. I’ve gotten through before, but this last episode somehow broke me to the point where I don’t know how to function. I don’t know how to get myself back. Has this happened to anyone, how did you get through it?"

Since the past 6 months, I've been having quite a bit of issues with my digestive system. Most of the other issues seem to have passed, but I'm still left with this one: Moderate pain on the lower right side of my stomach when sleeping on my right side.  This all started with a worsening of my reflux symptoms (which I've had on and off for at least the last 10 years or so). Terrible heart burn, lot of bloating, gurgling stomach sounds and lower right abdomen pain. Few days after the reflux went nuts, I also developed a diarrhea and low grade fever jumping between 37.5 - 38 Celcius (99.5 - 100.5 Fahrenheit). At that point, I went to a doctor and had some blood work done plus was tested for Helicobacter pylori. All came back normal (and negative for h. pylori). After physical exam, history and the test results, doctor gave me the diagnosis of IBS. Fast forward to this day. The good part is, my reflux and other stomach problems seem to be ""ok"" now, but I'm still left with this weird problem at night time. Like said, the pain only comes to surface when I'm laying on my right side in bed. When I switch my sleeping position to sleeping on back or on my right side, the pain disappears. The pain is always on the same place, right lower quadrant of my stomach. I believe it's right about the same place where appendix is.  The pain is almost always accompanied with gas and if I press on the spot where it hurts, there are audible gurgling sounds present. My questions are:  - Does anyone else experience the same thing (whether you have IBS or not)? - And if you do, have you (or your doctor) been able to figure out what's causing it? - Is there something that I can try to make it go away? I'm just clueless as to why this is happening now, because for the past 36 years, I certainly have not experienced this before. Any ideas and tips appreciated! --- (Image: Blausen.com staff (2014).

I'm only a 24 year old female (not sexually active) and for the past while (maybe 4-6 or so months) I started noticing a fairly solid lump on my anus when I wipe (feels directly on or just above, maybe perineum area? - not on the sides) - it hasn't gone away, it does cause a lot of itching but so far no blood except maybe for the light drops once in a while & no pain. At first I didn't think much of it, thought maybe it'd go away, I wasn't even sure if anything had changed, maybe it was just something I didn't notice before. I'm way to scared to bring it up with my usual doctor, just talking about it might be fine but the idea of a physical rectal exam terrifies me - I've never even had a pap. I've been going online trying to get some answers and now I've got myself scared of it being cancer... I keep thinking to myself that's silly, but if it is something more serious I don't want to leave it. What should I do? Does it sound like it's most likely just piles or a fissure? or something more? Thanks in advance."

It all started when I was 18 years old graduating from high school. I began to have abdominal pain and minor bouts of diarrhea. I thought it was just a virus or just going through a phase, but after a month I had enough and went in to see a gastroenterologist. I had blood tests run, an ultrasound of my adbdomen, and finally a colonoscopy. After all the tests my doctor said that I had “minor” IBS and that I would be fine. After speaking with the doctor I felt better knowing that I would be fine but in the back of my head I knew something was not right.  I went off to college for 5 years and the symptoms continued to get worse and worse, I saw a few other doctors along the way and they said that it is just the IBS you are “fine” just cut back on drinking and eating junk food/bad food. It got to the point towards the end of college where if I went out drinking than I would have extreme pain in the abdomen area/bad diarrhea so I began to cut back on the drinking and bad foods. Also my stools slowly started to become loose. I began to just not be myself and I knew something was wrong in the back of my head. But what more could I do besides a colonoscopy? I also started to experience frequent urination that got worse over time and also muscle spasms and heart palpitations that also got worse. My doctor said it was just “stress” and told me to cut back on any caffeine you may be consuming.  These symptoms progressively got worse over time but I was still able to live a moderately normal life until one day about a year after I graduated from college. At about 1:00AM in the morning I remember waking up from sleeping on the couch and quickly walking to bed. As soon as I laid down on my stomach I suddenly felt very light headed and queezy. I got very faint, my heart rate shot to what felt like 150bpm, I was sweating profusely, had scary heart palpitations, and I thought this was it my life was ending tonight. I got very close to passing out but never lost consciousness. My girlfriend at the time rushed me to the hospital and they did blood work and a cat scan of my head. I spent about half the night there and at the end of it the doctor said that I was free to leave and thought it was probably stress that triggered it and gave me no explanation. After that day I started noticing awful reactions to certain foods like sugar, white carbs, alcohol, eating excessively, and even exercise. I was having awful heart palpitations, feeling dizzy, was not able to think clearly, my lymph nodes became swollen and would get worse after eating the above referenced foods, and my heart would randomly jump to 130-15bpm. I got random bouts of dizziness after changing elevations quickly.  One day for lunch at work about a week after the first trip to the ER I consumed one single beer and immediately I started feeling dizzy and wound up going to the emergency room again that night. The same symptoms as the first trip to the ER happened and the doctor ended up saying basically the same thing. By the way it has been about a year since that second trip to the ER and I have not had a single drink since then. Shortly after the first trip to the ER I began seeing several doctors. The first doctor I saw was my general practitioner. He did extensive blood work and said everything looked normal and that it was probably stress and he recommended me to a cardiologist, endocrinologist, and even a psychologist! The second one I saw was a cardiologist in which I had a stress test done, several EKG’s, too much blood work, and also an ultrasound of my heart. Everything checked out fine and he said it was probably just “stress” you were experiencing and that you just need to relax. I proceeded to see another cardiologist and had the same tests done in which he told me that it was again just stress and that I was fine. Now I moved on to see two endocrinologists in which I did all the blood work in the world it felt like. I got tested for thyroid problems and everything and I got the same response from all the other doctors. I proceeded to see a gastroenterologist where he did extensive blood work and tested for chrons, any inflammation and various other diseases. I told him everything and he literally told me to take pepto bismol and that I was fine. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. At this point all I wanted was a doctor to give me some concrete answers and tell me something besides stress is causing all of this. On to another gastroenterologist. I went to the Medical Center in Houston, TX one of the best hopitals in the country. They did a stool sample, a cat scan of my abdomen, and extensive blood work. After all those tests they said everything was normal and that you’re symptoms were over a broad range of organ systems so they basically could not give me any answers. I have seen 7 doctors in 3 months at this point but hey who is counting. After eating anything at this point I just don’t feel right. My symptoms after seeing the 7th doctor include: heart palpitations, muscle spasms, swollen lymph nodes(gets worse after eating), tight chest(gets after eating), loose stools, occasional diarrhea, brain fog, loss of appetite, constipation, dizziness after sudden elevation changes, sleep loss, ringing in ears, and loss of weight. I went from being 175 pounds to 140 pounds without even trying. All of these symptoms get worse after eating, especially after sugar, junk food, starches, and alcohol. The only thing that made me feel slightly better was keeping an extremely strict diet. The more I researched the more I thought that this was a gastro related nervous system disorder so I saw a neurologist and he said that the gut is lined by the nervous system and that I had an extremely over reactive gut. He prescribed me clonazepam’s and said this would help calm my gut. I thought this was the last thing I wanted because I thought it would probably make me worse or it would just be a band-aid and not cover the real issues at hand. Nonetheless I took them for a few weeks to just try and keep sane because I was desperate and then got off of them quickly. They did not solve any real problems.  	It has been almost a year now since that first trip to the emergency room and my symptoms have gotten slightly better but they are still there and the only things that have helped me has been to keep an extremely strict diet. Right not all I want is some answers. I try hard to keep a positive attitude but sometimes it is extremely hard and I get really down on myself. All of my friends seem so happy and healthy and I cannot say the same for myself. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? This is not stress or IBS we are talking about here. Please if there is anyone out there that has any insight to what is going on with me or a possible doctor referral that could help me out please email me at   I apologize for the lengthy post but I can not go my whole life without knowing what is wrong with me. If anyone is going through the same types of issues or anything similar at all feel free to email me to discuss as well."

I have seen 7 doctors in 3 months at this point but hey who is counting. After eating anything at this point I just don’t feel right. My symptoms after seeing the 7th doctor include: heart palpitations, muscle spasms, swollen lymph nodes(gets worse after eating), tight chest(gets after eating), loose stools, occasional diarrhea, brain fog, loss of appetite, constipation, dizziness after sudden elevation changes, sleep loss, ringing in ears, and loss of weight. I went from being 175 pounds to 140 pounds without even trying. All of these symptoms get worse after eating, especially after sugar, junk food, starches, and alcohol. The only thing that made me feel slightly better was keeping an extremely strict diet. The more I researched the more I thought that this was a gastro related nervous system disorder so I saw a neurologist and he said that the gut is lined by the nervous system and that I had an extremely over reactive gut. He prescribed me clonazepam’s and said this would help calm my gut. I thought this was the last thing I wanted because I thought it would probably make me worse or it would just be a band-aid and not cover the real issues at hand. Nonetheless I took them for a few weeks to just try and keep sane because I was desperate and then got off of them quickly. They did not solve any real problems.  	It has been almost a year now since that first trip to the emergency room and my symptoms have gotten slightly better but they are still there and the only things that have helped me has been to keep an extremely strict diet. Right not all I want is some answers. I try hard to keep a positive attitude but sometimes it is extremely hard and I get really down on myself. All of my friends seem so happy and healthy and I cannot say the same for myself. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? This is not stress or IBS we are talking about here. Please if there is anyone out there that has any insight to what is going on with me or a possible doctor referral that could help me out please email me at   I apologize for the lengthy post but I can not go my whole life without knowing what is wrong with me. If anyone is going through the same types of issues or anything similar at all feel free to email me to discuss as well."

It all started when I was 18 years old graduating from high school. I began to have abdominal pain and minor bouts of diarrhea. I thought it was just a virus or just going through a phase, but after a month I had enough and went in to see a gastroenterologist. I had blood tests run, an ultrasound of my adbdomen, and finally a colonoscopy. After all the tests my doctor said that I had “minor” IBS and that I would be fine. After speaking with the doctor I felt better knowing that I would be fine but in the back of my head I knew something was not right.  I went off to college for 5 years and the symptoms continued to get worse and worse, I saw a few other doctors along the way and they said that it is just the IBS you are “fine” just cut back on drinking and eating junk food/bad food. It got to the point towards the end of college where if I went out drinking than I would have extreme pain in the abdomen area/bad diarrhea so I began to cut back on the drinking and bad foods. Also my stools slowly started to become loose. I began to just not be myself and I knew something was wrong in the back of my head. But what more could I do besides a colonoscopy? I also started to experience frequent urination that got worse over time and also muscle spasms and heart palpitations that also got worse. My doctor said it was just “stress” and told me to cut back on any caffeine you may be consuming.  These symptoms progressively got worse over time but I was still able to live a moderately normal life until one day about a year after I graduated from college. At about 1:00AM in the morning I remember waking up from sleeping on the couch and quickly walking to bed. As soon as I laid down on my stomach I suddenly felt very light headed and queezy. I got very faint, my heart rate shot to what felt like 150bpm, I was sweating profusely, had scary heart palpitations, and I thought this was it my life was ending tonight. I got very close to passing out but never lost consciousness. My girlfriend at the time rushed me to the hospital and they did blood work and a cat scan of my head. I spent about half the night there and at the end of it the doctor said that I was free to leave and thought it was probably stress that triggered it and gave me no explanation. After that day I started noticing awful reactions to certain foods like sugar, white carbs, alcohol, eating excessively, and even exercise. I was having awful heart palpitations, feeling dizzy, was not able to think clearly, my lymph nodes became swollen and would get worse after eating the above referenced foods, and my heart would randomly jump to 130-15bpm. I got random bouts of dizziness after changing elevations quickly.  One day for lunch at work about a week after the first trip to the ER I consumed one single beer and immediately I started feeling dizzy and wound up going to the emergency room again that night. The same symptoms as the first trip to the ER happened and the doctor ended up saying basically the same thing. By the way it has been about a year since that second trip to the ER and I have not had a single drink since then. Shortly after the first trip to the ER I began seeing several doctors. The first doctor I saw was my general practitioner. He did extensive blood work and said everything looked normal and that it was probably stress and he recommended me to a cardiologist, endocrinologist, and even a psychologist! The second one I saw was a cardiologist in which I had a stress test done, several EKG’s, too much blood work, and also an ultrasound of my heart. Everything checked out fine and he said it was probably just “stress” you were experiencing and that you just need to relax. I proceeded to see another cardiologist and had the same tests done in which he told me that it was again just stress and that I was fine. Now I moved on to see two endocrinologists in which I did all the blood work in the world it felt like. I got tested for thyroid problems and everything and I got the same response from all the other doctors. I proceeded to see a gastroenterologist where he did extensive blood work and tested for chrons, any inflammation and various other diseases. I told him everything and he literally told me to take pepto bismol and that I was fine. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. At this point all I wanted was a doctor to give me some concrete answers and tell me something besides stress is causing all of this. On to another gastroenterologist.

All of my life, I have been hoping for and trying to work towards a professional career. I have 3 college degrees, an associates in liberal arts, a bachelors in journalism and recently went back to school for accounting and just completed a master's degree in accounting back in May of this year. Despite studying several different areas, all I can seem to find is administrative work. Right now I work at a CPA firm, but because I cannot seem to master the advanced tax returns and bookkeeping, I have to split my time between doing the lower level tax returns and helping our administrative assistant by filling in at the front desk and doing filing and other admin work. I am a middle aged woman who doesn't have a lot of time to keep going back to school and trying different things. I am trying to sit for the CPA test right now but that is not going too well either, you need a 75 to pass and I made a 69 on my first test. I am trying to get my next test taken, but it has been hard keeping a positive focus.  At this point in my life, I feel like a real loser. Its one thing to be an administrative assistant or secretary if you like the work and chose that, but if you don't (I absolutely hate it ) it can seem like you are a complete failure when you can't move on from it. I don't like it because I don't feel like it is a real profession, I get bored with the general office work and it is not challenging enough to spark any kind of curiosity or interest in me. I feel like I am starting to become a bitter, depressed person because I cannot meet my goals of being a professional. Another problem is, I am starting to have feelings of resentment and bitterness toward people in my life or at work who have made it and are now professionals in their field. For example, there are accountants and CPAs in my office. I used to like them when I first started working at the firm, but now I am starting to have feelings of jealously and resentment toward them because I see them moving up and I can't. I am also starting to not like the administrative assistant that I work with. Sometimes I have really bad feelings of resentment toward her and wonder how in the world she can be happy supporting others with no real career of her own.   I don't think these feelings are good for me or those around me and don't feel like I am going in a good direction in my life, but I don't know what to do at this point and need advice. I don't want to serve others in a support role and watch them grow while I get left behind. That is going to be too painful for me and I'm afraid one day I am going to just give up on working all together and become homeless or something. At this point what can I do? Leave accounting and go try something else? What would it be? At this point, I just don't know anymore and I don't understand why I have such strong feelings of wanting to move up in the corporate world and why I feel like such a loser because I have not been able to. If anyone has been through something like this, I would appreciate any advice."

What they have done to people's lives is nothing but pure evil!!! Doctors and pharmaceuticals make money off of people in distress... not only do they make money but they further destroy an already very very sad and lonely person... Why??? All because they are GREEDY...they don't give a f*** about people's lives. All they care about is their pocket book and it does not matter how many people die and suffer!!! Too bad most people don't publish the truth about so-called medicine... all they do is show false proof that something is working when all it is doing is making people sick and killing them!!!

I was born early in the 90’s at 31 weeks and diagnosed with acid reflux a few months after I was born due to failure to gain weight from being unable to keep milk down. I was on zantac as a young child for it as well but it never controlled it very well and often got sick. Stomach pain, heart burn, vomiting and dizziness. I don’t remember the exact age or why I went off of the medication as a kid but somewhere in there I did. I had a few years were it seemed as if I was better but around my early teens I suffered from severe vomiting, acid regurgitation, stomach pains, heartburn and dizziness. I was put back on zantac after they checked my gallbladder out and two-three months later was immediately removed from it as it made my symptoms almost worse. Clearly H2 blockers aren’t for me. I was put on Omeprazole 20mg once a day and bam! Good as new. But as the years went on, I found the food I could tolerate becoming less and less full of variety and in 2014, due to symptoms coming back. Mainly acid constantly in the back of my throat. I compared it to downing a shot of whiskey and lightning it on fire. Not that much fun to be honest. I was upped to 20mg twice a day and that almost immediately fixed me. But again, the foods I could tolerate became less and less till I hit a point I was only eating cheese, bread, graham crackers, skinless chicken breast, low fat turkey and potatoes. I am not kidding. I drank a plain soda from time to time but nothing else too risky or fun. Then this entire year it seemed as if the meds stopped controlling my gerd as well as they did in the beginning. I finally got so dizzy and nauseous I was barely able to function. I was switching off Omeprazole and to Nexium 40mg once a day. Again. Over a month passed but unlike before when my meds were upped, it didn’t fix me. It made them more tolerable but I still felt and feel horrible. Currently on 40mg twice a day. The acid regurgitation is pretty well controlled but I’ve been having stomach pain. My actual stomach. Severe chest pain at times. Sometimes it feels as if food is getting stuck on the way down. Not in my throat but about halfway down my chest, where the front of my bra is. Sometimes it feels as if my stomach is being stabbed or if I haven’t ate in days, even if I ate twenty minutes ago. I get nauseous and dizzy from time to time. Sometimes I swear I’m even having heart palpitations but I have anxiety so it’s hard to say if it’s from that or just nerves from feeling so ill. I get full quite quickly and no matter how little or how slow I eat, I often find my stomach feeling extremely full and like its half in my chest, almost. I get severe stomach pain throughout the day at random times that ranges from uncomfortable to me in the fetal position crying. I’ve had two doctors, my regular doctor and my GI (which I’ve been referred to last month. Saw her. An endoscopy was ordered but cannot get in until late December.) I adore my doctors and trust them immensely but a possible hiatal hernia has been mentioned before and at this stage, I am quote curious. I truly believe with my symptoms I have Gerd and a hiatal hernia or possibly just a hiatal hernia that is causing the gerd. I was premed in College before I took another route in life but I am rather curious. Does it seem like a hiatal hernia, gerd or both? I’ve had surgery mentioned due to H2 blockers not something I’m able to tolerate and I’ve tried five different PPI’s at this point and nothing is controlling it to a point that I am able to work. Employers tend to not look too happy at the prospect of hiring an ill employee who multiple times a day has to lie down due to stomach nausea and pain. Any and all thoughts welcome!  Currently I am taking Nexium 40mg twice a day. Avoiding all trigger foods and beverages and have been for years. Only water is drank. Current diet is plain oatmeal with a banana in the morning. A plain turket sandwich at lunch and a baked potato with salt and another sandwich for dinner. I sleep sitting up or on my left side. I am exercising to lose weight almost every single day. I do not smoke nor drink alcohol and never have. My symptoms are chest pain, severe at times. Stomach pain. Feeling as if food is getting caught in my chest at times. Early satiety, postprandal fullness, feeling as if my stomach is in my chest at times. Sometimes I feel short of breathe after I eat, as if my lungs don’t have enough room to expand properly. Sometimes I get heart flutters/palpitations but again, that might just be anxiety related possibly. Burping for no reason, even after just taking a sip of water. Sometimes my breath smells bad and I have a bad taste in my back of my throat. An ulcer hasn’t been completely ruled out but due to my history with gerd the GI doctor seems to think an ulcer is not the main cause and gerd or a hiatal hernia could be. I cannot get in to get scoped till late December and just wished to get some input till then."

I finally got so dizzy and nauseous I was barely able to function. I was switching off Omeprazole and to Nexium 40mg once a day. Again. Over a month passed but unlike before when my meds were upped, it didn’t fix me. It made them more tolerable but I still felt and feel horrible. Currently on 40mg twice a day. The acid regurgitation is pretty well controlled but I’ve been having stomach pain. My actual stomach. Severe chest pain at times. Sometimes it feels as if food is getting stuck on the way down. Not in my throat but about halfway down my chest, where the front of my bra is. Sometimes it feels as if my stomach is being stabbed or if I haven’t ate in days, even if I ate twenty minutes ago. I get nauseous and dizzy from time to time. Sometimes I swear I’m even having heart palpitations but I have anxiety so it’s hard to say if it’s from that or just nerves from feeling so ill. I get full quite quickly and no matter how little or how slow I eat, I often find my stomach feeling extremely full and like its half in my chest, almost. I get severe stomach pain throughout the day at random times that ranges from uncomfortable to me in the fetal position crying. I’ve had two doctors, my regular doctor and my GI (which I’ve been referred to last month. Saw her. An endoscopy was ordered but cannot get in until late December.) I adore my doctors and trust them immensely but a possible hiatal hernia has been mentioned before and at this stage, I am quote curious. I truly believe with my symptoms I have Gerd and a hiatal hernia or possibly just a hiatal hernia that is causing the gerd. I was premed in College before I took another route in life but I am rather curious. Does it seem like a hiatal hernia, gerd or both? I’ve had surgery mentioned due to H2 blockers not something I’m able to tolerate and I’ve tried five different PPI’s at this point and nothing is controlling it to a point that I am able to work. Employers tend to not look too happy at the prospect of hiring an ill employee who multiple times a day has to lie down due to stomach nausea and pain. Any and all thoughts welcome!  Currently I am taking Nexium 40mg twice a day. Avoiding all trigger foods and beverages and have been for years. Only water is drank. Current diet is plain oatmeal with a banana in the morning. A plain turket sandwich at lunch and a baked potato with salt and another sandwich for dinner. I sleep sitting up or on my left side. I am exercising to lose weight almost every single day. I do not smoke nor drink alcohol and never have. My symptoms are chest pain, severe at times. Stomach pain. Feeling as if food is getting caught in my chest at times. Early satiety, postprandal fullness, feeling as if my stomach is in my chest at times. Sometimes I feel short of breathe after I eat, as if my lungs don’t have enough room to expand properly. Sometimes I get heart flutters/palpitations but again, that might just be anxiety related possibly. Burping for no reason, even after just taking a sip of water. Sometimes my breath smells bad and I have a bad taste in my back of my throat. An ulcer hasn’t been completely ruled out but due to my history with gerd the GI doctor seems to think an ulcer is not the main cause and gerd or a hiatal hernia could be. I cannot get in to get scoped till late December and just wished to get some input till then."

I am unable to work and I'm in pain 24/7 but nobody will take me seriously and I need to know what I should be asking for at this point. So sorry for how long this is. Extreme abdominal pain. The pain feels like I'm a pumpkin and somebody is scraping out my intestines. When I'm very bloated it's difficult to get urine out. I spent a week in the ER with severe dehydration to the point where I couldn't breathe. It hurts to touch my stomach. I've also been getting...rashes? on my hands and arms. If I get a cut or anything nothing will heal, it takes weeks/ months. A significant amount of hair has fallen out. I'm tired all the time and sleep for 12 hours a day. Can't eat or drink without pain. Can't walk without pain and haven't left my apartment for a month. Sometimes gas continues for hours upon hours. Pain worsens around 4:30 and continues until around 1pm the next day. My bags under my eyes are very dark, my skin has become very pale (and I'm not a pale person). I can't eat many foods. In April 2016 I began to lose weight, and lost 100 pounds by the next year through walking/ calorie restriction. I had binge eating disorder before this. In July 2016 I had my first attack, for a week straight I had severe intestinal pain that left me unable to walk. I'm not sure if it's relevant but at the same time I was living in a really bad apartment, everything was breaking and I had toilet water leaking into my bathroom from the upstairs neighbours 24/7. The pain eventually subsided on it's own but it kept coming back for 4-5 days at a time and then a period of being pain free. I tried gluten free, dairy free, FODMAPS etc etc with no changes. I was diagnosed with ibs at this point by a walk in clinic, the doctor wouldn't let me say anything other than ""stomach pain"" then shoved me out, I wasn't given anything. Another doctor diagnosed me as bulimic.....lol...not puking..... Throughout the rest of the year the pain continued to get worse, it was mostly hitting me after 4pm and I would have nonstop gas for HOURS at a time. By Summer 2017 I was at my first job and it would leave me unable to work most days. It got intensely worse in October and has completely spiralled from there. I've eaten the same thing every single day for over 6 months because although I'm in pain every single day of my life other things tend to make it worse. Basically some carbs are safe, no vegetables, no protein, no fats. I eat oatmeal all day if it gets really bad, but I will still be in pain if I do so. Drinking water makes the pain worse. I haven't left my apartment in over a month because I have stabbing pain from walking. My BMs are very very dark and I usually go 2-3 days with nothing and then have diarrhea. Two days ago I had to go to the ER because of the pain...but was told I should take a walk and have tylenol lol? Here's my pain diary:    Rash:   (they come and go, the itchy part is just where my IV was, the other bumps aren't itchy) My doctors say my blood/ urine tests are normal, but my white blood cell count is 7.40 and my leucocyte esterase is 250 (I can post my full blood/urine tests if needed- I had two done). They also said my ultrasound is normal with a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis and mild postvoid residual volume. I'm having a HIDA scan on Monday. I was meant to have a colonoscopy and the doctor who was going to do it said the pain is ""normal for women"" so I walked out. My Xray said I have scoliosis. No blood in stool. Those are all the tests I've had. I take digestive enzymes and probiotics. I'm currently waiting to see a GI and am first in line if someone cancels an appointment."

I am considering making an appointment with my PCP, but they always say I should increase my PPI as high as possible. I am tired of drugs. I am only 37 years old. I have tried getting off PPIs once before in 2016 and it worked for awhile, but then I had shooting pain in my back and chest. I got scared at that point and started up again and increased from 20 mg to 40 mg per my PCP’s instructions. I have been on and off Nexium and Omeprazole off and on since 2015. I have had 2 endoscopies. The one in 2015 showed a small hiatal hernia and mild gastritis and the one in 2017 did not show a hernia and looked pretty good. I am grateful for any help."

Today I'm stopping pain meds as that they say may be the reason for no appetite- i don't think so because i was eating up until 2 weeks ago had some appetite. Any suggestions? I'm seeing a dietician Fri- my gastro dr is no help. He blames everything on smoking. I'm not ready to quit yet. I used to eat! I'm naturally thin and worried- i was supposed to eat mini meals- haven't been able to. Anyone else ever lose their appetite? I think my stomach shrunk as I get full with 2 bites of food.

Beer/ vodka. After drinking only two beers I vomite. Sometimes I get really bad stomach pain to the point I fall in the street and can’t move. Other times I will vomite for two or three days anything that I eat or drink after drinking . Other times I’m totally fine. I had my liver checked and it was fine. Any ideas of what could cause this?

I don't remember how it feels like to be alive. I am sure I am not the only one nether do you. I feel tired, sad, numb and empty. I don't feel like living yet I don't want to die I just don't want to feel like this. I tried talking to a consultant in the first session he told me i am severely depressed. we had three sessions only and in the third one he ask me again to do like a assessment and honestly I did it well so I can finish the these sessions. but I am not feeling better, but he could not know that, so its pointless to keep talking to him. it took a lot of effort to decide that I will tell two of my friend and my sister for help. of course my friend did not believe that I am depressed and it's just a period where everything feel *** and then things will be better, the other friend did not listen and made me feel like what I have is nothing compared to what they have been through. my sister on the other hand she listened but she tried to make me think that i am not depressed and that I have blessed with many things and should start to appreciate and live. it made me feel real bad about my self every time I talk to any of them. its like they don't listen to me when I say I cannot do things and feel things the way I used to, I changed, everything changed even when good thing happen I don't feel anything. it's not just a bad day or week it's been almost two years it's killing me. I am posting here hoping someone would understand what I am going through, please help."

I'm not sure if this board is even meant as a support kind of group, but here I go anyway. I have struggled with anxiety and depression as long as I can remember. My life has been a rollercoaster because of it. I wasn't on medications or in therapy as a child. I sought help on my own and got a diagnosis when I was 19. I've been on and off medication ever since. Now I'm going through the worst/longest depressive episode I've ever experienced. The are a lot of factors, but as my depression grows so do the number of triggers. My anxiety got so bad this year that I developed a severe phobia of driving and have had to claw my way out of that (still working on it btw). I'm not motivated. I sit around most days and play video games because I don't have very much energy to do much else. It devastates me. I'm only 28! I shouldn't be this tired all the time. I shouldn't be isolating myself from friends, family, the world. I should be enjoying this time with my very living husband. I'm truly blessed with love all around me. That makes it worse, because it's like ""why are you so unhappy? Look at this beautiful life you're building."" So then I feel guilty. Idk. I'm so tired. I feel like I hold my husband back from doing the things he really wants to do in life. I feel like everyone is talking about me and that I'm always saying and doing the wrong thing. I don't really want to talk about it with anyone I know because a) learned the hard way that most people are not trustworthy b) I don't want to be a burden or sound like I'm whining and c) I'm so sick of everyone wanting to fix the situation. Just let me talk. I don't need problem solving right now. I need to be heard."

I didn’t do any research but I was in and out of hospitals and multiple doctors told my parents and I the same thing: on top of depression and anxiety, they all said I had bpd and bipolar.

After moving and straightening my life out, I’ve been a lot better, but still struggle a lot. After seeing a psychiatrist for the first time in a long while, I took tests and told her everything I thought was important.

After I moved the cycle was broken. I was told from the first visit I do not have bipolar but I do have bpd. She also said bpd can go away and looks like it could go away for me. I was nervous and didn’t really believe her so I scheduled the next soonest appointment. She also said she didn’t see any depression at the time, the only thing she prescribed me were low dosage anxiety pills. I’ve realized now after focusing on how I feel and why I feel it that my main problem is the depression. But it’s not constant.

I get a bit of discomfort that feels like 'period' aches or shooting pain on my left side which lasts only for a few minutes so I don't feel like its bad enough for tablets due to the short period it lasts for. I've been to see the doctor and they have put me on lansoprazole temporarily to see if this makes any changes but I've been on these for 2-3 weeks and still no difference. The bloating is fairly constant and I feel like my stomach hasn't been completely flat since it started but it is particularly bad after eating (no matter the size portion) to the point where I feel and look pregnant and I can't wear my jeans. I've also been having headaches more frequently which I'm not usually prone to but I don't know if this is related or not. I haven't been experiencing anything particularly out of the ordinary but my bowel movements have been slightly irregular but I'm still going more or less as normal which is similar to the gas I've been experiencing which comes and goes from week to week. At times I've been experiencing urgency to pee but this is only periodically and doesn't affect me all the time. I'm just not feeling myself with this issue and its getting in the way of everyday things like dressing differently and more comfortably. I also hear water sloshing in my stomach as if I'm moving in a bath tub, I've had this for many years but have always wondered why and what it was. One more thing that's changed is when i go to the toilet i will sometimes pass orange oily substance that worries me slightly. Do you know what might be the problem? Is there any need to be worried?"

I have ADHD and anxiety along with depression (not a good combow BTW) my ADHD makes it so im like really frickin annoying and then people tell jokes when I say something like ""oh, im annoying,"" they always say, ""yeah you are"" and then my anxiety kicks in and can't decipher whether or not they are kidding and finally decides that they arent and im an annoying **** so then my depression takes over and makes me feel alone and like there's no one to talk to.. so yeah. Also, a couple of weeks ago, i got into a fight with my mom. Even though she was just trying to help me. And i locked myself in the bathroom (along with the key) so that i could get away from her and i cut myself even though i know i shouldn't have and i regret it. Thn, i put on a long sleeve shirt and bandaids because my parents are already worried enough as-is so i didn't want to worry them more. So then, those bandaids fell off and i put on one bandaid. That bandaid was on there for a couple days, so when i finally took it off, it was itchy, and then it turned into an allergy rash. Does anyone know what i could be allergic to in the bandaid? This morning also might have been one of the hardest for me so far. A boy at my school, tragically killed himself late last night. Our principal said the announcement, and he never does the announcements so we knew something was wrong. As soon as he said the name of the person, my friend collapsed on the floor screaming and crying. I thought I was going to throw up. It was horrible to witness her having a friend so mentally disabled that this happens. And, I hope she and everyone else can get through this tough time, but seeing my friend screaming because of what had happened was a sight that is engraved in my mind. I mean, her friend just died, but it was so sad and just knowing that there is nothing i can do is horrible. So, i spent the entire day consoling my friends and staying strong until i got home. three of my friends went home but in the halls and in my classes there were people laughing. not at what had happened but at their own jokes. and it might sound mean, but all i could think was 'how dare they laugh when a person has just killed themselves' and a i wanted to scream because i wondered what wouldve happened if id listened t that little voice in my head telling me to kill myself. And i wondered if it wouldve been like this. and i wondered if anyone wouldve cried for me. and other than my parents and maybe two or three of my closest friends, i cant think of anyone that would. one of the teachers, i heard, ran out of his class crying because he was so close to the student. I feel so bad and it really makes me realize that there are bigger problems than trumps impeachment that we should be worrying about. that our government could be worrying about. and it makes you realize, y'know, that you cant see every disability. Some disabilities are invisible. And people with invisible disabilities sometimes need more help than those with physical or ""seeable"" disabilities. On a slightly lighter, but way more maddening note, i got told a couple days ago that depression doesn't exist. that we are all just 'making it up and we need to stop pretending' i bet the girl who said that is rethinking her word now. I mean sure, some people say they have depression for attention. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. And you shouldnt nullify others feelings just because one person is faking it. Because more often than not, they have problems. Also, this week in general is really stressful and im falling behind in my classes and i cant get fs i really cant because then i wont pass english and i wont graduate on time. so yay. and right now im having a mental breakdowns and seeing what other peoples mental breakdowns are just to remind myself, hey its not as bad as them to make me feel better but its not really working and because this is basically anonymous, im using it as a diary. Basically writing down everything that i see as 'wrong' with my life and putting it on here for the entire internet to see because lord knows thats a good idea. (not) and i get so angry somethimes i want to hurt someone but i kno that i cant but i still want to you know. Is it normal to want to hurt someone? (no one in particular just SOMEONE) Is it normal to want that even when you just saw someone bend over and even when you were just almost sick because a classmate killed themselves and you are so fed up with everything in your life already, and its already so stressful that now that this happened you just feel like crap. Is it normal? I need to know. Because I need to go to group therapy because the therapist i have now doesnt exactly fit what i need and i think group therapy would help. And i need to say that because i dont know what to talk about in group therapy. Oh also im a teachers pet even though im failing im like really smart still so im a teachers pet and everyone hates me for that. They dont think i notice the eyerolls.

I have periodic episodes of chronic stomach pain that feel like the cramps you get in the early stages of the stomach flu (no throwing up though). These cramps are usually triggered by periods of eating spicy food and/or milk (I was lactose intolerant as a child). They can also be accompanied by some bleeding when eliminating. The blood appears on the surface of the stool and will sometimes drip afterwards.  Just recently I had blood-work done as a part of a life insurance application. The results showed that I have lower than normal AST, GGT, Total Protein, Albumin, and Cholesteral. After reading a bit it appears that the only worrisome result is the low protein and albumin levels. My globulin level is normal, so I'm guessing that the abnormality in the total protein is all the fault of my albumin level which is 3.5 g/dL. Are these simply symptoms of under eating and high stress that can be remedied by just eating more and avoiding foods that I'm sensitive to, or would it appear that there are some more serious issues going on here. I generally feel healthy and can keep up a high level of physical activity, but its hard for me to gain weight when I'm not working out a lot and I sit behind a computer all day for work."

The results showed that I have lower than normal AST, GGT, Total Protein, Albumin, and Cholesteral. After reading a bit it appears that the only worrisome result is the low protein and albumin levels. My globulin level is normal, so I'm guessing that the abnormality in the total protein is all the fault of my albumin level which is 3.5 g/dL. Are these simply symptoms of under eating and high stress that can be remedied by just eating more and avoiding foods that I'm sensitive to, or would it appear that there are some more serious issues going on here. I generally feel healthy and can keep up a high level of physical activity, but its hard for me to gain weight when I'm not working out a lot and I sit behind a computer all day for work."

I’m a 40 year old women, my stomach was becoming severely bloated, I looked fat even though I am 5 foot 8, weighed around 125, the big stomach was not at all flattering on me. I would not go to the bathroom for almost 3 to 4 days and even when I did it was a struggle to try and get something out. I was having breakouts on my face, felt very sluggish, weird discharge from my vaginal area, it all was embarrassing and caused me a lot of stress...UNTIL I was reading about how people would use vinegar or apple cider vinegar for a detox for their bodies but I’ve never really thought of drinking it. I’m a cook though, love to concoct foods, so I thought about putting a mixture together that I could drink and wouldn’t be bad tasting and in one night, literally within an hour my stomach went down, I had a BM and within two days I went to the bathroom a few times, mind you I was backed up almost a week. No diarrhea or anything like that just a nice natural urge to go to the bathroom and cleaned out my system! I could not and still can not believe it!! My tummy is as flat as it has always been except for these months of horrid bloating!! I don’t have measurements of what I did yet exactly , I just make it the same twice a day everyday... but eyeing it out...about 1/4 cup to 2/3 of apple cider vinegar, about 1/4 to 2/3 water, I used the lemon juice that is in the plastic fake lemon that you get by the produce dept, I squeeze about 2 long squeezes of lemon juice into your vinegar/water mixture, then about 2 to 3 tablespoons of honey (depending how sweet you like it) then stir it up till the honey dissolves and all is mixed then add ice and drink up. I drink a small glass in the morning either before or after breakfast and then a small glass before or after dinner whichever would work for you. I’m telling you I SWEAR by this! My breakouts on my face went away, I have cleaned my digestive tract out, however you want to call that, it is absolutely amazing! I’m not a doctor or nurse so I cannot say this would work for everyone but at least give it a try! I was in tears the first night because I was very down on myself with my abdomen looking how it was and the sluggish physical and mental feeling I had.

I'm in a band and I absolutely love playing music and used to love performing but now whenever I'm at a gig I get so anxious that I get suicidal and think about how I could end it all in order to get out of there. My anxiety has been very very bad for about 3 weeks, and I'm so frustrated because I want it to just get better but all of the meds I've tried help a little but not enough, even if I take a lot.  The thing that caused me to write this though sounds really crazy, but bear with me.  Last tuesday I was in my room (this was around 10pm) and i started to see breathing effects and things moving in the corner of my eye. I went to the bathroom and while i was in there I heard my little brother saying to my mom ""whats taking her so long"" so I decided to leave the bathroom so he could go and when i opened the door there was no one there, and my brothers door was closed and my mom was asleep downstairs. This freaked me out so i sped walked to my room and i stood in my doorway and looked back at the bathroom to see if he was in a spot i couldnt see or something, and i saw the bathroom door jerk like it was closing a little bit, and then stop and then do it again (wasn't like a door normally closes was it was abrupt). I was terrified and i closed my door and jumped into my bed and was sitting there freaking out and i looked around my room and i started having more intense visuals like i had taken a tab of acid, and i got extremely paranoid because i thought people were watching me. I started facetiming my boyfriend once it became super intense and terrifying, and he couldn't make me feel better i was acting not like myself at all, i was paranoid and socially awkward when i was talking to him bcause i didnt really know how to act normal. I kept getting up to arrange stuff in my room and then would get scared and jump into my bed again. Then i heard my dad knock on my door and say ""grace, open the door"". I suspected it wasnt real but wanted to make sure so i opened it and again, no one there.

For many, many years now I have had soft and occasionally loose stools. No big deal though, just part of life for me. Anyway, about a week or so ago I noticed after one of my poops that the water at the bottom of the bowl around the poop had turned an orange-ish red color after about 10 or 15 minutes. Kind of dark and hard to tell but it looked more orange than red. Also the water at the top of the bowl was more yellow (like what you would expect from urine) so the effect was more akin to a diffused orange that got lighter at the top into yellow. Since then, I have noticed this several more times, including today. The poop appears to be normal brown color from what I can tell from, you know, wiping. It doesn't appear tarry or darker than usual either. It is decidedly not the same color that I have experienced before when I eat beets, which does turn the water red! Anyway, obviously the coloration is seeping out of the poop itself, and I am just wondering if blood wrapped up in the stool would turn the water this color. If not blood, then what could it be?? Is this something I should see a doctor about or wait a while to see if it resolves on its own? Just an FYI, I am 39 year old male with no real family history of colon cancer that I am aware of, if that makes any difference. Thanks in advance for any advice you guys can offer!"

I went to the hospital and had a chest X-ray and EKG done which also yielded negative results. Again, doctors told me I was fine and might have heart burn or ulcers.

I've been married for 9 years and I have to small sons. About 8 months ago I started experiencing visual and auditorial hallucinations with paranoia and memory lapses. I've always had a racing and overwhelming thought process where I over thought and had at least 5 to 7 perspective with just one decision or situation with things as simple that's what to make for dinner and things is complicated is what to do with my life. About 8 months ago the thoughts that were in my head started whispering into my ears. One of them was a female that laughed all the time but nothing she said was funny, it was often cruel and evil and dark. Another was unidentified gender but they always whispered and hushed and comforted me, making promises that everything was normal and I was fine and everything would get better and to continue to act normal because no one could know what was happening or they would be mad at me or hurt me. Another was a man that sounded alittle like my father and alittle like Frank Sinatra, he always sang, never spoke, he would sing over me, he would remind me of the lyrics to songs I had forgotten. When I would sing to my boys or listen to the radio he would offer sing over it so I usually just listened to whatever he wanted to sing instead of picking my own music.... My vision problems were shadows growing out of peripheral vision that weren't there, people became very hard to look at because there faces would blur and melt and no one looked like them anymore, I would apply more and more makeup to my own face to make my reflection look more human until I got to the point we're I just avoid my reflection as much as possible. Trees would move they way they shouldn't and things would sometimes look so bright they would glow and I could barely look at them. Words and letters would dance and fade. I finally got glasses hoping that would help but nothing changed. Still I kept to myself just over acting normal and staying as busy as possible so that I was never ideal for very long. I didn't sleep well at all, I could go and go and go with only 4 hours of sleep most nights. About 6 months ago I broke down at work and a coworker found me bidding and crying. He comforted me and I word vomited what was going on in my head and some of the things I was being told and promised. Not long after that he kissed and my first reaction was to kiss him back I remember pushing him away and after that the voices really look over. There were times the the laughing women would scream at me that ""I was nothing more then a whore and I didn't deserve the happiness I felt with my family and I should stop pretending to me something I wasn't"" ""I was a bad mom, a bad wife, my husband hated me and I was only there because it was convenient for him at the time and as soon as I wasn't convenient he would get rid of me he would kill me."" ""Whore, ***, ***, ***"" ""*** him, he's the only one that wants you, *** him or I'll hurt you, *** him or he'll hurt you"".... I would fight her sometimes out loud as I hid in the bathroom or office closet, I would fight her till I couldn't see straight I would get dizzy and tunnel vision and even actively vomit at times, having to dunk my head in cold water and sit until I could force the feeling to pass. The whole time the whispering voice would make promises ""do what she says and she will stop, make her happy and she will leave you alone, you don't want to lose your family, you can't tell anyone, just make her happy and you'll be batter wife and mother because you'll keep things normal for everyone."" I would hear the singing man mostly when I would do things like playing with my kids, sometimes during sex, dishes, cleaning the house, cooking, actively working, or at the gym. I finally gave in and *** the guy at work. I would have memory lapses and not remember how I got around him or into the position, but the voices would go away and for a few minutes there was silence and there was so much relief, I never made eye contact with the man at work and never really looked in his direction at all. I never thought about him outside of work and the affair never crossed my mind or memory most days at all. But the laughing women was fueled with insults and degrading threats and threats to my life and the safety of my family. My husband found out about my affair 4 months into it from the wife of my coworker I was cheating with. The encounter confuse me alot and when my husband didn't kill me, himself or our children it rocked my reality. It forced me to question everything I had been believing and everything I was being told, I fell in to full on psychosis. I lost the ability to speak well to text to think. Everything got worse because now I was realizing nothing was real but I couldnt separate myself from my living nightmare.... My husband is still with me for the time being, I'm in therapy and on medication currently and altho the visual disturbances have gone I still have constant mumbles and murmurs of a cloud talking over my left shoulder even the occasional dishes clanking. Feel feel mostly on associated with the affair like it wasn't me I often feel a kind of annoyance for being blamed for something I didn't do.

About 8 months ago the thoughts that were in my head started whispering into my ears. One of them was a female that laughed all the time but nothing she said was funny, it was often cruel and evil and dark. Another was unidentified gender but they always whispered and hushed and comforted me, making promises that everything was normal and I was fine and everything would get better and to continue to act normal because no one could know what was happening or they would be mad at me or hurt me. Another was a man that sounded alittle like my father and alittle like Frank Sinatra, he always sang, never spoke, he would sing over me, he would remind me of the lyrics to songs I had forgotten. When I would sing to my boys or listen to the radio he would offer sing over it so I usually just listened to whatever he wanted to sing instead of picking my own music.... My vision problems were shadows growing out of peripheral vision that weren't there, people became very hard to look at because there faces would blur and melt and no one looked like them anymore, I would apply more and more makeup to my own face to make my reflection look more human until I got to the point we're I just avoid my reflection as much as possible. Trees would move they way they shouldn't and things would sometimes look so bright they would glow and I could barely look at them. Words and letters would dance and fade. I finally got glasses hoping that would help but nothing changed. Still I kept to myself just over acting normal and staying as busy as possible so that I was never ideal for very long. I didn't sleep well at all, I could go and go and go with only 4 hours of sleep most nights. About 6 months ago I broke down at work and a coworker found me bidding and crying.

I suffer from IBS-D and also take Nexium acid reducer, either of which might be causing the pills to pass before the medication is absorbed. My depression was not improving while taking this dosage for 5 months, but it had previously improved immediately when I initially began taking 150mg dosage (which do not have the same casing that the 300mg do). I recently switched back to 150mg, taking twice daily now, and my depression symptoms started improving again within 24 hours.

Need Help,"Hello! This will be a long post so please bare with me. Over the past 3 years I have been experiencing strange symptoms/episodes infrequently that I believe are related to a combination of dehydration and low-blood sugar but because the incidents have varied so much in severity I have had trouble tracking what the actual issue is. I have not consulted a doctor because of how infrequent and varied the incidents are.  I work in the woods for a living as a forester in Oregon. When these incidents started I was working for a timber company on the coast that had just acquired some work inland on the western slopes of the Cascades. While the ground itself wasn't as steep and rugged as I was used too in the coast range, it was higher elevation and the temperatures were quite a bit higher day to day (One week topped out at 108 deg. F consistently). The first day I experienced one of these incidents I was working in a higher elevation area and it was around 95 degrees. I had left at 5 in the morning from the coast to make it to the inland jobsite at 9 am and had drunken a fair amount of coffee and some water but not nearly enough. I had also only eaten a gas station breakfast sandwich with no plans to eat again until dinner that night. After hiking through some steeper ground, I began to have blurred vision in one eye. It felt like I had a ""floater"" that just wouldn't disappear so I sat down and sipped some water. This continued to a varied degree for about 15 minutes and then dissipated but it was followed with a pretty bad headache coming from the top of my head and my temple. I also felt pretty hungry oddly enough. I took it easy for a little while longer, ate a granola bar, and then continued working. About 10 minutes later I began to feel pretty nauseous and ultimately fell like I was either going to throw up or I needed to have a bowel movement. About an hour later I did the latter and felt better and finished out the day. This didn't happen again for another month or so but when it did, it was under the same conditions in the same area and I ultimately attributed it to not being hydrated enough and started to cut back on my coffee consumption quite a bit and focus on eating and drinking well and the incidents didn't really ever happen again.  After about a year I accepted a job on the eastside of the Cascades where the ground was ultimately way flatter but I was in, again, higher elevations. This position had me in the Office a little more than I expected and definitely more than my previous position where I spent 50-60 hours in the woods a week. I began become more out of shape because I hadn't adjusted my eating habits or began exercising because I had always relied on the work I do to keep me in shape. Every time I would go into the woods in this new position I would over exert myself because I would try and work at the same rate I used too. I began to have the same episodes only I had one that was particularly bad where I had the same blurred vision, headache, and hunger only this time I tried to eat a large lunch after and ultimately ended vomiting. Because of the increased office stress of my new position, I was drinking quite a bit of coffee through out the day and then coping with the caffeine at night with beer (Not a lot of water was being consumed). I had a pretty unbalanced diet with eating next to nothing for breakfast, a medium sized lunch, and then a huge dinner. This has continued until now where I have recently tried to change my habits and get into better shape but the last couple times I have tried to exercise even with adequate water consumption (I have been using the half your weight in ounces rule of thumb) I have the same incident occur and feel like garbage until I sleep it off. It doesn't happen in the woods as much anymore because I don't drink any coffee on those days, drink water consistently throughout the day, and try eat small meals consistently throughout the day. As I am writing this out, I feel like I am answering my own questions but this has really caused me a lot of depression because I am almost afraid to hike in the woods again because I might have one of these episodes and my job is my passion. I worked out for 30 minutes yesterday and felt great until about 15 minutes after I finished when my vision blurred and the whole process started again.  Do any of you guys have suggestions? This happened maybe 10 times across the last 3 years. I am 6'1 and 250 lbs. When I worked on the coast I was around 215. Thank you for your time and help."

Because of the increased office stress of my new position, I was drinking quite a bit of coffee through out the day and then coping with the caffeine at night with beer (Not a lot of water was being consumed). I had a pretty unbalanced diet with eating next to nothing for breakfast, a medium sized lunch, and then a huge dinner. This has continued until now where I have recently tried to change my habits and get into better shape but the last couple times I have tried to exercise even with adequate water consumption (I have been using the half your weight in ounces rule of thumb) I have the same incident occur and feel like garbage until I sleep it off. It doesn't happen in the woods as much anymore because I don't drink any coffee on those days, drink water consistently throughout the day, and try eat small meals consistently throughout the day. As I am writing this out, I feel like I am answering my own questions but this has really caused me a lot of depression because I am almost afraid to hike in the woods again because I might have one of these episodes and my job is my passion. I worked out for 30 minutes yesterday and felt great until about 15 minutes after I finished when my vision blurred and the whole process started again.  Do any of you guys have suggestions?

Need Help,"Hello! This will be a long post so please bare with me. Over the past 3 years I have been experiencing strange symptoms/episodes infrequently that I believe are related to a combination of dehydration and low-blood sugar but because the incidents have varied so much in severity I have had trouble tracking what the actual issue is. I have not consulted a doctor because of how infrequent and varied the incidents are.  I work in the woods for a living as a forester in Oregon. When these incidents started I was working for a timber company on the coast that had just acquired some work inland on the western slopes of the Cascades. While the ground itself wasn't as steep and rugged as I was used too in the coast range, it was higher elevation and the temperatures were quite a bit higher day to day (One week topped out at 108 deg. F consistently). The first day I experienced one of these incidents I was working in a higher elevation area and it was around 95 degrees. I had left at 5 in the morning from the coast to make it to the inland jobsite at 9 am and had drunken a fair amount of coffee and some water but not nearly enough. I had also only eaten a gas station breakfast sandwich with no plans to eat again until dinner that night. After hiking through some steeper ground, I began to have blurred vision in one eye. It felt like I had a ""floater"" that just wouldn't disappear so I sat down and sipped some water. This continued to a varied degree for about 15 minutes and then dissipated but it was followed with a pretty bad headache coming from the top of my head and my temple. I also felt pretty hungry oddly enough. I took it easy for a little while longer, ate a granola bar, and then continued working. About 10 minutes later I began to feel pretty nauseous and ultimately fell like I was either going to throw up or I needed to have a bowel movement. About an hour later I did the latter and felt better and finished out the day. This didn't happen again for another month or so but when it did, it was under the same conditions in the same area and I ultimately attributed it to not being hydrated enough and started to cut back on my coffee consumption quite a bit and focus on eating and drinking well and the incidents didn't really ever happen again.  After about a year I accepted a job on the eastside of the Cascades where the ground was ultimately way flatter but I was in, again, higher elevations. This position had me in the Office a little more than I expected and definitely more than my previous position where I spent 50-60 hours in the woods a week.

At that time, I was also having one of the worst acne flare ups I've had since I was in my teens - I'm in my 40's now.  The doctor indicated that it might be a form of lupus, and referred me to a rheumatologist. They were not in agreement, due to other symptoms not being present, but indicated that the darkening may relate to the acne. Well it's been several months now, the acne has cleared up, but the fever, pain, and darkening of my hair continue. I don't want to exaggerate, but I look like a dalmation, and I don't know the cause. Additionally, I'm tired of feeling like hell. I've had numerous tests, and quite frankly, I'm not made of money. That said, I'm worried that if I back off, I may be ignoring something serious. I've searched the web tirelessly over the past several months, and nothing matches what I'm seeing. Additionally, new symptoms seem to develop regularly. I don't use recreational drugs, but I do vape and drink on occasion. Until last year, I was in fairly decent health. Does anyone have any idea what would cause this? Thanks in advance..."

I have a good day I go out do things and then I'm down again for 3-4 days wanting to sleep and stay in my room. I go to the store and the first scream of a child or loud noise sends me running out with no groceries. Now here is the kicker in all this I am a masochist I love pain, pain centers me I have friends in the lifestyle that help me by giving me pain on a weekly basis or a couple of times during the week. I seem to do well after for a day or two but then I go back into my 3-4 day depression and anxiety mode. What to do? I cant afford a therapist because my insurance only pays for so many sessions.  Here I sit on this beautiful day dreading to even open a window shade and wishing it was night already..."

There were 4 things that were to happen in my life according to the nightmare. 1) The company I worked for was going to lose a lot of money. 2) I was going to get fired. 3) I was going to have legal issues. 4) I was going to file for bankruptcy. The nightmare became a reality the same day which started with greedy solicitors from a cult that arrived at my work place and harassed me. After several more months Microsoft Outlook hackers sent me a tricky e-mail with a virus which spread through the network & the company lost about 100K. I got fired & I refused to sign a 4 page Employee Separation Agreement tailored made for me by their lawyers Moxon & Bowles considering the company broke civil laws by allowing a solicitor from a cult into the workplace. I was therefore denied my $2000 severance check. The employer denied me unemployment insurance by the EDD due to break of their company policies such as failure to delete spam. The EDD rep was very upset with me but once I reported the issue about the solicitor from the cult, EDD was in my favor & scolded the human resources of the company. I got my EDD benefits rather quickly. This bought me some time while I attempted to get my life together but I was never as happy as I was when I worked that full time job because I had seniority and I was making good money. Some of the employees were like family to me. Since my termination, I have not found a job that made me happy and haven’t been able to earn what I used to. After the job loss I became severely depressed & suffered much anxiety after loosing 4 jobs in a short period. I lost over 50 friends due to legal action against me by the cult and loss of my job. I did make new friends but we only get together on special occasions like events a few times per year. We keep in touch on Facebook but this is not sufficient for me. I'm now working a temp job and praying that it will turn into a perm job, I do have to get through 90 day probation for the 4th time in just a couple of years. I used to be independent & I had my own apartment but after my premonition nightmare I now rent a room in a family house. Unfortunately I live with 2 relatives that are alcoholics. My private room is my safe haven when I'm there but we share the kitchen. The bad energy from the alcoholism can be overwhelming. I try & spend time volunteering at community temple when I'm out of work. I’m also receiving advice from an independent practitioner on how to have a more positive attitude in the working world and in general. I believe in karma therefore complaining or bad critical remarks about the non-optimum conditions at some jobs will only cause me more suffering. It’s probably best to find employment that is more suitable but sometimes I say “beggers can’t be choosers” especially with my deteriorating body issues and commute to get to work . Nevertheless because harsh criticism can induce the boomerang effect it is best that I emphasize on improving that part of my attitude. I took initiative a week ago to confess in writing any unacceptable behaviors while I had been employed at my last few jobs and I plan to turn in my write-up to my practitioner this weekend. Whether it involved break of policy, unethical or immature behavior I have written it up and will only be viewed by my trusted practitioner who is like family to me and will remain confidential. Perhaps this will help me start fresh and new and not keep complaining on how my current employment & compensation is not as great as the job I had before the nightmare premonition."

Did stool WBC calprotectin tests in 2014 that were normal (no ova, parasites, cysts, inflammation). 2017 stomach pain back strong...abdomen/pelvic ultrasounds clean, breath test results showed SIBO (predominantly hydrogen, but I think also methane). Did Xifaxin (Rifaximin) 550mg 3x/day 14 days (failed), linzess, ibgard, peppermint oil, dicyclomine, ibuprofen, probiotics (heard may be bad for SIBO?) + Siebecker's SIBO diet (not strictly). Pain levels seem highly correlated w/stressful times. Previous GI ineffective/highly unresponsive.  Now looking for (ideally) an Anthem-covered Dr. specialized in curing SIBO, no more than ~45 min drive from Oakland CA (by San Francisco). Plz share what u recommend for cure & any detail about a recommended doctor e.g. (1) Track record of success treating SIBO e.g. finding and fixing underlying causes so we dont have to be on these crazy diets forever (2) Availability. Whats typical turn-around time to get answers, appointments? (3) Do they care enough about patients, SIBO, finding a cure in least amount of time/pain/cost possible (4) Are they open to alternative treatments such as herbals (are they more effective? Some say NDs/functional MDs r better but they're not covered so that's last resort (or can maybe see simultaneously if that is what you advise) + there's only 1 published report of herbal antibiotics for SIBO treatment) + can they even perform things like colonoscopies/endoscopies? Much appreciated! Take care."

Early this afternoon today I started having pain right below my rib cage, more towards my right side. It doesn’t hurt to touch, and It gradually got worse. I didn’t eat yet so at first I thought I was hungry. But I ate and it still continued and gradually became worse as time went on. It’s kind of difficult to explain the pain, it’s almost like a hollow feeling. It’s not throbbing or sharp it’s just there. It peaked around 3:30pm and was so painful I was about to go to the hospital it hurt so bad. As I was debating going to sit in a hospital for hours, it subsided. This is the third time this happened this year. The first was a year ago, when I was alone with my son he was an infant. I thought it was my period coming at first (not sure why because the pain was high up) and I tried Aleve and ibuprofen and it made it worse. I called my husband to come home and then called him back to cancel because it started to ease up.   Then the second was waitressing at my old job and it was the same way started a little bit and got worse through the day. It got to the point I couldnt really walk and I started crying. They sent me home. Then shortly after I left, it got better and I felt stupid for freaking out.  So the pain seems to contract like get worse and worse and then release a little bit when it peaks. The pain at its highest level is relatable to when I had a kidney stone. It is like an attack it happens then it’s over but it last hours. When the pain is at its worst it only last like an hour or less.  I’m Afraid it’s something stupid like really severe gas, but it’s rare enough I don’t think that’s it. I always feel like I’m afraid to be overreacting. I guess I should make an appointment with a GI. Does anyone have anything related to this?"

The day after I got sick I felt better pretty much. Still didn’t eat much just because I was afraid I would get sick again but I felt fine for the most part. The day after that though I started feeling bad again. Not the feeling that I have to throw up or anything though. Since the 4th of January I’ve been having random stomach cramp pains and have just felt really bloated. I can’t hardly eat anything because I’m so bloated it makes me feel full. Now the stomach cramps are only when I stand up. When I stand up it makes me feel like I need to crouch because it makes it feel better. Once I sit down the cramps go away although I still feel bloated. I’ve taken some tums today but they didn’t help. Any idea what is going on?

I am a 29 year old female. About 8 months ago, I began experiencing really random bouts of nausea. Some episodes lasting hours, some not as long. This nausea was not triggered by anything in particular, with or without food on my stomach. Before this began, I was weighing a healthy 120-125 pounds. My nausea began happening often enough, that I understandably could not eat, and when I did, it was not much, or just potatoes and soups.  When I first saw the doctor about this, they gave me Rx for Zofran for the nausea, fluids, and another Rx for omeprazole thinking that acid may be the culprit. They also tested me for h.pylori (negative). The nausea continued. After my doctors basically made me feel like this was all in my head, I gave up on them and got in with a gastroenterologist. He performed a biliary ultrasound (came back normal) and an upper endoscopy. He stated that he found mild gastritis in the duodenum that tested negative for infection and celiac disease. He said this mild gastritis was most likely not the cause of my symptoms.  I was then referred to a psychiatrist due to the thought that these symptoms could be stress related, although I did not see how. They put me on a low dose of Trazadone every night.  The symptoms continued and to an extreme level. After being bedbound for a week, I became nauseated, dehydrated, and malnourished enough that I landed myself in the E.R. While in the E.R., they performed a chest x-ray and an abdominal CT with contrast, which came back normal. They sent me on my way with more nausea medication. At this point, I was now down to 100 pounds at 29 years old.  The following week, I began seeing a nutritionist and holistic practitioner. He ran tests on my blood, urine, saliva, and a mineral test as well. From these tests, he have me a supplement regimen based on all the areas I was deficient in. He said my digestive function was low (no shock there) and the lack of nutrition put my body in ketosis and it was eating itself. He put me on a Mitochondrial Restore, a powder probiotic, Skeletal Strength capsules, 1/2 TSP of flax seed oil per day, Repair-Vite intestinal repair, Master Gland capsules, and whey protein shakes to help with nutrition.  It has been 2 months and I feel worlds better than I did before. I am eating more. I have only put a couple pounds back on, but no further weight loss. I have had a couple bouts of nausea, but for the most part have been able to ward it off. I have been obsessively concerned about my weight, though. I want so desperately to get back to a healthy weight and I just do not understand why I am not able to put it back on since I am eating, getting nutrition, and taking needed supplements.

At this point, I was now down to 100 pounds at 29 years old.  The following week, I began seeing a nutritionist and holistic practitioner. He ran tests on my blood, urine, saliva, and a mineral test as well. From these tests, he have me a supplement regimen based on all the areas I was deficient in. He said my digestive function was low (no shock there) and the lack of nutrition put my body in ketosis and it was eating itself. He put me on a Mitochondrial Restore, a powder probiotic, Skeletal Strength capsules, 1/2 TSP of flax seed oil per day, Repair-Vite intestinal repair, Master Gland capsules, and whey protein shakes to help with nutrition.  It has been 2 months and I feel worlds better than I did before. I am eating more. I have only put a couple pounds back on, but no further weight loss. I have had a couple bouts of nausea, but for the most part have been able to ward it off. I have been obsessively concerned about my weight, though. I want so desperately to get back to a healthy weight and I just do not understand why I am not able to put it back on since I am eating, getting nutrition, and taking needed supplements. I had a random bout of nausea today and I am just very fearful that I am back sliding. Does anyone have any similar experience with chronic unexplained nausea? And furthermore, does anyone have any advice about the weight not getting put back on?"

I am very nervous and trying not to worry, I take half of 10 mg amitriptyline at night to help me sleep, but at around 6 am I wake up and fail to go back to deep sleep and I am tossing and turning before I wake up altogether.  A week ago I had diarrhea and it cause me a lot of pain because spasms were even worse, but since I am careful with what I eat and I make sure that medications I take does not have diarrhea as their side effect my stomach is feeling better and it is functioning well.  If my stomach is functioning well, then why am I experiencing chest pain and uncontrollable belching and gases throughout the day? I am low on energy and since walking seems to help me with belching more I am losing energy even more.  I read somewhere that 270 degree surgery leaves you with belching and in case of 360 degree people have trouble to burp.  I wanted to ask is there any medication that can help me with chest pain and can you help me understand what situation I am in? When will the pain go away?"

My parents had initially blamed this on me being susceptible to stomach viruses but it became such a regular issue that they brought me to the hospital for tests (blood tests, kidney tests – had to drink something that I forgot the name of, and an enema followed by a colonoscopy). But they never actually looked at my stomach. It ended up that I tested positive for “mono”. The doctors didn’t see anything else from the tests so they blamed it on “mono”. But I never knew why mono was an explanation for stomach pains. But the problem never went away even after I recovered from mono. After that I just hid my symptoms from my family and friends (mostly because I was afraid that my parents wouldn’t let me compete in sports). I was experiencing some sort of stomach pain almost every day when I got to college. I was actually used to it and could function as a student but had to stop playing sports – I just wasn’t healthy enough to regularly compete at a high level. I also had a few really bad painful stomach experiences. On one occasion my dorm mates had to call an ambulance. But the university infirmary didn’t do much other then give me some pain killers and tagamet. To make a long story much shorter, after I graduated college, the painful stomach episodes became more frequent. I had a reoccurring stabbing pain in my stomach that seemed to move into my bowels. Basically the doctors prescribed ulcer medication which didn't really work. Then one day I had the most excruciatingly painful bowel movement in my life. I felt like my anus was being ripped apart. What came out shocked me. It was a perfectly spherical ball – seemed about the size of a baseball. It was heavier than a normal poop - it made a weird splash and thud when it hit the bottom of the bowl. It also had a series of perfectly round extruding nodules that completely covered the ball in a symmetrical pattern. When I looked down at that thing and the blood - I was completely scarred and flushed it. If I didn’t know better, I would say it was man-made because of the perfect shape. I’ve always regretted not taking it out of the toilet for testing. But did I flush some sort of cancerous tumor down the toilet that was working its way slowly out of my body’s digestive system? Has any medical professional ever heard of large perfectly spherical poop with symmetrical nodules? I’m saying poop but for all I know it was a tumor. Sorry if this sounds strange but this issue has been on my mind for years and I decided to just ask because I can’t find anyone ever experiencing a similar situation on the internet. I never asked for a medical opinion on what happened because I was so fearful of the tumor issue. On the bright side, my stomach symptoms left after that day and haven’t returned in over 20 years."

I have had severe abdominal pain for almost four days now and after multiple tests and visits the hospital has still not been able to identify the issue. The pain was accompanied by three vomits over the first two days, one occurring directly after being given Tramadol IV. The pain is a constant cramp-like feeling, similar to labour pain, occuring in the mid-to-lower section of my belly. Tummy exams over the last few days have shown varying degrees of tenderness, sometimes barely any, sometimes tenderness towards the lower right side and sometimes to the middle left side. Nausea and loss of appetite are almost constant, though i suspect it has been somewhat a side effect of the strong painkillers. A list of tests that have returned normal include; Multiple bloods, urine tests (including multiple standard pregnancy tests), abdominal ultrasound, transvaginal ultrasound, abdominal CT scan. A list of issues that have been ruled out as highly unlikely at this stage are; Pregnancy, Appendicitis, Ovarian cysts, Urinary Tract Infection. I have an Implanon contraceptive in my left arm and as a side effect hadn't experienced a period for over a year. I have been to hospital now three times. -The first time I was admitted. They ran a series of small tests (bloods, urine, stomach exams) as they suspected possible appendicitis. To manage my pain, which was about LVL 7/10, they gave me IV Tramadol, which increased my nausea (I vomited immediately after) but covered the pain successfully.  All test results came back normal, so they suspected it was simply due to some gastrointestinal upset. They gave me a script for Paracetamol/Codeine and Ibuprofen for pain management and sent me home aprox 3am from the Emergency Dep. -At home. Still under the effects of Tramadol, I was able to sleep for a few hours. The pain began to gradually return once I woke. I went to the chemist with my script as soon as they opened, then began taking the Paracetamol/Codeine (still very nauseous, I couldn't stomach any food so I was unable to take the Ibuprofen at the time). Passed a normal stool. -My second time to emergency.  It became clear that the Paracetamol/Codeine was not effective and pain level slowly returned in full so I returned to the Emergency Dep around midday. I experienced mild cold sweats and I vomited a large amount of yellowish-slightly green bile while waiting to be attended. I was given oral Tramadol and an anti nausea tablet. After a tummy exam resulted in tenderness in the lower right region I was put on IV fluids and was fasted in case of appendicitis. They then followed up with the Abdominal ultrasound and Transvaginal ultrasound which came back normal. I was then moved to a ward for overnight observation. During my time in the Observation Ward I continued being given a dose of Tramadol, paracetamol and an anti nausea tablet six hourly or so, when the pain began to return. I was assessed by the Ward's surgeons and they agreed that based on the normal results gained from all my tests that they didn't believe I required any kind of surgery and that I could come off of fasting and IV fluids. They proposed that I stay the night under observation, try and eat and drink and see how I progressed. If nothing else occurred overnight then I'd likely be able to go home in the morning. After speaking with me they sent me for a CT scan, which came back normal too, I then spent the night in the Obs Ward. Received an anti clotting injection to my thigh, apparently standard precautionary protocol for Obs patients as they're at risk of developing DVT. At the suggestion of the night shift Nurse I then started taking Oxycodone and paracetamol instead of Tramadol to see if it it made me less nauseous (which it did, worked wonders and helped me sleep). Re-assessed by doctors in the morning, they admitted that they didn't know what the issue was but suspected some kind of gastrointestinal issue that should pass. They prescribed me ten Oxycodone to take home for pain management. Before being discharged I noticed I had slight vaginal bleeding, which I notified the nurses of. One nurse suggested that it could have been caused by repeated blood pressure bands being placed on top of the Implanon, interrupting it's normal function. There is also the fairly reasonable possibility that the Transvaginal ultrasound may have caused mild bleeding. I was then discharged. -At home. I slept when I arrived home, but awoke with returned pain of around LVL 4/10. I had a lacy red rash over my chest and shoulders, I thought perhaps a heat rash as I woke fairly warm in my bed (it was the middle of the day). I then took my next dose of Oxycodone and paracetamol two and a half hours early. Over the next hour the pain rose slowly to a LVL 5/10 before the Oxycodone seemed to kick in but only took it back down to LVL 4/10. Over this time mild vaginal bleeding continued. I returned to the Emergency Dep because I was afraid the Oxycodone wasn't going to work and I didn't want to wait until it got bad again and spend several hours in agony waiting to be seen. -Third emergency dep. visit. The triage nurse gave me two Ibuprofen/Codeine. I sat down to wait with a pain LVL 4/10. By time I was taken into the Emergency ward the Ibuprofen had brought my pain down to a really good level, varying between non existent and LVL 3/10 depending on how much I was moving. I waited in the Emergency Ward for a few hours, it was very busy, and was briefly assessed by a nurse who suggested that the Ibuprofen/Codeine may have eased the pain because it was an anti-inflammatory drug rather than just a painkiller. I ended up leaving before being assessed by a doctor as my pain was under control and I didn't feel confident that I needed emergency treatment. -At Home. I returned home to continue treating myself for pain with the medication I had. I have continued taking Oxycodone every six hours, and taking the ED nurse's idea on board I've been taking one Ibuprofen 400g three hours after the Oxycodone to take the edge off.  It has worked quite well so far and I'm hoping this will help to keep the pain at bay. Vaginal bleeding has increased slightly, though certainly not alarmingly. This is pretty much where I stand with it all. I'm feeling ok, my pain is being successfully managed. I'm eating small amounts of plain foods when taking the Ibuprofen and drinking plenty of water. I'm just afraid of what will happen if the pain continues at the heights it has been at whilst continuing to go undiagnosed.   I only have six Oxycodone tablets left, so ideally 36 hours of pain relief remaining unless the pain eases up on it's own (which I'll be super happy about haha) All in all I'm very curious to know if anyone has any ideas of what else to do or has had any experience with a similar issue. I am really eager to get some kind of idea of what is going on. I can't live with the pain and nausea and I can't just keep going to the Emergency Dep every time the painkillers stop working, I really need a solution! Dx Any constructive advice would be much appreciated xxxxxxxx (Also; lol some doctors are really sloppy at putting in cannula, I have a bruise the size of a damn apple on my forearm haha they should leave it to the phlebotomist)"

During my time in the Observation Ward I continued being given a dose of Tramadol, paracetamol and an anti nausea tablet six hourly or so, when the pain began to return. I was assessed by the Ward's surgeons and they agreed that based on the normal results gained from all my tests that they didn't believe I required any kind of surgery and that I could come off of fasting and IV fluids. They proposed that I stay the night under observation, try and eat and drink and see how I progressed. If nothing else occurred overnight then I'd likely be able to go home in the morning. After speaking with me they sent me for a CT scan, which came back normal too, I then spent the night in the Obs Ward. Received an anti clotting injection to my thigh, apparently standard precautionary protocol for Obs patients as they're at risk of developing DVT. At the suggestion of the night shift Nurse I then started taking Oxycodone and paracetamol instead of Tramadol to see if it it made me less nauseous (which it did, worked wonders and helped me sleep). Re-assessed by doctors in the morning, they admitted that they didn't know what the issue was but suspected some kind of gastrointestinal issue that should pass. They prescribed me ten Oxycodone to take home for pain management. Before being discharged I noticed I had slight vaginal bleeding, which I notified the nurses of. One nurse suggested that it could have been caused by repeated blood pressure bands being placed on top of the Implanon, interrupting it's normal function. There is also the fairly reasonable possibility that the Transvaginal ultrasound may have caused mild bleeding. I was then discharged. -At home. I slept when I arrived home, but awoke with returned pain of around LVL 4/10. I had a lacy red rash over my chest and shoulders, I thought perhaps a heat rash as I woke fairly warm in my bed (it was the middle of the day). I then took my next dose of Oxycodone and paracetamol two and a half hours early. Over the next hour the pain rose slowly to a LVL 5/10 before the Oxycodone seemed to kick in but only took it back down to LVL 4/10. Over this time mild vaginal bleeding continued. I returned to the Emergency Dep because I was afraid the Oxycodone wasn't going to work and I didn't want to wait until it got bad again and spend several hours in agony waiting to be seen. -Third emergency dep. visit. The triage nurse gave me two Ibuprofen/Codeine. I sat down to wait with a pain LVL 4/10. By time I was taken into the Emergency ward the Ibuprofen had brought my pain down to a really good level, varying between non existent and LVL 3/10 depending on how much I was moving. I waited in the Emergency Ward for a few hours, it was very busy, and was briefly assessed by a nurse who suggested that the Ibuprofen/Codeine may have eased the pain because it was an anti-inflammatory drug rather than just a painkiller. I ended up leaving before being assessed by a doctor as my pain was under control and I didn't feel confident that I needed emergency treatment. -At Home. I returned home to continue treating myself for pain with the medication I had. I have continued taking Oxycodone every six hours, and taking the ED nurse's idea on board I've been taking one Ibuprofen 400g three hours after the Oxycodone to take the edge off.  It has worked quite well so far and I'm hoping this will help to keep the pain at bay. Vaginal bleeding has increased slightly, though certainly not alarmingly. This is pretty much where I stand with it all. I'm feeling ok, my pain is being successfully managed. I'm eating small amounts of plain foods when taking the Ibuprofen and drinking plenty of water. I'm just afraid of what will happen if the pain continues at the heights it has been at whilst continuing to go undiagnosed.   I only have six Oxycodone tablets left, so ideally 36 hours of pain relief remaining unless the pain eases up on it's own (which I'll be super happy about haha) All in all I'm very curious to know if anyone has any ideas of what else to do or has had any experience with a similar issue. I am really eager to get some kind of idea of what is going on. I can't live with the pain and nausea and I can't just keep going to the Emergency Dep every time the painkillers stop working, I really need a solution! Dx Any constructive advice would be much appreciated xxxxxxxx (Also; lol some doctors are really sloppy at putting in cannula, I have a bruise the size of a damn apple on my forearm haha they should leave it to the phlebotomist)"

I have had severe abdominal pain for almost four days now and after multiple tests and visits the hospital has still not been able to identify the issue. The pain was accompanied by three vomits over the first two days, one occurring directly after being given Tramadol IV. The pain is a constant cramp-like feeling, similar to labour pain, occuring in the mid-to-lower section of my belly. Tummy exams over the last few days have shown varying degrees of tenderness, sometimes barely any, sometimes tenderness towards the lower right side and sometimes to the middle left side. Nausea and loss of appetite are almost constant, though i suspect it has been somewhat a side effect of the strong painkillers. A list of tests that have returned normal include; Multiple bloods, urine tests (including multiple standard pregnancy tests), abdominal ultrasound, transvaginal ultrasound, abdominal CT scan. A list of issues that have been ruled out as highly unlikely at this stage are; Pregnancy, Appendicitis, Ovarian cysts, Urinary Tract Infection. I have an Implanon contraceptive in my left arm and as a side effect hadn't experienced a period for over a year. I have been to hospital now three times. -The first time I was admitted. They ran a series of small tests (bloods, urine, stomach exams) as they suspected possible appendicitis. To manage my pain, which was about LVL 7/10, they gave me IV Tramadol, which increased my nausea (I vomited immediately after) but covered the pain successfully.  All test results came back normal, so they suspected it was simply due to some gastrointestinal upset. They gave me a script for Paracetamol/Codeine and Ibuprofen for pain management and sent me home aprox 3am from the Emergency Dep. -At home. Still under the effects of Tramadol, I was able to sleep for a few hours. The pain began to gradually return once I woke. I went to the chemist with my script as soon as they opened, then began taking the Paracetamol/Codeine (still very nauseous, I couldn't stomach any food so I was unable to take the Ibuprofen at the time). Passed a normal stool. -My second time to emergency.  It became clear that the Paracetamol/Codeine was not effective and pain level slowly returned in full so I returned to the Emergency Dep around midday. I experienced mild cold sweats and I vomited a large amount of yellowish-slightly green bile while waiting to be attended. I was given oral Tramadol and an anti nausea tablet.

I'm just afraid of what will happen if the pain continues at the heights it has been at whilst continuing to go undiagnosed.   I only have six Oxycodone tablets left, so ideally 36 hours of pain relief remaining unless the pain eases up on it's own (which I'll be super happy about haha) All in all I'm very curious to know if anyone has any ideas of what else to do or has had any experience with a similar issue.

I have had severe abdominal pain for almost four days now and after multiple tests and visits the hospital has still not been able to identify the issue. The pain was accompanied by three vomits over the first two days, one occurring directly after being given Tramadol IV. The pain is a constant cramp-like feeling, similar to labour pain, occuring in the mid-to-lower section of my belly. Tummy exams over the last few days have shown varying degrees of tenderness, sometimes barely any, sometimes tenderness towards the lower right side and sometimes to the middle left side. Nausea and loss of appetite are almost constant, though i suspect it has been somewhat a side effect of the strong painkillers. A list of tests that have returned normal include; Multiple bloods, urine tests (including multiple standard pregnancy tests), abdominal ultrasound, transvaginal ultrasound, abdominal CT scan. A list of issues that have been ruled out as highly unlikely at this stage are; Pregnancy, Appendicitis, Ovarian cysts, Urinary Tract Infection. I have an Implanon contraceptive in my left arm and as a side effect hadn't experienced a period for over a year. I have been to hospital now three times. -The first time I was admitted. They ran a series of small tests (bloods, urine, stomach exams) as they suspected possible appendicitis. To manage my pain, which was about LVL 7/10, they gave me IV Tramadol, which increased my nausea (I vomited immediately after) but covered the pain successfully.  All test results came back normal, so they suspected it was simply due to some gastrointestinal upset. They gave me a script for Paracetamol/Codeine and Ibuprofen for pain management and sent me home aprox 3am from the Emergency Dep. -At home. Still under the effects of Tramadol, I was able to sleep for a few hours. The pain began to gradually return once I woke. I went to the chemist with my script as soon as they opened, then began taking the Paracetamol/Codeine (still very nauseous, I couldn't stomach any food so I was unable to take the Ibuprofen at the time). Passed a normal stool. -My second time to emergency.  It became clear that the Paracetamol/Codeine was not effective and pain level slowly returned in full so I returned to the Emergency Dep around midday. I experienced mild cold sweats and I vomited a large amount of yellowish-slightly green bile while waiting to be attended. I was given oral Tramadol and an anti nausea tablet. After a tummy exam resulted in tenderness in the lower right region I was put on IV fluids and was fasted in case of appendicitis. They then followed up with the Abdominal ultrasound and Transvaginal ultrasound which came back normal. I was then moved to a ward for overnight observation. During my time in the Observation Ward I continued being given a dose of Tramadol, paracetamol and an anti nausea tablet six hourly or so, when the pain began to return. I was assessed by the Ward's surgeons and they agreed that based on the normal results gained from all my tests that they didn't believe I required any kind of surgery and that I could come off of fasting and IV fluids. They proposed that I stay the night under observation, try and eat and drink and see how I progressed. If nothing else occurred overnight then I'd likely be able to go home in the morning. After speaking with me they sent me for a CT scan, which came back normal too, I then spent the night in the Obs Ward. Received an anti clotting injection to my thigh, apparently standard precautionary protocol for Obs patients as they're at risk of developing DVT. At the suggestion of the night shift Nurse I then started taking Oxycodone and paracetamol instead of Tramadol to see if it it made me less nauseous (which it did, worked wonders and helped me sleep). Re-assessed by doctors in the morning, they admitted that they didn't know what the issue was but suspected some kind of gastrointestinal issue that should pass. They prescribed me ten Oxycodone to take home for pain management. Before being discharged I noticed I had slight vaginal bleeding, which I notified the nurses of. One nurse suggested that it could have been caused by repeated blood pressure bands being placed on top of the Implanon, interrupting it's normal function. There is also the fairly reasonable possibility that the Transvaginal ultrasound may have caused mild bleeding. I was then discharged. -At home. I slept when I arrived home, but awoke with returned pain of around LVL 4/10. I had a lacy red rash over my chest and shoulders, I thought perhaps a heat rash as I woke fairly warm in my bed (it was the middle of the day). I then took my next dose of Oxycodone and paracetamol two and a half hours early. Over the next hour the pain rose slowly to a LVL 5/10 before the Oxycodone seemed to kick in but only took it back down to LVL 4/10. Over this time mild vaginal bleeding continued. I returned to the Emergency Dep because I was afraid the Oxycodone wasn't going to work and I didn't want to wait until it got bad again and spend several hours in agony waiting to be seen. -Third emergency dep. visit.

Then he set me up for a colonoscopy and you guessed it.. they found nothing. Apart from a small internal non bleeding hemorrhoid. I've increased my water intake and started taking metamucil. I am going more frequently now, but its still not right. My doctor basically just says sometimes this happens to people and sent me on my way. he also has me on a daily dose of miralax. My biggest concern now is that it comes out normal width, but it is pretty flat most of the time. not roundish like it is supposed to be. Should i be concerned about that if i am going more frequently now?I am not really in any pain, i get quite about of discomfort if i dont go for a while.

I got sick the first of Nov with a sore throat, unable to eat from pain, and a week later ended up in ICU with epiglottitis. I was given large amounts of steroids and antibiotics both in the hospital and at home. I was able to eat 1 full meal a day upon release. Around 3 days after release I began vomiting. I could not swallow any food and constantly vomited. I was put on ulcer meds and phenergan. I ended up in hospital 3 times over two weeks for dehydration. I ate no solid food. I saw a GI 5 days ago, he diagnosed CVS,and he put me on lamictal, zofran, maxalt, xanax and a liquid yeast med. It stopped the vomiting, but all I have eaten is 2 banannas, 1 apple and protein drinks. Everything tastes salty. I woke up this morning and drank some water and 5 minutes later vomited it up.

It started out with what seemed like a regular common cold, it went away. For a while, a persistent cough that would only happen when I was trying to sleep. Eventually, that went away. Around the 15th I noticed that the lymph node that deals with my right tonsil was sore, then I noticed that It was quite swollen. On the 26th, I was on a date and got sudden nausea, had a panic attack and threw up. On the 29th, I got tested for mono, tested positive. Since then I still get nauseous when I eat, my lymph nodes are still swollen, and obviously, my spleen is still enlarged. I just feel very stuck because I did not know I had it for such a long time, now I feel like it is going to take forever to heal. I didn't know that I had it, mainly because I have not had the terrible fatigue that most people have had. Anyway, I would get as much help as I can get. I'm in college right now and the clinic we have does not take our concerns seriously and has been known to make several misdiagnoses. I just get very, very worried about my health...I guess you could say I'm a slight hypochondriac. I know not everyone on here is a dcotor, but I do need some reassurance, even prayer would be appreciated."

Had endoscopy few days ago which showed very light inflammation. Doctors said to reduce Nexium and eat everything except spicy, alcohol etc. Im wondering if the belching could be due to low stomach acid from a high dose of Nexium or is it still the inflammation?"

I've seen different doctors for the past couple of months and have yet to figure out what is wrong. I started crossfit in May and have lost twenty pounds until my doctor advised me to stop exercising completely in late October due to much fatigue I have been experiencing, and continue to experience today, until we find out what is going on. I am a 22 year old male, weighing approximately 158 and am 6 feet tall. In mid-July I was started to feel a lot of discomfort in my stomach and abdominal area along with nausea, bloating, and constipation. It got worse after eating. All the symptoms left in early August but then came back in early September. So, I went to my family care doctor and he ex-rayed my stomach to show that there was air in my colon. He then referred me to a gastroenterologist. The gastroenterologist checked for blood in my feces and there was none and he did a CBC and CMP blood test. The only thing that came back wrong was a low white blood cell count. So for the next month, my family care doctor ordered three more CBC tests, along with a SED Rate test, Peripheral Smear (immaturity not observed), CRP C-REACTIVE PROTEIN, Parvovirus, IRON AND TBC, HIV, HEPATITIS PANEL ACUTE, EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS, and COMP METABOLIC PANEL blood tests. Everything was normal and good except that my white blood cell count values were low from 2.8-3.8 during that time, a high monocyte percentage of 11.8, and it was noted I have bilirubinemia. Through much of October and early November my symptoms went away again except for the fatigue but now I am experiencing much of the same symptoms again. As of last week I was referred to a hematologist and he took my blood in four or five tubes. I go back in mid-December to see what he says. The hematologist also asked me to go to a gi doctor while I wait so I did today. My gastrointestinal doctor said it was mostly out of his hands because all my blood tests only show a low white blood cell count. So, he put me on two medicines to help me use the restroom (#2) more frequently. Could anyone lead me to possible causes of the low white blood cell count with the stomach/abdominal pain and the fatigue? I am quite nervous about what it could be because at this point I have no clue. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!"

A few years ago I traced my issue down to intolerance to certain foods - especially nuts, chocolate, and berries. By eliminating these foods from my diet I achieved a significant level of relief. But lately the pain has returned and I haven't been able to determine what is causing it, nor to find any link between my food intolerances. I have spoken to my doctor and he doesn't have any theory or suggestions. It began with sunflower seeds. The second food to manifest was spearmint leaves - spearmint was, by far, the worst, causing acute debilitating pain. Next was blackberries, then peanuts, chocolate, and strawberries. At this time, I could still eat tree nuts, cranberries, and blueberries, but I had to eventually mark each one off the list - the last two to go were cashews, brazil nuts, and cranberries.  Having eliminated all these from my diet, I experienced several years mostly pain free. However, last year I added cherries to the list, and earlier this year I noticed increased discomfort after eating bananas. Next was green cabbage.  Related foods that I can eat - lettuce, napa cabbage, apples, plums, grapes, bread and grains, melons, legumes, asparagus, avocado, tomato, root vegetables, pineapple, citrus.  This week the old pain level has returned. I have not changed my diet, so it is something I have always been able to eat, and just like with the other foods, the change is sudden. I have no other symptoms, such as diarrhea or gas. The pain itself is caused by swelling - I can see the difference in size of my stomach when the pain is on me, and when the pain passes, the swelling passes, too. I worry that I can't keep eliminating foods from my diet as I will eventually reach a point where I won't be able to eat a balanced diet. I would like to find a cause and treatment, but the whole thing seems so bizarre, I wonder if that's even possible."

I am a 24-year old male and about a week after Thanksgiving, I started to get this pain behind my left breast and in the rib cage area underneath the breast itself. Anyways, I really started to notice the pain especially when I breathed in or either put my arm up, raised it above my head, or put my arms in front of my body. The pain would really hurt around the left breast when I made those movements. In addition, I started to develop stomach symptoms such as burning in the stomach, cramping, diarrhea, and pain in the side of the abdomen as well as in the kidney area. After trying out a round of antibiotics, the pain was still there which caused my doctor to prescribe me with two new antibiotics (Ciproflaxcin and Flagyl) which helped to ease the stomach and chest pain for about 10 days.  However, the stomach pain is still there sometimes when I eat certain foods and my doctor recently put me on Zantac and Omeprazole to see if those would work. Besides my Primary Care doctor, I also received a referral to a Gastro doctor who I visited yesterday. The Gastro doctor doesn't believe it is anything serious besides possibly GERD, but I have to stop taking the meds for two weeks in preperation for a H. pylori test. Besides that, the Gastro doctor also wants to conduct a Barium swallow test to ensure that it is nothing major.  While we wait for that, I continue to deal with the chest and rib pain especially behind the left breast extending up into the collarbone and below both breasts in the rib area. Lately, I have noticed that the pain does come and go, but usually is pretty persistent in nature. Ibuprofen seems to help as does hot showers, but it eventually ends up coming back and hurts.  I do have a Subaortic Stenosis heart murmur, which the cardiologist is not concerned about and said to just monitor, and had both an Echocardiogram and EKG done last month. Both of those tests came back normal as did the chest x-ray which came back with no evidence of COPD.

(Al/Mg Hydroxide Simethicone AND Probiotics),"It has been 2 days and I am experiencing minor constipation. Can, or should I take an OTC Medication along with Aluminum / Magnesium Hydroxide and Simethicone Tabs? The following is the ingredients of the medication: STRONG WAKAMOTO: In 27 Tablets (daily dose for adults; 3 times a day): Powder of cultured Aspergillus oryzae NK （microorganism producing digestive enzymes）	3375.0mg Cultured lactobacilli powder	675.0mg Dried Yeast （Vitamin supplement）	2490.1mg The medication is called STRONG WAKAMOTO from Japan and it contains ""natural ingredients"" that are said to ease stomach issues. I have taken this medication in the past. I had quite a few stomachache and diarrhea last week and on Monday diarrhea stopped but my stomach feels so bloated and heavy when lying down on my bed at night that I had to go to the hospital for a check. I have had issues with my windpipe lately that I was worried that there might be a severe problem. The electrocardiogram came out clean and my doctor told me it was gastroenteritis and prescribed me with Aluminum / Magnesium Hydroxide and Simethicone chew tabs. He also prescribed me Hyoscine Butylbromide Tabs and Dioctahedral Smectite Powder which I don't take because I am no longer having any diarrhea. Should I take both medications at the same time? Thanks!"

I’ve had a series of rough life events that I’m sure contributed: alcoholic mother, unfaithful exes, losing religion, having an abortion, etc. In general though, I’ve kept moving along, thinking I’ll feel better when my life was in a better place. I hated college, but eventually graduated. Did a management training program. And eventually left that company for a job in a creative field that I had wanted for a long time. I got my own apartment, some aquariums, and a great relationship with someone who’s not scared off by my mental issues. I’ve done therapy and gotten on medication. Objectively, everything’s great now. Except it’s not. I’ve always thought “I’ll be happy when...” I get a car, I graduate, I can work with art for a living. Whatever it was, there was always a light at the end of the tunnel. I could not want to get out of bed, but one day I would. I could feel like crying all day, but one day I wouldn’t. I could have a panic attack every time I had to interact with someone, but one day I wouldn’t. Well, it’s starting to feel like that day isn’t gonna come. My depression isn’t the worst it’s ever been right now. I once had a mental breakdown and couldn’t get out of bed for 3 months. And then again a month after that. But my suicidal thoughts have moved from “what if” to “when.” The biggest reason for this is just the way I know I’ll think about things. Anything out of the ordinary of a peaceful routine makes me want to shut down. If I misfile something at work and my boss talks to me about it, I react by thinking I’m terrible at what I do, I try to figure out how I could have let that happen, I have passing thoughts about the negative feeling for weeks, and I’ll have massive anxiety every time I have to file something. If I leave work and realize I forgot to send an email, I’ll panic about it, won’t cook or eat dinner, and can’t accomplish anything at home. If I don’t feel like calling my parents I have tremendous guilt and feel like a terrible person, but will avoid it at all costs. Everyday disruptions are one thing, but even things I look forward to usually take me weeks to mentally recover from. If I go to a concert and have a great time, I usually find myself struggling to get out of bed or accomplish anything for at least a week after. Any small accomplishment I feel good about is always bogged by self doubt in the following weeks. I can finish a drawing I’m proud of, but feel worse and worse about it every time I look at it, until I feel like I never want to draw again. Not because I think the drawing is bad, but because I know how terrible I’ll end up feeling about it, even if it turns out the way I want. I’ve been down on my appearance lately because I’ve gained weight and am a whopping 140. It’s not that I feel big, but I’ve definitely lost some self worth since I was 120 and I just see that getting worse if I gain any more weight. I don’t deal with things well. I get though it, but I’m really tired of living life that way. I’m tired of breathing exercises and mindfulness because it doesn’t fix the problem. I just covers it up until it happens again. The root of the problem is never going to go away. It feels like I spend a majority of my life just holding off the next panic attack. It’s exhausting. I’m tired of living life this way.  I really don’t want to go on like this. The help isn’t helping. I’m reaching out because maybe someone has an answer I haven’t already tried. I don’t want to put my loved ones through losing me, but that’s really the only thing keeping me from putting an end to all this. I just don’t see myself ever being less miserable than I am right now. Again, how I feel today, and in general isn’t the worst I’ve ever felt. But it feels like “on rare occasions not suicidal,” is the best I can manage. And if that’s the case, then what’s the point?"

I've recently just moved city and changed jobs and live with my partner, it's all new to me and my moods have just out of the blue started. Everything was going excellent up until Wednesday. It started with anger and irritability and the anger is extreme I mean so restless I cant sit in the same spot for longer than 10 minutes because I'm so frustrated. I keep thinking very negatively and no matter how hard I try to be positive it doesn't last. I calm down but within 5 minutes again I'm off on a tangent.

My melt downs which I dont ever have many of are extreme when they take place too,my recent one was Wednesday night and it lasted 5 hours. Screaming,crying, angry,racing thoughts all brought on by myself. I get so convinced every body is out to emotionally hurt me and that nobody really loves me? I can rationalise this and at the time i know it isnt true so its draining. Its as if I have a reasonable side which can push past the thoughts and a damaging side which believes them and it tires me out. I did self harm also which I haven't done for ages (this mood outburst/melt down is new to me)I've in the past felt very sad but have been able to bring myself out of it after a few hours until Wednesday when all erupted. This is causing issues with my partner as I have no interest in anything, I'm hot and cold and happy and sad. I cant figure out if I want to be held or want to be alone. I know I'm being unfair and it isnt nice to push everyone away but at the moment I cant help it. I do have anxiety too. Its better than what it was but still active in my mind. I'm treating people wrong without wanting too but recently my mind has been in control of me instead of me being in control of that. Yesterday I was upset and crying and then sorted myself out and then not long after that I started crying again.. sobbing. I have no idea what is currently causing this its just frustrating I want to stop this cycle and go back to the bubbly happy girl that I used to be only a few weeks ago. Can I stress that when I feel like this all I want to do is disappear and sleep. I know I'm not treating people fairly right now and it isnt acceptable but I'm honestly like a roller coaster. Period is late too. (Most likely stress) but that isn't helping. This is all draining.. I know I'm depressed but could this or does this sound like more? I'm nunb and blank and feel emotionless and then too emotional I cant find a happy medium."

That being said i went to see my Primary and told them how this developed, and they sent me for blood work. All my blood work came back ""perfect"" (doctors words) yet i still have this condition (itching skin, with hives) Never had allergies in my life, never had ANYTHING wrong accept some joint pain and tendentious BEFORE taking Propecia. Ive eliminated foods from my diet to rule out food allergies....NOT IT. Even eliminated eating all together and fasted....still broke out. So my diet leads me to believe that maybe i have fatty liver????? Could this be possible even though my blood liver enzymes are all perfect? I dont have medical insurance (self employed) and all these Dr's want do is send me to allergists which is a waste of money...Could this drug (Finasteride) still be in my fat cells after 4 weeks causing this condition? Could Finasteride have anything to do with this at all? Ive heard it also increases estrogen levels and can change hormone levels...iam now exploring the best way to spend my $$ in the medical world to fix this....maybe going in the direction of an endocrinologist....HELP!!!"

A few spots here and there, and for a while the instances were rather far apart. Every few weeks, I'd get a day or two with some splotches of blood on the paper. I wrote it off as being the fault of the paper, or maybe something akin to hemorrhoids. The last two weeks, however, the bleeding has gone from a few splotches to a very highly concerning flow of blood. The paper is almost covered in wet, crimson blood. Twice this week I have had to spend an extra 5-10 minutes on the toilet making sure that I was finished bleeding before exiting the restroom, to avoid getting a not insignificant amount of blood on my underwear. The flow was heavy enough to the point that it was dripping onto the floor whilst I was attempting to examine the issue. I have several other typical symptoms of hemorrhoids, that being soreness/discomfort and itchiness around the effected area alongside the bleeding. I have had difficult bowel movements ever since I was a child, where I would go for days and days at a time without one and then have very uncomfortable and long lasting movements with stools that begin loose and become formless by the end of the ordeal. It is a chronic issue I've never had examined by a medical professional due to it never having caused me any significant issues in the past, and due to the obviously embarrassing nature of the condition. I'm seriously concerned about the level of the bleeding now, however, and am wondering whether or not I should seek medical assistance, or if these are common symptoms of hemorrhoids (something I have never before dealt with) that I can treat myself.

Terrible Pain.,"Please help me. Whoever is out there that can answer my questions. I am posting this on multiple websites.  It all started on Sept 30th, 2017. I went out with my family for a birthday dinner. My life was completely turned upside down that night. I was eating like normal and I accidentally took a whole shrimp into my mouth. I chewed it twice and swallowed it way too fast. There was no shell on it and it wasn’t a mini shrimp. I swallowed it whole because I was eating too fast. All of the sudden, I felt weird. The shrimp was traveling down my throat very uncomfortably and I thought it went down my air pipe. I thought I was choking and I started sweating like crazy. I started hyperventilating and had the worst chest pressure that made me feel like I couldn’t breathe. I thought I was going to die, I thought I could be having a heart attack. My family thought I had a panic attack. After I calmed down, I realized I could breathe but I couldn’t take deep breaths or yawn normally. I tried eating again but I started to get panicky sweats again and got very scared. I had the feeling there was food stuck in my throat and chest. (I’ve never had panic attacks before in my life). That night, I have never been the same. It is now Nov. 9th, 2017. The week after my panic attack, my throat felt smaller and I had troubling swallowing food or drinks. Every time I ate food, it felt like it got stuck in my chest, no matter what I ate. I starting eating a lot less, like 2500 calories a day to less than 1000. The night I had a panic attack, I slept like I usually did but I had a hard time breathing normally. I didn’t get much sleep. Every other night after, I had terrible pain in my upper rib cages right below both breasts. I couldn’t breathe still. I went to patient first and told them everything. I got an EKG, blood tests, Chest and throat X rays, everything was normal. Nothing got stuck in my throat. Nothing was wrong. They thought I might of have acid reflux or GERD. They told me to take a drug store antacid like Mylanta. I took it a couple of times. I was having so much pain that week after the incident that I went to the ER as well. They did all the same tests and didn’t find anything wrong. I told them everything and they said it was probably GERD or acid reflux. They gave me a GI cocktail to help relieve some pain. It didn’t do much for me and my breathing was still not normal. I went to an ENT and he stuck a camera down my throat and said nothing was there. I went to a GI specialist after and got an endoscopy. The endoscopy was normal. The doctor said I couldn’t rule out acid reflux though, even though there was no sign of damage to my esophagus. He prescribed me some antacid medicine. I never took it. I went to another GI specialist for a second opinion, she told me all the tests they could do and I did a barium swallow. That test turned out completely normal too. They did an ultrasound of everything with my digestive system and didn’t find a single problem. I started to feel better after that awful week and tried eating more and more solid foods. The week after the panic attack I drank a lot of ensure. I slept that whole week propped up too. The week after the ribcage pain went away. I think it was because I wasn’t eating a lot. When I started eating almost normally again, I felt way better but I couldn’t breathe still and I still had trouble swallowing. It doesn’t really matter what food I eat, when I eat or drink anything, it feels like it puts pressure on my lungs or something. The chest pressure and breathing have gotten way worst in some moments. After a day of eating receses candy and ham and veggies, I got this burning sensation near my left breast in between my chest. After that day, I got a sore throat. Eventually I had a fever that lasted two days and turned into a cold. I think it might of started a week or two ago but now I have no appetite at all. I kinda always feel full and I have a cough leftover from the cold. I hear squeaking noises when I breathe inward. The left side of my stomach makes a weird short fart noise occasionally. I have gargling noises that come from a different part of my stomach too. I started taking a medicine the second GI doctor prescribed, pantoprazole 20 mg twice a day. I’ve been taking it for two weeks now. Sometimes when I eat food, I feel like I have to burp but I don’t and it feels like liquid comes up. I burp constantly whenever I eat anything or drink. I’VE ONLY HAVE BURNING SENSATIONS THREE TIMES MAX. The liquid feeling coming up never burns, it just worsens the breathing. I’ve woken up at night three different times feeling like I swallowed something and it got stuck in my throat. In my head I thought I was wearing a mask, and I swallowed it (I don’t even own any mask).How do I know this is acid reflux and why do I not feel hungry anymore? I never can eat much because I have trouble swallowing and it feels like my life is falling apart. Someone please help me. I’m losing hope. I need help. I can’t do anything normally anymore. I can’t tell If what im eating is hurting me, I cant breathe right, I cant exercise like I use too because I don’t eat enough. I am only 20 years old and 120 pounds. Life is awful. I’ve tried Xanax as well, it did not help with anything. I have to eat all food by grinding up almost to a liquid in my mouth. My chest pressure has never let up since that terrible day. What is happening to me? Btw when I take hard steps or jump off something, the front upper part of my teeth hurt really bad. I read that may be because they are connected to my sinuses or something?

Terrible Pain.,"Please help me. Whoever is out there that can answer my questions. I am posting this on multiple websites.  It all started on Sept 30th, 2017. I went out with my family for a birthday dinner. My life was completely turned upside down that night. I was eating like normal and I accidentally took a whole shrimp into my mouth. I chewed it twice and swallowed it way too fast. There was no shell on it and it wasn’t a mini shrimp. I swallowed it whole because I was eating too fast. All of the sudden, I felt weird. The shrimp was traveling down my throat very uncomfortably and I thought it went down my air pipe. I thought I was choking and I started sweating like crazy. I started hyperventilating and had the worst chest pressure that made me feel like I couldn’t breathe. I thought I was going to die, I thought I could be having a heart attack. My family thought I had a panic attack. After I calmed down, I realized I could breathe but I couldn’t take deep breaths or yawn normally. I tried eating again but I started to get panicky sweats again and got very scared. I had the feeling there was food stuck in my throat and chest. (I’ve never had panic attacks before in my life). That night, I have never been the same. It is now Nov. 9th, 2017. The week after my panic attack, my throat felt smaller and I had troubling swallowing food or drinks. Every time I ate food, it felt like it got stuck in my chest, no matter what I ate. I starting eating a lot less, like 2500 calories a day to less than 1000. The night I had a panic attack, I slept like I usually did but I had a hard time breathing normally. I didn’t get much sleep. Every other night after, I had terrible pain in my upper rib cages right below both breasts. I couldn’t breathe still. I went to patient first and told them everything. I got an EKG, blood tests, Chest and throat X rays, everything was normal. Nothing got stuck in my throat. Nothing was wrong. They thought I might of have acid reflux or GERD. They told me to take a drug store antacid like Mylanta. I took it a couple of times. I was having so much pain that week after the incident that I went to the ER as well. They did all the same tests and didn’t find anything wrong. I told them everything and they said it was probably GERD or acid reflux. They gave me a GI cocktail to help relieve some pain. It didn’t do much for me and my breathing was still not normal. I went to an ENT and he stuck a camera down my throat and said nothing was there. I went to a GI specialist after and got an endoscopy. The endoscopy was normal. The doctor said I couldn’t rule out acid reflux though, even though there was no sign of damage to my esophagus. He prescribed me some antacid medicine. I never took it. I went to another GI specialist for a second opinion, she told me all the tests they could do and I did a barium swallow. That test turned out completely normal too. They did an ultrasound of everything with my digestive system and didn’t find a single problem. I started to feel better after that awful week and tried eating more and more solid foods. The week after the panic attack I drank a lot of ensure. I slept that whole week propped up too. The week after the ribcage pain went away. I think it was because I wasn’t eating a lot. When I started eating almost normally again, I felt way better but I couldn’t breathe still and I still had trouble swallowing. It doesn’t really matter what food I eat, when I eat or drink anything, it feels like it puts pressure on my lungs or something. The chest pressure and breathing have gotten way worst in some moments. After a day of eating receses candy and ham and veggies, I got this burning sensation near my left breast in between my chest. After that day, I got a sore throat. Eventually I had a fever that lasted two days and turned into a cold. I think it might of started a week or two ago but now I have no appetite at all. I kinda always feel full and I have a cough leftover from the cold. I hear squeaking noises when I breathe inward. The left side of my stomach makes a weird short fart noise occasionally. I have gargling noises that come from a different part of my stomach too. I started taking a medicine the second GI doctor prescribed, pantoprazole 20 mg twice a day. I’ve been taking it for two weeks now. Sometimes when I eat food, I feel like I have to burp but I don’t and it feels like liquid comes up. I burp constantly whenever I eat anything or drink. I’VE ONLY HAVE BURNING SENSATIONS THREE TIMES MAX. The liquid feeling coming up never burns, it just worsens the breathing. I’ve woken up at night three different times feeling like I swallowed something and it got stuck in my throat. In my head I thought I was wearing a mask, and I swallowed it (I don’t even own any mask).How do I know this is acid reflux and why do I not feel hungry anymore? I never can eat much because I have trouble swallowing and it feels like my life is falling apart. Someone please help me. I’m losing hope. I need help. I can’t do anything normally anymore. I can’t tell If what im eating is hurting me, I cant breathe right, I cant exercise like I use too because I don’t eat enough. I am only 20 years old and 120 pounds. Life is awful. I’ve tried Xanax as well, it did not help with anything. I have to eat all food by grinding up almost to a liquid in my mouth. My chest pressure has never let up since that terrible day. What is happening to me? Btw when I take hard steps or jump off something, the front upper part of my teeth hurt really bad. I read that may be because they are connected to my sinuses or something? I am allergic to sulfur drugs and I have celiac disease. I’ve had it since I was 17. I do not eat gluten ever. I have never experienced any of this in my life.

Terrible Pain.,"Please help me. Whoever is out there that can answer my questions. I am posting this on multiple websites.  It all started on Sept 30th, 2017. I went out with my family for a birthday dinner. My life was completely turned upside down that night. I was eating like normal and I accidentally took a whole shrimp into my mouth. I chewed it twice and swallowed it way too fast. There was no shell on it and it wasn’t a mini shrimp. I swallowed it whole because I was eating too fast. All of the sudden, I felt weird. The shrimp was traveling down my throat very uncomfortably and I thought it went down my air pipe. I thought I was choking and I started sweating like crazy. I started hyperventilating and had the worst chest pressure that made me feel like I couldn’t breathe. I thought I was going to die, I thought I could be having a heart attack. My family thought I had a panic attack. After I calmed down, I realized I could breathe but I couldn’t take deep breaths or yawn normally. I tried eating again but I started to get panicky sweats again and got very scared. I had the feeling there was food stuck in my throat and chest. (I’ve never had panic attacks before in my life). That night, I have never been the same. It is now Nov. 9th, 2017. The week after my panic attack, my throat felt smaller and I had troubling swallowing food or drinks. Every time I ate food, it felt like it got stuck in my chest, no matter what I ate. I starting eating a lot less, like 2500 calories a day to less than 1000. The night I had a panic attack, I slept like I usually did but I had a hard time breathing normally. I didn’t get much sleep. Every other night after, I had terrible pain in my upper rib cages right below both breasts. I couldn’t breathe still. I went to patient first and told them everything. I got an EKG, blood tests, Chest and throat X rays, everything was normal. Nothing got stuck in my throat. Nothing was wrong. They thought I might of have acid reflux or GERD. They told me to take a drug store antacid like Mylanta. I took it a couple of times. I was having so much pain that week after the incident that I went to the ER as well. They did all the same tests and didn’t find anything wrong. I told them everything and they said it was probably GERD or acid reflux. They gave me a GI cocktail to help relieve some pain. It didn’t do much for me and my breathing was still not normal. I went to an ENT and he stuck a camera down my throat and said nothing was there. I went to a GI specialist after and got an endoscopy. The endoscopy was normal. The doctor said I couldn’t rule out acid reflux though, even though there was no sign of damage to my esophagus. He prescribed me some antacid medicine. I never took it. I went to another GI specialist for a second opinion, she told me all the tests they could do and I did a barium swallow. That test turned out completely normal too. They did an ultrasound of everything with my digestive system and didn’t find a single problem. I started to feel better after that awful week and tried eating more and more solid foods. The week after the panic attack I drank a lot of ensure. I slept that whole week propped up too. The week after the ribcage pain went away. I think it was because I wasn’t eating a lot. When I started eating almost normally again, I felt way better but I couldn’t breathe still and I still had trouble swallowing. It doesn’t really matter what food I eat, when I eat or drink anything, it feels like it puts pressure on my lungs or something. The chest pressure and breathing have gotten way worst in some moments. After a day of eating receses candy and ham and veggies, I got this burning sensation near my left breast in between my chest. After that day, I got a sore throat. Eventually I had a fever that lasted two days and turned into a cold. I think it might of started a week or two ago but now I have no appetite at all. I kinda always feel full and I have a cough leftover from the cold. I hear squeaking noises when I breathe inward. The left side of my stomach makes a weird short fart noise occasionally. I have gargling noises that come from a different part of my stomach too. I started taking a medicine the second GI doctor prescribed, pantoprazole 20 mg twice a day. I’ve been taking it for two weeks now. Sometimes when I eat food, I feel like I have to burp but I don’t and it feels like liquid comes up. I burp constantly whenever I eat anything or drink. I’VE ONLY HAVE BURNING SENSATIONS THREE TIMES MAX. The liquid feeling coming up never burns, it just worsens the breathing. I’ve woken up at night three different times feeling like I swallowed something and it got stuck in my throat. In my head I thought I was wearing a mask, and I swallowed it (I don’t even own any mask).How do I know this is acid reflux and why do I not feel hungry anymore? I never can eat much because I have trouble swallowing and it feels like my life is falling apart. Someone please help me. I’m losing hope. I need help. I can’t do anything normally anymore. I can’t tell If what im eating is hurting me, I cant breathe right, I cant exercise like I use too because I don’t eat enough. I am only 20 years old and 120 pounds. Life is awful. I’ve tried Xanax as well, it did not help with anything. I have to eat all food by grinding up almost to a liquid in my mouth. My chest pressure has never let up since that terrible day. What is happening to me? Btw when I take hard steps or jump off something, the front upper part of my teeth hurt really bad. I read that may be because they are connected to my sinuses or something? I am allergic to sulfur drugs and I have celiac disease. I’ve had it since I was 17. I do not eat gluten ever. I have never experienced any of this in my life. Can that onset event trigger acid reflux all of the sudden???"

Assuming a healthy digestive system and stronger immunity, helping us to fight against infections and protecting us when we take antibiotics are only a few benefits that these tiny little bacteria can give to us. The world health organization defined probiotics as: “Probiotics are microorganisms that give many benefits to our body when they are consumed in proper amounts.”  The digestive tube is the place where acts our intestinal flora, intestinal mucosa, and immune system. Inside our digestive system, it works 24 h from 24 h over 100.000 milliards bacteria. That`s why our body manages to digest what we eat, synthesizes the vitamins and other nutritive substance. Things like stress, unhealthy alimentation, antibiotics treatment can cause an imbalance to our intestinal flora, and this thing has a serious impact on our health leading to repeated infections, acne, mycosis, digestive disorders (diarrhea, constipation), fatigue and depression. And what`s the solution to all these? Probiotics are the friendly bacteria that rebalance our intestinal flora and bring the feeling of wellbeing.  Our intestinal flora has many physiological functions, assuring a healthy life. Helps digesting the food helps to synthesize certain vitamins, feeds our intestinal mucosa and helps it, has an essential role in protecting our body because it acts like a protective wall which won`t let bad bacteria affect our body. When our intestinal flora is unbalanced, the good bacteria can`t work properly anymore. In this situation, to rebalance our intestinal flora is necessary a nutritive supplement based on probiotics. Probiotics help the wall to become stronger and to fight better against the bad bacteria. Probiotics also favor the multiplication of probiotics, and so no bad bacteria will have a place. So here are the essential rules when you choose a probiotic: It is recommended that probiotics should be taken in the form of supplements. To be sure that you have selected the most efficient probiotic make sure to follow those tips: 1. Choose a product that contains a sufficient quantity of probiotics so that it has the effect you expected. More precisely, be aware of the number of CFUs used in the supplement you take. .2 Make sure that the bacteria are conserved in a safe method and that they remain alive. In this way, they will have better results in your body. 3. void seasonal infections make sure you take a proper amount of probiotics daily."

I'm trying to figure out the cause for my bloating. I'm a 32yo male, 67 kg in fairly decent health, I did smoke for 13 years and drank a fair amount when I went out 2 or 3 times a month. I'll try to give as much info as possible here below: Diet wise is good now. I've always been able to eat anything and have remained at 65-68kg regardless of what I ate. I was travelling in Asia for the past 14 months but have now been in Australia for the past 3. The past 6 months I have noticed bloating in my lower gut, front side all around where my belly button is. The first time I noticed it was in Asia and I put it down to drinking beer more regularly. The one and only time I had an actual reactive episode to food was around 5 months ago when I went to a good Italian restaurant and had pasta. Not a huge portion but within half an hour I thought I was going to explode. I have seemingly zero fat on me and my abdomen was bulging insanely. My gut area inflamed so much that I ended up being sick and having diarrhoea through the night. That led me to believe it was maybe a gluten intolerance so from then on I cut gluten out of my diet. But the bloating didn't really go away and I re-introduced gluten to my diet. That made zero difference to anything.  It generally gets worse at night but it is present in the morning still. I have no other physical symptoms present.  The only other thing I think it could be is due to stress and anxiety. On the face of it I feel happy, I'm always mentally aware of where I am in life and I'm good at making corrections in my thinking if need be. The first time an anxiety attack hit me properly was around 24 hours after finishing drinking during a hangover. It was a full on panic attack- tight chest the feeling of impending doom/ I was having a heart attack. I wasn't sure the cause at the time and then a similar thing happened a few months later and then became more frequent. It only happened on big nights of prolonged drinking. I'm a social drinker and the average week I drink nothing at all - a few units if anything. But when I go out for a big night, I drink a lot. 20-35 units in a single night. Although big drinking was rare, I've cut back further and only drank clean good alcohol.  The panic attacks/anxiety started to play a part in my everyday life. They were never full on attacks, more of a constant feeling and still always that tightness in the chest like my heart was failing. I read up heavily on the subject and started doing yoga and meditating daily. I also had a more fight than flight attitude mentally when confronting the anxiety which helped. So relaxing but also being firm in my thoughts definitely helps and the anxiety and tightness in the chest has largely disappeared.  But the bloating is still there. I should add I had a similar thing a few years ago. Never a panic attack but I was convinced there was a small hard lump in the centre left of my chest. Doctors then put it down to stress as I was cleared of anything else. They didn't give any explanation to how stress can manifest itself into seemingly real physical symptoms and really didn't take anything seriously at all. I'm by no means a hypochondriac but I'm fully aware how powerful the mind - conscious and subconscious can be. That's why I've taken the approach to my anxiety now. I eliminated certain foods to reduce the bloating but to no result - maybe I need to do it for longer and try different diets?  I'm thinking it might still be a stress thing. I'm a self employed travel photographer - I'm quite hard on myself as the market is a tough one. I love working and do so all the time without sacrificing my own happiness. At least that's what I think I'm doing.  So does anyone have thoughts on anxiety and bloating? Are there ways to reduce the physical symptoms of the bloating itself? Like I said, I'm fairly active. My diet is pretty good and balanced. No other symptoms present. I drink plenty of water everyday.  I'm asking here first as I am still travelling so going to a doctor overseas can be complicated and costly.  And input would be appreciated. Thanks"

I'm trying to figure out the cause for my bloating. I'm a 32yo male, 67 kg in fairly decent health, I did smoke for 13 years and drank a fair amount when I went out 2 or 3 times a month. I'll try to give as much info as possible here below: Diet wise is good now. I've always been able to eat anything and have remained at 65-68kg regardless of what I ate. I was travelling in Asia for the past 14 months but have now been in Australia for the past 3. The past 6 months I have noticed bloating in my lower gut, front side all around where my belly button is. The first time I noticed it was in Asia and I put it down to drinking beer more regularly. The one and only time I had an actual reactive episode to food was around 5 months ago when I went to a good Italian restaurant and had pasta. Not a huge portion but within half an hour I thought I was going to explode. I have seemingly zero fat on me and my abdomen was bulging insanely. My gut area inflamed so much that I ended up being sick and having diarrhoea through the night. That led me to believe it was maybe a gluten intolerance so from then on I cut gluten out of my diet. But the bloating didn't really go away and I re-introduced gluten to my diet. That made zero difference to anything.  It generally gets worse at night but it is present in the morning still. I have no other physical symptoms present.  The only other thing I think it could be is due to stress and anxiety. On the face of it I feel happy, I'm always mentally aware of where I am in life and I'm good at making corrections in my thinking if need be. The first time an anxiety attack hit me properly was around 24 hours after finishing drinking during a hangover. It was a full on panic attack- tight chest the feeling of impending doom/ I was having a heart attack. I wasn't sure the cause at the time and then a similar thing happened a few months later and then became more frequent. It only happened on big nights of prolonged drinking. I'm a social drinker and the average week I drink nothing at all - a few units if anything. But when I go out for a big night, I drink a lot. 20-35 units in a single night. Although big drinking was rare, I've cut back further and only drank clean good alcohol.  The panic attacks/anxiety started to play a part in my everyday life. They were never full on attacks, more of a constant feeling and still always that tightness in the chest like my heart was failing. I read up heavily on the subject and started doing yoga and meditating daily. I also had a more fight than flight attitude mentally when confronting the anxiety which helped. So relaxing but also being firm in my thoughts definitely helps and the anxiety and tightness in the chest has largely disappeared.  But the bloating is still there.

My mum says I stopped after she told me she would no longer take me out with her to restaurants if my behavior continued. But I never stopped regurgitating food. Now even five hours or more after I eat I still regurgitate small amounts of food. It is not controllable. There is no pain or stomach contractions. No acidity. I'm just constantly re-chewing my food and its pretty embarrassing.  I have been told its a phase and that I will probably grow out of it with age but I am now 21 and nobody is taking this issue seriously. Does anyone have any idea of what this might be? any suggestions on how to stop it?

I hate the idea of labeling myself with some disorder. I'm not looking for excuses for my short comings.  I can't seem to get a grip on my life. I have twin boys and a husband. I struggle to keep up with normal life things. Cloths cooking engaging with me kids. I want to do better but I can't find the energy. Mayne not energy just the motivation. I feel disconnected. I cant seem to find out in things. I spend hours hating myself for not being on top of things but still cant push myself to just get it done. I feel like I'm screaming to myself all the time but I can't make myself focus on any task to long. I feel tired like a need some big break when I haven't really done much at all. I feel judge within my home over the small things I do enjoy. Such as books and tv shows. I just feel lonely without ever really being left alone. Some nights I can feel the stress getting to me. I can't breath and feel trapped under some weight. I just want to be a better mom and wife.

Things were spinning faster and faster out of control. At our last counseling session my wife said, “you destroyed my heart. I’m going to destroy your life.” I thought it was just upset talk, but later I came to find out that she was serious. short story = She attacked me repeatedly using the police and ***. My public defender sucked and I am now a felon. She continued to attack me, try to set me up for things for the following years. I soon had to stop seeing my daughter because of these attacks. I had to completely separate myself from anything connected to my now ex. I haven’t seen my daughter for 5 years now. It’s like she was kidnapped from me. I have no family for support. I ended up becoming a truck driver because I needed a place to live, I live in the truck, because it’s hard for a felon to find a place to rent, especially when you were evicted while you were in jail for the bs felony charge. I’m obviously depressed as I have nothing and anything that mattered to me was ripped from my life. I have tendinitis in both my wrists, which extremely limits my career choices as a felon. I basically cannot do anything repeatedly with my hands without pain and swelling. Typing this out on my phone hurts... I feel lost in this truck, driving in circles, for no reason. I don’t trust people, and cannot make new friends. Oh yea, I lost my few friends. They all just stopped talking to me right after I was arrested for the felony. Later I found out that she told them that I had been molesting my daughter. Which obviously was not happening. She must have been very convincing though... Anyways, I’m alone, afraid to put myself out there to new people. I have no place to call home, I have no interest in hobbies I used to love anymore. I have no real distraction from my pain.

The surgeries/Hospital visits i've had in the past have been constipation, pneumonia that led me to wear a bipap mask at night, a spinal infusion, feeding tube/g-tube mickey button.

My stomach is tender to touch below my xiphoid process but far above my belly button in my upper center abdomen. Not to the left, not to the right, dead center. The pain is the worst when I am dehydrated. Not to say that it improves much when I drink, but it's not as bad.

Stomach tenderness is said to be a medical emergency, mine is not, obviously and yet its a significant reduction in my quality of life. I do have some herniated discs in my thoracic region from old football injuries, but when those hurt, its a very specific pain which I have not had to deal with in many years. This stomach pain comes from the front and does not radiate into the back at all. My spine is not tender to touch as it is when I am injured. I am considered obese, though I am quite active and healthy otherwise. I weight 240 and am 5'10"" tall. I do not smoke, I do not eat red meat, consume alcohol, or any other drugs of any kind, legal or not. QUESTIONS Is there any other bacteria I should be tested for?

I was diagnosed with depression 4 months back, but have probably been depressed for longer. I just wanted to ask you all if some of the things I’m going through are ‘normal’ for depression? I have some completely blank days, I can’t focus on a thing, all I want to do is sleep, and cry. I haven’t told the people I’m staying with about my depression , so when I’m confronted about my over sleeping/ lazy ways, I react badly. I get abnormally furious and overwrought, it’s horribly intense, I feel like I’m burning. It’s just as bad with any slightly stressful situation, I become consumed with fear, and all kinds of bad self-harming thoughts go through my head. But the worst is, I have ‘lucid’ days too, when I wonder what I’d been fussing about. It’s on these days that I go out and mingle with people, so they never know, and I feel so normal. But I never know when the next wave will hit me, and there’s nothing I can do except wait. Some days I have moments when I feel like I’m cut off from the world, and it’s all just a dream, it’s surreal how painful and crushing this emptiness feels. But when it passes, I’m fine, and it scares me that I can be like this. I used to try and write a journal to help me understand these episodes, they feel like a mental seizure.  Please, is this roller coaster thing something anyone can relate to? I’m scared of my own feelings."

I was diagnosed with depression 4 months back, but have probably been depressed for longer. I just wanted to ask you all if some of the things I’m going through are ‘normal’ for depression? I have some completely blank days, I can’t focus on a thing, all I want to do is sleep, and cry. I haven’t told the people I’m staying with about my depression , so when I’m confronted about my over sleeping/ lazy ways, I react badly. I get abnormally furious and overwrought, it’s horribly intense, I feel like I’m burning. It’s just as bad with any slightly stressful situation, I become consumed with fear, and all kinds of bad self-harming thoughts go through my head. But the worst is, I have ‘lucid’ days too, when I wonder what I’d been fussing about. It’s on these days that I go out and mingle with people, so they never know, and I feel so normal.

Right now I am in my bedroom/office listening to some café jazz, visualizing myself walking down a peaceful long grassy road, with the music and a strong breeze; side by side with me. The weekend was not good for me. For some reason I felt panic, fear irritable and paranoid. I don't know why, I just felt depressed and all along. Can any of you guys relate to my emotions? and the scary part about it, it's hard to explain your feelings of apprehension verbally to anyone. I am a part of the baby boomer generation, in September, I will be sixty four years of age. The elders in my family - mother, grandmother, aunt are deceased, I just recently lost my mother-in-law. Therefore I don't have maternal women in my life to place my head on her lap. I have a forty three year old daughter, but hey I am suppose to be her lightening rod, not the other way around. The last time I felt depressed, I was placed in a mental institution for a couple of weeks. They prescribed anti-depressant medication for me, and for awhile it help but eventually the potency was not having an effect. So they increased the dosage. You know what, I don't like it. You see I have always been a woman of strength, courage and determination, in other words being in control. Thru medication I have become submissive. So I try to find alternatives for my depression with vitamins, various energy juices, green tea so on. I would cut down taking my anti-depressant pills(cut in half) along with my other supplements, and it was working. Yet this past week, something came over me. This morning when I was praying, a quiet voice spoke to me. It said Sharon ask your Heavenly Father grant you power to accept what you can not change, and be content what you can. It was then I realize what was wrong with me. FEAR OF DEATH. My grandmother abandoning her three children, at an early age, caused tension, hostility, resentment, bitterness and pain, you see my grandmother had five children, my mother who was an infant then and my uncle, who was a toddler; she had taken. The three older children she left. I remember over the years of stories of hearing them crying and begging my grandmother not to leave them. The rift in our family has caused problems, whereas we don't know how to be a family. My grandmother's mother was placed in a mental institution and by her being the only child, she married a much older man, who was very abusive; which is one of the reason she left her home. My mother pretty much raised herself, so there was no relationship with her mother, just as I too did not have a relationship with my mother. We didn't know how to open up in communication about our feelings. My mother was afraid of her mother and I was afraid of my mother, fear of being hurt. Had it not been for my experience with my mother, the same curse with my daughter, would had been the same. My fear of death, is my legacy. I feel that I have hurt a lot of people in my life time, my mother, sister, brothers and my children. Now that I am at an age that death can be around the corner, I began to worry. Even though I don't have the female(s) in my life to console me, that quiet voice that we all have, is just as powerful. Ask Our Heavenly Creator to grant the power to accept what we can not change, and for us to be content what we can. May it be relationship(s) daily habit(s) or just looking within ourselves, and like who we our.  Join me guys walk with me. Sha"
