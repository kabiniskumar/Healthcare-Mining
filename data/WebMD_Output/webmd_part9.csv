That would explain all your symptoms; I would however need to dig more into your “ slight fever”. A less- than 38 degree Celsius still fits into the spectrum, but higher values may point to possible latent infection that flares up with waning immune status in company with sex hormones imbalance and a bleeding endometrium, especially if there is local uterine pain.  Stemming from such a pathophysiolgy antidepressant use is of help, evidently keeping in mind your position regarding use of those. One more point regarding one reply; the fact that fiber rich food is estrogen rich, which will compensate for the relative estrogen reduction at this phase of the menstrual cycle, it may contrpuntally be of benefit to increase intake of those in this context.

So far I've had a rectal exam that was normal, no blood in stool, went to a urologist today because I have had kidney stones before.I have a family history of polyps in the colon, but I get screened every five years for that and will be getting screened again soon.

I have always known 2017 would be my last year on earth and things have happened to insure that this is it for me. I have no idea why i am writing this. I was a mistake that can not be fixed. I have lost everything. My family, my kids, my friends and I am sick of feeling so sad all the time. Nothing helps and nothing will ever change the person I have become.  My parents divorced when I was 8. My dad left our lives when I was 10 leaving me as the youngest of 4 kids. My oldest sister then my brother, then my other sister, then me. My mom worked 2 jobs to support us and was never home. My brother who is 5 years older then me was a monster. He would beat me up all the time. I dont mean like your bigger brother who was mean to his little brother. I mean he beat me and beat me and beat me some more. When he wasnt beating me he would fight with my older sister and they would fight and beat on each other. She once protected me by hitting him with a can of soup and he hit her with a skillet. She was the only thing that stopped the beatings I would take. Until she couldnt take it anymore and she left.  So from then on it was me and my other sister taking the beatings. Until one day he beat her with a ice scrapper and bruised her leg dark blue all up and down her thigh. He never touched her again....so that left me.  I took all of it from the time I was 11 until I was 15 and one day he made threats to my mom and she finally called police and because he had guns at the house they got him out of our home.  My mom never did anything to stop any of this. She was weak and helpless and never stopped any of it. My brother once took a 25lb frozen turkey and smashed me in the face when i was 14. I thought I would stand up to him. As I layed on the floor with blood pouring out of my chin my mom just yelled at him and did nothing. I am 44 now and keep a beard to cover the scare that was never treated or healed.  One time I let our neighbor in our garage to borrow one of my brother tools. He kept the garage all to himself and when he found out I lent the tool of his to our neighbor he tracked me down while I was with my friends. He drove up and got out of the car and punched me in the face without any warning and I went down. I rememeber my friends who were all 12 at the time saying Dan what the *** man. He threatened them and picked me up by my hair and threw me in the car and punched me as we went home. I got out of the car thinking it was over and he hit me from behind knocking me down and then dragged me by my hair (it was longer at that time) into the house. He proceeded to beat the *** out of me and I could not open my eyes for days.  When I would come home from school and walk home from the bus I would see my two older friends sitting across the street listening to my mom and brother yell and scream at each other. I would see them laughing like it was a moving they were enjoying. I would go sit and laugh with them like I was part of the group but I knew they were making fun of me and my home. It was so humiliating.  As life has gone on I developed an intimidating look and tried so hard to be scary so people wouldnt mess with me. I was so scared that someone would know i was a coward and this was the only way I could protect myself. I myself turned into a monster. I have never hit any of the woman I was with but I would yell and scream and argue and was always so angry all the time. I later found out that verbal abuse is just as bad if not worse then physical abuse. I became the monster I was terrified of.  I was with someone for 12 years and she dealt with me through all of the years. She was a liar and bi polar herself but we had 2 kids together and as much as I loved her and she claimed she would stay with me and be loyal and loving to me, a person can only take so much. So she found someone else and began to cheat on me. Once I found out I was devistated. I always knew anyone who says they love me will leave and she did as well.  Now I am alone, I can not see my kids, I lost the one person who said she would stay with me and I have no friends. I have a good job and a nice car, but my only goal was to not be like my dad and I wanted to keep my family together. That is all gone now and as I said in the beginning of this post, I always knew this would be my last year in this world.  Someday I always said....someday I will kill myself and be done with this hell. Someday is rapidly approaching and I have researched C02 poisoning. But it looks like my newer car wont put out enough C02 to kill me so thats not going to work. I do not have a gun so I will have to try to get one from the hood or something. I can not bring myself to hang myself so i either need to locate a *** load of sleeping pills or find a gun.  Sadly it looks like hanging myself is what I will have to do. I hate myself and I know I was a mistake. My parents made a new years mistake and i was born in Sept of 72. I do not speak to or have a relationship with anyone in my family. My older sister tries to help because she knows what it was like. But I find that if they know how I feel they will just try to talk me out of it or get me stuck on a 72 hour evaluation. Who wants to deal with that? not me. My life is over and I will be finding a way within the next few days to make it happen.  Maybe someone out there will see this and post...oh please dont give up....but that means nothing to someone who has been in so much pain for the past 34 years. I can not rememeber anyting before age 10. But thats when the beatings began and every moment prior to that is a lost memory.  I am so sad and unhappy all the time and I wish I could just have a heart attack and die naturally. But hell has not had enough of me yet and wants me to stay and be miserable.  I wont stay here anymore. I hope if you think about hitting your kids or if you know someone who is being beaten that you will help them. Because even when it stops the pain lasts a lifetime."

I am 44 now and keep a beard to cover the scare that was never treated or healed.  One time I let our neighbor in our garage to borrow one of my brother tools. He kept the garage all to himself and when he found out I lent the tool of his to our neighbor he tracked me down while I was with my friends. He drove up and got out of the car and punched me in the face without any warning and I went down. I rememeber my friends who were all 12 at the time saying Dan what the *** man. He threatened them and picked me up by my hair and threw me in the car and punched me as we went home. I got out of the car thinking it was over and he hit me from behind knocking me down and then dragged me by my hair (it was longer at that time) into the house. He proceeded to beat the *** out of me and I could not open my eyes for days.  When I would come home from school and walk home from the bus I would see my two older friends sitting across the street listening to my mom and brother yell and scream at each other. I would see them laughing like it was a moving they were enjoying. I would go sit and laugh with them like I was part of the group but I knew they were making fun of me and my home. It was so humiliating.  As life has gone on I developed an intimidating look and tried so hard to be scary so people wouldnt mess with me. I was so scared that someone would know i was a coward and this was the only way I could protect myself. I myself turned into a monster. I have never hit any of the woman I was with but I would yell and scream and argue and was always so angry all the time. I later found out that verbal abuse is just as bad if not worse then physical abuse. I became the monster I was terrified of.  I was with someone for 12 years and she dealt with me through all of the years. She was a liar and bi polar herself but we had 2 kids together and as much as I loved her and she claimed she would stay with me and be loyal and loving to me, a person can only take so much. So she found someone else and began to cheat on me. Once I found out I was devistated. I always knew anyone who says they love me will leave and she did as well.  Now I am alone, I can not see my kids, I lost the one person who said she would stay with me and I have no friends. I have a good job and a nice car, but my only goal was to not be like my dad and I wanted to keep my family together. That is all gone now and as I said in the beginning of this post, I always knew this would be my last year in this world.  Someday I always said....someday I will kill myself and be done with this hell. Someday is rapidly approaching and I have researched C02 poisoning. But it looks like my newer car wont put out enough C02 to kill me so thats not going to work. I do not have a gun so I will have to try to get one from the hood or something. I can not bring myself to hang myself so i either need to locate a *** load of sleeping pills or find a gun.  Sadly it looks like hanging myself is what I will have to do. I hate myself and I know I was a mistake. My parents made a new years mistake and i was born in Sept of 72. I do not speak to or have a relationship with anyone in my family. My older sister tries to help because she knows what it was like. But I find that if they know how I feel they will just try to talk me out of it or get me stuck on a 72 hour evaluation. Who wants to deal with that? not me. My life is over and I will be finding a way within the next few days to make it happen.  Maybe someone out there will see this and post...oh please dont give up....but that means nothing to someone who has been in so much pain for the past 34 years. I can not rememeber anyting before age 10. But thats when the beatings began and every moment prior to that is a lost memory.  I am so sad and unhappy all the time and I wish I could just have a heart attack and die naturally. But hell has not had enough of me yet and wants me to stay and be miserable.  I wont stay here anymore. I hope if you think about hitting your kids or if you know someone who is being beaten that you will help them. Because even when it stops the pain lasts a lifetime."

I have always known 2017 would be my last year on earth and things have happened to insure that this is it for me. I have no idea why i am writing this. I was a mistake that can not be fixed. I have lost everything. My family, my kids, my friends and I am sick of feeling so sad all the time. Nothing helps and nothing will ever change the person I have become.  My parents divorced when I was 8. My dad left our lives when I was 10 leaving me as the youngest of 4 kids. My oldest sister then my brother, then my other sister, then me. My mom worked 2 jobs to support us and was never home. My brother who is 5 years older then me was a monster. He would beat me up all the time. I dont mean like your bigger brother who was mean to his little brother. I mean he beat me and beat me and beat me some more. When he wasnt beating me he would fight with my older sister and they would fight and beat on each other. She once protected me by hitting him with a can of soup and he hit her with a skillet. She was the only thing that stopped the beatings I would take. Until she couldnt take it anymore and she left.  So from then on it was me and my other sister taking the beatings. Until one day he beat her with a ice scrapper and bruised her leg dark blue all up and down her thigh. He never touched her again....so that left me.  I took all of it from the time I was 11 until I was 15 and one day he made threats to my mom and she finally called police and because he had guns at the house they got him out of our home.

Others don't seem to notice it, but sometimes I think they do. I do not feel a gas exiting me. I can not controll the smells, they come randomly. The frequencies of the smells varies from day to day, week to week, or month to month. 0 - 7 times a day. I don't know if this is a real smell, or me just imagining it. It where I had depression aswell as anxiety, about a year ago. The smells later became the main issue my mental health, and effected me hugely. Since 5 years ago I started worrying about my oder. But the smells didn't exist back then. I would not say that I smell bad regularly, sometimes I even get compliments about my oder, and I shower everyday. During summerbreak the smells dissapeared, but now that school is closing in they've returned. I'm not that nervous about it, it's a new school and class though. I wonder what the people on webmd thinks. Is the smells actual smells, or just in my head? I would really appreciate if someone could give their opinion on this. I would be extremely thankful, seriously. If you want to know anything more, just ask in the comments. I also excuse for putting this in the mental health section, I reallt don't know where else to put it."

I am writing this because :  1. I sometimes feel so depressed that I just don't want to get out of bed.  2. I think I am a waste of life sometimes.  3. I have very low self-esteem, I think there is none, to begin with.  4. When I talk to people, I think they have the lowest opinion of me automatically. This makes me an outcast in a group setting and couple that with my introverted nature, it is an absolute nightmare meeting new people.  5. I have severe anxiety issues, much better than what I was initially. It could be the imposter syndrome or my realization that in 1 more year I will be done with MSc and my upcoming thesis work.  6. At the moment, I feel like I don't have a purpose or a strong resolve for pushing myself and improving (which I hate absolutely, I want to get better).  7. I procrastinate a lot. I try my level best to do my responsibilities but it is very tough.  To give a little history about myself : 1. I had a very bad childhood. My parents used to compare me with the other kids in any aspect, be it sports, academics, life, etc. It was suffocating to me because I never saw the other kids as people but people I have to compete with. This created an aversion to people for me. Even with other kids who treated me well as well.  2. I used to be sexually abused when I was 11 or 12 years old by the housemaid. It is a repressed memory sort of, and I think I continued this chain of abuse (which cannot be excused). Lately, these thoughts have been coming up a lot and I don't know what to do."

Some of the vomit had little red coffee bean shaped pellets in it which I didn't think much of at the time but apparently this is a bad sign when taking Naproxen and I read that if this happens you should contact your doctor immediately. It's been 5 days and though my stomach doesn't feel 100% I've had no pains or nausea and I've been eating. Am I in danger, and should I visit a doctor?"

I am Chantale, 44 ( soon 45) from Montreal , Canada.  I come to this place, for a hint to something new. Because frankly, i am heading for depression and, i came in Montreal to fulfill my life's purpose.  Since 2013, it's a copy paste. Just to mention that i've seen doctors, specialists, but they never stumbled upon something that could be helpful. I have a very very long term constipation condition. And when i say constipation, it means no natural bowel movement at all. At all.  Before, i used to go to the emergency room to empty my bowels when it was too hard to live with. They were simply emptying me, and sent me home. Years like this. They tried all the possible medication avenue on me, including Resotran ( prucalopride) and food combination. Still, the same. If i am not having an enema, i'm not going. 3 liters of water per day, exercice, healthy eating, and we've been into the no gluten, no lactose, no this and no that, and no changes. Now, for two months, i've stopped going to the emergency room cause i was about to loose my job because of it. They would even send me home very often with a 4 liters of Peglyte ( or Golitely). I was sick for days. I became anorexic because of this, for two years. I would feel like food was just poop that would be stuck, and that i was a *** barrel. Nothing else. My life is all about this. That's a handicap, pure and simple. NOW, what's happening is that, i poop with a suppository. If i don't put it, nothing comes out. No matter how i force, the position, no matter nothing. I don't feel the need to defecate, i don't cramp, it doesn't push. I just know it's time because i get extremely cold, like it's winter inside my body, lightheaded, and passing so much gaz that it's another handicap. Now here is the interesting part. The suppository never even have the time to melt. I insert it and two minutes after, i hurt so bad , i have to go. No pushing. It comes all out, always the same: a veryyyyyyyyy long ""s ""shape smooth poop. So long, you wouldn't believe it was sitting there, right at the door...without knocking. But it is. I have no sensation in my anus when i push, as if it's dead. The suppository just induce the feeling for my anus to expulse because, the feces are right there.  I have to do it like two times a day, to avoid inconfort.  After i expulse, i feel terrible pain all over my body, i ache everywhere. It's like my skin becomes all thin, dry, my bones hurt, i feel soo soo cold....and i can feel the older poop sort of moving down, and that's why i have to insert another 4-5 hours later. Then the same amount of feces comes out.  In a way, i am and should be happy that suppositories replaced enemas. But....i don't feel better. I still feel ill and sick, every single day. I could not take the enemas anymore, it made me suicidal. Before, suppositories would not work. Now they do. The doctors were always impressed by my constipation, especially all located on the right side. And the amount of it. Several pounds. They never forget mentioning me. How a tiny person like me could have so much feces. They made me feel like an animal.  So this morning, i wake up and...im tired of the suppositories. Why is that nothing comes out, and that it's RIGHT THERE? Sitting there, that long thing. It hurts, im cold, tired, feeling weak, the pain in my body is just excruciating. I even have heart palpitations when the feces are moving inside of me, as if they touch my heart. So..why is it that a suppository that doesn't have the time to melt, makes my feces comes out in one split second, to make me feel cold , in pain ( i even had to call off work often because i was too cold or lightheaded to get out) .  My whole life is about that. I'm unhappy, so unhappy. Please someone say something."

Another posibility is maybe cancer (haha laugh at me all you want, my left tonsil has been swollen for like 5 years, after an episode of strep, the doctors wouldn't take it out because I was too old.) I have no known allergies, and no one in my family is allergic to anything, except my aunt to foods in the broccoli family. I don't have the conviction to keep a food diary, I have tried so many times. I could never say whether the symptoms hapoen after certain foods. I eat grain and dair basically everyday. I've thought maybe a hole in my intestines, but I'm sure sepsis would hospitalize me, so probably not that either. This is VERY long term. Please give thoughts, comments, personal experiences, or anything else you'd like to add. Thank you for enduring this long post."

What I don't understand is if gastritis is inflammation of stomach lining, why is my LES relaxing and causing heartburn to a point where my throat swells up everyday? Is stomach not able to send proper signals to close the LES? Or is the high pressure in stomach causing LES to relax? If not what else? Either way, will LES return to normal functioning after gastritis treatment?"

That is sad but a fact. I have been diagnosed with Chrohns Disease about 4 years ago. I was bleeding profusely from the rectum and bowel movements were up to 38 to 40 times a day. My doctor had put me on infusions of Remicade and that really helped me. I had to go back to work and could not take 4 hours every other Friday for infusions so I stopped. I tried to go holistic. What a mistake. I felt ok for almost 7 months and then wham I was in full blown relapse. I have had some surgery only to remove a mass that was in my intestine. I went back to my doctor begging for forgiveness lol. The one problem with Remicade is once you go off of it you cannot go back on. Your body builds immunity and you can also become allergic to it. For the last 3 months I have been self injecting Humira. It does not seem to work. I have been feeling so sick and eating Immodium like chicklets to get through the work day. For a week now I am lethargic and just feel so ill. I still pushed on through my week. I am so scared and really do not have anyone who really knows what this does to you to talk to. This disease is ruining my life. My doctor knows that I refuse to have the bag on. I told him the only bag they could put on me is a Prada! Mentally and emotionally I just cannot handle it. He hugged me and said he would not give up on me kid... I told him I would rather just die then do that surgery. I know it has helped a lot of people but I just cannot do this. So there is one more infusion therapy I can try but will be missing work which may lead to losing my job. I try the healthy eating and low carbs and tried low lectin diet but my pain and bathroom trips are still not manageable. Does anyone have any advice on what helped them? Humira does not seem to be working. I am exhausted all the time to the point I sleep all weekend because I feel ill."

When i Urinate or have a bowel movement, the pain reoccurs. (urinating not as much as a Bowell movement). going from a sitting to a standing position(more less the motion of turning your body to exit a car) causes it to flare and dissipate. I thought nothing of it and thought maybe after a few days it would go away. But it still persists, and seems to be getting worse. When i went to take a pee earlier today, the act of unbuttoning my pants caused the pain too. I'm starting to get concerned. Could this be a swollen prostate? appendix related maybe?

I used to drink coffee everyday, but now I can not tolerate a single cup. Alcohol is the same, I can not tolerate a couple of beers. - When I eat certain foods I get flatulence, which can smell pretty bad. I can't pinpoint what foods but I know ice cream is one of them. - When I drink certain beverages, especially water, alcohol, and coffee I have to urinate very frequently, sometimes every hour throughout the day. I have recently tried drinking sole with lemon (Himalayan salt and lemon with water) and have noticed a lot of the symptoms decrease. But the once I stop, they come back.

This has been going on for over a month now, and I have had 4 doctor visits. I've had three blood tests, a CT scan, an upper and lower ultrasound, and had a female exam. Nothing was found to be the cause of my pain, and I am not old enough to get insurance for a PCP or GI, so essentially I have to wait until something really bad happens. My stools have been yellow in color and small. I've had constipation on and off, sometimes lasting over a week (and when I had it nothing could cure it, no food, folk remedy, laxative, or enema made a difference.) The pain feels as though it radiates into my hip bone and leg, and sometimes my entire right side hurts. I am unsure if pain relievers work because I've been taking them closer to bedtime if I do. No food seems to make it worse or better, nor does a hot pack help. Physical activity doesn't make a difference. I'd really appreciate any answers people might have.

I started seeing a therapist and things were going well until I moved to New Zealand for 6 months in June of last year. I was attending university there for a semester, and the party culture got the best of me and I began drinking pretty heavily (20+ drinks per week easily). I also noticed my depression got much worse while I was there since I was no longer seeing my therapist, or so I thought. After I left, I traveled around southeast Asia for about a month where I fist developed signs of what was later diagnosed as severe anxiety. I was in and out of hospitals all throughout my time in Asia thinking I had a serious medical problem, but every hospital I visited told me the same thing, which is that it is in fact anxiety. When I came back home in January of this year, I spent a lot of time trying to accept that the crazy physical symptoms I was experiencing was in fact anxiety and not something more serious. Fast forward to today, my depression has gotten noticeably better after I began seeing my therapist again, who suggested I see a medical doctor to prescribe me antidepressants. However, the physical symptoms of my anxiety (heart palpitations, dizziness, confusion, sleep problems, severe heartburn and nausea, pins and needles feeling in hands and feet, numbness in limbs and a feeling of a shock or zap throughout my body) have continued to bother me. So, after going back to my general health doctor and asking if theres anything she could do for me, she recommended I see a psychiatrist. Within the first five minuets of talking to this psychiatrist, she immediately told me that all of these symptoms are a direct result of my alcohol consumption, and that I am an alcoholic going through withdraws. Now, I am 21 and a college student and still consume around 20+ drinks a week, but I know plenty of people who drink way more than I do and have never experienced anything close to what I experience on a daily basis. She did make some good points about the effects of consuming alcohol while on antidepressants and just the general affect alcohol has on the body, but she even claimed that my depression was a result of my ""alcoholism,"" even after I told her that I was depressed long before I started drinking heavily. I just feel like she really didn't take my situation as seriously as I was hoping, and I just wanted to see if anybody here struggling with depression/anxiety are avid drinkers and know that their mental health struggles are not a result of their drinking? Are these symptoms actually common symptoms of alcoholism, even though nearly all of my peers drink just as much as I do? Any input on this would be greatly appreciated."

So my doc gave me lactulose and said ""take as much as you need to go"" well I didnt know what enough was so I started taking up to 18 tbspns at a time every day. Then after almost a year of that, I started taking 1 cup of peglyte and 4 sennakot in morning and 4 at night. Every single day. I dont know wth I was thinking..IM so stupid!...anyway...so I eventually lost ability to go even with that. I only go one little amount..and then everything else is left over..even if i take a whole bottle of lactulose..ill only have initial release..then nothing else....   Ive had colonoscoy..and dr said everything is fine...ive since dropped laxatives significantly..I am now only taking 4 tbspns at night...but Im having these major issues: - Constant bloating - non-stop gas build up in lower stomache (almost like pressure building and popping, but no flatulence) - Passing of gas when I move in certain positions eg. (when i lay on my side for a few minutes, then turn over, i pass gas every time) - incomplete bowel movements ever single time. - acid reflux sometimes, gas pains - Crunching, popping feeling in gut   Now, after extensive research and everything seeming to fail..i think i might have figured it out... I MUST have completley stripped my intestinal flora.. i have no idea why the gastroenterologist didnt mention this to me. But I have a feeling that this is whats wrong with me. I hope anyway, because i have tried everything and nothing has worked...and i cant get a diagnoses...they alwasy say ""its the methadone""..bnut its not! Ive had opiate constipation..this is NOT it....Im not even constipated. I got almost every morning..,Its the constant symptoms ive listed....   Can anyone chime in on this and give me some advice? Maybe how i can restore flora..etc?   Much appreciate any help at all.. Thanks."

The reason I’ll wait for two weeks more is that I have exams. Tbh honest what if I don't have depression. What if I’m just dramatic. What if they said I’m just stressed with school.

I started taking it after postpartum panic attacks showed up out of nowhere. Unfortunately, the doc that saw me did not warn me about the issues of being on the medication for such a long time – I was a young teen mom who did not know the dangers of this until a few years later after someone sued him for malpractice and had to leave the practice. Over the years I have tired to ween off the med but most of the time I was given some kind of anti-depressant or another - ALL of which sent me into multiple cases of serotonin syndrome and required the need for hospitalization EACH time. The weening had always failed. Fast forward a few years to last year - my doc of 2 years simply left her practice without any notice whatsoever and I was left scrambling to find a new one. Eventually I located the only Doc ( an NP) within a 40 mile radius that was taking new patients and could see me without having to wait 6 months for an appointment. The first appointment this past October was HORIBBLE. I was belittled and made to feel horrible by her about my Klonopin dosage - so much so that I left her office crying for hours and hours (but with a new RX script). She was reported to my insurance company (THEY made me give them details and file when I simply called them for a list of docs in my area who took my insurance and they learned what had happened) but nothing came of it. I had to see her 3 months later though, because AGAIN, I could see no one else for months. When my next and most recent appointment came up last month I was questioned about the report made as I sat there disoriented with the flu and the 105 degree temp that tagged along with it. I was so out of it but I remember telling her that my anxiety and panic disorders were MUCH WORSE when sick. By the time I left, she had refilled my regular 1mg tab, 3 times a day script for ONLY ONE month and it was agreed that I would start AGAIN to ween off the medication the next month. A few days ago my husband picked up my RX. I didn't see it until yesterday but when I DID, it alarmed me. Rather than weening off the med SLOWLY from 1mg 3 times a day, the bottle had only 45 pills instead of the normal 90 pills in it with these EXACT directions: 'Take one tablet by mouth twice a day for 2 weeks, then take one-half tablet by mouth two times a day for 2 weeks, then stop.'  I began FREAKING out! I called the pharmacist who said that this cannot be done! I have been on a pretty high dose for over a DECADE and it would take a LOT longer than a month to ween off of it. She suggested I contact my Dr.'s office, which I did and was told the directions would NOT change and the few pills I have now were ALL i was ever going to get EVER, so I better follow the directions for best results in my weening process. I had my mom come over and she helped me make calls all over town trying to find out if this was safe or not (which I know darn well without being told that it is NOT). We called so many doctors looking to get me in somewhere else but there was NOTHING! No one could offer up any advice short of going to the ER (at this point I was well-into my 8th panic attack inside of 2 hours and each one was worse than the last.) My family doc refused to even deal with assisting me in advice. (Now, just a bit of side info needed to help you fully understand everything a bit clearer: this past July I had major surgery which I woke up in the middle of and now have severe anxiety, nightmares and PTSD over. 2 weeks after that I was sent to the ER for dehydration from the stomach bug but rather than giving me a nausea med IV, I was given an anti-psychotic that messed me up beyond horrible (I spent 12 following hours sitting in the cold shower screaming hysterically as it felt like my brain was on fire) and because of the 2 hospital incidents I have now developed a mild but serious degree of agoraphobia. The only 2 times I have left my home in 9 months were to see this NP and I had to be VERY sedated to do so. Also, the manufacturer of the brand of Klonopin I had been on for over 11 years was bought out by a different company who changed the medication formula completely and now the med is only about as HALF as effective (at most) as the discontinued brand, but needed nonetheless- I have tried 4 other manufactures brands but they all caused their own issues and bad side-effects from what I am told from my doc, is the inactive ingredients that can and DO completely change how a med can work in a person, especially for someone who is hyper-sensitive to meds like myself. I have a laundry list of health problems: type 1 diabetes with severe nerve damage in over 75% of my body (including the inability to feel or move any part of my body from the knees down), 2 heart conditions & a pacemaker, high blood pressure, insomnia since 3 years old, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Diabetic Gastroenteritis. other causes of PTSD, and Seizures just to name a few and I just turned 30 last month.   Right now I am terrified, to put it mildly, and I have NO idea what to do, who to talk to, or anything really. My hours of freaking out earlier have mentally exhausted me but I am too restless for sleep or rest – I have and have had pure adrenaline coursing through me all day and I feel like I'm in some sort of 'brain fog' mentally. I am terrified despite how much I try to convince myself otherwise, that I am going, or soon will go, crazy, have a permanent breakdown or will feel horrible like this for a long time, if not forever. I saw a therapist for 8 years and it really didn't do much. My husband does not understand much of what I'm going through, my mother has a lot of medical issues of her own she is having to deal with and I have ZERO friends to talk to. Nothing helps me chill out and relax and I have both desperately and wholeheartedly tried almost everything from yoga, exercise, walking in the fresh air (I physically can not run with my Footdrop), TRYING to learn & practice meditation (but only epically failing), journaling, CBD oil and Hemp oil, prayer, SO MANY self-help and workbooks, listening to relaxing sounds or deep theta binaural beats/sound waves, various hobbies (adult coloring books, candle making, etc.), aromatherapy, and so-on. What am I supposed to do about the 'weening so fast off Klonopin' thing? Currently, I am having 3-4 panic attacks per hour, insomnia (up for 77 hours now), random feelings of intense fear and crying, tremors, heart palpitations, high blood pressure and so-on. I need all the GOOD advice I can get right now, no trolling. Thanks for taking the time to read this and hopefully reply kindly to.

Over the years I have tired to ween off the med but most of the time I was given some kind of anti-depressant or another - ALL of which sent me into multiple cases of serotonin syndrome and required the need for hospitalization EACH time. The weening had always failed. Fast forward a few years to last year - my doc of 2 years simply left her practice without any notice whatsoever and I was left scrambling to find a new one. Eventually I located the only Doc ( an NP) within a 40 mile radius that was taking new patients and could see me without having to wait 6 months for an appointment. The first appointment this past October was HORIBBLE. I was belittled and made to feel horrible by her about my Klonopin dosage - so much so that I left her office crying for hours and hours (but with a new RX script). She was reported to my insurance company (THEY made me give them details and file when I simply called them for a list of docs in my area who took my insurance and they learned what had happened) but nothing came of it. I had to see her 3 months later though, because AGAIN, I could see no one else for months. When my next and most recent appointment came up last month I was questioned about the report made as I sat there disoriented with the flu and the 105 degree temp that tagged along with it. I was so out of it but I remember telling her that my anxiety and panic disorders were MUCH WORSE when sick. By the time I left, she had refilled my regular 1mg tab, 3 times a day script for ONLY ONE month and it was agreed that I would start AGAIN to ween off the medication the next month. A few days ago my husband picked up my RX. I didn't see it until yesterday but when I DID, it alarmed me. Rather than weening off the med SLOWLY from 1mg 3 times a day, the bottle had only 45 pills instead of the normal 90 pills in it with these EXACT directions: 'Take one tablet by mouth twice a day for 2 weeks, then take one-half tablet by mouth two times a day for 2 weeks, then stop.'  I began FREAKING out! I called the pharmacist who said that this cannot be done! I have been on a pretty high dose for over a DECADE and it would take a LOT longer than a month to ween off of it. She suggested I contact my Dr.'s office, which I did and was told the directions would NOT change and the few pills I have now were ALL i was ever going to get EVER, so I better follow the directions for best results in my weening process. I had my mom come over and she helped me make calls all over town trying to find out if this was safe or not (which I know darn well without being told that it is NOT). We called so many doctors looking to get me in somewhere else but there was NOTHING! No one could offer up any advice short of going to the ER (at this point I was well-into my 8th panic attack inside of 2 hours and each one was worse than the last.) My family doc refused to even deal with assisting me in advice. (Now, just a bit of side info needed to help you fully understand everything a bit clearer: this past July I had major surgery which I woke up in the middle of and now have severe anxiety, nightmares and PTSD over. 2 weeks after that I was sent to the ER for dehydration from the stomach bug but rather than giving me a nausea med IV, I was given an anti-psychotic that messed me up beyond horrible (I spent 12 following hours sitting in the cold shower screaming hysterically as it felt like my brain was on fire) and because of the 2 hospital incidents I have now developed a mild but serious degree of agoraphobia. The only 2 times I have left my home in 9 months were to see this NP and I had to be VERY sedated to do so. Also, the manufacturer of the brand of Klonopin I had been on for over 11 years was bought out by a different company who changed the medication formula completely and now the med is only about as HALF as effective (at most) as the discontinued brand, but needed nonetheless- I have tried 4 other manufactures brands but they all caused their own issues and bad side-effects from what I am told from my doc, is the inactive ingredients that can and DO completely change how a med can work in a person, especially for someone who is hyper-sensitive to meds like myself. I have a laundry list of health problems: type 1 diabetes with severe nerve damage in over 75% of my body (including the inability to feel or move any part of my body from the knees down), 2 heart conditions & a pacemaker, high blood pressure, insomnia since 3 years old, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Diabetic Gastroenteritis. other causes of PTSD, and Seizures just to name a few and I just turned 30 last month.   Right now I am terrified, to put it mildly, and I have NO idea what to do, who to talk to, or anything really. My hours of freaking out earlier have mentally exhausted me but I am too restless for sleep or rest – I have and have had pure adrenaline coursing through me all day and I feel like I'm in some sort of 'brain fog' mentally. I am terrified despite how much I try to convince myself otherwise, that I am going, or soon will go, crazy, have a permanent breakdown or will feel horrible like this for a long time, if not forever. I saw a therapist for 8 years and it really didn't do much. My husband does not understand much of what I'm going through, my mother has a lot of medical issues of her own she is having to deal with and I have ZERO friends to talk to. Nothing helps me chill out and relax and I have both desperately and wholeheartedly tried almost everything from yoga, exercise, walking in the fresh air (I physically can not run with my Footdrop), TRYING to learn & practice meditation (but only epically failing), journaling, CBD oil and Hemp oil, prayer, SO MANY self-help and workbooks, listening to relaxing sounds or deep theta binaural beats/sound waves, various hobbies (adult coloring books, candle making, etc.), aromatherapy, and so-on. What am I supposed to do about the 'weening so fast off Klonopin' thing? Currently, I am having 3-4 panic attacks per hour, insomnia (up for 77 hours now), random feelings of intense fear and crying, tremors, heart palpitations, high blood pressure and so-on. I need all the GOOD advice I can get right now, no trolling. Thanks for taking the time to read this and hopefully reply kindly to. I am beginning to have the start of another panic attack again right now as I type this......."

The only 2 times I have left my home in 9 months were to see this NP and I had to be VERY sedated to do so. Also, the manufacturer of the brand of Klonopin I had been on for over 11 years was bought out by a different company who changed the medication formula completely and now the med is only about as HALF as effective (at most) as the discontinued brand, but needed nonetheless- I have tried 4 other manufactures brands but they all caused their own issues and bad side-effects from what I am told from my doc, is the inactive ingredients that can and DO completely change how a med can work in a person, especially for someone who is hyper-sensitive to meds like myself. I have a laundry list of health problems: type 1 diabetes with severe nerve damage in over 75% of my body (including the inability to feel or move any part of my body from the knees down), 2 heart conditions & a pacemaker, high blood pressure, insomnia since 3 years old, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Diabetic Gastroenteritis. other causes of PTSD, and Seizures just to name a few and I just turned 30 last month.   Right now I am terrified, to put it mildly, and I have NO idea what to do, who to talk to, or anything really. My hours of freaking out earlier have mentally exhausted me but I am too restless for sleep or rest – I have and have had pure adrenaline coursing through me all day and I feel like I'm in some sort of 'brain fog' mentally. I am terrified despite how much I try to convince myself otherwise, that I am going, or soon will go, crazy, have a permanent breakdown or will feel horrible like this for a long time, if not forever. I saw a therapist for 8 years and it really didn't do much. My husband does not understand much of what I'm going through, my mother has a lot of medical issues of her own she is having to deal with and I have ZERO friends to talk to. Nothing helps me chill out and relax and I have both desperately and wholeheartedly tried almost everything from yoga, exercise, walking in the fresh air (I physically can not run with my Footdrop), TRYING to learn & practice meditation (but only epically failing), journaling, CBD oil and Hemp oil, prayer, SO MANY self-help and workbooks, listening to relaxing sounds or deep theta binaural beats/sound waves, various hobbies (adult coloring books, candle making, etc.), aromatherapy, and so-on. What am I supposed to do about the 'weening so fast off Klonopin' thing? Currently, I am having 3-4 panic attacks per hour, insomnia (up for 77 hours now), random feelings of intense fear and crying, tremors, heart palpitations, high blood pressure and so-on. I need all the GOOD advice I can get right now, no trolling. Thanks for taking the time to read this and hopefully reply kindly to. I am beginning to have the start of another panic attack again right now as I type this......."

I started taking it after postpartum panic attacks showed up out of nowhere. Unfortunately, the doc that saw me did not warn me about the issues of being on the medication for such a long time – I was a young teen mom who did not know the dangers of this until a few years later after someone sued him for malpractice and had to leave the practice. Over the years I have tired to ween off the med but most of the time I was given some kind of anti-depressant or another - ALL of which sent me into multiple cases of serotonin syndrome and required the need for hospitalization EACH time. The weening had always failed. Fast forward a few years to last year - my doc of 2 years simply left her practice without any notice whatsoever and I was left scrambling to find a new one. Eventually I located the only Doc ( an NP) within a 40 mile radius that was taking new patients and could see me without having to wait 6 months for an appointment. The first appointment this past October was HORIBBLE. I was belittled and made to feel horrible by her about my Klonopin dosage - so much so that I left her office crying for hours and hours (but with a new RX script). She was reported to my insurance company (THEY made me give them details and file when I simply called them for a list of docs in my area who took my insurance and they learned what had happened) but nothing came of it. I had to see her 3 months later though, because AGAIN, I could see no one else for months. When my next and most recent appointment came up last month I was questioned about the report made as I sat there disoriented with the flu and the 105 degree temp that tagged along with it. I was so out of it but I remember telling her that my anxiety and panic disorders were MUCH WORSE when sick. By the time I left, she had refilled my regular 1mg tab, 3 times a day script for ONLY ONE month and it was agreed that I would start AGAIN to ween off the medication the next month. A few days ago my husband picked up my RX. I didn't see it until yesterday but when I DID, it alarmed me. Rather than weening off the med SLOWLY from 1mg 3 times a day, the bottle had only 45 pills instead of the normal 90 pills in it with these EXACT directions: 'Take one tablet by mouth twice a day for 2 weeks, then take one-half tablet by mouth two times a day for 2 weeks, then stop.'  I began FREAKING out! I called the pharmacist who said that this cannot be done! I have been on a pretty high dose for over a DECADE and it would take a LOT longer than a month to ween off of it. She suggested I contact my Dr.'s office, which I did and was told the directions would NOT change and the few pills I have now were ALL i was ever going to get EVER, so I better follow the directions for best results in my weening process. I had my mom come over and she helped me make calls all over town trying to find out if this was safe or not (which I know darn well without being told that it is NOT). We called so many doctors looking to get me in somewhere else but there was NOTHING! No one could offer up any advice short of going to the ER (at this point I was well-into my 8th panic attack inside of 2 hours and each one was worse than the last.)

I started taking it after postpartum panic attacks showed up out of nowhere. Unfortunately, the doc that saw me did not warn me about the issues of being on the medication for such a long time – I was a young teen mom who did not know the dangers of this until a few years later after someone sued him for malpractice and had to leave the practice. Over the years I have tired to ween off the med but most of the time I was given some kind of anti-depressant or another - ALL of which sent me into multiple cases of serotonin syndrome and required the need for hospitalization EACH time. The weening had always failed. Fast forward a few years to last year - my doc of 2 years simply left her practice without any notice whatsoever and I was left scrambling to find a new one. Eventually I located the only Doc ( an NP) within a 40 mile radius that was taking new patients and could see me without having to wait 6 months for an appointment. The first appointment this past October was HORIBBLE. I was belittled and made to feel horrible by her about my Klonopin dosage - so much so that I left her office crying for hours and hours (but with a new RX script). She was reported to my insurance company (THEY made me give them details and file when I simply called them for a list of docs in my area who took my insurance and they learned what had happened) but nothing came of it. I had to see her 3 months later though, because AGAIN, I could see no one else for months. When my next and most recent appointment came up last month I was questioned about the report made as I sat there disoriented with the flu and the 105 degree temp that tagged along with it. I was so out of it but I remember telling her that my anxiety and panic disorders were MUCH WORSE when sick. By the time I left, she had refilled my regular 1mg tab, 3 times a day script for ONLY ONE month and it was agreed that I would start AGAIN to ween off the medication the next month. A few days ago my husband picked up my RX. I didn't see it until yesterday but when I DID, it alarmed me. Rather than weening off the med SLOWLY from 1mg 3 times a day, the bottle had only 45 pills instead of the normal 90 pills in it with these EXACT directions: 'Take one tablet by mouth twice a day for 2 weeks, then take one-half tablet by mouth two times a day for 2 weeks, then stop.'  I began FREAKING out! I called the pharmacist who said that this cannot be done! I have been on a pretty high dose for over a DECADE and it would take a LOT longer than a month to ween off of it. She suggested I contact my Dr.'s office, which I did and was told the directions would NOT change and the few pills I have now were ALL i was ever going to get EVER, so I better follow the directions for best results in my weening process. I had my mom come over and she helped me make calls all over town trying to find out if this was safe or not (which I know darn well without being told that it is NOT). We called so many doctors looking to get me in somewhere else but there was NOTHING! No one could offer up any advice short of going to the ER (at this point I was well-into my 8th panic attack inside of 2 hours and each one was worse than the last.) My family doc refused to even deal with assisting me in advice. (Now, just a bit of side info needed to help you fully understand everything a bit clearer: this past July I had major surgery which I woke up in the middle of and now have severe anxiety, nightmares and PTSD over. 2 weeks after that I was sent to the ER for dehydration from the stomach bug but rather than giving me a nausea med IV, I was given an anti-psychotic that messed me up beyond horrible (I spent 12 following hours sitting in the cold shower screaming hysterically as it felt like my brain was on fire) and because of the 2 hospital incidents I have now developed a mild but serious degree of agoraphobia. The only 2 times I have left my home in 9 months were to see this NP and I had to be VERY sedated to do so. Also, the manufacturer of the brand of Klonopin I had been on for over 11 years was bought out by a different company who changed the medication formula completely and now the med is only about as HALF as effective (at most) as the discontinued brand, but needed nonetheless- I have tried 4 other manufactures brands but they all caused their own issues and bad side-effects from what I am told from my doc, is the inactive ingredients that can and DO completely change how a med can work in a person, especially for someone who is hyper-sensitive to meds like myself. I have a laundry list of health problems: type 1 diabetes with severe nerve damage in over 75% of my body (including the inability to feel or move any part of my body from the knees down), 2 heart conditions & a pacemaker, high blood pressure, insomnia since 3 years old, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Diabetic Gastroenteritis. other causes of PTSD, and Seizures just to name a few and I just turned 30 last month.   Right now I am terrified, to put it mildly, and I have NO idea what to do, who to talk to, or anything really. My hours of freaking out earlier have mentally exhausted me but I am too restless for sleep or rest – I have and have had pure adrenaline coursing through me all day and I feel like I'm in some sort of 'brain fog' mentally. I am terrified despite how much I try to convince myself otherwise, that I am going, or soon will go, crazy, have a permanent breakdown or will feel horrible like this for a long time, if not forever. I saw a therapist for 8 years and it really didn't do much. My husband does not understand much of what I'm going through, my mother has a lot of medical issues of her own she is having to deal with and I have ZERO friends to talk to. Nothing helps me chill out and relax and I have both desperately and wholeheartedly tried almost everything from yoga, exercise, walking in the fresh air (I physically can not run with my Footdrop), TRYING to learn & practice meditation (but only epically failing), journaling, CBD oil and Hemp oil, prayer, SO MANY self-help and workbooks, listening to relaxing sounds or deep theta binaural beats/sound waves, various hobbies (adult coloring books, candle making, etc.), aromatherapy, and so-on. What am I supposed to do about the 'weening so fast off Klonopin' thing? Currently, I am having 3-4 panic attacks per hour, insomnia (up for 77 hours now), random feelings of intense fear and crying, tremors, heart palpitations, high blood pressure and so-on.

I’m here because I don't have supportive people around me. Sorry for my bad English first. I’m 17(12th grade). My mental health is worse than ever and even everyday tasks are hard for me like taking a shower, cleaning my room and brushing my hair etc. My school grades keep getting worse too I don't want to study or go to school but I have to force myself though. I have really low self-esteem. My appetite increased and I hate myself every time I eat. Nothing can make me happy. At some point I think to end it all but I know it's wrong. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to tell my parents about it I don't want to be a burden. I’ll end up just feeling guilty."

The band member grabbed my phone when I told him I didn't have the money that was in his either signed or unsigned contract, because we didn't make enough money at the door. He ran inside and threw my phoned as I was chasing him deciding whether I should hit him or grab him, knowing me, the none fighting type I would've grabbed him. But he swung at me as I tripped over a table, and he landed a punch on my left eye hitting my glasses into my eye socket, leaving me on my back on the floor. We knocked over a garbage can full of beer bottles and he was on top of me and I was afraid he was gonna pick up a beer bottle and smash my head with it. Well his friends grabbed him off of me. I called the police and they let him go, and I had to work at the same place the next night with a black and blue eye. The nightmares began that night, and I still have nightmares about it, and panic attacks about it till this day. I wish it would be resolved."

I've been having a problem lately. I had some light diarrhea before a date (nerves, not weird for me), so I took Imodium. I ended up taking more, maybe too much- Four that day. I didn't go again for a few days, and when I did, all I did was pass some bloody mucus. The next day, I started passing ACTUAL stool with the mucus (which after a while stopped having any blood in it, so that's a plus I guess). The stool was fine and normal, but causes horrible pain on my lower abdominal when its going down. I noticed this was the only time when I was in pain (although between BMs I'll feel awfully crampy and achy, but the next day I felt pretty good since I was ""empty"" and hadn't eaten a single thing, so nothing was moving through that ""problem area"") So here I am afraid to eat, so I haven't. What could this be? Could the constipation from all that Imodium have jump started something? I'm pretty normal otherwise; No actual diarrhea just regular stool and mucus, no fever, no nausea, no vomiting, my appetite is fine (oh god I want to eat), perfectly hydrated. I wanted to make an appointment with my doctor, but he's out of town (middle of nowhere, so I have to wait) I've gotten mixed results in my results, a few people suggested to me it could be an anal fissure, but I thought those were just like cuts more closer to the opening? It's my lower abdominal that hurts."

I'm 18 years old male with a long-lasting problem that I'm very hopeful you can give me some advice on. Here's how it went. About 2 years ago I've noticed cracked skin on my hand. Since then it's always cracking more with the exception of when I apply an ointment to it, after which it heals the skin for a bit. If it matters, ointment that I use is a local one with galipot as it's core component. About half year ago I did some tests on the matter: complete blood count, biochemical blood analysis, syphilis blood test, several different urine tests. Only values out of the norm on the result of these tests were AST and ALT activity level: 106 for AST, 196 for ALT. I then went for an ultrasound examination that have found me to have cholecystitis, with only other unusual notes being that bile echogenicity is slightly increased and there is a bend in the bottom part of the gallbladder, no stones or anything else unusual was detected. I also did test for HIV, Hepatitis A, B and C. All results were negative. Around 4 months ago, a noticable activity started taking place under my right part of the ribs: sometimes there's something moving or contracting, also a general feeling of tension around this area. There were no acute pains for that whole period. Since then the state of the skin on my hand was only getting worse in proportion to discomfort under my rib. Then around 3 months ago I started the following course of treatment in hopes of curing cholecystitis assuming it's the only problem: Allochol - 1 tablet after a meal 3 times a day; Silymarin(Silybum Marianum) 140mg - 1 capsule 3 times a day; Drotaverine - 200mg distributed for 3 times a day; Pancreatin - 2 tablets with a meal 3 times a day; I did that for a week and it was the first time the skin on my hand was getting healed on its own without the use of ointment. The feeling under the rib also got better, tension was gone and there were little to no contractions or any signs of movement. I then took a break for about a week and the symptoms began to return. After I noticed that, I returned to the same treatment plan, but this time it didn't seem to help that much after a week, discomfort considering skin and the tension around liver was slowing down but wasn't completely reversed this time. But I was adviced that it requires couple of months of this kind of treatment to take effect, so after a similar break of about a week I started taking these medications again, only this time plan was a little different: Allochol - 1 tablet after a meal 3 times a day; Silymarin(Silybum Marianum) 140mg - 1 capsule in the morning; Drotaverine - 120-240mg only when there are noticeable contractions at gallbladder area; Pancreatin - 1-2 tablets with tougher meals; After 1.5 weeks of this, the effect, again, was little and symptoms were only slowing down a bit. I did this for another 3 times, 1.5 weeks each, with around a week in between each. Each iteration it seemed like it was helping less and less, and definitely didn't seem like it was on the way of completely reversing the symptoms like it seemed initially. The general pattern is that under no medications my hand skin and area under the rib are in a very tough state, and with these medications its only about half as bad. Symptoms at current point in time consist of: general constant feel of tension, contractions or movement, sometimes burning - all that regarding area under my right part of the ribs, also rarely all of these symptoms can be felt in my chest for a small amount of time after which they return under the rib. I only had one noticeable bit of acute pain at gallbladder area in this whole period of time 2 weeks ago. The state of my hand skin correlates directly with discomfort under the rib. It cracks from time to time and when it does it also burns and itches. When I'm taking Drotaverine there are little contractions or any kind of movement, but it comes back if I don't take it. Other drugs on that list relieve general constant feel of tension and sometimes occuring burning under the rib. But they're still there, only little less while taking them. Overall, I don't seem to be heading on my way to recovery at all with current actions. So far it is only getting worse and I'm not even sure that cholecystitis is the only problem here. What would your professional advice be in this situation? Please help and I will be eternally grateful to you."

But I was adviced that it requires couple of months of this kind of treatment to take effect, so after a similar break of about a week I started taking these medications again, only this time plan was a little different: Allochol - 1 tablet after a meal 3 times a day; Silymarin(Silybum Marianum) 140mg - 1 capsule in the morning; Drotaverine - 120-240mg only when there are noticeable contractions at gallbladder area; Pancreatin - 1-2 tablets with tougher meals; After 1.5 weeks of this, the effect, again, was little and symptoms were only slowing down a bit. I did this for another 3 times, 1.5 weeks each, with around a week in between each. Each iteration it seemed like it was helping less and less, and definitely didn't seem like it was on the way of completely reversing the symptoms like it seemed initially. The general pattern is that under no medications my hand skin and area under the rib are in a very tough state, and with these medications its only about half as bad. Symptoms at current point in time consist of: general constant feel of tension, contractions or movement, sometimes burning - all that regarding area under my right part of the ribs, also rarely all of these symptoms can be felt in my chest for a small amount of time after which they return under the rib. I only had one noticeable bit of acute pain at gallbladder area in this whole period of time 2 weeks ago. The state of my hand skin correlates directly with discomfort under the rib. It cracks from time to time and when it does it also burns and itches. When I'm taking Drotaverine there are little contractions or any kind of movement, but it comes back if I don't take it. Other drugs on that list relieve general constant feel of tension and sometimes occuring burning under the rib. But they're still there, only little less while taking them. Overall, I don't seem to be heading on my way to recovery at all with current actions. So far it is only getting worse and I'm not even sure that cholecystitis is the only problem here. What would your professional advice be in this situation? Please help and I will be eternally grateful to you."

I'm 18 years old male with a long-lasting problem that I'm very hopeful you can give me some advice on. Here's how it went. About 2 years ago I've noticed cracked skin on my hand. Since then it's always cracking more with the exception of when I apply an ointment to it, after which it heals the skin for a bit. If it matters, ointment that I use is a local one with galipot as it's core component. About half year ago I did some tests on the matter: complete blood count, biochemical blood analysis, syphilis blood test, several different urine tests. Only values out of the norm on the result of these tests were AST and ALT activity level: 106 for AST, 196 for ALT. I then went for an ultrasound examination that have found me to have cholecystitis, with only other unusual notes being that bile echogenicity is slightly increased and there is a bend in the bottom part of the gallbladder, no stones or anything else unusual was detected. I also did test for HIV, Hepatitis A, B and C. All results were negative. Around 4 months ago, a noticable activity started taking place under my right part of the ribs: sometimes there's something moving or contracting, also a general feeling of tension around this area. There were no acute pains for that whole period. Since then the state of the skin on my hand was only getting worse in proportion to discomfort under my rib. Then around 3 months ago I started the following course of treatment in hopes of curing cholecystitis assuming it's the only problem: Allochol - 1 tablet after a meal 3 times a day; Silymarin(Silybum Marianum) 140mg - 1 capsule 3 times a day; Drotaverine - 200mg distributed for 3 times a day; Pancreatin - 2 tablets with a meal 3 times a day; I did that for a week and it was the first time the skin on my hand was getting healed on its own without the use of ointment.

I’m sure I have that too. I need support because I need to separate myself from someone that has caused me a lot of pain and trauma. I decided that I wanted to separate myself from any communication with him because it almost caused me to kill myself and I don’t deserve the pain and trauma that he was putting me through. I love him and always will, I’ll never be with anyone else but I don’t deserve to be tortured like he has done in the past. I never once did anything to deserve the trauma and pain he put me through. I just need support during this time because he is the love of my life so this isn’t something that I want but it needs to be done. I just need support right now.  Thank you -Sheena"

I was pretty depressed, still am. So I came to know about a site on internet that lets you make friends. And so I registered there, behavior there was a lot like dating sites. You don't get any replies if you're below average looking and no initial messages if you aren't girl or extremely good-looking. I realized how much looks matter even for having some friend. This is got me even more depressed, I removed my photo and put anime avatar as display picture. And somehow managed to find 2 friends. I was talking to them daily while still looking for other friends as I couldn't talk to them much because of time differences or because of them already having other tons of friends. I uploaded my pics again for some reason I don't know. After texting 100 people I would get a reply of 1. Mostly would just disappear after 1 reply, some talking so less or taking so long in reply that you lose interest and just give up. Even if I somehow find someone who talks to me, its always has to be me to start to conversation It was like ""I message them, they reply. I don't, they don't."" I hate it and so I never found anyone to talk to other than those 2. Now I'm used to losing friends so I have experience. I know we get hurt when things don't go to our expectations. I've trained myself to not expect what's not in reach. And so I didn't expect that my friendship with those 2 would last forever but I still expected to last it some months and it ended even before that. Now I'm so depressed, this is reality of me for finding friends. I can see the reason why I'm single since birth. I don't see myself anywhere in future either. I don't know if this life is even worth living. I don't remember last time I smiled, felt genuine happiness or even had fun. I'm 16 turning 17 this year and I have been suicidal for last 1 and a half year. The only thing that keeps me going is the fear of after-life. I'm Agnostic and I'm not sure whether there is one or not. What's in it for me, what if it's worse. and I don't want it even if it's heaven. So the only thing I can say I'm alive for is hope that someday human-hibernation would be in my reach so I would be able to hibernate myself for eternity. And I also don't know why I'm posting all this here, I just wanted to say it. Also I'm pessimistic and know the reality and facts so crap like ""Your matter. Looks don't matter bla bla"" does not help me or even put a smile on my face. I don't know what could anyone say that would help me in any way."

Findings: Following the IV administration of radio pharmaceutical, anterior abdominal imaging was performed for 60 minutes. There was appearance of activity in the gallbladder by 10 minutes. Common duct and bowel activity was also present at 10 minutes. Gallbladder contractility was assessed with an Ensure fatty meal. Following the fatty meal, there was progressive gallbladder contraction with calculated ejection fraction of 66%. Patient described nausea following the fatty meal administration.  Impression: No evidence of common or cystic biliary ductal obstruction.  Normal gallbladder contraction with ejection fraction 66%. Can someone help me understand what all this means?  Thank you!"

I was dealing with it, and never really looked into it, or changed my eating habits. On Saturday however, I woke up with a tightness in my whole chest, which was made better by lying down. I tried to eat something in the afternoon that day and about 10 minutes after I ate the food I had indigestion. I took 2 tums and an ibuprofen for the chest tightness and went to sleep till about 7-8 p.m., when I woke up I had 2 slices of pizza and went back to sleep for the night. The next morning I woke up with no chest pain but my stomach was growling way more than usual. Over the past few days, except for this morning, I woke up and my stomach was rumbling. I seem to have indigestion after every meal and my stool is a very light brown almost orangish color and smells very foul. I have been trying to eat smaller portions throughout the day but it seems my stomach gets more gassy after every meal I eat.

Throughout these many years he has tried many different medications, all have worked to some extent or another BUT all have ended up making him sick. Why? This is because he has a rare allergy to an ingredient that is found in a lot of common pill-form medicines. The exact name escapes me at this moment but I think it's something along the lines of Titanium Dioxide. These medications always end up getting him bladder infections.  Just in the last year he was suggested Xyrem by doctor, and as far as I know, it did help him to control his sleeping and he got better for a short period of time, however ... after a couple of months this medicine ended up getting him horribly depressed (part of the known side effects I am guessing) and he has actually had to go on anti-depressants. Unfortunately, the anti-depressants have had minimal effect in out-weighing the Xyrem. He has been struggling for the better part of the last 6 or 7 months with his narcolepsy, Xyrem and his anti-depressants. Nothing seems to work for him and he cannot seem to break himself from the funk he is currently in. The drugs together seem to be turning him into a zombie. As far as I know, he's already seen a couple of different doctors regarding the situation, but I have no idea how those visits have gone. I am fearful for his mental health at this point and am wondering if anyone else has any experience with a situation like this?  Does anyone know any good specialists in the surrounding Columbus OH area? Any kind of vitamin or diet techniques that might help?  Any kind of advice, suggestions, or feedback would be helpful. Thanks in advance. I also made this post in the sleep thread, but I thought since it has to do with mental health as well, it might be a good fit here as well."

He has been struggling for the better part of the last 6 or 7 months with his narcolepsy, Xyrem and his anti-depressants. Nothing seems to work for him and he cannot seem to break himself from the funk he is currently in. The drugs together seem to be turning him into a zombie. As far as I know, he's already seen a couple of different doctors regarding the situation, but I have no idea how those visits have gone. I am fearful for his mental health at this point and am wondering if anyone else has any experience with a situation like this?  Does anyone know any good specialists in the surrounding Columbus OH area? Any kind of vitamin or diet techniques that might help?  Any kind of advice, suggestions, or feedback would be helpful. Thanks in advance. I also made this post in the sleep thread, but I thought since it has to do with mental health as well, it might be a good fit here as well."

Night before last I couldn’t breathe because I was crying so much. Don’t know what triggered it. I think I have always had some form of depression. I am in my 40’s and the last 10 years have been the worst. I have been in therapy for almost 5 years. I have been taking antidepressants for 2 years. I have no kids. Never been married. Large family/ limited contact long story. Hand full of associates. No friends. I have a public service job which is very demanding. Both my parents have passed on. Next month marks the 10 year of my moms passing. May marks the 3 year of my dads passing. Oldest sibling passed 4 years in June. My moms death hit me hard. I still struggle. Prior to my dads passing I was coping- kinda. I had less dark periods. Night before last was the worst night in 3 years. I had pain in my throat. Tears. My head felt like it was going too explode. Tried reaching out but hit a brick wall. Finally contacted my therapist that is very supportive. I just need her to be a one on one support 24 hours a day. Sometimes I have a hard time realizing that she has other patients. Anyway, guess I just needed to vent."

They did a CT scan without the dye because I'm allergic to it. They were mainly looking at my appendix but I was told the scan was normal. My periods have also been very irregular. I went to my gyno about that. They did an ultrasound to look at my reproductive organs. They found a very small cyst on right ovary which should have dissolved on it's on. Funny because the tech told me she couldn't see my right ovary because a lot of gas and feces was blocking it. I belch a lot more. I get quick, sharp, stabbing pains in my abdomen where the pressure is and on the sides of my abdomen in that area, on my lower back (by kidneys), shoulder blades, and chest right below throat. I have a pressure on my chest just below my throat. I feel and look bloated sometimes.

I decided that taking the antibiotics were doing more damage to me than they were worth, so I stopped taking them at the halfway point and saw a podiatrist about my toe instead.  The podiatrist did the trick, but unfortunately the antibiotic has left my stomach in disorder. I stopped on Saturday and it is now Thursday and I've had persisting diarrhea (through not as frequent, maybe 2 times a day) and bloating/sensitive stomach since. Thankfully I haven't bled out since, but the stool has had a sloppy consistency and contains remnants of what I've been eating including peppers, nuts, corn etc. Today I had a case of orange stool, which a quick google told me isn't exactly a good thing.

I've had a history of stomach problems going back through recent years -  it can be extremely sensitive at times which mean I'm often needing to his the bathroom with the runs. Polyps near the end of my large intestine have also led to bleeding from my rear end, which is always fun... So I recently incurred an ingrown toenail on my left big toe which became infected shortly after. As a result of the infection, I went to my local doctor and was given a prescription of Erythromycin antibiotics, which lasted a week and ended on Saturday just gone. The toenail seemed fine after the course, not paining me, so I thought it would be ok to walk around on it as normal. The following Tuesday, pain had returned. a quick examination of the toe led me to believe that it had again become infected, as there was a yellowing of the skin in behind the nail. I again returned to my doctor who this time prescribed a stronger dose of antibiotics called flucloxacillin. I began taking them without thinking there'd be any side effect. The flucloxacillin began to throw my stomach for 6 - I was fine for the first day, but thereafter was experiencing diarrhea 3/4 times a day. I thought this a normal symptom, but it ended up getting so bad that halfway through the course I found myself with a pot of blood underneath me after a trip to the bathroom. I decided that taking the antibiotics were doing more damage to me than they were worth, so I stopped taking them at the halfway point and saw a podiatrist about my toe instead.  The podiatrist did the trick, but unfortunately the antibiotic has left my stomach in disorder. I stopped on Saturday and it is now Thursday and I've had persisting diarrhea (through not as frequent, maybe 2 times a day) and bloating/sensitive stomach since. Thankfully I haven't bled out since, but the stool has had a sloppy consistency and contains remnants of what I've been eating including peppers, nuts, corn etc. Today I had a case of orange stool, which a quick google told me isn't exactly a good thing.

About 6 months ago I noticed pain during bowel movements and excessive blood in my stool that last 2 days then completely went away. I also noticed when squatting in the shower that my anus slightly buldged out so I took a picture and noticed it was dark purple. I assumed this was hemmoroids and it did not need to be checked out. Then about 2 months later I started experiencing stomach and lower abdomen pains that were not extreme pain but more discomfort. It would come and go and my stool consistency would change. Then everything went back to normal for a few weeks. This would continue to happen off and on over the next several months and everyonce in a while I would notice that my stool would occasionally be black. After that it would go back to normal. Now for the past month I have been feeling discomfort in my stomach and lower left abdomen. When I lay down I can feel a pulse in my lower left abdomen. If I press hard on it there is some slight pain but not severe. My stool consistency tends to change some times appearing slightly redish but not enough to be noticeably different. The other day my stool seemed normal except for one solid tiny white one. I have been very nervous about all of this but have moved far away fromwhere I grew up and do not have a doctor set up do could not be seen immediately by anyone. I also work on rotating schedules with limited to no time off which has also kept me from seeing a doctor. I have been googling my symptoms online but cannot seem to find much except hemmoroids, colorectal cancer, diverticulosis and other gastrational diseases. I am assuming that There is sometbing serious going on in me and it should be immediately looked at but also am afraid I waited too long at it could be too late to treat. Other traits I have is I smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol one-four nights a week depending on the schedule I am on. Can anyone shed light on to what I am experiencing?"

I only had upper middle back pain which I still have to this day. However, I was put on 40 mg twice a day of Prilosec starting at the beginning of the year. I was on it for about two months. It made me feel absolutely horrible and it wasn't helping the initial issue so I went off of it and have been using Zantac to avoid the awful side effects of giving it up. So I have gotten myself down to 75 mg twice a day of Zantac and I am working myself off that. Basically, what I am asking is, I was COMPLETELY normal digestive wise before I went on Prilosec and now I have awful symptoms all the time like it's hard to breathe and swallow and my stomach just has so much acid and I know that these issues are because of my digestive system.

I was given 3 rounds of antibiotics which did not fix it, and then figured out that it was actually LPR, a type of acid reflux. I was also taking antacids pretty constantly for about 2 months before I was given a pantoprazole for 2 weeks followed by xantac. During this time I was often constipated, but nothing too major. Should also mention I quit smoking, was working out and eating healthy, and was all around relatively healthy Shortly after taking the ppi, my symptoms took a turn for the worse. I started to develop gas and bloating after eating, and shortly after experienced abdominal pain ranging from mild to severe for about 2 months. My stool was also very oily and filled with undigested food. Sometimes, I would also wake up and be extremely pale, weak and lightheaded for a few days, then return to the normal problem listed above.  I stopped taking any anti-reflux medication about 3 weeks ago, and although it has been a better, and the bloating, gas and pain is gone, there has been a huge swing in symptoms. For instance, I would get sweet smelling urine and be exhausted after eating carbs, but tested negative for diabetes twice, as this has gone away twice. I also experienced bodywide itching lasting for about 10 minutes, followed by brain fogginess and fatigue, which heavily worsed my ADHD, twice in two weeks. The first time eating whole wheat toast and eggs, and the second time being vector cereal. This hasn't happened while eating white bread. The last time that I was having the sweet smelling urine problems, I did a nocarb diet for a single day, before waking up the next day with such low blood sugar I couldnt stay awake, so I ate a bagel and since then have had no problems with sweet smelling urine or fatigue after carbs, besides when eating the vector cereal this morning. I also get lightheaded when standing up after laying down or sitting.  I have just recieved my ultrasound result, and they have found fluid interposed between diaphragm and dome of liver, along with in bare area of the liver. All organs including the liver show no signs of damage, and no ascites were found. The report says possible subcapsular fluid or perihepatitis followed by ""This is opposed to a right pleural effusion"". I have no idea what any of this means, so if anyone could help me out, or make suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it. I should also mention that bloodwork was mostly all fine, with slightly high ferritin and haemoglobin, and moderately high WBC leukocytes. I also take Dexedrine to treat ADHD, and tolerance has increased very rapidly, as I did not use it properly during the time of my severe problems, taking much more than prescribed just to function. I take anywhere from 60-100mg a day, and gives me no drug high effects at all. Thanks!"

The last time that I was having the sweet smelling urine problems, I did a nocarb diet for a single day, before waking up the next day with such low blood sugar I couldnt stay awake, so I ate a bagel and since then have had no problems with sweet smelling urine or fatigue after carbs, besides when eating the vector cereal this morning. I also get lightheaded when standing up after laying down or sitting.  I have just recieved my ultrasound result, and they have found fluid interposed between diaphragm and dome of liver, along with in bare area of the liver.

I have no idea what any of this means, so if anyone could help me out, or make suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it. I should also mention that bloodwork was mostly all fine, with slightly high ferritin and haemoglobin, and moderately high WBC leukocytes. I also take Dexedrine to treat ADHD, and tolerance has increased very rapidly, as I did not use it properly during the time of my severe problems, taking much more than prescribed just to function.

I am a 19 year old male who was relatively healthy until a few months ago. I had impacted wisdom teeth for about 3 months, and was taking NSAIDs pretty much every day for 2 of them.

I was given 3 rounds of antibiotics which did not fix it, and then figured out that it was actually LPR, a type of acid reflux.

Should also mention I quit smoking, was working out and eating healthy, and was all around relatively healthy Shortly after taking the ppi, my symptoms took a turn for the worse. I started to develop gas and bloating after eating, and shortly after experienced abdominal pain ranging from mild to severe for about 2 months. My stool was also very oily and filled with undigested food.

They focus too much on whether something works or not but less on potency or just how effective it is or things like consistency and if the supplement is reliable or not. Yes, CLA works if that is what you are asking.  There are surely several studies which can be used to clinically/scientifically prove it. Furthermore, there is a meta-analysis in humans, from 2007, which identified 18 eligible studies and compared them and the conclusion was that conjugated linoleic acid taken at a dose of 3.2, which is a pretty small dose when it comes to CLA because it is of a weak potency, can be able to promote a modest body fat loss in humans. Modest is the key word here, however.  Another thing people mistake is when they presume that their results will be the same as the results seen in a certain study or trial. No, CLA may not even work for you. In fact, it is clear if you go and look at the studies and trials, that conjugated linoleic acid has had to contradict and mixed results. It is perhaps the most inconsistent and unreliable weight loss supplement. The claims that are made online about CLA, some are just to overhype it and to sell products, meaning they are not true. Conjugated linoleic acid at a 3 grams per day dosage can work depending on the person, you may need more, up to 6 grams per day if you want better results. Your results will also depend on how active you are regularly and of course on what you choose to eat and what caloric intake you have.  For those that are interested. CLA works through PPARs which are nuclear receptors in your body, essential for energy metabolism. It's just not that effective, CLA that is, and may work differently for each person.  Although it's found naturally in cattle beef or yogurt or milk and other products from ruminants, grass-fed cattle, the quantities in foods are not enough. You'll need to invest in a supplement and it just might not prove to be the best investment. I would advise you to consult a medic as well since CLA supplementation can come with side-effects. To those that are new to weight loss, it may sound confusing. What I mean is, there is really no supplement out there which can burn your fat away without you making a change first. Let me explain because it is very simple.  The reason why you are overweight is a combination of two main factors, unhealthy eating habits, and a sedentary lifestyle. No matter who you are, unless you have a health problem that is causing you to be overweight/obese, you are either not eating right or you are very inactive. Usually, it's both, a combination of both. Some are kind of active, they go out to run once per week, which is not enough when you have bad eating habits because you are not burning enough calories. This can be resumed in two words, imbalanced lifestyle. People that are fit lead a balanced lifestyle. Yes, they eat healthily but don't think that they don't eat pizza or fast-food or enjoy a cold beer, eat cake and sweets, etc. They do, but they don't do it regularly or abuse it.  So you may wonder, of what use is a supplement if I still have to exercise and diet? Well, if I am to be perfectly honest, you don't need a supplement to lose fat, it's that simple. They can help but you just don't need them to do it. There is no such thing as not being able to lose fat without using a supplement. Diet, exercise, and fat will go away, no doubt about it.  However, supplements can help, even though the benefits are quite small.  What's more, sometimes it's difficult to tell if the supplement is working since you are dieting and exercising and that boosts your metabolism and lowers your caloric intake creating a deficit and thus helping you to lose excess fat. There are hundreds, thousands of people that have lost fat without using a supplement, we know it's possible, it's a fact. It's common sense actually.  But let's go back to benefits of a supplement. Think of CLA (conjugated linoleic acid). It is quite popular, although there are misconceptions about it.  Could it help you? Yes, I mean it has clinical evidence. We know that it has influence over PPARs (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors). In turn, the PPARs have influence over your metabolism and its regulation as well as other things in your body.  Unfortunately it is one of the weaker weight loss supplements and it has mixed and even contradicting results in studies and trials but nonetheless, it can work. Some of you may use it, though, and not notice that it is working. It doesn't work for everyone and there are different isomers of CLA.  Especially if you are dieting and exercising, which you should be, you may just not be able to tell if it's helping. Using supplements like CLA Safflower Oil might improve your condition.

To those that are new to weight loss, it may sound confusing. What I mean is, there is really no supplement out there which can burn your fat away without you making a change first. Let me explain because it is very simple.  The reason why you are overweight is a combination of two main factors, unhealthy eating habits, and a sedentary lifestyle. No matter who you are, unless you have a health problem that is causing you to be overweight/obese, you are either not eating right or you are very inactive. Usually, it's both, a combination of both. Some are kind of active, they go out to run once per week, which is not enough when you have bad eating habits because you are not burning enough calories. This can be resumed in two words, imbalanced lifestyle. People that are fit lead a balanced lifestyle. Yes, they eat healthily but don't think that they don't eat pizza or fast-food or enjoy a cold beer, eat cake and sweets, etc. They do, but they don't do it regularly or abuse it.  So you may wonder, of what use is a supplement if I still have to exercise and diet? Well, if I am to be perfectly honest, you don't need a supplement to lose fat, it's that simple. They can help but you just don't need them to do it. There is no such thing as not being able to lose fat without using a supplement. Diet, exercise, and fat will go away, no doubt about it.  However, supplements can help, even though the benefits are quite small.  What's more, sometimes it's difficult to tell if the supplement is working since you are dieting and exercising and that boosts your metabolism and lowers your caloric intake creating a deficit and thus helping you to lose excess fat. There are hundreds, thousands of people that have lost fat without using a supplement, we know it's possible, it's a fact. It's common sense actually.  But let's go back to benefits of a supplement. Think of CLA (conjugated linoleic acid). It is quite popular, although there are misconceptions about it.  Could it help you? Yes, I mean it has clinical evidence. We know that it has influence over PPARs (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors). In turn, the PPARs have influence over your metabolism and its regulation as well as other things in your body.  Unfortunately it is one of the weaker weight loss supplements and it has mixed and even contradicting results in studies and trials but nonetheless, it can work. Some of you may use it, though, and not notice that it is working. It doesn't work for everyone and there are different isomers of CLA.  Especially if you are dieting and exercising, which you should be, you may just not be able to tell if it's helping. Using supplements like CLA Safflower Oil might improve your condition.

They focus too much on whether something works or not but less on potency or just how effective it is or things like consistency and if the supplement is reliable or not. Yes, CLA works if that is what you are asking.  There are surely several studies which can be used to clinically/scientifically prove it. Furthermore, there is a meta-analysis in humans, from 2007, which identified 18 eligible studies and compared them and the conclusion was that conjugated linoleic acid taken at a dose of 3.2, which is a pretty small dose when it comes to CLA because it is of a weak potency, can be able to promote a modest body fat loss in humans. Modest is the key word here, however.  Another thing people mistake is when they presume that their results will be the same as the results seen in a certain study or trial. No, CLA may not even work for you. In fact, it is clear if you go and look at the studies and trials, that conjugated linoleic acid has had to contradict and mixed results. It is perhaps the most inconsistent and unreliable weight loss supplement. The claims that are made online about CLA, some are just to overhype it and to sell products, meaning they are not true. Conjugated linoleic acid at a 3 grams per day dosage can work depending on the person, you may need more, up to 6 grams per day if you want better results. Your results will also depend on how active you are regularly and of course on what you choose to eat and what caloric intake you have.  For those that are interested. CLA works through PPARs which are nuclear receptors in your body, essential for energy metabolism. It's just not that effective, CLA that is, and may work differently for each person.

I am currently travelling in Central AMerica. About 5 weeks ago, I had a week of diarrhea in Guatemala. Since then, I've experienced bloating and constant abdominal pain.  The first doctor assumed I had a parasite and gave me antiparisital medicine which did nothing.   The second doctor did a stool sample and put me on a weeks worth of antibiotics after the results showed I had E. Coli bacteria. I didn't feel any better.  The third doctor did urine, blood, and stool tests and my results were fine. He concluded I had post-infectious irritability of my colon. He gave me probiotics, digestive enzymes, and antispasmastic medicine. There was no improvement in my symptoms. I'm not sure whether to see another doctor or perhaps experiment with my diet.

I might have a Cyst because I had a buildup that bloody exploded on my buttcheek near my rectum. This instantly comes on without buildup, and it hurts bad. The pain is in the area above my private area and below my stomach. I can feel the gas buildup, and it feels like how your head feels when it . I feel like I am passing gas as I have explosive diarrhea that comes out like a facet (it is an oily liquid with chunks of poo with chunks of undigested food). The area gets bloated and warm, and noisy to were I can here it as I watch TV. I also get very gasy and often have this terrible smell of wet shoes and a backed up septic tank in leakage in my underwear.  What is wrong with me?"

But I have been experiencing a lot of panic attacks and severe depression and anxiety. I've always had anxiety (OCD) and I panicked every now and then but not as much as now. It all started when I ate thc edible that was 900 mg. I ate little bit day before so it must be less than that but it didn't work so next day when I was at school I ate whole thing. Everything was fine until it kicked in when it did I wasn't panicking until I went to gym class where my anxiety started kicking in, everything was going slow motion kids in front of me were moving really fast and then slow and then things would pause and reverse like a movie. This made my panicking worse I wasn't panicking to the point where I thought I'm gonna die but I panicked a bit. I then went to nurse office when things got out of control and my BP was high and pulse was fast. Long story short next day my anxiety was gone however my vision was very foggy and bright and also I had brain fog. This happened for few days but when I started going to gym class I noticed I would start panicking and everything would start going in slow motion like it was when I was high. I had to tell nurse and go home like every other day it would go away whenever I came back home though. But after a few times i started getting this dream like feeling like everything started seeming fake to me like my surroundings seemed fake I started forgetting things became depressed and even my eating habits changed I was less hungry. So i went to the doctor and let him know i was then prescribed zoloft my anxiety is a bit less as far as panic attacks go there usually worse in morning. But i still feel like my mind is somewhere else while my body is still here it's like I'm stuck in my mind when I go outside people around me seem fake like I'm trapped in a bubble everything seems fake even my body and thoughts. I am really worried and have visited the doctor many times and the answer he always gives me is its anxiety. If someone can please give me some advice on this that would be great because I feel like I'm going mental or something. And I really regret eating that edible now"

So this month I ve experienced 9 out of 53 of my stools have been type 6 on Bristol stool chart, which isn t a horrible amount. Last month it was a little more. But I always had this lingering fear that I had IBD because they never tested me for it and they never tested me for food allergies or anything like that."

So i'd come to the point, which is not one but many. I am in class 10th, good at my studies but only when i study. I mean in the beginning of this session i.e. in april, i was among the top 10 students in my class.  I had been studying in st. mary's school since LkG till my 9th. After that i came to the school i am in presently. I changed my school because 1) i thought i'd be able to focus on my studies here 2) i'll make new good friends and not think much about our friendship(not overthink about friends) 3) will make a new good image of myself  Its not like i didn't focus on my studies in mary's but just that till 8th i was the class topper but in my 9th i was sick for the entire year. i hardly went to school and scored 70 percent in my annuals which was very shocking for everyone as i had scored 10 cgpa in past all the classes. so people thought of me as a girl who has now stopped studying when i was actually ill. Also, i hated my friends there. They actually made fun of me every time and i couldn't reply back to them because 1) i didn't want to because i know it hurts and 2) i didn't know how to reply to such comments  In this school, my new school, initially i barely talked to anyone then a few weeks later i was appointed as the class monitor and so i had to talk to everyone. gradually, i made friends here and got frank with them and i enjoyed my school. i still do. its fun because they find me funny and i love to make them laugh knowing that i did not insult anyone or hurt anyone while cracking jokes. its kind of a satisfaction to know i am funny without being rude. But at the same time, i miss my school. I miss it a lot. I miss my friends. No matter what, but the friendship i had with them is not the same as i have now. Students in my new school are kinds weird maybe because its not a convent school. I am not too comfortable being around them. They are different. I cant say certain things in front of them because it makes me look like a complete uneducated person. They act as if they are from some very well educated family who earns like a million in a month when actually its not true. They fake things around and even a small word like stupid is something very big for them. students here are also too much into studies, which is good but it becomes boring after a point. So, in short, i don't like this school and i have stopped being regular after august.  if you're still reading then thank you The thing that has been troubling me a lot lately is my previous school friends. Two of them are in the same coaching and we meet every alternate day but they don't even look at me. I mean i dont what what changed except my school that they stopped talking to me. I intentionally took the evening batch so that i could meet at least 2 of my friends but they don't bother to say a hello. I expected something very different. I thought we'd sit together and discuss my new school and whats all happening in mary's and whats going on and stuff and study together. After i changed my school , i used to call each of my friends every now and then but when i realised they aren't interested in talking to me i stopped calling them first. And not so surprisingly, they didn't call me even once. I am upset, really upset.  My 9th class was a really bad one. I was into self harm since my 8th class that i rarely did something more than scratching with a compass and that too just once or twice in the entire year. But 9th class left me with scars. I started using a blade and my hand was so ugly to even look at after it was filled with blood all over. I thought of myself as a complete mess. I thought i was so annoying that i should not weven talk to anyone and yes, i didn't talk to anyone. I stayed quiet most of the time and got upset at very small stuff. I changed a lot in the initial of my 10th but i am back to the same point now. My hand is full of scars, even my thigh too. I wonder what i am gonna do after the winters end. How am i gonna face my parents! I have this urge to destroy my hand completely with a blade whenever i feel down and the problem is i feel down every alternate day. The feeling is so bad that even thinking about it can make me cry. I couldn't help but rush to the washroom with a blade. It actually calms me down. I stop crying after it and i forget whatever just happened. Its so relaxing. I cant explain how good it feels. It kills all the feelings i was going through a few minutes back. I know its wrong but i cant help. My ex best friend once called my mom and told her about it. After i returned from my coaching she cleverly checked my hand and almost cried. My father took me to the hospital for injection. They were both very disappointed. They thought of me as a very strong girl but i was this strong girl till my 5th or 6th class. I grew weaker n weaker after that.  I have had suicidal thoughts and I've been wondering what could be the best option. I have had days wen i researched a lot about how to kill yourself and i probably wouldn't have been alive if i found an appropriate way that time. I've bought sleeping pills but after i read an article that there are no 100 percent chances that you'd die, i threw them away. When i die, i want to die in 1 go, no going to the hospital. Sometimes i wonder if i'd be able to survive for long with such *** in my head. But i recently lost my grandfather. My father has completely broken down and i cant see him like this. He's very emotional but it makes my cry to see him like that. 2019 has had a bad start. It is so so depressing right now. Though one thing good that has happend is that i have decided not to ever commit suicide after seeing that my family is so weak. I cant put them into such a bad situation.  Mid october to mid november , i tried to change myself a lot and i guess i even did. But i don't know, i am being dragged into the darkness again. I have thought of killing everyone in my house and then killing myself. Even i know its really stupid but just a thought.  thanks for still reading Its been almost 3 weeks now that i am crying daily. Self harm is very normal for me now. I feel upset all the time. I don't wish to talk to anyone. I don't reply to anyone's text. I cant study.

I have got actually no friends at all whom i can share anything with. I cant share my suicidal feelings with my family obviously and at this time, not at all.

I am having worst constipation in my life. i mean i always have it once a while, but never lasted this long(3 weeks). usually, once it's out, no more constipated afterwards. Eventually i drank some prone juice and had a diarrhea from it. Right after that, i was constipated again.  Then, I took some Miralax for 4 days and had some bowl movement everyday. But it was never like before: much harder to strain out some; stool is thinner than before; still feel like it's not empty; some orange/pinkish spot (liquid, not chucks) in stool when i wipe (i have been eating carrots, so not sure that could be it). Before my stools were much fatter, and came out smooth. i have done my research and now im worried it could be colon cancer since my gpa died from it late 50s. I went to doctor, but she said its very unlikely for people of my age to have cancer, so no exams done."

I had a cat scan done a while back and the doctor said that it showed where my pancreas and gallbladder were a little swollen and pushing against each other. He said there was not much you can do except clean up your diet and don't eat greasy foods because that's what causes that to happen. Well I have done that and I still have this issue flare up from time to time. What else could be causing this pain? I feel he did not give me a valid diagnoses. Any information would be great!

I am expanding my boundaries on talking to people. Right now I am just talking to people online. (I should mention I have social anxiety as well, so it's difficult for me to meet people on a personal level.) A couple of months ago I had reconnected with a friend from high school (who I had a falling out with for personal reasons) and a couple of days ago I responded to someone's ""I need a friend"" posts. I want to talk, I want to have a conversation, but it always seems like I am asking all of the questions, or bringing another topic to talk about so the conversation continues. It's frustrating! I want to talk about my life too, and not just have them repeat the question I asked them. Or worse yet- have them cut back to the first statement of an actual conversation that we've had, leaving nothing else to talk about. For example ""I love watching Westerns..... this is what I love about them..... this is how you feel about them..... I love watching Westerns."" There is no leading into another topic, there is no cue on where to go with it, it just stops. So I ask another question, and it happens again. So I bring up another topic (movies), and it happens again. This isn't like a one time, ""hey how are you doing"" conversation. It goes on and on, everyday we talk and everything we talk about. I don't want to have to control the conversation, I want to be a part of it."

Over the years time and again, I found that spinning my wheels does nothing but turn inward, affecting my health. Even as a non practicing catholic, in my younger days, working in hospital ICUs and burn units, I would go to work repeating the manta, ""Let go and Let God. Not once or twice but for the whole time it took me to get to work. Now with age and hindsight I see how that worked for me. SO, 'mindfulness' which began in hospitals with workers and patients has shown to be a tremendous benefit. With my distracting ADD, this is hard for me but may help you.

I am constantly overwhelmed, and life almost never feels safe for me because I do not feel I am up to it’s tasks by any stretch of imagination. Other effects from these issues are IBS, alergies, and chronic pain.  One time I went to the ER with Colitus, and a very kind doctor prescribed Prednisone for me. There are no words to describe all it did for me. It not only helped my colitus, but my allergies and chronic pain subsided. Even more importantly, instead of feeling buried under life’s tasks with my usual depression and anxiety, I felt completely calm and full of confidence that I was competent to deal with all I had to do. It wasn’t like a “high” either. Rather it seemed as though I had been given something I had always been missing. I cannot begin to describe how much I want that experience again.  My question—what is in that stuff that could give me all I lacked? It seems it would be an excellent pursuit to find out how it works on people like me and develop a comparable medication that could be used long-term.  I would love to hear any thoughts, ideas, insights or information on this subject. Thank you!"

So my main question is getting people's opinion on who to see over this. I have been experiencing depression symptoms for several years and I was able to ""control"" and hide it, still managing to live successfully without it interfering with most of my daily life. Lately I've noticed its gotten worse the past few months and its not beginning to affect my life and others around me are starting to notice. This seems silly, but even though my closest friends and family are noticing somethings up, I still do not want to talk to them about it yet, as I haven't completely admitted it to myself. I believe one of the ""causes"" could be my thyroid, I've had hypothyroid disease for over 10 years, I'm 21 now, and recently things have gotten worse. I guess my question is which doctor do you think I should see or which have any of you seen and recommend? I don't have a close relationship with either my endocrinologist or family doctor, they're both new and I haven't really connected with either but since they work together with my thyroid issues I can't really switch. Should I try and talk to one of them or just try and find a therapist or something instead first? I know its dumb but I really don't know who to ask without worrying someone in my friends/family but I'm noticing I need to do something about this before it gets worse and I'm not sure which way to turn. Any suggestions will help! Thank you!"

We have been getting to know each other as friends for about 9 months now, coworkers first. She makes herself so hard to communicate with, I have to go where she is which is work and see her in person just to get some conversation. Sometimes that leads to hanging out when she’s done working if she doesn’t have other plans. When we part ways we usually hug so I know she likes me. If I text her it is extremely difficult to get a reply but I will see she read the message. I tell her if i’m Texting too much and being annoying let me know but I still don’t get a reply so it is difficult to tell what’s up. She does like her job a workaholic almost and she doesn’t usually look at her phone during work unless on break, work days are the days that sometimes I can get her attention when I text her. When she’s not working it seems like she isn’t doing anything constructive, she is on a stay cation this week and lives near where I work and live but I don’t see her and if I text I still get no reply.  Last Saturday we made plans to hang out after we were both done working but she stood me up and texted, that sorry she was tired, it’s understandable we have the same job and she worked straight through the week with one day off. I felt gipped because the day before she couldn’t hang out with me because she was hanging out with other friends. The problem is she was going to pick that friend up from work take him home get high with him then drive him back to work while she was still high. I could keep going there is more but my question is, how do you communicate with a depressed person when they make it difficult? She also has a drug and alcohol problem but when you try to tell her you’re concerned she just blows it off. I should mention i’m not much of a social person or a very good communicator myself."

(explained further below) I went to ER on 4/26 and all they could say at that point was that my lipase level was 68 and WBC was 13. My EKG was good and chest X-ray was clear. Negative for Lyme and bacteria cultures were clear.  I have to note that, being stuck in the ER for 8 hours that day, I didn't get to eat anything all day and only had a non-fat yogurt, low-fat breakfast bar, carrots and water for dinner when I got home. I made it through the night with no issues.  4/27 was mostly good as well - stuck to low-fat foods and was ok all day. For dinner we had homemade fajitas but I'm wondering if the spices or wrap triggered this again because I had the same issue.  4/28 felt chilled when I woke up, lasted until around noon when it changed like a light switch and I became flushed; red and warm in the cheeks, neck and ears. That lasted for about two hours and then I was fine for the night. Again, food intake was light and on the low-to-no fat side.  Got up this morning and stayed on that food path - cheerios, almond milk, banana and breakfast bar. Still feel fine right now. Just overall a little weak and/or sluggish, which is no shock since I'm not eating like normal.  Overall, I get hunger sensations but have to almost convince myself to eat. My normal eating desire just doesn't seem to be there. I'll admit though that I'm also a little nervous as to what to eat, because I don't want to trigger the chills again (if food is even a trigger), but I'd say the lack of desire is a bigger reason as to why. Not surprisingly, I've lost a few pounds over this week because my caloric intake is definitely way down compared to normal.  Last week, I had started adding at least 1 tsp cayenne pepper and ~.6 tsp turmeric to my daily smoothie to try and help with my BP. That's the only dietary change I can think of prior to this whole thing starting. I stopped adding these on 4/22 (date of the first night I started with this issue), mainly because it tasted horrible, so not sure if that's what started this. Possible inflammation of some part of the digestive system?? Or did it just bring some other buried issue to light now? Should they be sending me for a CT scan or something else? They don't seem that concerned by it, but I can't keep on like this and lose more weight. It's only been a week and I've had two people comment that I'm looking thinner."

For dinner we had homemade fajitas but I'm wondering if the spices or wrap triggered this again because I had the same issue.  4/28 felt chilled when I woke up, lasted until around noon when it changed like a light switch and I became flushed; red and warm in the cheeks, neck and ears. That lasted for about two hours and then I was fine for the night. Again, food intake was light and on the low-to-no fat side.  Got up this morning and stayed on that food path - cheerios, almond milk, banana and breakfast bar. Still feel fine right now. Just overall a little weak and/or sluggish, which is no shock since I'm not eating like normal.  Overall, I get hunger sensations but have to almost convince myself to eat. My normal eating desire just doesn't seem to be there. I'll admit though that I'm also a little nervous as to what to eat, because I don't want to trigger the chills again (if food is even a trigger), but I'd say the lack of desire is a bigger reason as to why. Not surprisingly, I've lost a few pounds over this week because my caloric intake is definitely way down compared to normal.  Last week, I had started adding at least 1 tsp cayenne pepper and ~.6 tsp turmeric to my daily smoothie to try and help with my BP. That's the only dietary change I can think of prior to this whole thing starting. I stopped adding these on 4/22 (date of the first night I started with this issue), mainly because it tasted horrible, so not sure if that's what started this. Possible inflammation of some part of the digestive system?? Or did it just bring some other buried issue to light now? Should they be sending me for a CT scan or something else? They don't seem that concerned by it, but I can't keep on like this and lose more weight. It's only been a week and I've had two people comment that I'm looking thinner."

Almost 10 years and several medications later, I don't think this was correct. I've tried it all. Lexapro, Zoloft, Neurontin, Lithium, Risperdal, Trazadone, Seroquel... plus more. Most recently I was on a combination of Lithium 450 2x a day, Zoloft 200 1x a day, Seroquel 400 1x at bedtime, Xanax .5 3x a day, Antabuse 1x a day for alcoholism. Before I started the Antabuse I was drinking and mixing these meds and had 3 seizures so if you are on meds, PLEASE BE CAREFUL! But I recently started taking the Antabuse and had 2 episodes where I was so disoriented and confused I almost went to the ER in fear of a stroke. Turns out to be a negative side effect of the Antabuse. So I am done. I am quitting all these medications and going to a more holistic and herbal approach. The Lithium obviously hasn't helped over the past ten years because I still get so depressed I turn to alcohol and my visits to Rehabs and Psych wards have not slowed or helped. These medications are making things worse as I see it. I failed to mention, when I was diagnosed as Bipolar, I was heavily using cocaine on a daily basis. I have not used any drugs in at least a year and alcohol in 2 weeks. Does anyone have any advice? Herbal supplement suggestions? I am not going to return to the psychiatrist for the simple fact that I leave with more than I started with. Also, even with the medications, I attempted suicide twice... it wasn't a permanent threat, more like a cry for help because I was so ""squirrelly"" inside my head.

It like a dull soreness approximately 4 inches inside my anus. It is not a constant pain. Laying down or prolonged sitting seems to make it occur more, while walking and standing usually makes it go away.  So, it's just the dull soreness pain that comes and goes now.

So, by the time I do eat, I'm ravenous and I eat too fast. Even when I'm not ravenous, I eat too fast because I have things to do, and need to get on with it.

I had a uti not major. Today I am having soreness in my lymph nodes below my ears. I don't feel sick just am resting. Can all this be linked to bipolar disorder and my hormones out of whack?

October a few weeks later: -I become severally constipated and began taking natural remedies: Aloe Vera juice, Prunes, Apple juice/Apples. -Eventually after something like 4 days I went...and went...and it was just diarrhea. Spent hours on the toilet and began having abdominal pain and eventually blood in whatever liquid came out. -I went to the emergency room spent 4 days in the hospital received the following: CT scan, Antibiotics, probiotics, enema, sigmoidoscopy (revealed nothing of note), morphine, and something for nausea. -Ultimately I got better and began having solid bowel movements and released with a tentative diagnosis of Colitis. Mid-January 2017: -I notice my right neck lymph node is swollen. -Stays swollen for over a month before I seek help. -Primary physician redirects me to an ENT but prescribes a week of antibiotics incase. Mid-February 2017: -I begin having similar penis and colon issues in a less severe way around the time I am going to an ENT doctor to inspect my swollen lymph node. -He takes a liquid biopsy of the lymph node and finds nothing, so I get a contrast and no contrast CT scan of my neck and they find that both my neck lymph nodes are swollen. Present day: -I am scheduled to have one of my lymph nodes removed for further investigation and for safety as my mother has lymphoma. -My self-intuition tells me something is cycling in my body, less severe the second time since my body has learned to adapt and the lymph nodes on my body are swelling as a response of this ""thing"" having lived in my body since September last year. Any thoughts?"

Unfortunately it has severely upset my stomach (I have been taking two 500mg tablets a day as recommended on the pack, although I was silly to sometimes take it on an empty stomach or two tablets at night rather than divide them in 2 doses as advised) so I have obviously stopped taking it as soon as I noticed the problem. There has been a slight improvement over the last month since I stopped (I am not drinking any coffee or smoking so I reckon magnesium levels in my body may still be high) but the problem persists. I've tried taking probiotics I've been recommended in my local health store but they don't help. I did some Google search and found that what I'm experiencing (bloating, abdominal pain, stomach cramps, struggling to digest most foods) is called hypermagnesemia and calcium injections are one of the treatments as they help remove excess magnesium from the body because calcium is a natural antagonist of magnesium. I don't find my condition that severe so that I should be going to the hospital for injections, I remember I had stomach issues because of magnesium supplement in the past and it has settled after a good while so I am sure it will be the same this time but I am looking for ways to speed up the process. My question is, do you think that drinking calcium in an effervescent form would be a good idea as another way of increasing my calcium intake to balance that high magnesium level in my body? Other option I found is to take digestive enzymes which would seem logical as my stomach takes ages to break down foods and is really sore while doing that, especially with bigger meals - could that be helpful?

While its happening, I hear this one specific song in the back of my head and I keep seeing the same imagery that I did the first time I ever had one of these episodes- but then as soon as it's passed I cannot for the life of me remember what the song was or what I was thinking about. I've tried taking note of when they occur but have never found any consistencies as its happened at all times of day, in public or alone, and in moments where I've been doing completely different things. Sometimes it'll happen several times in a week, then other times weeks have passed before I experience it again. I've thought that I could try writing down what I'm thinking at the moment that the episode happens so I can go back later and evaluate what might be the issue, but the feeling is so overwhelming that I can't bring myself to do anything other than sit still and stare in front of me until it passes.  To go into a little more detail about the episodes themselves- I wouldn't quite describe it as a wave of depression, but more so a rush of anxiety, sadness, and emptiness at once. When I describe it as 'overwhelming' I don't mean it in the sense that it's too much to bear, it's just the ONLY thing that I can feel in the moment and the feelings are so much that I can't describe with words- which has also made it very hard to talk about with my psychiatrist and/or therapist. I kind of feel like I'm in a dream when it happens and the song that I mentioned before almost sounds like its actually playing out loud, but in the other room; my stomach gets queasy, I start to feel overheated, and I'm looking through my own eyes but they're out of focus. I've researched a little about depersonalization and it sounds similar to what I'm experiencing, but I don't think some of the other key elements of that diagnosis apply to me. The most notable aspect of any of these episodes is that its never something new, it's always the SAME things (song & imagery) that come to mind when it happens. In terms of my mental health history, I have been treated for my ADD, Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and PTSD starting at around 12 years old. For a long time I struggled mostly with depression because I often went periods, ranging from hours to days to weeks, where I didn't feel like myself and I didn't find any joy in being alive (not necessarily suicidal, though), but eventually reached the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder because I also have stages where I'm extremely manic and become hyperfocused on whatever it is that consumes me at the time. I am currently 20 and my doctors are primarily focused on my PTSD from a robbery and sexual assault that occurred about 2 years ago, and my Anxiety that worsened when I began having frequent panic attacks in social situations about a year ago. I am taking Lamictal (200MG) right now, and just recently stopped taking Mirtazapine (22.5MG) after being on it for about 8-9 months. I also take 5MG of Dexedrine twice a day for focus. And lastly, my lifestyle- I regularly smoke weed, probably about 1-2 times a day. I am a social-smoker, but I also do it to help me eat or sleep, cope with stress or boredom, or to ease anxiousness when I'm alone; so the amount really just depends on the day. (Note: I have always been sober every time one of these mysterious episodes has occurred). I do not smoke cigarettes, I rarely drink, and I live a relatively healthy lifestyle in terms of diet and exercise. Drug-wise, I have done shrooms twice, coke four times, and LSD 10 times- which brings me to my conclusion. The first time one of my episodes ever occurred- I'm only mentioning this part last because I thought it would be important to know all of the other information beforehand. The first time I ever experienced one of these moments was after coming down from an LSD trip with a friend of mine. Although I do think the LSD played a part in the onset of the first incident, I'm still hesitant to definitively say drugs are completely responsible for what is going on. On the day it happened, my friend and I had both taken only half a tab. I had done acid 9 other times, in the span of 2 years, before this and always took a full tab, so the trip was short and we were both feeling our usual selves within about 6-8 hours. We were sitting on the couch at another friends house approx. 14-15 hours after taking the half tabs when I got the overwhelming feeling I mentioned before- anxiety, depression, and emptiness all at once. I remember listening to music and scrolling down Instagram until I passed over a photo of my ex out at a party posted by someone else, then I felt it. It should also be noted that this ex and I had recently broken off a long-term relationship, so it was a particularly sensitive subject-matter. My mental health had taken a turn for the worst about 6 months earlier (panic attacks, severe depressive episodes, inexplainable episodes of crying, etc.) and as a result, took a toll on our relationship and was ultimately the catalyst that led to the end of things. We had lived together and he kept our puppy after the breakup, so it was not a clean break by any means. However, when this first episode occurred, I had been on the Lamictal and Mirtazapine for a few months and was back in a stable place. About a month passed before I experienced another moment like this one, and then they began to become more frequent later on.  In conclusion, I know that the LSD very well may have been the reason this ever started, even if I wasn't actively tripping when it first occurred. But it's also possible it could be the result something else like stress, other lifestyle choices, medications, etc.. I still haven't been able to characterize it and neither have any of my doctors, so that's why I'm here. Regardless of what the cause might be, what I would love to know is what these episodes are called, and how/if it could be treated. Although they are only 2-5 minutes long, it can be quite debilitating and leave me feeling detached for periods of time afterward. Any advice at all would be much appreciated. Thanks for reading."

If anyone has any advice, or tips, or anything, I'd be grateful. I'm not even opposed to downing sleeping pills at this point, even though the lighter ones I've tried haven't worked. Every time I've voiced concern to my parents, they don't seem to see it as a big issue, and the time I've spoken to a doctor (about a year ago) I received no helpful advice at all."

Please let me know I'm not alone in this. I've been suffering with ""IBS-D"" since early 2006. My story begins as most do, Once Upon a Time, I was just fine. In 2006 I underwent surgery to remove my right Fallopian tube and ovary. During the procedure, the surgeon noticed that 6"" of my small intestine had collapsed. Concerned that severe complications would undoubtedly arise; the damaged intestine was removed and reattached. Recovery was unremarkable; outside of the NG Tube (which should be outlawed), and I went home a few days later. And so it begins, a few days after I began to experience intense spasms in my stomach; so much so that they come in waves so severe that I become nauseated and begin to vomit; cold sweats and to make it more complicated...severe diarrhea. I returned to the ER where I was admitted, given pain meds and Zofran, rehydrated, CT scan showed nothing. A few days later, discharged. Diarrhea has been my constant companion since. And to make it worse there is no holding it back. It has a mind of it's own and once started if I can't find a bathroom in 30 seconds or less; I'm a ""poopy-pants""! Fast forward to January 2017, admitted to the hospital again for the same symptoms (this is the fifth time). I've been taking Lotronex for the past 2 years; which I must say has helped with the dreaded diarrhea but; not the spasms, vomiting, nausea. In researching the IBS-D pharmaceutical options; the side effects of the drugs is at best; frightening. I knew about what could happen with Lotronex; I signed a ""waiver"" to start the drug. At this time desperation made it impossible to see anything but no more ""poopy-pants"" at work, shopping, driving, etc. I'm desperate! I can't go through another ""bout"" like this last one and I want my life back. If there are one or two or 100 kind souls out there that can share anything with me that may help I'd be eternally grateful. Even if all you can do is tell me you empathize with me. Thanks for listening."

I hope that this a judge free zone and that if you guys have any questions, you will ask, it will probably be good for me to talk about it. So for as long as I can remember, I was sexually abused every night up until I was nine. When I finally told somebody about it, my whole family fell apart and I felt like it was my fault. My mom was working three jobs and we were babysat by our grandpa. But he was an alchoholic and was often times passed out on the couch. 9 and 10 year old me had to watch my siblings almost every night. I remember one time, he was drinking and driving, and we almost ran into a tree. After that, I usually only slept in my brothers room. My mom met a guy, his name is Jacob. We moved. They got married, and had a kid. Over the 2 or 3 years that I just passed over, my anxiety slowly got worse. I was waking up with panic attacks and I couldn’t sleep at night. I first started noticing that something was up when my friend took me to New York City, and I wasn’t excited about it at all. I didn’t even realize that I was there, until I had already left. We moved house and I met my best friend braylee. She moved away at the end of the school year, and I had only known her for a couple months. I was grounded all summer, and I was really upset all of the time. I started having frequent panic attacks, and I was severely afraid to sleep. I was afraid that I was going to die in my sleep. The new school year started, and I knew that something was wrong with me. I just wasn’t ever myself. As the school year has gone on, my depression has gotten worse. Many things have happened that you can read about in my next post, but I felt myself hit the bottom of a pit. I honestly want to die sometimes. I want the pain to stop. And the constant judgement to stop. I feel worthless, and sad all the time. There’s this voice in my head and I can’t get it out. Many thing scare me and give me anxiety.

Like, if you're not a concert or some random event, then don't scream around me). Sometimes, I can get anxiety from really gross goopy things around me. I even see things sometimes (like really bright colors, and if I look at some random object for more than five seconds, I'll see it in different spots where it isn't). Another thing is that I can be really happy and excited one second and then the next second I'll be mad and pissed off and I'll snap at people. I'm not sure what it is, but it kind of scares me.

My doctors at the time were unable to ever find an answer as to what caused it and ultimately wrote it off as a freak occurrence that hopefully won't happen again. Then about a year ago, it was discovered that I was very anemic. My previous surgeon ordered an EGD, colonoscopy, small bowel follow through and around February, a capsule endoscopy, to no avail. He referred me to a hematologist, who started me on iron infusions. I received the infusions once a week for about 5 or 6 months. My iron did eventually climb to normal levels, but once the infusions were stopped, my numbers fell quickly. The doctor ordered yet another capsule endoscopy in August, but says it showed no results. Microscopic traces of blood were found in my occult stool sample, but my doctor kept telling me that we'll wait and see what happens.  I finally scheduled myself an appointment with a gastroenterologIst in the fall and he conducted his own EGD and colonoscopy, which again showed nothing. He finally ordered a third capsule endoscopy, which I completed about 2 weeks ago.  His nurse practitioner called me today and said that there is an ulcer in my small intestine along with another stricture. She said that my capsule came to a stop in my small bowel and was worried that it might be stuck, so she ordered an x-ray for me to get quickly along with some additional blood work. After taking the x-rays, the tech informed me that there are THREE foreign objects inside of my small bowel. When I told him about the capsule studies, he confirmed that that is what he saw - all THREE of them from over this past year, stuck inside me.  I'm waiting on the doctor's office to receive the report and contact me to see what I need to do from here. So now, I'm not only worried of what condition is causing all of this, but I now have to worry about the 3 capsules inside my small bowel. How did the previous doctor not notice that the capsule came to a halt during BOTH studies and maybe suggest getting an x-ray to make sure I passed them. I feel like a fool for not taking it upon myself to check it out.  My question is: has anyone ever experienced or heard of anyone having multiple capsules stuck like this? Is this an emergency issue or could it become one? I will be talking to my doctors office tomorrow I'm sure, but in the mean time, I'm a little nervous about everything."

I finally scheduled myself an appointment with a gastroenterologIst in the fall and he conducted his own EGD and colonoscopy, which again showed nothing. He finally ordered a third capsule endoscopy, which I completed about 2 weeks ago.  His nurse practitioner called me today and said that there is an ulcer in my small intestine along with another stricture. She said that my capsule came to a stop in my small bowel and was worried that it might be stuck, so she ordered an x-ray for me to get quickly along with some additional blood work. After taking the x-rays, the tech informed me that there are THREE foreign objects inside of my small bowel. When I told him about the capsule studies, he confirmed that that is what he saw - all THREE of them from over this past year, stuck inside me.  I'm waiting on the doctor's office to receive the report and contact me to see what I need to do from here. So now, I'm not only worried of what condition is causing all of this, but I now have to worry about the 3 capsules inside my small bowel. How did the previous doctor not notice that the capsule came to a halt during BOTH studies and maybe suggest getting an x-ray to make sure I passed them. I feel like a fool for not taking it upon myself to check it out.  My question is: has anyone ever experienced or heard of anyone having multiple capsules stuck like this? Is this an emergency issue or could it become one? I will be talking to my doctors office tomorrow I'm sure, but in the mean time, I'm a little nervous about everything."

I do feel completely normal, else than slight bloating. No pain or anything unusual at all. I do consume alcohol more than I should, but stopped for 1.5 weeks without any change. Never had this before, and condition persisting for about 2 months is getting concerning. I eat well, with good amounts of fibre, low processed or junk foods, lots of water, been taking probiotics (mostly yoghurt). I exercise regularly in the gym 3 times a week. I don't have any other conditions, or allergies. I am health conscious, and full blood test done about a year ago without issues. Work is stressful, but no more than it has been previously."

I’m starting to lose interest in my major, though I know I love it and it’s what I want to do for a living. I think I have some form of depression and anxiety. I don’t know how to seek help, and I don’t want my family to get involved but I’m on they’re insurance, and I don’t want to have to pay a whole bunch of money because that will make me feel worse if anything. Where do I go from here?"

Sometimes the diarrhea has blood in it, sometimes it doesn't. This diarrhea also comes along with occasional episodes of constipation. My stomach always seems to be hurting. Another huge part of this is that ever since the diarrhea started, I have been feeling incredibly tired. So tired that I have actually had to take a semester off of college because I was so exhausted all the time for no reason. My stomach is constantly very loud and embarrassing and the diarrhea has gotten to the point where I can't eat anything unless a bathroom is close by. I made an appointment with a GI doctor but their earliest wasn't until the end of April. Does this sound like Irritable Bowel Syndrome? I'm just going off of internet research and I know that only a doctor can help me for sure, but I do want to get some idea of what's going on with me because it's annoying and painful."

I haven't heard anyone say anything about shortness of breath or the problem of trying to ""catch my breath"" with those problems. I've had this uncomfortable experience with what seems to be bloating in the upper stomach for about 5 days now. It has been so uncomfortable that I have not been able to sleep at night. I got about 3 hours of sleep last night because I was trying to ""catch my breath."" It's like I can't ""complete"" a breath. I will exhale and try to inhale and am always cut short of completing the breath. When I start to drift off to sleep, I abruptly awaken. I'm not sure if this experience is related to my bloating or IBS and how to remedy the breathing. I take omeprasole, ondasetron, take probiotics when I have them, I've had a cup of Kefir every day for the last 3 days, and I eat a cup of yogurt every day. Does anyone have any thoughts or other remedies for this experience? I also take a Miralax generic for constipation due to use of prescribed morphene."

It was an unpleasant feeling of course that lasted through the evening with me having no appetite. What I find odd is that it pretty much completely disappears by around 8PM every time! Now about a week later I'm still experiencing this which is why I came here seeking help. I've been spending hours on the internet to find the cause for this but can't seem to figure it out. People say it could be GERD, ulcer, anxiety, parasite etc but I'm not too sure as my symptoms matches every one of those. In addition to the gagging and no appetite, I also feel extremely fatigued all the time and sleep does not help it. I went to the doctors yesterday and he told me it was the ""stomach flu"" and ordered a blood test so I'll see the results in about a week. In the mean time, I've made a list of my lifestyle choices to find the culprit. 1) I'm a frequent marijuana smoker for only a couple months as it helps with my ADD more than Adderall; 2) I've been prescribed Adderall for years but that has never made me feel like this and I prefer marijuana anyways so I don't use it as often; 3) The Adderall makes me skip meals sometimes like once every week; 4) I'm ashamed to say this but I've been downing like 12+ gummy vitamins everyday for the past 2 months (I THINK THIS MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT). I've been researching the symptoms of vitamin overdose and it sounds like what I've been having. Could vitamin overdose make me gag in the morning then subside at night and could it affect me for this long (a week)? Like many others who have gag reflex problems, it affects almost every aspect of life and I just want it gone. Any responses would be much appreciated."

There's no comparison between her and her sister (or anyone I've ever known). This happens day and night and is uncontrollable. I'm afraid it's a sign of a major digestive problem. She has been tested to be lactose and gluten intolerant (severe), so her mother cooks every meal and we avoid those foods as well as nearly anything packaged. So she has a very balanced, healthy diet. She rarely drinks soda, etc. She occasionally complains of burning reflux into her throat. She also complains of stomach pain. That could be bloating/cramping I guess. Her stool generally looks normal - no diarrhea unless she's sick. I'm wondering if she has something like SIBO. We recently started her on a high quality probiotic. No change in symptoms yet.  We haven't taken her to a pediatric GI doc yet, as we are afraid the doctor will just try to treat her symptoms. We want to find the root cause so she won't have life long medical issues. Please help."

In the beginning, it used to be due to a small case of OCD, but later on, it was due to fear that stopping it might affect my studies. I recently stopped it, around 3 weeks ago. And a couple of days afterward, I started experiencing some serious nausea and dizziness. If I move my head in a different direction, or decide to look somewhere else, I will get this sudden dizziness, which will almost immediately go away, but a mild feeling of wanting to vomit will remain throughout the day. The same dizziness seems to appear if I suddenly see a bright light. All these symptoms make day to day work impossible, and even lying down it bed can be nauseating. The doctor who prescribed the Setraline back in the day advised me to go back to the medication, but another doctor suggests that it could just be an ear infection, and prescribed Stemetil to help relieve the dizziness. It barely helps. Has anyone else taken Sertraline for long periods of time and suffered from issues after stopping it? Are there any recorded withdrawal symptoms associated with Sertraline. I wish to know because even if I do start taking Sertraline again just to get rid of the dizziness now, how much longer will I have to take it?"

Honestly I've been feeling this way for a while and needed to let it all out. A few years ago I was sad and to this day now I still feel that way so I said to myself that I was depressed. In class when I have to speak in front of my class or even just one person I don't know I get so nervous; my breathing becomes irregular, my hands start to shake, my heart starts beating so fast and I find it so hard to function. Along with that I also get extremely angry and rage out at people who come my way. Usually I have my burst out and get mad at every little thing but when I've calmed down I reflect on what just happened and think to myself, ""Did I seriously do that?"". About 1-2 years ago I also began to isolate myself from others, I think I got fed up with the people around me and decided to not involve myself with them. Recently I haven't been feeling anything; it's rare. Of course I feel but I bottle it all up because I have this thought in my head that if I feel, I'll be considered a little ***. But if there is a possibility that I do let it all out I usually go over the top if that makes any sense. Another thing that has been happening recently is that I have some nights where I get no sleep at all or I oversleep. Yesterday when I got home from school(2:00 p.m) I went straight to bed and didn't wake up till today at 6 because of school but if i didn't have classes today I'm pretty sure I would've woken up later on just like it happened a few days ago. Sometimes in school I feel that it's difficult for me to concentrate or to even remember what I was taught. At other times I ramble on my words so much I don't even know what I'm saying. There are also some other things going on in my head. I kind of have these voices in my head, like in the cartoons when they have the angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other. In certain situations like decision making or something I hear one of them telling me to do the right thing and the other telling me to the the wrong thing and then there's me, I contemplate on what I should do but most of the time I end up doing the right thing. Another thing is that recently I've been hearing and seeing things that are not there when I check again, it's so weird because I swear on my life what I saw or heard was true. I honestly don't know what's going on with me and it's been happening for quite a while. I know only a professional can diagnose me with something but does anyone have an idea on what I might be?"

The process is expensive and the force you to have a transvaginal uttrasound and give you 24 hour to “think about it” before you can have an abortion.  While researching online I found a women’s group that sold the abortion pill and after a few unsuccessful attempts at ending the pregnancy myself ( taking high doses of vitamin C and hot baths) I ordered the pills. The doctor thought it might have originally been twins but one had absorbed the other and perhaps the other fetus was a molar pregnancy ( either the sperm or egg was blank with no DNA so not a baby) They did an ultra sound at 9 weeks and noticed a blood clot. When the pills arrived I waited until our day off and took them. I saw the baby come out. Well, I saw bones. I put them in a bag and came out of the bathroom shaking.  I remember that Comfortably Numb was playing on the radio. I was alone in the room and I cried. For the first time I realized I killed a baby. I didn’t regret my decision but its different when you are a part of whats going on instead of lying back and letting a doctor do it.  Then the bleeding started. Everything went ok at first but after a while I started to bleed heavily. The package said I would bleed so I rode it out.  Until I passed out. I would pass out 2 more times before I told Billy to call an ambulance. When I got to the hospital I had to have 2 units of blood. Eventually they found tissue in my cervix that was not allowing it to close. I was in the hospital for 2 days.  It has stayed with me and haunted me since then. Everything seemed to go down hill after that. I didn’t want to be around people anymore. I never told anyone what happened and I felt that people would hate me if I did. I has an abortion before but this was different. I ended it myself and it was violent. And I did that. Not a medical procedure. Me. And it tore me up. I just didn’t realize how much for a while.  This is when everything started to fall apart.  I didn't want to be around people, I alienated all my friends. I started isolating myself and missing work until I lost the job I had had for 5 years, and then the job after that, and the one after that. It has steadily gotten worse and worse.  In March I had a break down and was hospitalized. Seeing the doctor there I was told that she believed I had major depressive disorder. I was glad at first because I thought that FINALLY I was going to be able to feel normal again. It never happened and I am more depressed now than ever.  My youngest child is 16 and she moved out to live with her father because the University she wants to attend is near him... 2500 miles away from me.  My mother has been bed ridden for almost 2 years after failed mesh from a hernia surgery has cost her her stomach and has just recently had reconstructive surgery but is still a long way away from getting better. As a matter of fact, we live each day worried about leaks, and bleeding and infection that might cost her her life.  My father has heart problems and in the midst of all the problems my mother is having, had to have triple bypass.  about a year and a half ago we were offered a house for rent by my brother in law and right in the bog middle of all of the family crisis, he decides he wants to sell the house and gave us 3 months to pack up and get out.  That was all I could take an I just snapped.  I was at work when my brother in law gave me the news and I lost it. I drove to my parents house to get a gun. My mom was in the hospital and dad was with her. When I got there the key to the guns was not where it usually was. In desperation I started tearing apart drawers trying to find it. After about 10 minutes I look up and see the damage I have down looking for it and I realized what I was doing and called for help.  After the hospital I had to stop working which has put us in hard times financially so a month ago I went back to the same job, working at a pet store but I am not a manager anymore and I only work 20 hours a week to try to keep my stress levels down but even now I get up 4 hours before I go in at 8am because I have to cry, and throw up several times before I can talk myself into leaving the house, alone, for 4 freaking hours. I can't handle 4 hours and that makes me feel like a failure. This has also made it really hard for me to see the doctor and get my meds because of the cost. I manage them but I have nothing left over to see a therapist so I ride out each day waiting for it to end and go to bed every night hoping that tomorrow will be the day I start building my life again but that day never comes. I've tried all kinds of scripts, Supplements, Medical Cannabis, CBD, nothing has worked and sometimes I don't know if I am depressed or if my life is just overwhelming and it's normal to feel this way.  I wish I was dead every single day.  I am trying to get disability hoping that it will afford me the time and money to throw myself into getting better. I guess I want to know how you cope?

Still no idea what's wrong.  As I suffer.","Hello. My name is Lindsey. I am 34 years old and have 3 beautiful children. I'm new on here. I've lost hope. Close to jus giving up. Between the migraines and recent diagnosis of venous anginoma. And my skull sits too low on my spine. So, I deal with that. Although, I'm having a hard time dealing with what's going on in my GI track. For the past couple years, drs thought the pain and sickness was from endometriosis And cysts on my ovary. Ok. I get a cyst removed. Not it. A year later, another removed. Later, an ovary removed. Then they decided it's time to remove my female parts. They put me on birth control to help with the cysts. Only for me to get pregnant. Because I'm sick all the time I can hardly take care of the two children I have how am I going to take care of three. But being the person I am I keep the baby. As my tummy grew larger I was about seven months pregnant and I noticed on the ultrasound a huge mass. I asked the ultrasound lady what that was and her response was ""I'm not sure I brought that to the nurses attention last time it looks like it is on your colon, but they said there's nothing they can do about it until baby is born."" Once baby was born you could not see it anymore I don't know if it's because you could only see it because my stomach was larger or what. Problems continue and then they removed my female parts. Well problems continue but they are actually worse. I am on week three with no bowel movement. I've done for animals to suppositories I've drink the stuff they told me to and nothing. To the hospital twice did their enema and nothing. It feels like I have the flu all the time. It disrupts my life time with my children and my fiancé. And when I don't feel like this I have a migraine. I get weak I lose weight I'm nauseated feverish dizzy lightheaded. I get drainage from my rectum. Some doctors are saying am I have IBS I feel like it's something different. My potassium drops often I've been to the hospital three times for her getting critically low to 2.0 Almost die from it I went to a G.I. doctor he told me I had high enzymes for pancreatic cancer. Told me I need to get my esophagus stretched out every four months since it closes sometimes when I eat. I did all the tests. My pancreas is fine. Every time I go in when I'm having a flareup and in pain and sick they tell me I need to poop Like really! I know I need to, but I can't! There is literally nothing in my rectum, so I can't go in there to get it out! Its not like it's packed in my rectum where I can just get it out. I jus don't know what to do any more. Does anyone else have this problem?? I went to get a colonoscopy done. But the prep dropped my potassium and had to call an ambulance. My kidney was in excruciating pain!

My best friend tries but it's not the same. I just want someone to look at me with some love and listen to me when I have a bad day. I'm going crazy by the day, I talk to myself more and I skip dinner or eat in my room where I can be alone and away from family and social events. I cry myself to sleep sometimes and snap at my sister's for nothing cause I get so angry when I'm sad and I create these personas for myself where they feel no pain and the world is black and white.

Precisely, I completed my MSc degree in Data Science and Analytics in Cardiff and I've struggled to get into a job since then.  I was offered a phd degree studentship at the University of Liverpool however I wasn't really into furthering my studies and I'm not a big fan of academia. So I remained so undecided and suddenly fear and worry for my future creeped in. I lost my sleep, my appetite, and lost weight too. I got severely stressed and burdened with how I would go about my future, got envious of colleagues who had already defined their career paths.  When I discovered CBT, I adopted a number of techniques which did help alongside self-help like physical activity and joined a volunteering organization for a month.  Sadly I suffer relapses mostly because of sleep disorder, I wake up only a few hrs into my sleep then get fear of will I remain like this forever and so many other negative thoughts creep in which sinks my day. Please advise the best natural remedies to insomnia and way I can effectively overcome my illness. Thanks Micheal"

I have had abdominal pain for at least twenty years now, have had five colonoscopies and a sigmoidoscopy to be told I have ibs and there is no treatment for it. I have done the fodmap diet to find out I am sensitive to lactose,gluten,garlic,onion I don't eat red meat so my diet is severely restricted . But it upsets me so much knowing my pain is real but when my doctors say are you stressed I feel the believe it is all in my head. Please does anyone else feel like this ?????"

It has gotten especially worse for me recently though. I have always had to take a shower immediately following a bowel movement, and that routing usually took 1.5-2 hours. Now the whole thing takes me anywhere from 3.5-5 hours. Anyways, when I wipe, I use baby wipes. They get me much cleaner and it's much more comfortable on my skin back there than toilet paper or other wipes, which don't get me clean enough. Now at the end of my wiping routine, I am going in deep into my hole, and the wipes either just have blood on them, or they have blood plus a sort of mucus looking clear substance. It's usually spread out no further than the size of a penny, but most of the time it is smaller than that. So my question is, what is this clear substance? When I see it on the wipe, it makes me think I am not clean enough, so I have to wipe until I see only blood alone on the wipe, or nothing at all. This has caused my BM/wiping process to get much longer than it used to be. Is there any kind of fecal matter contained in the clear stuff? Is there any reason for me to feel unclean if I were to stop wiping once I only see blood and clear stuff? For further information, I will say it's probable that I have some form of IBS, although I have never been diagnosed as such. My BMs are usually solid, although I have the occasional loose stool probably once a week, with diarrhea happening around 3-4 times per month. I frequently have stomach cramps, which I take a GasX in response to, but this seems to have limited efficacy. I recently (as in this past week) started taking a probiotic supplement again. I took a daily probiotic in the past, and it seemed to help somewhat, but I got off of it probably midway through 2016. I tried a different brand, it says it has a billion cultures per serving so I hope that will help me. Anyways, my main question/concern here is the clear stuff in my anus. Any comments or suggestions will be greatly appreciated, as this could really have an impact on the time I have to spend in the bathroom every day."

Your stomach cannot move solid food. I am on mostly liquids. There are medications for this and tests to make sure. I have not had luck with the med school, and have not yet had any major tests done. I think you should ask your doctor if this could be a possibility. It's horrible not being able to eat. This illness (gastroparesis) is chronic and lifelong. I hope you figure out what's going on."

I'll try to make it as short as possible. Throughout my childhood, i've NEVER had any stomach issues. I was always able to eat any and everything and be fine no matter what. No allergies or intolerances, i loved food and i'd eat an entire jar of edys ice cream within one day. I'd get occassional stomach aches but i would be able to drink some ginger ale and shake it off within a matter of hours. Even that was rare. i've always had anxiety but that never truly affected me. Now, when i was 15, which was toward the ending of 2013, I caught a really bad stomach virus for the first time. After about a few days i still wasnt able to shake it off and even water was making me sick. WATER. So with that i lost about 10lbs. Which is alot because i am tiny anyhow. I was suffering for WEEKS with nausea vomiting and abdominal pain. Then i finally saw a g.i and planned an endoscopy begining of 2014. They found that my stomach lining had scars due to excessive acid and they pretty much chalked it down to acid reflux. OMEPRAZOLE had little effect and i was on it for months. Then i got allergy tested and it was found that i was lactose intolerant (Never had any problems with dairy before) Switched to an organic diet and i still had bloating and nausea even after eating a little bit. 2015 i was fine. still not 100%, but fine.  Last year 2016 I randomly had an unexplainable flare up around my birthday, March. I was still organic but occasionally i'd cheat. Even grapes and water was making me sick/nauseous and i had severe belly pain. It took me almost two months to feel at least a little well, but the symptom that has stuck with me was early satiety. Even half a sandwhich would make me feel full and bloaty. Fast forward to this past november, i wake up one morning and literally everything made me sick. I tried to force feed myself because I know i have to eat but it only made matters worse and with that, i havent had a full meal since early november. Then i started noticing that food i never had a problem with before, magically became a problem (Such as rice, bread, meat, soup) basically EVERYTHING. i was living off crackers cookies and juice. NOW JANUARY,  starting on JANUARY 1ST, i caught ANOTHER BAD STOMACH VIRUS THAT THREW MY SYSTEM FOR A LOOP. I literally havent ate much since then and ive lost 20lbs, now im 99lbs. ive only had water, popsicles, cheerios (which made me sick) and sunflower seeds. I was starting to feel better last friday. I was still nauseous after eating CLEAR SOUP. CLEAR SOUP!!!!!!!. However, one of my doctors insisted that I had functional ibs dyspepsia since every test came out NEGATIVE, she insisted my anxiety was part of the problem, so they decied to prescribe me zoloft 50 mg. BIG MISTAKE. I had the WORST reaction EVER to that stuff and since then, i felt sick to my stomach, dizzy, headachey, twitchy, agitated etc. I havent ate since the night  i took that second dose (friday). Of course I discontinued it but now I feel even more anxious and depressed than ever before. I tried to eat yesturday but my body started feeling sick and i started shaking.  I JUST WANT THIS TO END.

I was admitted and had 7 major surgeries in 11 days saved my life. I was hospitalized for 33 days. I came home and had to relearn how to walk again. Moving forward to 2016 and I again had gangrene in my foot. I ended up with MRSA and an amputation below my knee. 2015 I went blind in my left eye and contracted Chronic kidney disease. This year in April I got really sick. I went to the hospital and was told that I had a heart attack sometime in the past. I didn't know it or felt it. I was sent to a different hospital that had a great cardiologist there. I found out there that I had to have a triple bypass surgery. I went through that and they cleared out 97% of the blockage. I live alone so they thought I would be better off in a nursing home and rehab center. The surgeon sent me there 5 days after the surgery. I was at the nursing home for about 5 days and went into heart failure. I was rushed back into the hospital and had to take a few dialysis treatments because I had went into renal failure. They gave me 2 blood transfusions. I was sent back to the nursing home to restart my physical therapy. Altogether I was gone from home for 5 months. I've been having nightmares every night about surgeries and dying. It has made me to the point I'm scared of going to the doctor's office or the hospital for anything. I feel stupid talking about this but I need help to get over it.

I'm 14 years old, and now I'm going to do the cliche thing where I lost my mental health issues in the attempt that someone else will relate and I'll be less alone. I have OCD, GAD, SAD, Panic Disorder, and Depression. Long list, yay. My parents don't believe in mental health issues, I'm only in therapy because the hospital (physical, not mental) said I had to be. And they don't believe when I say I'm in pain, mental or physical. They don't believe, or they just tell me it's ""good"" or to ""shake it off"".  Last night, my dog ate a lot of chocolate and died, and it was my fault. I left it out, and she does because of me. Everything I touch dies. Plants, relationships, and now this. I can't leave my bed. Can't get the energy to move around. It took me a couple hours to decide to do this. I just don't want to be alone, but I can't touch anyone because that'd kill them too. I can't do anything right, and no one cares. It's all much fault."

She has undergone everything in her life from the time that she was a child from a domineering and overbearing mother who was unhappy with her own life and ultimately divorced from her husband, my friends birth father, to being the classic female middle child in a three sibling lower middle class household during the 70's/80's/90's, to not fitting in that well during junior high and high school and beginning at that time to use drugs and alcohol as a social lubricant and early self-medication during her late teenage years. She was, and still is an extremely beautiful girl and woman - inside and out (I have known her since she was 10 years old and I was 12, having moved to the Pacific Northwest at that age and becoming best friends with her oldest brother, who is my age - that being 44 years old...) - I say this because, as is far too often the case with women in general, and attractive women at that, she suffered some VERY extreme sexual assault in her 20's, as well as sexual advances from close family members at several different points in her life. Compounding what I personally believe were long standing and preexisting mental health diagnoses due to genetic and environmental factors, she continued and escalated substance use and abuse at various points in her life as well. She has had some periods of what most of us may consider success on the financial, social, and personal levels - however they are few and far between in comparison to the times in her life that have led to the point that she is at now. I should mention that since I myself have managed to screw my own life up quite well and am just now in the process of (for the first time) actually doing the things that I need to do for myself as well as for any possible other person that I have a relationship with - I knew her on a personal level (she was my first unrequited love FYI...) from the age of 12 to 20 and from the age of 20 to 43, we were out of each others lives completely. It has only been in the last year that we have been together and I very, very, VERY truly love this woman (who I still think of as the sweet, smart, and beautiful girl that I fell in love with as a kid...) more than any other person on the face of this planet. The reason that I stated what I did in the last paragraph is mainly to establish the specifics of our relationship (or lack thereof...) over the last 32 years of our lives. I understand the whole co-dependency issue that we both have, and though I haven't mentioned details of my own life without regard to her, I will also say that I myself am diagnosed with several mental health disorders including Bipolar Depression, Social Anxiety Disorder, ADD, and OCD all stemming from mental and emotionally based PTSD - and I am intelligent enough, even as a layman in the field of psychology to understand that two 'broken' people (for lack of a better word...) will be fighting an extremely uphill battle in a relationship - particularly one that has the dynamics of ours!  That said, since this already so long, let me get right to the point (yeah right... LOL) She has self-medicated with just about every illicit and legal drug that adjusts, for better or worse, the big three (as I call them) neurotransmitters in our brains - being dopamine, norepinephrine, and seratonin. Opiods, stimulants/amphetamines, benzodiazepines, alcohol etc... She has tried various combinations of prescribed medications as well as various different voluntary attempts at treatment for co-occurring disorders on and off since her early twenties. She has had minimal success and has always (sooner or later) relapsed into chemical dependency and progressively worsening mental health. She is diagnosed (she tells me) with what is know as refractory (treatment resistant) depression and thus the effectiveness of conventional treatment, particularly what can be afforded on the state medicaid insurance level have all proven next to fruitless. She is a single mother of a ten year old boy who himself suffers from depression/anxiety, add, and the general things that come along with the exposure to the life that he has had thus far. In the last three years she has had four MAJOR trauma's to compound her already long standing and serious issues. Those being the loss of her father (who was the most important and understanding figure in her life!), the loss a child (due to being still born), the loss of her beloved dog (who was her long time companion of more that 10 years), and most recently the suicide of her last boyfriend (he killed himself while incarcerated). She has been abusing a potent dextroamphetamine/amphetamine prescription by binge taking doses anywhere from 60mgs to over 100mgs several times each day over the course of a week each month, and experiencing an EXTREME lack of sleep and REM function - as well as since I have been with her, at least, she has been suffering from every single classic symptom of schizophrenia that I have seen on this website. I am not sure if this (and this is BY FAR the biggest hurdle that I am facing in my attempts to get her to want to help herself and get a higher quality of help than what the State of Washington can provide!) is due to amphetamine drug induced psychosis, or is the manifestation of preexisting and developing schizophrenia over the course of some or all of her life. In closing I just want whoever may take the time to read this all (hopefully qualified medical personnel...) that she has recently begun talking about taking the next steps that she must to survive much longer, that being inpatient treatment. She is suicidal at times. She is on the verge of homelessness. She believes that I do some of the most horrible things to her. She is on SSDI and a small grant from the state in lieu of her unpaid child support, meaning her income totals $1,150 monthly plus $200 in food benefits to support herself and her son. I make $14 an hour as an inside sales rep and due to required weekly appointments myself and things I doing to better my own life, as well as walking and taking the bus to all of this - I am only working part time at this time. I say these things because SHE NEEDS MORE MODERN AND EFFECTIVE MEDICAL AND MENTAL HELP THAN CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT AND 12 STEP PROGRAMS CAN PROVIDE. Without the financial resources to do so, I honestly believe that she may be dead or institutionalized in the near future. I love her with each and every fiber of my being and will do ANYTHING that I am capable of to help her. I have not always been the best support for her as I haven't fully understood what I believe to be the full picture until recently - and due to personal problems between us and the chaos of living with her this past year - I have been unequipped to deal with things properly and in the best way for her and her son.  So, if anyone out there can offer any advice on how we might get the next level of help so desperately needed - I would most likely owe you my own life - not to mention hers. Thanks so very much for your time and attention on all of this! Damn it is long... Please email me directly to   - Thank you."

I was referred to a rhemotologist at the possibility of having lupus or another autoimmune problem, she tested and found high Immunoglobins E and referred me to GI as she said she could do nothing else. I was so thankful for the GI doctor I got, as he apologized for having been passed around so much. Began testing, first colonoscopy/endoscopy, finding irritation and a precancerous polyp but no celiac or crohns. Tested gallbladder, was normal. Did elimination diet to test for food allergies, no significant findings. Have recently had a SIBO breath test and abdominal CT and waiting on results. I am currently taking pantoprazole, IB &FD gard, Carafate, ranitidine, probiotics as well as ondansetron and diclocymine as needed. My condition flares and ceases consistently, and currently the biggest problems are the digestive mentioned above, extreme fatigue (can sleep 11 straight hours, wake up, and three hours later I am exhausted) , cold intolerance, and cough. My family history includes crohns disease, graves disease, heart defects and skin cancer. We are struggling to find an answer and my body is growing tired. Any ideas are appreciated!"

My mother is a nurse, so we have a habit of just ""toughing it out"", but I am beginning to get a little worried, considering how the problem has progressed and how long it has persisted. When I have a BM I experience a sharp pain in the rectal area, and bright red blood. The bleeding has been getting progressively worse over the past year to the point where tonight, after passing stool, a few drops of blood dripped into the toilet, and there was a substantial amount of blood on the toilet paper. Also, recently i have been able to feel a small bump near the anus. It is fairly small and hard. At first I thought hemorrhoids, but the symptoms only occur when having a BM. No pain, itching, or anything at any other time. This leads me to believe that it may be something more serious! I would be super embarrassed to go to the doctor and it just be hemorrhoids, but I am scared it could be something else.

This time it persisted and I also got back pains(middle/upper back) and abdominal pain(both upper and lower abdomen and also on the sides), as well as nausea. I went to my GP and after palpation she diagnosed me with gastritis and put me on esomaprazone and other acid inhibitors.

It started off with constant burning the burning would be worse after a burp. I tried over counter medicine which didnt work for me at all. My friend with who i went gym with said he has acid reflux and gave me few PPI tablets to try omeprazole which gave me such a great relief. He said he usually takes a course and hasnt got problems for months with me it was different, its been over a year now and if i dont take a tablet i struggle to cope. It usualy takes 2-3 up to a week for the burning to come back after i stop taking the tablet. I also realised that even if i do take a tablet and drink on the weekend i will still wake up with the burning sensation above my stomach as i said its worse when i burp after i burp its like some acid is going out above my stomach. I recently started feeling nauseas i dont know but i also have health anxiety so anything happening to me i think straight away that its cancer. But i read it could be the nausea from taking of the omeprazole. It doesnt happen much sometimes at all sometimes during the day usually around 3-6 oclock i feel this vomiting feeling for some reason. I have also realised that it happend to me twice after heavy drinking i would vomit coffee grounds or some blood but i dont vomit at all if i dont drink. I have read that all that stuff is GERD symptoms.

Mental illness does run in my family (two suicides in recent generations) and I've always struggled with self esteem and self worth because of my childhood. I had a mother who was cold and unemotional and never stood up for me with my older siblings who ganged up on me most of my youth. I had an amazing dad who I lost when I was only 20. I was raised in the church and believed that suicide was an unforgivable sin; otherwise, I guarantee you, I'd have ended things in my teens.  I'm the mother of three incredible young men who are pretty much grown and don't need me anymore. I'm married to a man who I always thought was my soulmate, but who has a drinking problem that he can't quit. We also have issues with his adult son who is a drug addict and has cost us both thousands of dollars over the years. I have tried to get my husband to quit drinking. He'll admit he has a problem and cut back for a while and things will be decent, but then he'll ramp it back up again to the point where it disrupts my sleep the way he flails and twitches in bed and snores like you have no idea. It also turns him into an obnoxious kid, even though he's fifty. And when I call him on it, he can turn mean. Not physically abusive, but he'll yell and slam things.  I've been feeling emotionally weaker the past few years, likely from dealing with the physical pain of my jobs for the last 25 years. When things go south with him, I feel like nothing will ever get better. I either want to take off to parts unknown and leave everyone behind (except my children, who are the only thing that keep me here). I feel hopeless.

I am a 27 year old female (in the UK) who for as long as she can remember has had trouble when going for a poo. At the moment, if left alone I will only go every 4-5 days or so at best. As a result, I am in constant discomfort. I also have a very sensitive stomach and gastritis so normal laxatives and a number of herbal ones from Boots etc cause me cramps and pain and aren’t a good solution. Basically, anything with Senna will cause me pain, which seems to be the ingredient in most natural/herbal laxatives. I generally have a very good diet, high in vegetables and fibre so I am assuming this isn’t the cause. Some of the things that do NOT work for me include: - Hot water in the morning (with/without lemon) - Teas/coffees or any hot drinks(esp. green tea with peppermint – still nope!) - Dried fruit (sometimes it works, but causes cramps and pain!) - Regular exercise - Fibre powders (e.g. Fybogel) - Green/alkaline veg I was wondering if you guys had any recommendations for me based on this? I know there are solutions out there, because after seeing an acupuncturist, she gave me some herbal pills that were absolutely magical. Unfortunately, she won’t tell me their name are as she wants to sell them to me and make her margin, which is fair enough. I am completely open to any alternative medicines and will also look into any Chinese medicine/remedies for this. Please help me poo! Thanks so much"

I wanted to and would have kept working longer if not for being laid off. I was seeking part time employment and was offered a position of 20 hours per week. I was unable to accept this position as I just found out that I am going to need hip replacement surgery and it is scheduled for September. This position was just seasonal from July thru January and I really wanted to work but could not in good faith start working and then telling the employer that I needed to have surgery. It took me so long to find a position. I asked the surgeon if I cold put it off for 6 months but he stated that it was not a good idea. When I told this employer that I was unable to take the position and why I was told to call them when I am recovered as they were really interested in hiring me. I am terrified to have this surgery as I am so afraid that I am going to due during surgery or have some complications, but I need to have this surgery so that I can walk again and enjoy life as right now I use a cane to get around and am told that this surgery will make me totally functioning again. I have been reading online about this surgery and the reviews from people who have gone through this procedure and some are good and some are bad and this is not helping me at all. I am so stressed out and worried about our financial situation as we really could have used the extra income as it is so difficult living on a fixed income and my husband and myself are not that well off. Also my husband has bypass surgery this past January and he has recovered very well but I still worry about him. Then we lost several thousand of dollars in one of our investments due to miss-management and there is a class action lawsuit that is pending. Then we had an issue with the IRS and had to obtain a tax accountant to handle for us. It is just one thing after another and it never seems to end and I have a history of depression and all of this has not helped one bit and I just have so much anxiety and cannot stop obsessing about this surgery. My husband was going to start looking for part time work but now with what is happening with me it will be hard for him to work right now as I am going to need some care for awhile. my dad is 90 and is in assisted living and I go there every Saturday and bring him personal items that he needs and also handle his finances as I am his POA along with taking him to all of his various doctors appointments. My sister lives in Florida and my brother is here in Cleveland but he works full time however even when I was till working full time I had to totally handle all of my Dad's needs, so once I have my surgery and am recovering it will be a while before I can help him once again, so it is going to be on my husband's shoulders to take care of my dad which is unfair to him even though he is very helpful and supportive to me and my Dad. I am just so very overwhelmed but all that has happened so far and what is yet to come. I really don't have any close friend that I can talk to and right now cannot afford counseling.

I'm a recovering alcoholic and an author, who is dedicated to working with suffering alcoholics to help guide them to recovery. I suffered through 10 relapses, each worse thanthe first, the last almost killed me. If not for my last horrific and fatal relapse from alcoholism, I wouldn’t have been able to summon the courage to openly share personal information about this disease. It was required of me to write the tell-all memoir of my 42-year horrific journey straight through terminal phase alcoholism; I ALMOST MURDERED A COMPLETE STRANGER. I did this with the purpose of trying to be a small part of saving another alcoholic’s life. I make no profit from this book. I donate all profits to a rehabilitation facility dedicated to helping addicts to recover. This link provides straight talk about alcoholism and relapse, and may well you if you have suffered from a relapse, or aren't sure how relapse fits into your recovery.      I hope this is of some help to any suffering from this horrible disease. Additional help can be found here: www.jimspina.com"

Especially if it helps me! First, I already vape, I have for about 5 years and it's the only thing that successfully got me off cigarettes.

I started to have a problems about 10 years ago. I received 20 mg omeprazol. Since then, almost without excessive was everything ok. In December 2016 i returned from vacation in Spain and i got pretty heavy heartburn, received 80 mg omeprazole, ranitidine and metoclopramide. No luck so far, my symptoms were worse and worse till my doctor said that he had heartburn too from bacteria. He is complete cured. No meds at all.  So I started to google and found some interesting facts. To make it shorter I found out that I have too little acid in my stomach not too much as doctors keep saying to me. Now I am more than month PPI free, everything is solved with vinegar and HCL in tablets.  If is someone interested in this topic and want to quit PPIs too, feel free to contact me. And I describe you my journey that should work for almost everyone. I can now eat chocolate, eat fried meals, tuna fish, etc.  And why should you quit PPIs? After years of using PPIs you are preparing your stomach for cancer, vitamin insufficiency, bone breaks etc. These meds ARENT so safe as doctors say!! It's only business (these drugs are the most sold meds overall) nothing more."

It has now been 3yrs and my issues and problems are only becoming worse and more severe and causing other medical issues such as vertigo episodes brought on from stress/anxiety/depression/lack of sleep. What are the long term effects for being on these meds on a daily basis for 17yrs? Will it ever get better? What kind of help can I get and what can I do? I've been to numerous doctors n specialist n nobody will help me because of my previous dependency on these meds. It's affecting my life in a negative way severely my job my family n the list goes on . I've even gotten to the point of feeling very suicidal and feel like no one will listen or talk to me about it or help me in anyway!! Please help

Afterwards it went well. Until 2010-11 when he was having more issues again. We went back to the doctor and found out the surgery had slipped also the hiatal hernia that was repaired needed to be repaired again too. They suggested surgery again, so we did. Right after the 2nd operation things weren't the same. He was having cramping in his stomach. Six weeks post op he went back for a check up the doctor informed him that they nicked his diaphragm during surgery. During this visit we explained his getting sharp abdominal pains after eating then vomiting / diarrhea. As the time went on , the symptoms never really left. Some weeks it happens once or twice. Some weeks it happens 5-7 days. We have changed his diet, tried ruling out certain foods. In 2013 we had more procedures (endoscopy/colonoscopy) and discovered that previous 2nd surgery is now completely undone as well. They told us he may have nerve damage from the surgeries, can not correct the slip anymore it could permanently paralyze his stomach. We are still in the same position, same symptoms. He has had his gallbladder checked, blood work, swallow test, GI tests, stool samples, etc. No positive answers. Now it is getting to the point he has issues when the cramping happens he can't get somewhere quick enough. Typical time frame for him is eat food within 20-30 min sometimes less he is sick. He was originally 160 lbs...now he can't get over 130lbs. He is 5'9"" and 43 years old. Were going back to the doctor next week (regular doc). Starting back at square one. Anyone ever had any experience or is there a doctor here anywhere that has heard of a cause?"

I could control my anxiety and keep it in check for years. I was fine, up until now. I had a panic attack a month ago and I had to go to the er to calm down. After that day at the er, I had trouble eating. Everything I ate, I gagged up. I stayed hungry for awhile and I was also in fear of another panic attack. This eventually went away. And then around July 2nd I had really bad anxiety one night and I couldn’t sleep at all. I tried eating but I couldn’t eat at all. I was hungry and scared. I ate some. The following night I got two hours of interrupted sleep. The next night I decided to go to the er and get something to calm me down. They gave me Ativan and it helped me sleep for 4 hours.

What should I do?,"I’ve had anxiety since I got into a traumatic accident when I was little. I broke my arm in three places. I was hospitalized and had surgery done. I suffered with panic attacks that lasted for hours. It felt I was admitted for three days but it was a whole week. After that I suffered with panic attacks outside of the hospital. I could control my anxiety and keep it in check for years. I was fine, up until now. I had a panic attack a month ago and I had to go to the er to calm down. After that day at the er, I had trouble eating. Everything I ate, I gagged up. I stayed hungry for awhile and I was also in fear of another panic attack. This eventually went away. And then around July 2nd I had really bad anxiety one night and I couldn’t sleep at all. I tried eating but I couldn’t eat at all. I was hungry and scared. I ate some. The following night I got two hours of interrupted sleep. The next night I decided to go to the er and get something to calm me down. They gave me Ativan and it helped me sleep for 4 hours. I tried sleeping last night and I only got about 2 hours. Tonight I’m in fear of having a panic attack, fear of not being able to sleep, and fearing that I cannot eat. I don’t know what to do.

As I got older my depression got worse and even as a teenager I was always feeling tired or fatigued even though I was active. I will admit for a time as a little kid I did do self harm by hitting myself or banging my head against the wall. I always had problems at school and at home. I self harmed extremely rarely as a teenager but at 16 there was one instance when I slurred my speech. I also had chest pains from stress but was told my heart was healthy after a e.k.g.

Thank you so much! Every year my family goes on vacation overseas and I have to take a plane. The problem is, I get extremely sick on the plane, NOT FROM MOTION SICKNESS. As I go deeper into the airport, I already feel uncomfortable. When going towards the plane on the aerobridge, I begin to feel much queasier from the ""airplane smell"" I start to feel very light-headed and nauseated as I approach the airplane. On bad years, I throw up even before stepping on the plane due to the smell. I try to breathe through my jacket to make the smell less intense. Once I am about to board the plane from the bridge extending from the airport, a wave of ""airplane smell"" hits me and I try to hold in my vomit. This is always futile, as I always throw up at least once before even taking off. This reaffirms the notion that it is not motion sickness. Throughout the flight, I experience flu-like symptoms: I vomit at least a dozen times, cannot get up from my seat, have a massive headache, and feel overall nauseated. Eating or drinking anything in the smallest quantities results in me throwing it up within seconds or minutes. I cannot eat or drink for a full 10 hours on my flight. When the meals are brought out, I feel even worse. Also, the smell of the blankets and the pillows provided makes me throw up as well. My theory on that is the compressed vacuum sealed air for both the food and the blankets. As I do not have motion sickness, my best guess to me ""disease"" to the smell of the plane is the compressed air that is in the cabin as I would not be able to breathe otherwise. All doctors I see locally have not seen a case remotely similar to mine and cannot think of anything to give to me to ease the pain, only generic Advil or something like that. We have tried all conventional methods used to ease sickness on the plane including every homeopathic medicine under the sun. As doctors cannot prescribe me anything, I have not tried any potent medicine. I would greatly appreciate anyone's help to aid me through my next flight. Thank you so much for reading this through!"

Since then, I have been to two GP's, a homeopathic doctor, a GI, a gyno, and an infectious disease doctor, none of whom can find the cause of this nausea.

On the 1st of February I had a massive panic attack and it left me with a weird sensation that has never left me since. I feel like nothing makes sense anymore. And I mean nothing. I feel like I don’t love my family anymore, or my friends. I had to go back home from university even though I really loved it. All my dreams, my goal, the things I wanted to do don’t mean anything anymore. I don’t see why people go to work, go to parties, how they can have fun. Life’s become so flat and bleak I can’t physically feel trapped. I feel like I’m not myself anymore. All my memories feel distorted, as if I wasn’t myself. All the things I did and learnt and cared about are completely gone. They’re like sand. Both good and bad things. I’m not afraid of walking alone at night anymore, I don’t care if someone attacks me. Sometimes I wish someone killed me. All my values, my interests, my faith, everything just disappeared. I tried everything. I went to a psychiatrist and am currently taking some pills. But they don’t seem to be working that much. It’s been almost 5 months now and everyday going by I feel that my detachment increases. I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t read, I can’t watch movies, I can’t study. I’ve become the ghost of myself. I feel absolutely nothing, just this void. I’m so jealous of my friends that can go on with their life while I’m stuck in this bubble. I feel like I don’t know how to live anymore and I can’t imagine feeling any other way in the future. My doctor said all of this is part of the illness but if feels just too much, how can it be just part of the illness? Can someone relate to these particular feelings?"

Suffice to say, drinking the right amount of water and adding more fiber/greens hasn't helped me out. I've even been taking a broad spectrum probiotic, as recommended by my dietitian, but, again, no change to my bowel habits (I think taking the probiotic twice a day for several days made me feel sick, so I'm back to taking it only once a day). With all of this (which I've been working on for the greater half of this year), my dietitian decided I should try to cut out all dairy products for 3-4 weeks to see if I might have a dairy sensitivity (while intolerance causes diarrhea, she told me that a sensitivity can cause constipation). I started it yesterday after having tried out and chosen some dairy alternative products (her recommendation of pea-based Ripple Milk is great, as it has the same amount of protein as cow's milk, but isn't as sweet or watery as a lot of other alternative milk, and I found a dairy-free, plant-based ""butter"" that tastes just like butter...but I'll avoid any fake cheese like the plague, because what I tried tasted like sacrilege!).  BUT...on the morning of Day 2 (the day I am writing this post), I'm already feeling withdrawals. I feel a bit weak, even though I had a protein-rich snack and lunch (used Ripple Milk in my cereal for breakfast, so I got the same protein I would have gotten if it was cow's milk), foggy-headed (almost like a headache, but not really), and I am CRAVING sweets like no tomorrow. It sucks! Not to mention the agonizing realization that, during this trial period, I will have to avoid a lot of pastries and chocolate that are brought into my office (unless if someone had the heart to bring in Mighty-O donuts instead of Top Pot), and avoid all pre-made breakfast sandwiches served in any cafe, since cheese comes on them by default (and they are usually frozen/refrigerated, so the cheese can't be taken off before heating up). I mean...at least restaurants where they make their plates from scratch can honor a customer's request to not even add dairy products. It's only Day 2 and it's maddening to think how much food I love has dairy in it, even food that I honestly would never imagine would have dairy at all (same with things that have wheat/gluten - why add something extra to foods/drinks that has nothing to do with it? Which is why hard cider being labeled as ""gluten free"" cracks me up. But, no, I am not cutting out gluten, just dairy). And almost anything I see in grocery stores that has dairy taken out is labeled as ""vegan"" - I am not going vegan! I have nothing against eating animal byproducts! I just can't have dairy until the trial is over and I see if it made any difference. Can't things be just ""dairy-free"" instead of lumped up under the ""vegan"" label?? Well, anyway, that's my story, and I hope that perhaps people could give me some advice (besides what my dietitian already told me) on how to successfully get through the next 3-4 weeks...and how to treat the withdrawals I'm already experiencing. I should point out that I already take a Vitamin D supplement every day, since I get some seasonal blues with the lack of daylight."

I had just turned 21 and had started drinking alcohol, albeit in very small quantities and only once a week. My surgeon told me that I wouldn't be able to drink any alcohol again for years, that even 1 single drop would be enough to make me double over in pain. However I know people who have had the same surgery and they drink often and only waited months after the surgery to start drinking. Online I am seeing tons of people say its safe to start drinking again after only weeks. Did my surgeon lie to me? Is it safe for me to start drinking alcohol again, even if only in limited quantities? I am not trying to get drunk, I just want to be able to enjoy an alcoholic beverage every now and then."

I've been weaning myself slowly 2 yrs ago from 150 mlg, yr or so to 75mlg and about a year ago down to 37.5 mlg. I understand it could take weeks or months for the final withdrawal Understanding that I have purchased several of the recommended supplinents and give it the final go. I've been Venlaflaxine free for 7 days.  I highly recommend decreasing dosages slowly over time because the ""brain zaps"" are intolerable . Even at just 7 days off of the 37,5 mlg I have experienced most of the common withdrawal symptoms only to a much much tolerable degree. Adding some of these supplinents should be very helpful. Fish oil, Q10, B Complex, Ginger root, Magnesium Complex. Perhaps others. Not sure of the dosages in my case but a lot of the fish oil and ginger root had been recommended plus a lot of water, excercise. My Dr. is monitoring my withdrawal process. This has probably been my worst experience since my colon ruptured, surviving Sepsis the colectomy & colostomy followed by double Pulmonary embolisms and reattachment a year later. That was 8 years ago...but, now that I think about it that was much worse than this withdrawal thing."

For most of my life I've managed well with these symptoms, I have lived a very fulfilled and active young life so far (exercising regularly and travelling/going out with friends) with these episodes of physical difficulty only popping up here and there and never usually during the normal working day hours, in fact I would sometimes go weeks even months without feeling a thing and then they might come up again here and there, but would eventually subside into a 'dormant' state again.  In other words it has never bothered me or gotten in the way of me living, even when at the time it would feel uncomfortable and very unpleasant, once it was over life would go back to normal. Until now, around late December 2017 I was out with a friend and we took the train to an event and when we got off the train and began walking I felt strangely dizzy and out of breath, I then felt some discomfort around my left chest and my heart rate increased, causing a bit of pain in the upper left chest near the armpit.

I've gone through alot of CBT self help resources and even a CBT video course offered by my workplace, but they have been very limited in helping me, although I do feel slightly better by understanding how the thought process of a person works when panicked or anxious, the physical affects still remain and still give me great difficulty. As a person I have no real worries, I'm in a great job, have a very supportive and loving family and good friends too. I have hobbies that I enjoy and in general I've always just enjoyed life to the fullest till now, I feel like my life is at a standstill and has completely nose dived since feeling like this. When my symptoms are not as strong and I'm having a 'good day' where perhaps I find myself able to go out with friends/family or to work without much or any physical difficulty I feel like I'm close to myself again and almost instantly start feeling better, until they come up again and I fall right back into feeling upset/distressed and just not like myself.  I apologize that this is so long but I really needed to get this off my chest and explain myself in detail to get the best response :). Thank you all if you've made it this far, I just want to know what could be done about this? Is there a name for what I have? Is there a form of therapy and/or medication that can help me? Essentially I just want to feel back to normal and like myself again, free, happy and active, not trapped, distressed and physically uncomfortable. Thank you"

Had Barium swallow, showed some slowing in the esophagus with viscous foods. Had endoscopy and it showed weak muscles in esophagus. I'm not sure how you classify this, but he said there is not much to do. Just take small bites and chew well. He wants me to go for a manometry test which i think tests the contractions of the esophagus. He said its not Achalasia and the results also said my LES was opened.

I was given the drinkable contrast material an hour before, then was given the intravenous contrast materal during the final stage of the exam. I felt nauseated for a minute after it was injected, which was considered normal. After the MRI, I felt fine and ate a big lunch and went on with my day. However, about 2 hours later, I felt suddenly nauseated and had a bout of soft stool. I called the medical center and they advised I drink lots of water. I did so, and the nausea came and went throughout the afternoon. By this morning, I felt fine...until 10 am when I became nauseated yet again and had soft stool almost immediately. If this is a side effect of the contrast dye, I am seriously wondering what else I can do about it, and how long it will take to go away. I am a very small woman, 5’1” and 92 pounds, so I wouldn’t be surprised if I just am sensitive to it. I have no other side effects. Just really annoying nausea that’s going to ruin my weekend."

Currently, I am craving almost every kind of food I can think of (the most prominent one is peanut butter) and I want to just eat as much as I want. I have heard some people online say that it's normal and that it is your body's way of repairing itself after starvation and that you should give into the cravings and eat as much as you want. But I have heard others say that you shouldn't give into the cravings and if you have had a history of binge eating (which I have; I used to starve myself for the entire day and then binge eat later on) then it could be a recipe for disaster. I am going to see my doctor sometime next week and I was going to ask this same question but for right now I wanted some clarity on what is normal. Thanks!"

These thinking patterns reinforce negative thoughts or emotions. While it might seem that ways your mind can be misperceiving reality might be limitless, actually distorted thinking can be boiled down to 10 types. Whenever you find yourself following any of these 10 thought patterns, your brain is lying you and you may need help to redirect your thinking...but you can recognize this for yourself. Stop and question yourself, if you find thought looping in any of these patterns: 1. All-or-nothing thinking: looking at things as absolute where every thing is either black or white with no in-betweens.  2. Overgeneralization: thinking that how you feel right now is how you will feel always in a never-ending pattern of defeat. 3. Mental filter: going through life filtering out any positives in a situations and only seeing the negative aspect. 4. Discounting the positives: when something good happens you give credit to luck, a mistake or anything except your own ability to make good things happen for yourself in your life. 5. Jumping to conclusions: feeling you can mind-reading (assuming that people are reacting negatively to you) or tell fortunes (predicting that things will turn out badly). 6. Magnification or minimization: you focus on things in a way that either falsely makes them larger than they are or discounts them entirely. 7. Emotional reasoning: reasoning from how you feel “I feel worthless, so I may family would be better off without me."" 8. “Should” statements: internally criticizing yourself or other people with a set of unrealistic, false or make-up guidelines of how people should be/act. 9. Labeling: saying, “I shouldn't be alive,” or “I’m a loser,” when in truth you made a mistake or didn't get something perfect the first time. 10. Blame: blaming yourself for things you were not responsible for, or you blaming others or events when you contributed to a problem. If you find yourself caught in any of these thought patterns, your thinking is distorted not your whole life. If you change your thought, using cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, you will find. things will change."

Yesterday he began treatment at a local recovery center and has began Methadone treatment. He has had two doses at the clinic, I believe 30mg liquid. I can tell when he is on pills in several ways... his small pupils, his strained/raspy voice, full of energy, ""happy"" mood but very easily set off. Yesterday I kept checking in on him after his first dose at the clinic and he said he was very calm, more calm than ever before even when he is clean. But at the end of the day he was showing all the signs he does when he is on pills. He assured me he had not taken anything and that it was the Methadone. This morning he went and had his second dose. I've talked with him several times on the phone already and I hear his voice sounds like when he is on pills.  Does Methadone cause the same side effects as Hydrocodone and other opiates? From what I read while researching this is not supposed to be the case. I'm just concerned he may be mixing but he has assured me he is ready to get clean for good and would not risk taking anything because of the random drug tests at the clinic. If he fails one they stop treatment.

I feel that the medication is not helping. after I was told to wait a couple of months, still have not noticed a big difference. what feelings am I looking for? when I can not feel anything? has anyone had that feeling that you feel nothing? even when something is happy, or sad, you do not feel those feelings. it really upsets people that look at you with a confused face because I have a blank stare and feeling nothing. thinking of nothing, and feeling lost. walking around the mall, thinking of nothing. and just like a ghost walking around not even noticed by anyone. it is a very dark feeling that I can not explain to anyone. I just wish it would go away. and it has been like this for years. I don't remember a year that I havnt gone through this. I don't know what else to do anymore.

It wasn’t serious/long lasting. Every time my mom has the back pain, she put on a pain relief pad (those cheap kind you can get from Chinese pharmacies or Rite Aid. She used various kinds, and they seemed had worked in the past).  Now the pain relief pad doesn’t help anymore. The back pain (again in the lumbar spine area) is getting worse, and even her knees are getting pain as well. We went to different doctors (3 internal medicine (primary care provider), about 5 specialist including orthopedics, neurologist, physical therapist, acupuncturist, and cardiovascular doctors), no one is able to diagnose what exactly is wrong with her. Her situation is getting increasingly worse. Here are her symptoms and hope there’s someone on WebMD platform could offer some opinion or just point to a direction. She couldn’t sleep well at night for the past 5 or 6 months. She could only get 2-4 hours of sleep at night, no matter whether she works during the day or not. She started jut having the imminent back pain (lumbar spine area) here and there for the past year. Every time when she has it, she put on a pain relief pad and it helped. Now it doesn’t help anymore.  Her knees pain started two months ago. Her two legs (below knees part) are swollen sometimes since a month ago. Especially her feet. Her situation is getting worse, not her back & knees pain is getting worse, but she now cannot even stand without support for long than 5 minutes, cannot even turn in bed, cannot even get up from her bed to go to bathroom. Not to even talk about walking normally without support. She tried, but she collapse to the floor/ground. She got so many medical tests/exams: blood test, urine test, comprehensive ultrasound exam for the abdominal area, her two lags, cardiogram, X-Ray for lumbar spine and her knee bilateral, MRI for the lumbar spine (without gadolinium), nerves test (forgot the name), gastroscopy. No single exam found serious issues, or anything that may potentially cause her symptoms. Here are the major finds from the tests: MRI of the Lumbar Spine without gadolinium: At L5/S1, there are mild bilateral facet joint/ligamentum flavum hypertrophic degenerative changes. At L4/5, there is a minimal disc bulge with a central annular fissure. There are mild bilateral facet joint/ligamentum flavum hypertrophic degenerative changes. The disc is desiccated/degenerated. At L3/4, the disc is desiccated/degenerated. There is a 0.5 cm Tarlov cyst. Impression: There are multilevel mild degenerative changes without significant spinal stenosis or neural foramen stenosis. X-Tray Kee Bilateral (technique: AP, lateral, and oblique projections are obtained), findings: There is normal mineralization. No fracture or dislocation. Joint spaces and articular surfaces are unremarkable. No effusion is identified.  Her Blood test finds: 1.	CK, Total: 11300	(range: 20-180 U/L) 2.

All indications are that I have an extremely rare (not sure even how rare, I am sure other people have it, but I could be the only person on the planet to do it at this extreme) autustic ability. Before you read this, please do not dismiss what I am about to say as impossible, because I already had some of this ability tested at my doctor's office and it has atleast been verified that I can do it well enough that it is beyond a normal person's abilities. Furthermore my parents have witnessed me do it all my life. And lastly it took like 8 hours of search on the internet (thats how rare it is to find info on this) to find a reference by a medical doctor who talks about a rare occurence with fibromyalgia that can also happen with autistic patients because of how both disabilities effect the central nervous system. As I understand it, some fibromyalgia and autistic patients only require maybe a 1000th of the stimuli from a sensory gland of a normal person to detect something, because of how their central nervous system gets stimulated so much more easily or reacts much more faster (not sure which). The reference on the internet I found speaks of fibromyalgia patients who can hear the humming of the ballast tubes in flourescent lights that no normal human can hear, because of their central nervous system. That reference also refers to the possibility of it also effecting a fibromyalgia or autistic's sense of smell. In my case, almost all my senses are effected to some extent but smell seems to be effected the greatest. Let me give some examples. When I was around 18. I was in my bedoom behind a closed door, with tape all over the door to keep smells out (thats how sensitive I am to smells), and I am like 40 feet away from the kitchen and my sister cooks a tv dinner (like fish with white wine source). Both my mother and sister are standing 3 or 4 feet from the microwave and can't smell the alcohol. I smell it behind the taped door in my bedoom, from 40 feet away. I also smell odors thru walls, thru pipes, etc. Recently, just happened a couple months ago, I smelled something like a dead animal when I was in a car (the smell was overwhelming to me). Both my parents were in the front of the car and couldn't smell something that was overwhelming to me, and it wasn't until the moving car went for another couple minutes that my parents could finally smell it. So maybe 200 to 300 feet or perhaps more feet in distance before they could pick up the smell. Just another case of how much farther away I can smell stuff then normal people. And as I mentioned earlier my doctors office tested and verified that I wasn't just imagining this ability. I go to a therapist for my autism. The therapist told me that he put a tiny amount of cleaning stuff on a chair to test me (I was unaware that he did it until after the test was over). A patient came in 15 minutes later, and even sat in the chair and could not smell it. Then a patient came in an hour later and sat in chair, and couldn't smell it. Then another in 2 hours, then another in 3 hours. I came in 4 hours later and smelled it, as soon as I opened the door, and could even state where the smell is coming from, the chair. The same therapist also tested me another 20 to 30 times, and each time I correctly identified the smell, and it was a smell that was too weak for normal people to pick up. And today, believe it or not, I smelled better then a gas detection meter. I'm getting tired of typing so will summarize quickly. I lived next to gas stoves for 32.5 years and never reported a gas leak. What are the mathematical odds, if you pick a random day in 32. 5 years to just report that you smell gas and there really is a leak, and it is just coincidence? The gas man is saying it is impossible because his meter (which apparently isn't as accurate as me) didn't pick up the smell in the hallway, when I smelled gas coming from a neighbor's apartment. Never reported something like this in 32.5 years of being around gas stoves. The day I reported it, the gas man, goes into the apartment and checks the stove and there is a leak (I was correct). And just to be clear again: I walked in front of every apartment in the building, didn't smell gas at any, except for the one where the gas man actually said there was a leak and I never reported a gas leak in 32.5 years of being around gas stoves. It would be around a 1 in 60,000 (or higher) mathematical probability that it was done by random chance. The gas detection meter couldn't detect the gas in the hallway, but the only way I could of known which apartment out of all of them in the building had the leak, and the only way I could of reported this on the correct day of the leak (when I never reported a gas leak in 32.5 years) is it was NOT random chance or coincidence. At this point, I really like to find out what is going on and get as close to an exact number to how much better I smell then a normal person. I live in Pennsylvania, but I could travel if necessary.

Don’t tell me about ...care...or Govt Care .... May 10, 2018 Start answering to not just my family in regards to my O Negative Kidney that was stamped with my kindney robbed of “UCSF Teaching Hospital” giving me Expired Meds but some time later threatening my family & i NOT to dare sue them or else..we were clearly then in terrible shock. We still then & now do not know who to turn to.You see for people’s as we, the public & private concerns, as well your own medical origins are without heart,soul,OR concerns CARE” let alone wanting to give you any concern.They ARE beyond offering any at all uplifting OR helping you through the loss & knowledge you will die from this.They are the worst of ever being offered in or to that of real HUMAN CARE”. So here is my post I sent to a person wanting feedback.  Dear America,  I am still at a loss & will continue to feel that way till the end of my life.... Tatiana A. Kostanian My post to my fan mail .... Dear Floyd,  When I first learned I lost my O Negative Kidney due to UCSF a California Teaching Hospital in San Francisco, CA.who gave me wrong meds that was expired I was devastated. I felt in shock with the loss, terribly betrayed. I did not know what to do. I felt like dying.My doctors really were distant & did not apologize to me for their grave mistake.They gave me no options no persons to work through my loss.They abandoned me completely.Here I had volunteered for years to give my blood for all ages my O Blood.Now, even for myself I had no real O Kidney. I was beyond frightened. I had to rely more & more on my husband & daughter, no one else.I had no more way to go to work or help my family with income My daughter,husband were also somewhat insecure as to what would happen to me. Somewhere during those years, UCSF sent two goons to follow us.They actually threatened us all telling us “don’t you dare sue us, or else.” We were frightened as well horrified any Teaching Hospital would both “threaten & warm” us as patient & as a family.We could not understand what was their thinking & why they were so irrational.It was they who gave me wrong meds & expired meds.Why go after us & tell us to back off.?Well short story we were frightened & did not sue.We did not know what they were capable of doing to us.We just knew they had given us wrong meds that were did always wonder what more they were capable of doing to all of us as a family.you run run when you are threatened you know not what to do anything but keep quiet. You know a 15 gauge needle can really keep you quiet as well when you know it will be for the rest of your life. Oh my goodness, we’re we quiet.  I later quietly changed hospitals. The old one made me feel too upset as well the doctor I still had done to me. He also did not keep a very new Ca Dialysis Clinic.The chairs & the sheets,walls had blood spattered all over way after the last patient had left.The hallways were hard to get through as they were strewn through the hallways with beds, wheelchairs, other stuff that no hospital should have in any hallway.We could not even get through the hallways to get to the men’s or women’s rest rooms I became even more upset.To get my mind cleared about this issue of life I wrote a letter to the State about the premises as well who the doctor was in charge.The State came to our site, gave the doctor a letter of discipline for at least 8 things they found in error.That seemed to help me but not entirely.I felt heavily weighed down because I could not sue.I did not know how to relieve myself & over the years the financial aspect on us was unbelievable.Here we already had massive bills,a daughter whose needs were endless,my husbands & mine.We had no one to turn to.We were always feeling upset & scared.I always felt I was going to die. Nobody on my health team told me, my Family anything. To be incommunicado with your medical team IS a terrible situation.It is one main reason of the why I left this bad hospital & medical team.For a States Teaching Hospital this we think is the worst!!! These last 5 months, the head of this hospital on Webster Street,here in SF & my Dialysis through Davita told my husband & I after only about a 12 minute talk & looking at a bit of my medical history,that he would tell my medical team that I was too old for a transplant & if I were to have any surgery I would not make it.There was & Remains so much more of my past& present doctors said & did to me it would make any patient drown mentally.  So now I am age 75. I don’t know who to turn to save my husband & daughter. Together we now just depend on GOD. Yes my meds cost a great deal,we still have no one to talk to or to help us financially. All we can & do do,is lean on God in prayer.  I do remember I wrote to my friend Gavin Newsom, who is Our California State Lt. Governor of what was going on to me & in my Dialysis Care,who now is running for State Governor...He never responded.I wrote many more, nobody responded!!! ....It’s NOT an ideal life going to Dialysis every other day, but then we guess that’s life.  Most of the time when I have strength & not exhausted I go on the Internet & give advice or share my story. At age 75 what else can I do? Don’t give up & don’t most of all give up on you.YOU are still here.Continue to reach out.  I hope my story has helped some.  God Bless & take care... tatiana  May 10, 2018 San Francisco, Ca.

None of this should never happen to any human being any age, especially from a Known “Teaching University” Known Globally who receives grants globally & Locally.

During that time I let my own health go. Completely. Caregiving was intense and exhausting. My husband died in July of 2019. We were both to the point of not going on but death was his end and utter exhaustion and years of accumulated consequences both emotionally and physically were mine. I am working on learning to sleep again. For years I existed on no more than five hours a night and usually less. My next challenge is to learn to take my type 2 diabetes seriously and make changes that are healthy for me. But my motivation level is low. I feel overwhelmed and I am grieving my husband's death. I want to change but I feel an awful sense of inertia. I want to move through or past that sense of being defeated before I even begin. If you have struggled with a lack of motivation and a sense of hopelessness when it comes to making lifestyle changes but have found a way out please share with me how you did it. Thank you.
