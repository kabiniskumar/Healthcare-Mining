After that I was really scared to I slightly put pressure on it again and it happened again . I was wearing my loose trouser and a undergarments. I don't have any pain and in the morning I haven't touched since so I don't know if it's still there. I did not have any injury or any lumps or swelling ( but I have noticed a very slight urine colour change to more yellowish but no burning ) I don't think it's a tortion cause people say it has intense pain but I have an Intense orgasm kinda or I think it feels sore I don't how to explain .

She told me she had just been tested before we had sex and she came up std free. She has gotten tested two more times since then, and both times she came up clean. Is it more likely I had some other infection and a false positive test, or more likely that she got three false negatives. I had not had sex with anyone else in over a year, and I don't do drugs, but could it be possible that I got it from a public restroom. I always thought that was a myth/lie."

I began to develop symptoms around 3 days after potential exposure, which consisted of tiny red bumps on my scrotum. I went to a dermatologist who did a viral culture, but it came back negative (the bumps were already scabbed over however so I wasn't surprised). Then about 10-12 days after symptoms appeared I had blood drawn, and was negative on both the IgM and IgG tests. My doctor is very confused as he would have expected IgM to be positive if this was HSV.  Since that initial ""outbreak"" I've had 3 recurrences, about once per week, although the symptoms changed. I no longer get the red bumps, but I do experience pain in the back of my legs as well as strange pains/discomfort feelings in my penis, scrotum, and groin.

I was hospitalized for days, bedridden for months, used a walker for months, went to PT for years and have tried everything and anything for pain relief.  It is now almost 6 years later, I'm 27 years old, and in unbelievable chronic, dehabilitating pain. I have immense trouble with mobility and strength and EVERYthing affects it. Driving hurts, sitting, standing, walking, lifting, pushing, pulling, writing, reaching... everything creates pain. I am living in a complete cloud of misery. Funny thing about it is this: I don't look like it! Or act like it! I am a chirpy, ""fit + healthy"" seeming, bubbly, hardworking girl. I don't mope around, I try not to complain or speak up too much about it. So when I do, whether its a new doctor or old- they aren't taking me serious! I know for a fact multiple doctors think I'm fine.. they say I'm young, I've ""recovered"". But I haven't and it is ruining my life. My weekly schedule consists of acupuncture sessions, cranial sacral therapy, massage, grounding, restorative yoga, swim and have been in and out of physical therapy for years. I've tried so many types of therapy I don't even know what else is left. I have also seen so many specialists and doctors, I've given up. No matter what I do, I am in copious amounts of pain. One exception- Once in a blue moon on a RAGING flare up, I will take half a pain killer. This is the only time I feel complete relief from pain. But, I'm scared of being a person that ""relies"" on pain killers, so I don't take them often. PLUS- there is such a bad connotation with ""young people"" and pain killers that doctors smirk at me if I even bring them up. I've been out of Hydrocodone for the past month and have had such horrible pain I can't go to work anymore, be active or do much at all. Pain: My biggest issue these days in an excruciating sharp pain in between my shoulder blades in my upper back. My neck flares up and becomes a sharp pain up through my head. My entire upper back scar tissue is rock hard and full of knots. And now my right arm has become completely numb and/or will have sharp pains down through my palm and fingers. My right arm and right leg have uncontrollable spasms nightly at this point.  I was told by a doctor that I have bone spurrs between C6 and C7. And I was also recently told by a massaeust that my shoulder blades are very misaligned and uneven. She said my right shoulder blade is low and sunken in while my left is bulging out. Perhaps these are the causing a nerve to be pinched and why my right arm is having so many issues?  I need help as soon as possible. The pain has become so extreme, I honestly feel like I am dying. I need to figure out a solution, some sort of real relief, but no doctor ""cares"" or will listen to me because I'm just TOO YOUNG. Too young for surgery, shots, anything. I'm sorry but I am too young to feel like I am 100 years old and bedridden at 27 years old.  I'm open to any suggestions- holistic, western, eastern, whatever. I need help :("

I told her from day 1 she needs to find a solution, I'm here now and I'm sure you can fill in the rest. I found out recently that this is because of the pill. She won't go off of it because she says her periods are terrible: ""I don't think you understand how awful it is not being on the pill. Period symptoms are significantly worse, like I can't even get out of bed for the first 2 days because the cramps are so bad, you *** everywhere all the time, you're bloated when you eat but you eat *** everything. It's not something you will ever understand. "" She says that she initially started using the pill by doctors recommendation not because of its contraceptive qualities, but because her period was unpredictable. She said she would get blood in her pants sporadically any day of the month.  So my question is... Is there a win win out there? I.e. Something that continues to help her regulate her periods but doesn't eat her testosterone/kill her libido? It can also have contraceptive qualities but doesn't have to as I'm more than willing to use condoms or do whatever else I need to do to satisfy that requirement."

Are there alternatives to opiates that work effectively? Is there alternatives to opioids? I do believe I could control myself, especially with my mothers help, if I had to do opiates, but I really am hoping there is a better way to relieve severe pain. If there is not a good alternative, is it even possible to go on an opiate pain medication while on suboxone or is that not possible as an option?

I think the pain began as my left foot hit touched the ground but I am not 100% positive. I had never felt this type of pain before at any time in my life.  As the day went on this pain became more general and less concentrated. I definitely felt the pain more with taking steps up steep terrain.

My partner's doctor said that before an initial outbreak the virus can't be transmitted, this seems to align with anecdotes from married couples who did not infect each other after decades of sex... but would love to get specific confirmation of this.  2, I understand there is asymptomatic viral shedding - usually in the week before / after an outbreak. With viral shedding there are NO visible symptoms but the virus is shedding and so it can be transmitted just the same as when there are lesions. However... the implication from the statistics, descriptions and anecdotal evidence, is that when there is NO outbreak and NO viral shedding, then there the virus can NOT be transmitted... is that true?  The statistics say that there is a 10% transmission rate if you don't take medication and don't use condoms, simply avoid sex during an outbreak. With condoms and suppressants, it drops to 2-4%. That's very low. However, it seems to me that this is still referring to the days when a transmission is possible due to asymptomatic shedding. The implication would be that when there is no shedding, then there is also no transmission possibility.  Would love to get a firm answer on these 2 questions.  Thanks!  Felix"

From there to C7 are bulging. I have not seen the radiology report, this is just me looking at the disc myself and Google. I did have my chiropractor look at it and he confirmed my thoughts. The nerve going to the right is getting cut off at the higher level. The lowers are cutting into the left. So I have pain going down both arms but more severely with my right.  I've had chronic pain with this for 7 years. Seeking multiple forms of treatment. Most recently daily ibuprofen and bi-weekly therapeutic massage and chiro adjustments have kept things manageable. However this particular ""flare up"" has been over the top enough for me to go back to pain management. My quality of life has been severely impacted. Pain mgmt ordered the MRI. So now they'll have three MRIs to compare, 7 years ago, 4 years ago and now. The radiology report always says ""mild"" and I always think if it's so mild why does is hurt so freakin bad?! My chiro thinks stepping it up a notch to an epidural steroid injection is the next step. Pain management also sees that as a good option. I've been to PT, two ortho Drs, two chiros, several massage therapists. I've tried narcotic pain meds, muscle relaxers (flexeril, skelaxin), ultram. Most recently tizanidine but I feel like I'm drunk on that so not really a reasonable option for daily use.  I see the orthopedic dr Friday and I'm hoping she can offer me a satisfactory treatment plan. I would not mind surgery if that is an option. After 7 years I'm ready for a solution. I'm 36. Been suffering since I was 29.  Does anyone else feel like no one takes their pain seriously? Am I crazy to be thinking about surgery when I haven't even tried these injections yet? So many people talk about avoiding surgery and I'm just over here like please anything to make the pain stop!"

I went to my Dr. and was treated for a yeast infection. After taking Diflucan I still had symptoms and called back. A different Dr. got me in that week and tested again. The lab results showed BV and Yeast. I was treated for both, and when finished with both medications I still had symptoms and my prescription was refilled. The Flagyl prescribed for the BV gave me a yeast infection and I had to take 3 Diflucan doses to get rid of everything. After the hassle of all of this I never went back to the Dr. to see if everything actually went away.  Around November this year I started noticing the same kind of discharge and was worried that the BV maybe just never went away from the 3 years prior. So, I called my OBGYN. She prescribed a total of 6 doses of Diflucan for a yeast infection that would not go away. A few weeks ago I saw a different Dr. from a different women's center. Turns out I have BV and a yeast infection. I was prescribed a cream for the yeast and Flagyl for the BV.  I am wondering how, after having 2 lab tests that checked for BV, it is showing up now? Could this have developed while being treated for the yeast infections? I also don't know why I have such a hard time getting rid of these two infections. I have had the same sexual partner for 3 years now. My last question is, should I wait to use the yeast infection cream until I have finished the Flagyl? Because I know that the Flagyl will give me a yeast infection.  I feel like my doctors get very frustrated because my issues keep coming back. I also worry that the medications didn't work every time I take them and I feel like I should be examined again, but I think that the doctors get frustrated that I keep coming back in for the same things.

Whether it's because you sit all day long at your desk in an unhappy position, you've forced your muscles through exercise or simply because you've carried too many grocery bags, you just know how unpleasant back pain can be and how it can stop you from conducting your daily activities normally.  So, what should you do? Some simple exercises that you can do when you're in pain but that you have to execute frequently to relieve pain, recover faster in the future to prevent other such trauma and strengthen your back muscles. If you resort to inappropriate   , they can have grave consequences on your back, which is a very sensitive area that should not be forced. Here are a few exercises for lower back pain relief that can be done at home: Partial Crunches  Whenever you have acute low back pain, avoid the exercises that can make things worse. Partial crunches are just the answer to your condition because they help you strengthen your back and stomach muscles. Lie on your back on the floor with your knees bend and feet flat on the floor. Put your hands behind your neck, tighten your stomach muscles and then raise your shoulders off the floor, while breathing out. Do not use your arms to pull your neck off the floor. Hold for a second and then slowly lower back down. Repeat 8-12 times. Make sure your feet, lower back and tailbone are constantly in contact with the mat. Hamstring Stretches  Lie on your back on the floor and bend one knee. Take a towel and loop it under the ball of your foot. First, strengthen the knee and then slowly pull it back towards your chest with the help of the towel. Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat 2 to 4 times for each leg.  Wall Sits Stand at a distance of 10 to 12 inches from the wall. Try to lean back until your back is flat against the wall. Slightly bend your knees, while pressing your lower back into the wall. Hold for a count to ten and then slowly slide back up that wall. Repeat 8-12 times. Press-up Back Extensions  Lie on your stomach on the floor and place your hands directly under your shoulders. The extension starts by pushing with your hands so your shoulders can lift off the floor. If that's too easy for you, just place your elbows on the floor directly under your shoulders and hold for a couple of seconds. Bird Dog Start on your hands and knees and concentrate on tightening your stomach muscles. Lift and extend one leg behind you and then hold for 5 seconds. Switch to the other leg. Repeat 8-12 times for each leg. Make this exercise a little bit harder by lifting and extending the opposite arm for every repetition. Knee to Chest Start with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Bring your right knee to your chest, while keeping the left one flat on the floor. During the exercise, make sure your lower back is pressed to the floor. Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat with the other leg. Do this four times for each leg.  Pelvic Tilts  Lie on your back on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Feel the contraction in your stomach as you were preparing for a punch. Press your back into the floor and feel your hips and pelvis rocking back. Breath in and out and hold for 10 seconds. Repeat the exercise 8-12 times. Bridging Lie on your back with your knees bent and heels touching the floor.

Whether it's because you sit all day long at your desk in an unhappy position, you've forced your muscles through exercise or simply because you've carried too many grocery bags, you just know how unpleasant back pain can be and how it can stop you from conducting your daily activities normally.  So, what should you do? Some simple exercises that you can do when you're in pain but that you have to execute frequently to relieve pain, recover faster in the future to prevent other such trauma and strengthen your back muscles. If you resort to inappropriate   , they can have grave consequences on your back, which is a very sensitive area that should not be forced. Here are a few exercises for lower back pain relief that can be done at home: Partial Crunches  Whenever you have acute low back pain, avoid the exercises that can make things worse. Partial crunches are just the answer to your condition because they help you strengthen your back and stomach muscles. Lie on your back on the floor with your knees bend and feet flat on the floor. Put your hands behind your neck, tighten your stomach muscles and then raise your shoulders off the floor, while breathing out. Do not use your arms to pull your neck off the floor. Hold for a second and then slowly lower back down. Repeat 8-12 times. Make sure your feet, lower back and tailbone are constantly in contact with the mat. Hamstring Stretches  Lie on your back on the floor and bend one knee. Take a towel and loop it under the ball of your foot. First, strengthen the knee and then slowly pull it back towards your chest with the help of the towel. Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat 2 to 4 times for each leg.  Wall Sits Stand at a distance of 10 to 12 inches from the wall. Try to lean back until your back is flat against the wall. Slightly bend your knees, while pressing your lower back into the wall. Hold for a count to ten and then slowly slide back up that wall. Repeat 8-12 times. Press-up Back Extensions  Lie on your stomach on the floor and place your hands directly under your shoulders. The extension starts by pushing with your hands so your shoulders can lift off the floor. If that's too easy for you, just place your elbows on the floor directly under your shoulders and hold for a couple of seconds. Bird Dog Start on your hands and knees and concentrate on tightening your stomach muscles. Lift and extend one leg behind you and then hold for 5 seconds. Switch to the other leg. Repeat 8-12 times for each leg. Make this exercise a little bit harder by lifting and extending the opposite arm for every repetition. Knee to Chest Start with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Bring your right knee to your chest, while keeping the left one flat on the floor. During the exercise, make sure your lower back is pressed to the floor. Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat with the other leg. Do this four times for each leg.  Pelvic Tilts  Lie on your back on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Feel the contraction in your stomach as you were preparing for a punch. Press your back into the floor and feel your hips and pelvis rocking back. Breath in and out and hold for 10 seconds. Repeat the exercise 8-12 times. Bridging Lie on your back with your knees bent and heels touching the floor. Push the heels into the floor, squeeze your buttocks and lift your hips until you form a straight line between your shoulders, hips and knees. Hold for 5 seconds and slowly lower. Rest for 10 seconds and then repeat 8-12 times. Lifting Weights Lifting weights does not hurt your back as long as they are done properly. As a matter of fact, it helps relieve the back pain.

I never thought it was herpes but now I’m freaked out. I’ve never had a cluster of bumps or a rash. It was one bump on the outer labia. It comes and goes. Right now it’s flat and it sometimes flare up. Not open or any discharge coming out. Just a bump within the skin and then it goes away. It’s always in the same spot. I thought herpes was different. It could be anywhere on the vagina and it’s open sores. At least that’s what I’ve seen from the pics. I’ve had one bump and it gets flat when it’s not flared up. I’m going out of my mind waiting for blood test results.

Can't see my doctor for another week so wanted to get some ideas now incase I should go to the emergancy room or anything. So about 4 days ago at 2AM I woke up needing to use the restroom. I went to the bathroom and started peeing, within seconds I had cold chills up my body and my stomach feeling like it wanted to puke. Before I could react I suddenly opened my eyes to be laying on the floor of the bathtoom feeling like I fainted or blacked out. I got up still with my stomach upset and my left arm sore. I finished up in the bathroom and quickly got back to my bed were I instanly passed out. The next day I felt fine (I assumed it was food poisoning but I had no side effects in the morning) but my arm is still sore.  Four days later my arm now had a trail of purple and green bruises and is very tender, also can not put any pressure on it or use my hand for any heavy lifting. Also dunno if its related but a few times during these four days I have a feeling of my heart pumping really quick or lots of bubbles in my chest.  Hoping for some ideas or clues of what I might have so I can figure out how serious it is."

I thought I had pulled the muscle and brushed it off but the pain has gotten progressively worse. Last week I kept waking up in the middle of the night with severe nausea and back pain. Today I got out of my car and I couldn't even walk. I cannot bend down anymore, even slightly, without being in severe pain. It's very hard for me to get up, especially when I have been lying in bed or even just sitting down in a chair. The pain started in the lower left side of back, sometimes reaching all the way around to the other side and going up my spine. Recently however, the pain has been exclusively on the lower left side of my back, sometimes shooting up my spine, but also it is spreading to my left abdomen and middle abdomen. When I put pressure on my left leg it hurts my back and hip. I was bending down to pick up a towel a few days ago and my back, hip, and the entire left side of abdomen just screamed in pain and I let out a yell. What is going on with me and what should I do?"

I went bowling and my ankle was fine but it hurt not that badly. Toward the night i was on mmy phone in bed for about 30 mins. i went to get water and my ankle hurt really badly. i could not put any weight at all on it. I had to walk slowly and limp to the kitchen to get water and a ice pack and went to my room. I slept and i kept waking up at night with zaps of pain. Today in the morning on june 17th it still really hurts and there is pain from the back of my ankle/foot to the right side of my ankle/foot. The pain also goes behind my ankle bone as well. Im not sure if a popping noise happened when the injury happened because my arm slapped the glass which made a banging noise. I can't move my ankle/foot up, down or to the right. If i move my ankle/foot a popping feeling happens in the pain area to the right of my ankle bone. I want to know if this is a ankle sprain grade I, II or III , Torn or stretched ligament, or i broke my foot/ ankle? Please respond i am getting worried."

When I was younger, I just thought they were growing pains, so I never paid attention to them. When I get the pain, it’s usually just in one leg or arm, either side of my body, from the uppermost joint (shoulder/hip) to the extremity (fingers/toes). Each pain lasts anywhere from 3 hours to 2 days; it’s not a shooting pain or an achy soreness, more of a dull pain that doesn’t go away with ice/heat/rest/exercise/pain medicine. It never inhibits me from moving or walking – the pain is normally about a 5 out of 10 when I’m resting, without applying pressure. With pressure/walking, it might increase to a 7 or 8 out of 10, but never more than that. It happens year-round, when I’m at my most active – playing a contact sport 6 day a week for months – and at my least active – doing no exercise for months at a time. For the past 6 months, I’ve kept track of the pains and I’ve noticed that they generally come in 2-week intervals. For example, I’ll experience a pain in my right leg one day, then two days later it’ll be a pain in my left arm, then the next day a pain in my left leg. Then, I’ll be pain-free for 12-16 days and the same thing will occur again. The intervals of pain will typically be 5-10 days, consisting of 3-5 incidents of pain, followed by two pain-free weeks.  I’ve seen an orthopedist, rheumatologist, and currently a neurologist, none of whom have been able to change anything, and my blood tests and enzyme tests have come up normal.

The vaginal sex lasted about 15 seconds before I wised up and opted for a condom, however this was after a couple minutes of oral sex that was unprotected (both ways).    Now, I’ve done my research and I know that what I’ve said is enough to contract an STD. In terms of symptoms, I’m generally quite an anxious person so I don’t know if a lot of it is in my head: 1) I have noticed that’s I’ve been urinating very frequently the last two days. However, I’m a very frequent urinator as it is (I have a very small bladder), so I’m not sure if I’m overthinking this. 2) I have not necessarily noticed burning every time whilst urinating, but on the third or fourth morning after I definitely did notice a burning sensation. However, this has happened before as a one off, and I don’t feel like I’ve had the same sensation since.    3) My penis does feel a little heavier than usual, but this one I can’t work out if it’s in my head. It almost feels (slightly) sore, maybe from the constant urinating.  That’s the extent of it. I know that I cannot accurately test for chlamydia and/or gonorrhoea for another week, so I guess the questions I had are: - is number 3 a common STD symptom? - whilst I know it is entirely possible that I contracted an STD, is it possible to have these symptoms and it be something else? Or does that sound too coincidental/wishful thinking? - exactly how frequent is frequent urination? When I go, I don’t seem to urinate large amounts, rather just small quantities. I actually noticed this perhaps more than usual about 10-12 hours following the sex.  Thank you."

I started having this symptom a year ago and it’s been reoccurring every now and then. The thing is, the rash only appears on my pubic hair region. I had unprotected sexual intercourse twice before with my partner. I had a total of 3 check ups. The first time was on March 2017. I was negative for HIV but postivie for a mild STI infection. The name of the disease which I forgot was something called “cocci”, but the one in-charge said that it was just mild. I was given a medicine for it but I was not able to have a follow up check up to know if I was cured or not since I had to go abroad the next day. The penile discharged that I was experiencing was gone so I thought I got better. To be sure, some time between late April and early of May 2017, I went to the social health clinic of Manhattan in New York. I took a urine and blood test there as well as an examination on the rash. They couldn’t tell what rash it was since It was almost healed and Ibwas advised to go back when it’s still fresh so that they can get a sample. The results came back two weeks later and it says online that I was fine. There were no diseases or any STD found. I was still having the rash and that’s when I decided to go back and asked if the rash that I was having was Herpes. The personnel said that it could not be Herpes since the result I got was all clean and he said if there’s anything that I’ve got then it should have shown in their test. Based on my research online, there is a separate test for Herpes and it includes blood test which I had in the clinic but was not sure if detecting Herpes was one of it. I got back to my country and had my follow up check up some time between August and September 2017. The result was also negative for any STD including my previous infection. Also, when I’m just at home, I only wear boxers ‘til I go to bed and I just started wearing boxers last 2 years. My country also has a hot weather since I live in South-East Asia. So I think that it’s just a rash from being sweaty and exposure to bacteria.  Attached to this post are the pictures of my rash on my pubic hair region. Herpes photos online resembles to my rash but I’m still hoping that it’s just a normal rash.  Thank you for any answers or suggestions and please respect my post."

I ejaculated in her mouth, and then the experience was over, which I immediately regretted. This was my first time engaging in this kind of risky behaviour with someone I did not know. When I got home, I washed my penis with soup. I think I even put shampoo inside. I was pretty rigorous, as I felt very dirty from the behaviour. Of course, the shampoo hurt and made me feel stinging sensations at the tip of my penis. Next, I went and got myself tested on December 19 for everything imaginable. The big ones were HIV, HSV, chlamydia, gonorrhoeae, syphilis, hep B, and hep C, which all turned out negative. I felt good about that until I opened my pee hole and looked inside. The bottom wall or canal of the urethra was white in colour. It is slightly raised and it seemingly travels down the urethra tube for as far as I can see with a flashlight. I immediately panicked and realized I did all my tested way too soon. I can’t remember if I was feeling stinging inside the tip of my penis before looking inside, or if it started again after, but either way I have been feeling discomfort ever since December 15, and with the white appearance I see inside, I’m in even more discomfort. So on December 29 (2 weeks after high risk incident), I took a test for HSV 1 and 2, and it came back negative again. On January 2 (2 weeks + 4 days), I took a test for chlamydia and gonorrhoeae, which also both came back negative again. Still, the tip of my penis was irritating me. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. My underwear was bothering me. I felt rubbing against the fabric. It was getting red on the exterior of the tip of my penis, and I was frantically always checking, touching, and squeezing open. I even tried masturbating several times through this tough experience simply to see if that would get rid of the pressure and irritation I was feeling, but it only seemed to make things worse. I was feeling like my life was over. I’ve cried myself to sleep two times. That’s how shaken up I’ve been. So I went to see a doctor on January 6 who was not mine, because I felt ashamed to see my own. My doctor is actually quite rude and makes me feel uncomfortable, always brushing me off like my problems and concerns are not worthwhile. That’s besides the point though... so I saw a doctor and she gradually looked and just told me it was my urethra and not to worry. I tried taking that to heart but I felt like she didn’t even look closely. Just peered over and probably my angling of my penis towards her visual perspective was not the right angle, because from my vantage point I could clearly see it, while she sat in her chair not getting up to try and look. So as I reassessed that moment, I regressed back to my worries. On January 29, I went to see my doctor. He didn’t know what it was. I asked him if it’s normal? He said, “What is normal?” I said I don’t know, I’m not a doctor. He said anything can be normal. He berated me for even worrying and told me not to have sexual contact without protection, and yes I know, I get it that I screwed up. I have this mysterious irritation though with this mysterious appearance, and so I need answers. He took a swab for HSV, and I’m awaiting those results. I have another urine test to do to check for chlamydia or gonorrhoeae, but I feel like this will all come back negative again. My doctor thinks it could be HPV. I have had genital warts before on my scrotum, but those haven’t appeared for over a year and a half, going onto two years. Never had a bad breakout of that. It was so minor. Removed with the ice freezing or whatever it was, and they haven’t returned. Could this whiteness inside my urethra really be HPV? If so, how would I get rid of that? I asked my doctor, and he said you don’t. But really? If I can’t get rid of it, will I become infertile? Basically I am looking for answers. I have no answers at this point. I’m very confused. I can draw up any possibility without any concrete confidence that I’m correct about anything Help needed, please and thank you!"

I can’t remember if I was feeling stinging inside the tip of my penis before looking inside, or if it started again after, but either way I have been feeling discomfort ever since December 15, and with the white appearance I see inside, I’m in even more discomfort. So on December 29 (2 weeks after high risk incident), I took a test for HSV 1 and 2, and it came back negative again. On January 2 (2 weeks + 4 days), I took a test for chlamydia and gonorrhoeae, which also both came back negative again. Still, the tip of my penis was irritating me. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. My underwear was bothering me. I felt rubbing against the fabric. It was getting red on the exterior of the tip of my penis, and I was frantically always checking, touching, and squeezing open. I even tried masturbating several times through this tough experience simply to see if that would get rid of the pressure and irritation I was feeling, but it only seemed to make things worse. I was feeling like my life was over. I’ve cried myself to sleep two times. That’s how shaken up I’ve been. So I went to see a doctor on January 6 who was not mine, because I felt ashamed to see my own. My doctor is actually quite rude and makes me feel uncomfortable, always brushing me off like my problems and concerns are not worthwhile. That’s besides the point though... so I saw a doctor and she gradually looked and just told me it was my urethra and not to worry. I tried taking that to heart but I felt like she didn’t even look closely. Just peered over and probably my angling of my penis towards her visual perspective was not the right angle, because from my vantage point I could clearly see it, while she sat in her chair not getting up to try and look. So as I reassessed that moment, I regressed back to my worries. On January 29, I went to see my doctor. He didn’t know what it was. I asked him if it’s normal? He said, “What is normal?” I said I don’t know, I’m not a doctor. He said anything can be normal. He berated me for even worrying and told me not to have sexual contact without protection, and yes I know, I get it that I screwed up. I have this mysterious irritation though with this mysterious appearance, and so I need answers. He took a swab for HSV, and I’m awaiting those results. I have another urine test to do to check for chlamydia or gonorrhoeae, but I feel like this will all come back negative again. My doctor thinks it could be HPV. I have had genital warts before on my scrotum, but those haven’t appeared for over a year and a half, going onto two years. Never had a bad breakout of that. It was so minor. Removed with the ice freezing or whatever it was, and they haven’t returned. Could this whiteness inside my urethra really be HPV? If so, how would I get rid of that? I asked my doctor, and he said you don’t. But really? If I can’t get rid of it, will I become infertile? Basically I am looking for answers. I have no answers at this point. I’m very confused. I can draw up any possibility without any concrete confidence that I’m correct about anything Help needed, please and thank you!"

I had oral sex with one girl without condom and intercourse with condom on Feb 1, 2019. After two days I got some kind of allergy on my penis and I feel like it's burning and itching all the day. Next day I used some creams and I feel like relief and those itches are gone away. But after two weeks again I got some kind of blister or sore on my penis (it's not looking like a blister but lower skin of my penis went full reddish and it becoming wet often). Again I used creams and it is not going away. I feel like I should see a doctor and I went to see doctor on MAR 13, 2019. He saw my penis and told me it looks like herpes and not sure is that really Herpes. He did blood test like HSV1 IGG and HSV2 IGG, syphils. All came negative and in the blood test ranges are like hsv1- 0.2 and hsv2- 0.17. Before coming the reports he asked me to use acyclovir 400mg 3/day for 5 days. After 5 days the allergy went away and everything is normal now. After blood reports got negative my doctor is told me to do another same test in after 5 weeks. So here is my question Do I really affected to Herpes?. As of now I don't have any symptoms like fever or body-pains. Is those reports are accurate or is there any time period for antibodies to show-up in blood test. The test I took is like after 6 weeks when I had sex with the girl. Please help me in this situation. Thanks."

For the past 6 months I have had a burning/stinging sensation in the tip of my penis and foreskin. Let me first say that I highly doubt this is a STD because I have only been sexually active with my wife in the past 12 years (and we were both virgins when we met). About 6 months ago my wife and I had unprotected intercourse (she was 7 months pregnant at the time). A few days after, I noticed a couple of bumps under my foreskin; I scratched them. A couple days after that the same patch of skin turned red and began to burn and now I also had stinging in the tip of my penis. I went to my GP who told be to try Lotrimin, which I did for a couple weeks with no results. I went back and he prescribed me an oral anti-fungal which appeared to help things a little bit but ultimately the stinging came back. My GP thought that it may be nerve issues and prescribed me Gabapentin(sp?), which hasn’t helped either. Finally, I asked for a referral to a Urologist, who told me that he could see no cause for concern and basically told me to”wait it out”."

However I met this guy and we started talking , at first I did not tell him I was positive because I was scared what his reaction would be. But one thing led another and we didn’t have vaginal sex. But I performed oral sex on him and used spit for lubrication. I was thinking and honestly was too afraid to tell him.   But finally he asked me if there was anything else I should know about and I finally told him the truth and he was greatly upset , as he should be because I should’ve been honest. But I do feel terrible, and I’m really hoping that I didn’t pass it on to him. During that time I didn’t have any visible outbreak.

He considers it minor, because it is not very wide, probably not more than 1/8 or 1/4 of an inch, and it connects more to the underside of the head rather than farther up the head of the penis. The medical term is ""penile skin bridge"". Fortunately it doesn't cause any pain during an erection or masturbating, so his issues are purely cosmetic. He feels too embarrassed to talk to his parents about it, and he has discovered online that a surgery to fix it would cost more than a thousand dollars (not sure how accurate that is). Another solution could be to remove it himself, but the thought is gruesome and scary. He could consider leaving it there, but he really really really just wants it to be gone and heal fast, so his penis looks normal. Some questions he has are if he is too young to get the surgery, if it would be painful, if it would reduce pleasure, if it would still look weird later, other possible solutions, and how to talk about it with his parents.

We were like wrestling and I was trying to pin her down on the flour. She accidentally kicked me on the one side of my head. Yes, it was a bit hard but there was no mark, bleeding or even dizziness. However, the next morning, the one side of my neck was swollen and my shoulder was quite sore. I visited the chemist who said I ought to go see a doctor. So, off to the doctor I went the next day. By then the swelling and pain was less but still present. My doctor informed me that it may just been because of the sudden movement of my head to the one side and gave me inflammation tablets. After 3 days of these it went away and I thought right, it was nothing. But soon realized I was wrong. After about two months the swelling and pain came back and with a vengeance. So, back to the doctor I went. After quite some arguments, he sent me for X-rays but couldn't find anything out of place. I was them sent for acupuncture. This was a nightmare, the needles bend completely and afterwards the pain was worst, my neck actually made a big bulge. So, no more of that I said. I started taking ibuprofen which helps ease the pain but knew I couldn't stay on it forever. I requested a second opinion and was sent for an MRI which also showed no issue. Then I was sent for normal physiotherapy which did assist with the issue and for a long time everything seemed normal. Yet, this was all about 4 years back and every now and then it would come back, I'd drink ibuprofen and it would go. The last time was about 8 months back and I thought, well, eventually it is gone.  Once again I was wrong. It returned yesterday and is worst that ever before. Even the ibuprofen only helps somewhat. Is there anyone here that can give me an indication of what it could be and how to manage it as I don't think it can be cured."

This is my first post and I am looking for some kindred folk who may have experienced what I am experiencing. I have had a dull ache between my shoulder blades (interscapular) for three months (since end of October), primarily on my dominant (right) side. I have taken very conservative treatment options (three visits to a physiotherapist in past three weeks and use of NSAIDs, such as Aleve on a sporadic basis) because I do not exhibit any of the warning (red flag) symptoms that should compel an immediate visit to a physician (no weakness or numbness, no fever, no swelling, no night sweats, no pain waking me at night, etc). Also, my physician is 25 miles away in my former hometown, which makes it a bit more difficult to make the trip. I did go to a walk-in clinic in early December, as this all seemed to start with a mild bronchitis which caused a lot of coughing and subsequent intercostal rib ache along with corresponding ache in the upper back. I thought that with the cough getting better the ache would go away soon after, and that physician confirmed that he thought this was what was causing the problem and ""not to worry"". Fast forward another 7 weeks or so, and the ache is pretty much there all the time. It is not enough to stop me from working or doing every-day tasks, and is not affected by movement, but I'm always thinking about it. The characteristics of this discomfort are the following - dull ache just below the scapula and primarily on the right side; ache that sometimes goes into the scapula and can refer to the middle of the back (spine) at times; ache is generally unaffected by movement, though there is corresponding stiffness; corresponding ache in right shoulder (started about a month ago, and compounded by my stupid decision to go to a rock climbing gym with my son); sometimes the ache goes into the upper right arm above the elbow (this only started a couple of weeks ago).  I find relief only with three things. 1. Moist heat (like the hot tub) is a saving grace; 2. Vigorous exercise; 3. Sleep. It is better when I am lying down, but pretty much there all the time when I am up and taking part in daily activities. I also do a fair amount of stretching and have done some yoga. My physiotherapist, whom I have only started seeing three weeks ago thinks I have major muscle stress and trigger points, which might be the cause of the problem. He says my upper back is ""hard as a brick wall"" and says that this has been going on for so long that it could be another 4-6 months before it is finally better. I do have an office-type job where I spend a lot of time sitting in meetings and in front of a computer monitor. I have been trying to monitor posture and take regular breaks to walk around. My physiotherapist says there is better movement each time he sees me, but that the pain or ache is always the last thing to go. While I don't discount his professional opinion, and hope he is right (except for the lengthy healing process), I am wondering if I might have a nerve impingement thing going on (perhaps dorsal scapular syndrome or something like that), osteoarthritis, a disc problem, or something more ominous?!  The ache has not been getting worse, but is not really improving. However, some days it does feel improved (after the first visit to the physio, I felt good relief for about three days).

After 2 CT Scans and an MRI his doctor says his organs are ""healthy"" and they cannot detect any issues. He had a history of kidney stones and has had occasional hematuria but his doctor said the stones forming are too small to be the culprit of the pain. After a year and five months, he still has no diagnosis for what could be cause of what he describes as ongoing pain accompanied with pain ""spikes"". He has been prescribed naproxen and Norco, but mainly avoids taking both as medical cannabis seems to dull the pain temporarily, though recently, the pain has increased. Though the doctor has prescribed physical therapy, my partner is familiar with muscle pain and feels the pain may be related to an organ rather than a muscle. The pain is interfering with his work, his sleep, his ability to connect with family events. Just looking less for pain management advice and more of a direction for suggested tests that might lead to a diagnosis."

I would not be able to get up at 6am for school. I couldn't drag myself out of bed I was so out of it. I would end up sleeping through my alarm and waking up at 10 am.

He did several test and then came back and told us that he could not do surgery because the main artery that goes in the front of the heart was calcified. If he tried to clamp it off, it would shatter and cause a stroke. So they did another heart cath and put in more stents. Since that time he has gotten weaker and weaker. He is tired all the time. He has chest pains and all they do is tell him to take his nitro. I asked about what they could do and I was told that there wasn't anything more they could do for his heart. The only thing that could try to do was get his blood pressure under control. In the meantime, it has gotten where he is not the same person.

I feel like if for a second I am about to pass out. Heart beats fast and then goes down. These are not too often but definitely more often than years ago.

Diet It's okay, I drink water like 98% of the time. Very rarely I would drink juice, soda etc. I avoid most junk foods but still eat at some restaurants. Breakfast sandwiches (ham, egg and cheese) 2-4 times a week.  Coffee but not every day and never full 8oz. Burgers and fries (perhaps once every 2 or three weeks) Pizza (maybe once or twice a month) if that.  I do eat salads with grilled chicken breast but I have been hating chicken for a while now. I stop believing that chicken, specially these days, is good for you.  I some times snack on almonds or walnuts.  Some times salmon for dinner.  Exercise Very little these days. I work in the IT field and spend most of my day sitting. I used to exercise a lot more in my teen's and 20s. I was very skinny. Sex  Married but very little sex drive and poor erection. This is been causing problems in my marriage of course.  Stress My job is somewhat stressful as so many other jobs but I never consider myself a stressful person. After talking with some people and general doctor they think I do suffer from anxiety.  The following are things that I have experienced related to anxiety. At night I have a hard time falling asleep especially after my heart palpitations became more frequent.  The thought of death comes to my mind. The fact that at one point in time I will die, just makes me anxious for a few minutes. Enough to get me from falling asleep. This doesn't happen often but I don't know why I think of that.  I have become a lot more conscious about my heart specially when I go to bed. I just hear it really loud and become aware of every beat making it difficult to fall asleep.  Lots of debt. This is something that for a whatever reason doesn't worry me like it should but I think it definitely affects my mental health.  Twice now I have noticed my heart at around 100-120 bpm for no reason. First time I was going to a weeding (I have gone to many weddings in my life) and I just couldn't feel at peace. I never figured out why my heart was beating fast for the majority of that afternoon.  Another night my heart was around 100bpm while I was trying to fall asleep. I have recorded those bpm with the Apple Watch and showed them to the cardiologist. They said I'm fine. Of course I don't believe them.  Some nights when about to go to bed I become cold to the point I am shivering. AC in the room 62F, outside 80sF. This is very worrying to me because then I feel like my heart takes a beating when this happens. I have to shut off the AC and take a hot shower to lower my body temperature. This has happened to me around 3 times in the past 6 months. The 2nd one was the reason I went to ER at midnight.  Visit to ER and Cardiologist  After 8hrs of waiting. They said I was fine and referred me to a cardiologist. Cardiologist gave me heart monitor for a week. They were looking for those palpitations which I had to do a ""manual entry"" to the monitor whenever I experienced those and I did. But they said my heart was fine. I did recommended me to exercise and eat small portions. I had told them than some times I do feel fatigued and even have felt the palpitations after eating. I thought it was because perhaps I ate too much fatty food or something. They think it's related to eating large portions. But again these heart palpitations have happened to me even when I am sitting in front of my computer.  I visited new primary doctor and told him about my recent events with my heart. He asked me some questions and after telling him that me and my wife are expecting our first baby he thought I was just anxious about it. And honestly it very hard for me to make that the cause of what's been happening to me. Yes, things will change when our baby is born but I don't even think about it too much. I'm not going crazy about it. I am happy about it and can't wait too meet our baby but I don't think about it 24/7. Is it really affecting me without me being aware? Around 7 years ago my old primary doctor told me my cholesterol was borderline high. I started exercising/moving more but have not been consistent. Back then I was having some asthma episodes triggered by dust mites. Those are not as present anymore but if I am exposed to dust or start running I may get asthma.  The heart situation have made me start researching about heart disease, heart attacks, high cholesterol, etc. Many doctors on YouTube talking about the dos and don'ts. Things to eat for a healthy heart. I have implemented some foods into my diet that are good for lowering cholesterol, help with arteries etc. Apple cider vinegar, turmeric, walnuts, lemon juice, raw honey among others. Anyway, I now constantly live with the thought that at any moment my heart will just stop. I try to not feed that thought of course but then I am reminded every time I get heart palpitation (not everyday ), it twitches/flutters (almost everyday now), or when I start shivering when going to bed, for whatever reason (doesn't happen often).  I'm posting this not expecting a magic solution. Mostly to share my experience and get some feedback from some of you. Thanks in advance!"

Diet It's okay, I drink water like 98% of the time. Very rarely I would drink juice, soda etc. I avoid most junk foods but still eat at some restaurants. Breakfast sandwiches (ham, egg and cheese) 2-4 times a week.  Coffee but not every day and never full 8oz. Burgers and fries (perhaps once every 2 or three weeks) Pizza (maybe once or twice a month) if that.  I do eat salads with grilled chicken breast but I have been hating chicken for a while now. I stop believing that chicken, specially these days, is good for you.  I some times snack on almonds or walnuts.  Some times salmon for dinner.  Exercise Very little these days. I work in the IT field and spend most of my day sitting. I used to exercise a lot more in my teen's and 20s. I was very skinny. Sex  Married but very little sex drive and poor erection. This is been causing problems in my marriage of course.  Stress My job is somewhat stressful as so many other jobs but I never consider myself a stressful person. After talking with some people and general doctor they think I do suffer from anxiety.  The following are things that I have experienced related to anxiety. At night I have a hard time falling asleep especially after my heart palpitations became more frequent.  The thought of death comes to my mind. The fact that at one point in time I will die, just makes me anxious for a few minutes. Enough to get me from falling asleep. This doesn't happen often but I don't know why I think of that.  I have become a lot more conscious about my heart specially when I go to bed. I just hear it really loud and become aware of every beat making it difficult to fall asleep.  Lots of debt. This is something that for a whatever reason doesn't worry me like it should but I think it definitely affects my mental health.  Twice now I have noticed my heart at around 100-120 bpm for no reason. First time I was going to a weeding (I have gone to many weddings in my life) and I just couldn't feel at peace. I never figured out why my heart was beating fast for the majority of that afternoon.  Another night my heart was around 100bpm while I was trying to fall asleep. I have recorded those bpm with the Apple Watch and showed them to the cardiologist. They said I'm fine. Of course I don't believe them.  Some nights when about to go to bed I become cold to the point I am shivering. AC in the room 62F, outside 80sF. This is very worrying to me because then I feel like my heart takes a beating when this happens. I have to shut off the AC and take a hot shower to lower my body temperature. This has happened to me around 3 times in the past 6 months. The 2nd one was the reason I went to ER at midnight.  Visit to ER and Cardiologist  After 8hrs of waiting. They said I was fine and referred me to a cardiologist. Cardiologist gave me heart monitor for a week. They were looking for those palpitations which I had to do a ""manual entry"" to the monitor whenever I experienced those and I did. But they said my heart was fine. I did recommended me to exercise and eat small portions. I had told them than some times I do feel fatigued and even have felt the palpitations after eating. I thought it was because perhaps I ate too much fatty food or something. They think it's related to eating large portions. But again these heart palpitations have happened to me even when I am sitting in front of my computer.  I visited new primary doctor and told him about my recent events with my heart. He asked me some questions and after telling him that me and my wife are expecting our first baby he thought I was just anxious about it. And honestly it very hard for me to make that the cause of what's been happening to me. Yes, things will change when our baby is born but I don't even think about it too much. I'm not going crazy about it. I am happy about it and can't wait too meet our baby but I don't think about it 24/7. Is it really affecting me without me being aware? Around 7 years ago my old primary doctor told me my cholesterol was borderline high. I started exercising/moving more but have not been consistent. Back then I was having some asthma episodes triggered by dust mites. Those are not as present anymore but if I am exposed to dust or start running I may get asthma.  The heart situation have made me start researching about heart disease, heart attacks, high cholesterol, etc. Many doctors on YouTube talking about the dos and don'ts. Things to eat for a healthy heart. I have implemented some foods into my diet that are good for lowering cholesterol, help with arteries etc. Apple cider vinegar, turmeric, walnuts, lemon juice, raw honey among others.

The doctor said that he should not have intercourse for that time. She also said that everything should be fine after 10 days. He went for a check up after 5 days, and they said that things were getting better. Fast-forward to 12-13 days after starting medication (he didnt have any sensations while urinating for a few days)... we had unprotected intercourse. 2-3 days after this intercourse, I started to have itching of my labia minora. The itching (has been going on week) is not persistent. Currently I am on my period, so I wash myself after urination... and then i feel the urge to itch... but usually I feel nothing during the day, or just a very slight ""burning"" or sometimes a urge to itch sensation. I was wondering if this is something slight or serious and what it could be? is it from the antibiotic he was on (since he did not take a probiotic) or maybe the UTI?"

He went for a check up after 5 days, and they said that things were getting better. Fast-forward to 12-13 days after starting medication (he didnt have any sensations while urinating for a few days)... we had unprotected intercourse. 2-3 days after this intercourse, I started to have itching of my labia minora.

No job no money, in the middle of a bankruptcy which is the 2nd most embarrassing thing on this planet to go through, and adding more and more hospital bills that will never get paid isn't anything i want to do. For their sake more so than my own. But over past few months my feet and legs have been swelling out and look like balloons as well as feels like it too. Same with my entire stomach. Growing to normal flat size to 9 months pregnant with triplets in a day or so then would go away. For about 5 months that was happening but now the stomach stays at full swell and feels like at anytime its going to burst and most of the time i wish it would and just get it over with. I can not eat for up to 2 weeks and still not lose a bit of swelling. And the past week i can feel sharp jolting pains in my chest, massive fatigue anytime i stand or bend over and rapid breathing along with wheezing when i lay down flat and on my sides. How worried should i be. In the course of a year i went from 166 lbs average built active man to a super pregnant 235 lbs paper weight that i dont recognize in the mirror at all. Any thoughts?"

Or am I overreacting?,"Hi there, so close to 7 weeks ago, 4/5 days after having sex with a new male partner I started developing symptoms of what I thought (hoped) was a UTI. We used a condom for vaginal sex, he had a condom on for receiving oral sex, but I did not have protection when he gave me oral. It was just a slight vaginal irritation at first. But I'm diligent with STI testing, so I got tested for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, bacterial vaginosis, and trich which all came back negative. I was then prescribed Cipro for a UTI since I had a dipstick test that showed bacteria and high white blood cell count. Symptoms seemed to go away then come back a couple days after finishing antibiotics. So back to the walk-in doctor I went. This time they took a urine culture and did another dip test. Dip test showed high white blood cells again. So he prescribed me Septra while I waited for the urine culture. 4 days into the antibiotics and my symptoms had worsened. Constant urge to urinate and feeling of vaginal irritation up inside me. No pain, just irritation. Hard to explain. So I went back. Culture seemed to be ""inconclusive"" due to bacterial contamination or something- he was difficult to understand. Gave another urine sample and was sent home with my THIRD antibiotic Macrobid. Symptoms started dissipating after about day 4 and seemed to go away for about a week? Maybe less, then started coming back again. Made an appt with my family doctor and he did more swabs for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trich, yeast which all came back negative again. He did a pelvic exam and didn't see any lesions inside me (unless they are further up- is that possible?). He also did a urine culture which came back negative this time. STILL having symptoms almost 7 weeks later and have now convinced myself (thank you anxiety and doctor Google) that I have urethral herpes or cancer or something. I know not all people have typical symptoms of herpes...I've been doing extensive googling and really don't know what else it could be. Getting super paranoid and anxious and would love some feedback! Lowdown- Symptoms: - Urinary urgency- especially after peeing. Typically dwindles away a bit if I don't go pee for a while. Seems to be worse at night right before going to sleep. Doesn't wake me up though and usually feels better in the morning, until I pee a couple times, that is. - Inside my vagina feels ""irritated"". No pain, no discharge, no smell, no lesions/blisters/etc. Just doesn't feel right. Again, hard to explain. Meds I am currently on (if that may mean anything): - Alesse birth control. - Synthroid for hypothyroid. - Also I get frequent headaches so I take Advil often.

I know not all people have typical symptoms of herpes...I've been doing extensive googling and really don't know what else it could be. Getting super paranoid and anxious and would love some feedback! Lowdown- Symptoms: - Urinary urgency- especially after peeing. Typically dwindles away a bit if I don't go pee for a while. Seems to be worse at night right before going to sleep. Doesn't wake me up though and usually feels better in the morning, until I pee a couple times, that is. - Inside my vagina feels ""irritated"". No pain, no discharge, no smell, no lesions/blisters/etc. Just doesn't feel right. Again, hard to explain. Meds I am currently on (if that may mean anything): - Alesse birth control. - Synthroid for hypothyroid. - Also I get frequent headaches so I take Advil often. Any advice is greatly appreciated while I wait to make another appointment with my doctor! Hopefully he will refer me to a urologist."

About two months ago I’ve had an extreme frequent urge to urinate sometimes I urinate 20+ times a day and it’s really starting to stress me out. This is without drinking an absurd amount of liquids either. Sometimes rarely I will get a slight pain in my penis but not often. As far as I know I have not noticed discharge, bumps or anything like that. From what I read it was most likely a UTI but I bought CVS UTI test strips and two have came back negative. I also took cipro for about 4 days. I still feel the need to urinate which seems to me to be beyond extremely excessive. What could this be please help me out thanks !"

I'm told both soap and oil could damage condoms.

About 18 months ago I noticed that my left ball was getting extremely red and some of the skin was starting to peel and become scaly in appearance. At about the same time I also noticed a small, pink bump that appeared on my ballsack, closish to the base of my penis. The bump was perfectly round, slightly raised, pink in color and smooth to the touch. I went to the nurse practitioner at my university (general medicine) for these issues and she diagnosed me with jock itch for my ball and genital warts. I was somewhat confused by the diagnosis of genital warts (years earlier I had gotten a HPV vaccine and I always use condoms during sex) and she admitted that she was somewhat unsure but that was what she believed it to be. Another complicating factor is that I was diagnosed with a medium sized varicocele in my left testicle at the age of 12. I was given aldara cream for the wart and lotramin for the jock itch. After 3 weeks of regimented application, neither condition changed. I went back to the same woman and she decided to treat my ball as a yeast infection and prescribed me medication accordingly (can’t remember what it was). For my pink bump they decided to freeze it off and LIBERALLY applied the cryotherapy. Another three weeks went by and my “wart” was gone and my ball had improved but still maintained a reddish color distinct from the pinkish color of my right testicle. During this time I also received a general STD test and all results were negative. 	Several months later I went to a urologist back at home who I had been going to for years. I explained the situation and he was convinced that it was NOT a genital wart. He was unsurprised by the diagnosis due to the fact that I was seen on a college campus which are apparently always more likely to diagnosis STDs to air on the side of caution. With regards to my ballsack problem he suggested that it was due to my extremely sensitive skin and recommended that I alter my bathroom routine and use soaps that were softer on the skin. I took his advice, and while my condition was temporarily relieved I still suffer constant irritation of my pubic region, almost EXCLUSIVELY in the area of my left testicle. To this day the testicle is still redder than my right. The vast majority of the time I experience general purpose itching that extends from my left ball up through the pubic hair region. Rarely, I also experience precise pain and irritation, however, it is ALWAYS located in the exact location where the cryotherapy was applied. The condition seems to worsen in hot, humid temperatures, after sex and after sitting for long periods of time. In the last 18 months, I have never noticed ANY irregular bumps or rashes and I check twice or more daily. I get relief when I slather the region in Eucerin cream twice daily (my current routine).  	My personal theory is that the irritation is due in large part to a combination of my sensitive skin, medium sized vericocele, and life in a hot, humid climate (south texas) as well as an active lifestyle that results in a lot of friction in the region. I have always been somewhat of a neurotic person but for the first time in my entire life I now have a girlfriend (great timing I know) and I don’t want to put her at risk for anything. Due to my current circumstances, seeking out the help of a professional isn’t my number 1 choice but I would do it if I absolutely had to.

I went to the nurse practitioner at my university (general medicine) for these issues and she diagnosed me with jock itch for my ball and genital warts. I was somewhat confused by the diagnosis of genital warts (years earlier I had gotten a HPV vaccine and I always use condoms during sex) and she admitted that she was somewhat unsure but that was what she believed it to be. Another complicating factor is that I was diagnosed with a medium sized varicocele in my left testicle at the age of 12. I was given aldara cream for the wart and lotramin for the jock itch. After 3 weeks of regimented application, neither condition changed. I went back to the same woman and she decided to treat my ball as a yeast infection and prescribed me medication accordingly (can’t remember what it was). For my pink bump they decided to freeze it off and LIBERALLY applied the cryotherapy. Another three weeks went by and my “wart” was gone and my ball had improved but still maintained a reddish color distinct from the pinkish color of my right testicle. During this time I also received a general STD test and all results were negative. 	Several months later I went to a urologist back at home who I had been going to for years. I explained the situation and he was convinced that it was NOT a genital wart. He was unsurprised by the diagnosis due to the fact that I was seen on a college campus which are apparently always more likely to diagnosis STDs to air on the side of caution. With regards to my ballsack problem he suggested that it was due to my extremely sensitive skin and recommended that I alter my bathroom routine and use soaps that were softer on the skin. I took his advice, and while my condition was temporarily relieved I still suffer constant irritation of my pubic region, almost EXCLUSIVELY in the area of my left testicle. To this day the testicle is still redder than my right. The vast majority of the time I experience general purpose itching that extends from my left ball up through the pubic hair region. Rarely, I also experience precise pain and irritation, however, it is ALWAYS located in the exact location where the cryotherapy was applied. The condition seems to worsen in hot, humid temperatures, after sex and after sitting for long periods of time. In the last 18 months, I have never noticed ANY irregular bumps or rashes and I check twice or more daily. I get relief when I slather the region in Eucerin cream twice daily (my current routine).  	My personal theory is that the irritation is due in large part to a combination of my sensitive skin, medium sized vericocele, and life in a hot, humid climate (south texas) as well as an active lifestyle that results in a lot of friction in the region. I have always been somewhat of a neurotic person but for the first time in my entire life I now have a girlfriend (great timing I know) and I don’t want to put her at risk for anything. Due to my current circumstances, seeking out the help of a professional isn’t my number 1 choice but I would do it if I absolutely had to. I would appreciate any advice from people with similar experiences or help from any medical professionals out there."

Both times I went to the ER and both times all tests came back negative for heart issues. I am still getting random stabbing pains in my chest and into my left arm but these are not paired with the rapid heart rate.  Additionally about 11 mos ago I had an epidural placed on a vein. They put a test dose in and it caused sensations very similar to what I felt these two times. It is my understanding if it had not been a test dose, I would have went into cardiac arrest.  The drs keep saying that it is probably just anxiety but I know my body and something isn’t right. Any insight would be much appreciated."

Initially I thought they are shave bumps/ingrown hair but that's quite unlikely as they still remain the same after 2 weeks. *They are about 1-2mm in size *Some or them are slightly reddish *They don't burst on their own. Yesterday, after shower, while using a towel, I accidentally broke one of them. There was slight bleeding *No itching or pain *They don't seem to be spreading further or growing. *Broken ones are healing themselves. *I am diabetic type 2 *Had contact with multiple sexual partners in the last 3-4months. None of them had anything visible like this Anybody know what do they look like?"

I am a 57 year old male. I drink 1 pint of Bourbon a night. My BP (even after Clonodine, Losartin, Water Pills (?), and Norvask?) hovers around 190/110.  Over the past ten years, I have had increasingly bizarre sleep disorders... I know I am going to sound weird, but here is what transpired:  First, there was a ""buzzing feeling"" in my nose as I fell to sleep.  Next, it progressed to a ""electric shock"" in my forehead.  Then, a SEVERE shocking feeling, lifting my body from the bed.  Now, it feels as if my entire body is electrocuted, and a color like a red or green ""spot"" appears with the shock... Today, I was both ""out of my BP medicine"", AND I had not eaten in 18 hours. While waiting on a coustomer, suddenly, my hair stood on straight end, I got Chills, I got EXTREMELY Clammy, I started to (Semi-Violently) Shake, and my Speech was so Shaky that it sounded like I was shivering... All the while, I felt fine. The Boss got my BP meds and made me eat several packs of crackers, and after an hour, I felt better... So, is it BP, Sugar, or Nothing at All? Thank You. Warren"

I am a male 59 years of age. I was born with a murmur and since December 2018 I started loosing my breath and fainting. As a matter of fact one time I felt on my head having to go to the ER and got 6 stitches. This past January my condition worsen I could not longer run or even walk fast because I would loose my breath. I went to my PCP and he after hearing my murmur sound so bad sent me immediately to a pulmonologist and cardiologist. One to verify all was well with my lungs and immediately he recognized that my murmur had gotten much bigger. My lungs are perfectly normal. He immediately refer me to a well known Cardiologist who discovered after having done a heart cat and also did a test inserting a camera through my esophagus and discovered it had grown 3 cm on my Septum middle of the heart left ventricle creating an obstacle to the mitral valve and the aortic valve as well. The blood would come out of the mitral and it would regurgitate back into the mitral valve creating damage to those valves. This in turn caused me to be without air and do the basic tasks of life. I had open heart surgery on March 26, 2019. All went well with my surgery except I also have a Pacemaker since they had to shaved off so much of the murmur that my lower part of the heart does not pump as much as it should but that is one reason why they invented the Pacemakers. I am doing great now, I function perfectly normal still tire at times but to get rid of the anesthesia and secondary effects takes a good 6 months to a year.  Recommendation see a cardiologist asap and try to get a heart cat and the other procedure done. This will tell him/her of the exact condition you are going through. People specially young such as athletes are presently dying who do not want to have open heart surgery."

Need natural alternatives.,"Hello, I'm writing regarding my mother's recent lab results. She has always had high cholesterol levels, but as time progresses her levels continue to increase. She has tried every cholesterol lowering medication on the market, aside from injections. We have had appointments with multiple cardiologists, but ultimately nothing changes. The last cardiologist did tests to rule out peripheral artery disease, because he suspected this was going on in her legs. The test came back negative, but he said that if she did not change things it would progress to that level. She is also a smoker and has had an extremely difficult time trying to stop. In addition to this she is not physical active, aside from walking around the house. She has severe back/ body pain and COPD just to add insult to injury. She also only eats one meal a day, by choice and usually the meal is unhealthy. The bottom line here is that she is in poor health due to her lifestyle, and the cholesterol meds have had adverse effects on her body. Her liver enzymes increased after taking Crestor to the point that she had to be taken off of the drug. I am trying to find something ""natural"" that will help her. I know fish oil has worked for people, I would like her to try that. At this point, I just don't know what dosage would do her good. I know she needs to stop smoking and become more active. I don't expect a miracle, but I would like to see the numbers lowered. She is only 57 years old, and living the lifestyle of someone who belongs in a nursing home. Just a few weeks ago she developed edema in her ankles and flank pain. Her doctor ordered labs, which is how I found out about the new levels. I assume this is all related to her heart and it worries me beyond anything I can put into words. I have spent years bringing her to doctors for her physical ailments, but this one is never resolved.

I used to have palpitations throughout puberty but they didnt cause me shortness of breath. I am male, 22 years old. I was on testosterone replacement therapy and used testosterone at a dose of 500mg (increased dose, trt was 125mg per week) per week from march to june. Recently i have been trying to come off the trt and my natural production is slowly kicking in. I must say that these palpitations coincide with the period of low testosterone. The thing is, i did a thorough heart check in july, so after my ""cycle"", ecg , ultrasound and wore 24h holter monitor. They said my hearth is healthy. I have been to the ER multiple times because of shortness of breath and panic attacks and during the period of low testosterone (which reached its climax during the last week where i felt as i havent slept for days and was getting  Palpitations throughout the day i am starting to feel better in the last few days, testicles have increased in size) so i assume low testosterone had a lot to do with anxiety. I have done more than a few ecg's post my cycle and they were all good however this last ecg showed signs of early repolarization but the doctor didnt seem concerned about that. I have a feeling that these latest palpitations are more sinister however i would like to hear your opinions. The fact that worries me the most is the shortness of breath that accompanies those palpitations. Could fluctuating hormone levels (my natural testosterone increasing) cause this? Or is there something more sinister at play? One more thing, i seem to get numb hands much more often lately. And i do get chest discomfort from time to time but i am not sure whether it is the heart, anxiety or digestion. My hematocrit is normal, 0.453. Looking forward to your responses"

Now after a two year break we caught up again however when we had sex for the first time after a two year break, she was quite loose, like someone who would have sex on a regular basis.

I also had several swab and urine tests and a spermoculture that all came back negative.  Though I got an MRI of the prostate that showed an inflammed prostate.  For the eyes i've got ciclosporin and ketitofen for 6 months. I've never had urethral swab after prostate massage because my urologist said it is useless. Now, my urologist thinks of putting me on Cortisone for 2 months. Do you think it is a good idea ? Do you have any explanation for the remaining symptoms ? Thank you for your help."

In 2008 I had an echocardiogram, X-Rays, MRI, EKG for a trip to the ER due to chest pains and racing heart. The ER Dr. said it was panic but though it would be good to test everything out to rule a heart issue out. All test came back good and there were no issues and my DR said I have a very healthy / strong heart.  Since then I’ve been to the ER a few times and all EKGs since then have shown no signs of issues or damage. And all agree it’s Panic Attacks.  Recently I’ve had issues with Panic Attacks and Anxiety again. I went to my Dr. and she listened to my heart and we did a cholesterol test since I’m 38 and it’s been a long time since I’ve been to the Dr.’s office. She said my heart sounded good and my cholesterol numbers were very good. I usually also take my BLood Pressure about once a week because I have a bad case of White coat syndrome.

So here is my question - I am currently in between jobs and don’t want to set up a Dr’s appointment until My new insurance kicks in with my new job.  I am an avid golfer, and I’ve noticed on days that it’s very hot and I sweat a lot, I notice that I have heart palpitations when I get settled in and start to rest after the round. I work out often and this usually never happens to me after even an intense workout. I also notice my heart rate will stay elected for a few hours afterwards.  My resting HR is about 75-80 but after I get settled in and relaxed after golf it’s around 98-108 on average and when i start to pay attention to it my anxiety goes up and it shoots up to 100-118  Could this be due to dehydration? I usually drink 75-100oz on any given day, but when I golf I’ve noticed that my intake drops to 30-40oz during the round (6 hours with warm up, and playing )  Should I drink more than what I’m currently taking or should I add an electrolyte to my water during the round?

I was told when I was about 12 or 13 that the doctor heard a heart murmur. I had an echo done and all was good.  About a year and a half ago, I had to go to the ER and the ER doctor told me again that I had a heart murmur and I needed to get it looked at. (No doctor has ever told me about a heart murmur in the years in between) I went to the cardiologist about 8 months ago and he said he didn't hear one, but his nurse said she did. I was sent for another echo and stress test, which both came back good. At my follow up appointment with the cardiologist, he said I didn't need to keep seeing him unless I had any further issues.  I was admitted into the hospital about 5 weeks ago for kidney stones while pregnant and the nurse on charge said she heard a very strong murmur.  My question is, what do I do now? Do I go back to the cardiologist? Is a murmur nothing to worry about after you get your heart looked at? Do I need a second opinion?  I'm just confused.  One important thing to note is that my father was born is valve issues that lead to open heart surgery twice (once when he was little and another in his 30's) and he ended up passing into his 40's from his valve shutting down. So, I just don't know if I need to take this more seriously than most when multiple medical professionals say they hear a murmur."

This was all because of chest pain and shortness of breath. I went to the ER, I had x-ray, EKG, blood tests, and ct scan. All came out normal. I also may have acid reflux.  I was not paying attention to my heart rate and looking for a pattern because they told me it is anxiety and nothing wrong with my heart. However, I have been monitoring my heart rate through my watch all day long. And noticed that when I am standing or laying down my heart rate is normal and it can be as low as 76 or 69. Once I stand, boom, my heart rate jumps to 100 and keeps increasing to 120 and 130 and so on, all this is while I am only standing not doing anything even not walking. When I walk, my heart rate fluctuates between 100-150. 150 was the highest rate I have hit so far.  And I remembered my first episode, which they said a panic attack, was when I was laying down and got up to turn off the lights and had chest pain, racing heart, and chocking feeling.  Why is this happening? I have prim doc is still investigating the issue to roll out everything and he will have me put a holter monitor for couple days. But I am worried now from every single activity as walking and standing seems to make my heart go up too high.  I am scared and my anxiety is getting worse. Note: age is 21.

Why would they implant a device like that and then don't monitor results? I don't want this monitor inside of my body if I can only record 4 episodes every 6 months. I have symptoms every single week. They also never explained anything to me. I only know from the online handbook I found that I have to keep a certain distance from electronic devices and even my induction cook top. Needless to say I'm not impressed with the health care system Anyone else with tips or recommendations?"

The doctor ordered a NT-proBNP blood test. During my visit he said my blood work looked fine. But later I reviewed my lab results print-out and it showed the BNP test was flagged as 'abnormal' with a result of less than 15 pg/ml. The reference range is 0-125 pg/ml. Is less than 15 an abnormal result? Could it indicate some type of heart failure?

I have a healthy sex drive for about 5 days in a row. My wife, who's libido is high, appreciates these days. During this time, I feel strong and mentally clear. I always feel like I'm ""cured"" and that my sex drive will continue to be strong. That never happens. After about 5 or so days, my sex drive plummets and is almost non-existent. I lose all interest in sex. I don't fantasize about having sex and feel like I'd be just fine if I never had sex again in my life. I have a difficult time even getting an erection. Even my morning erections go away or if there is one, it feels about as half as strong. This time lasts for about 2 weeks and sometimes longer.   I talked to my doctor when I first got married at age 22. Yes, this has been going on as far back as I can remember. The doctor thought it was in my head and gave me a Viagra sample. That didn't help anything. A few years later, I talked to a urologist. He looked at me and told me that I should be able to have sex 2-3 times a night multiple days a week because I was a health young man. He threatened to inject me with something to prove that my penis was okay. I passed on that. He also offered me some Viagra. Now let me point out again that during those 5 or so days, I feel like I'm God's gift to women and have no issues at all.   I recently talked to my primary care physician and he checked my Testosterone and it was on the lower end. He started giving me intramuscular injections of testosterone. I took it for a year with no changes to my pattern of sexual drive. It did absolutely nothing except give me headaches and so I stopped that. My sex drive continues to be hot and ice cold as described above.   Maybe this is just who I am, but it sucks. I have 3 brothers and they all have a constant strong libido. My wife would appreciate it if it could change as well. Any thoughts?"

Advice please?,"Hey guys, I had a close encounter last week and would just really appreciate some input. I'm pretty upset about it and am really concerned. It was a mistake that I will never make again. I'll start my saying that I'm a 29yo circumcised white male (healthy) Female (mid-40's, Hispanic, don't know anything else about her) I was in a really bad emotional state last week and just made a bad decision to see a sex worker. This was last Sunday (9 days ago). I was trying to be as safe as possible given the circumstances. For what it was worth, I asked her if she had any Std's or anything and she said that she didn't and always plays safe.  So I put a condom on and she performed oral for about 5 minutes, then we had vaginal intercourse for another 5 minutes. When I reinserted myself about two minutes into that and think the condom broke somewhere in there and may have had unprotected vaginal intercourse for possibly 3 minutes or so before we realized. Both of us were concerned and decided that we should just end it there since the mood was gone anyway. I asked again if she had any Std's for peace of mind and she said absolutely not and that she had a family and had to make sure she stayed safe. She says its not worth being unsafe (even though it's a very risky line of work she chose, etc). Starting the next day up to present (around 8 or 9 days), I've been experiencing a mild burning in my urethra and some tenderness/pain in my testicles. It doesn't really change when I urinate and feels like that feeling when you have really acidic urine or have to urinate really badly. I got tested for Gonorrhea and Clamydia on Thursday (4 days after and both came up negative). Can you guys provide any information on what you think it may be? Chances of getting HIV is she was in fact positive?  Anything will help. I'm going to get tested when the time frame after exposure permits, I would just like to hear anything you have to say that will help me until then. Again, just a bad decision that will NEVER happen again. Lesson learned. Thanks in advance!"

I'm looking for some support on my recent heart health issues. I'm a 43 y/o male nonsmoker. I have significant family history of poor heart health on my mothers side. I won't go into all of the specifics unless to keep this as short as possible. Here's my story: Around the first of this year I noticed some occasional dull achy chest pain. Was very sporadic and could happen at any time. This eventually became more and more frequent. In March I was sitting at work and was feeling the dull ache when I had an episode of sudden intense chest pain that doubled me over and caused SOB, nausea, and extreme sweating. A couple of weeks later I had some extreme SOB after moving a heavy object. My PCP did a work up (chest xray, holter monitor, ekg). All was normal except for ekg shows bradycardia (I exercise frequently). Cardiologist was not impressed but offered to order a stress test or CTA of Heart for my peace of mind. Being and xray tech, I opted for the CTA and it was positive for LAD stricture. On May 30th a Heart cath revealed an 80% ""widow maker"" stenosis in the mid LAD. Stent was placed and after increasing my workout routine I felt like a new man after a couple of weeks, all symptoms gone. Afterwards I correlated extreme fatigue and dizziness. Fast forward a couple of months and the dull achy pain starts coming back along with fatigue. On 9/27 I was jogging and had some pretty intense chest pain along with nausea and sweating. A trip to the ER and a heart cath later in the day and they find another 75% stenosis even more proximal in the LAD. Another stent was placed. F/u with my cardiologist was interesting. He doesn't feel that either stenting explained any of my symptoms and he couldn't explain why the other blockage happened so quickly. I'm still having the dull achy pressure/pain along with dizziness and sporadic SOB. On 10/16 I was also having some sharp stabbing type pain as well so I went to ER AGAIN. Nothing was found, troponin was ok. Was kept overnight for observation. Eventually the pains stopped in the night. My PCP is not satisfied that what has been done is sufficient. Based on the location of these blockages, he's concerned that maybe a bypass was the correct option from the start. Both interventionalists mentioned the possibility of by pass before each stent. My cardiologist says I need to be seen in a tertiary facility and I have an apt to see a specialist on 11/9. It's hard to correlate all of the things that I'm experiencing, but I know that something is not right with me. Any information or ideas would be very welcome. Thanks in advance to anyone who took the time to read all of this."

Please help,"Hey everyone. Can I start this by saying that I'm unbelievably concerned and stressed out about the possibility of contracting a very serious STD like HIV or other life-long, life-threatening ones (any in general). I'll make this as short and precise as possible. Honesty is key in providing you with as much information as possible for an accurate diagnosis or opinion (I hope). I was in a really bad state of mind emotionally on Sunday night (72 hours ago) and just made a terrible decision to see a prostitute to take my mind off things. I was still very concerned about the encounter and asked ahead of time (for what it was worth) if she had any std's at all. She said that she was a healthcare worker (worked at an obgyn) and that she didn't and was tested 3 months back and was cleared. It was at her place in a lower income area. We both agreed that a condom must be used at ALL TIMES. She gave me oral for maybe 3-4 minutes and then we had vaginal intercourse for 5-7 tops after that. We both noticed that the condom broke when I pulled out. I wasn't into it and just wanted to leave, so I didn't ejaculate. I think I felt it break when I reinsertwd myself in about 2-3 minutes prior to stopping. We both talked about how we were clean and shouldn't worry and I left, completely worrying because of the situation. Obviously I can't trust her one bit and was more concerned than she was.  I'm a 30yo circumcised, healthy white male. She was Hispanic, maybe mid-40's. The next morning I had a very mild burning sensation in my urethra that has persisted through today (Mon morning through Wed evening).  I guess what I'm asking for is some comforting statistics or advice on the situation given what you know... anything would help. I looked some stuff up but wanted to ask for a specific professional opinion to help sleep at night. Thank you in advance for anything. This was a one time mistake that will NEVER happen again as long as I live."

It all began around 6 months ago, she started developing a nasty cough. We figured it was caused by her smoking, so I told her it was time to quit! She cut down, first to around 5 cigarettes a day, then to 1 or 2. It did no good at all with the cough, it actually got worse and she started to lose energy mid day and was very tired and lathargic at night. This persisted for a few months, so she went to the doctors. The doctor seemed to think it was caused by acid reflux and prescribed her medication for that. It seemed to help a little, but not much. Her vitamin D was also low, so she was prescribed a supplement to take each day. None of this was really helping the problem, still coughing, still low energy later in the day but felt fine early in the day. Then one morning things got worse quick, she called me and said she wasn't feeling right and needed me to check on her (I live right next door). So I ran over as fast as I could, she couldn't stand up and walk without getting weak and falling down, she was sweating bad, dizzy, heart racing. I called 911 immediately and she was brought to the local hospital, diagnosed with AFIB. I thought this could be part of the answer, the lack of oxygen to her blood is causing her fatigue, which has been the most crippling part of all of this! She was given Xarelto and a few other meds, I know she was given a blood thinner, maybe that is what the Xarelto is? Anyways, after staying there for 48 hours, she was sent home! When she first got home she was feeling a little better, she went back to work after a few days and I figured half the battle was won! This sadly has not been the case, as the cough had gotten worse, as had her breathing. A lot of the time she was wheezing, especially during a coughing spell. The cough is productive, as it does produce phglehm but it never seems to get better and in fact, worsens. She hadn't been able to sleep a full night in over 2 months at that time, it has effected her sleeping down to maybe 4-5 hours a night, sometimes less! Then about 2 1/2 weeks ago, she had a doctors appointment. At this point she had been working most days, she has as many sick days as she needs to take off before retirment but being they were intended to pay for her health insurance, she don't want to use all of them. When she got to the doctors, they found an alarming abnormality in her EKG and wanted her to go to a hospital immediatly! This time they sent her to a hospital around 50 miles away, that specializes in heart health. The hospital is well known for it's cardiac unit and I figured she was in good hands and maybe we could finally get some answers! They did an EKG there, said it was fine, blamed it on the doctors offices EKG machine and said her heart was fine. We asked what was causing the fatigue and cough to get worse and he acted like he couldn't even look at it! Basically said since he checked her heart and it was fine, he wasn't doing anything else. Not check her breathing, not refer her to anyone, nothing! There were over a DOZEN overdoses in the emergency department during the time we were there and they seemed to take precidence over her, which is absolutely obsurd! At any rate, we left there with no more information than we had, her coughing getting more persistant to the point it makes her chest hurt from coughing so much and her fatigue getting worse! Was NOT impressed by that hospital and as I have chosen not to put them on blast, if you live in central NY, ask and I shall tell! As the past two weeks have went on, she has gotten even worse. Now just walking from her chair to the bedroom and back or through the store has her out of breath. She feels normal when she is sitting or lying down, besides the cough. She just has NO energy to do anything, even talk much sometimes. Gets winded and starts wheezing walking a short distance, especially in the heat. To recap, before 5 days ago we knew almost nothing of what is causing this. A week ago she went in and had a chest X-ray done, nothing abnormal came up on that. She had a breathing test done and her breathing is at 50% capacity. Her doctor ordered for her to have a CAT scan done 5 days ago, she went and had it done at our local hospital then came home. She couldn't have been home an hour and they called her up, wanted her to come back in right then to talk about the results! I was freaking out! All I could think was lung cancer as my brother died at 35 from germ cell carcinoma of the lungs. Turned out they found ""abnormal tissue"" at the base of her esophagaus. Her lymph nodes at the site were also swollen, which for whatever reason alarmed the doctors. This is what they are saying is causing the cough and the lack of oxygen, making her fatigued. They told her that her lungs were in great shape, which came as a surprise being she has smoked her entire life up until recently. There were no tumors or anything at the site of the abnormal tissue, her blood work also came back great. When my brother was battling cancer, there were markers in his blood which indicated cancer, none were found in my moms blood work. She has to have a scope and a culture done on her esophagaus this coming Monday, then see an oncologist. Issue is it KEEPS getting worse and is starting to worry me greatly! Sleeping a few hours a night, falling asleep during the day, she is starting to get depressed and down in her spirits which is not like her at all. I am now doing all of the cleaning, cooking, laundry, shopping, etc... as she cannot walk far at all without being out of breathe. Absolutely do not mind at all helping her, she is just an independent person who is looking forward to enjoying her retirement! Aside from the scope Monday, no other appointments are scheduled including the oncologist appointment. All the doctors including her own, are on ""vacation"". I just see this as much more serious than they do, after losing my father to a stroke and my only sibling to cancer, I don't want to lose my mom. The worse she gets, the more I worry and make her call and try to find out ANY information on some action being taken. The ONLY thing that does help a little is a nebulizer, which she just got today. It helps her breathe better and I have noticed the cough is not so bad. Tonight she is sleeping much better, which is really good! She has two inhalers, one does not do anything, that is the twice daily one. The other is one she can take whenever she wants or a ""rescue inhaler"", that one makes her heart race and feel funny so she is not using that one. At this point, we are both very worried about what could be wrong and I am sick of watching my mother suffer while doctors take vacations! At very least, someone could look into the issue far enough to provide some relief from the symptoms! Problem is, no one even knows exactly what the problem is yet!  If anyone has any insight at all it would be GREATLY appreciated! As for immediate family, my mother and my son are ALL I have! They are almost all I have in general although I feel I should mention, my moms parents are still alive. My grandmother is 87 and my grandfather is 92! My great grandparents also died in their 90's, so living to be very old runs in my moms family. Good health runs in her family, there are no genetic diseases or cancer in her family history at all, other than diabetes. This is why I do not get why her health is slipping so quickly.... She was fine 7 months ago, now she can't even do most things for herself? Seeing this is killing me and the doctors aren't a ton of help or in a big hurry around here, which I personally feel they should be! Please if you have any suggestions or insight I would love to hear it, thank you!"

I am now doing all of the cleaning, cooking, laundry, shopping, etc... as she cannot walk far at all without being out of breathe. Absolutely do not mind at all helping her, she is just an independent person who is looking forward to enjoying her retirement! Aside from the scope Monday, no other appointments are scheduled including the oncologist appointment. All the doctors including her own, are on ""vacation"". I just see this as much more serious than they do, after losing my father to a stroke and my only sibling to cancer, I don't want to lose my mom. The worse she gets, the more I worry and make her call and try to find out ANY information on some action being taken. The ONLY thing that does help a little is a nebulizer, which she just got today. It helps her breathe better and I have noticed the cough is not so bad. Tonight she is sleeping much better, which is really good! She has two inhalers, one does not do anything, that is the twice daily one. The other is one she can take whenever she wants or a ""rescue inhaler"", that one makes her heart race and feel funny so she is not using that one. At this point, we are both very worried about what could be wrong and I am sick of watching my mother suffer while doctors take vacations! At very least, someone could look into the issue far enough to provide some relief from the symptoms! Problem is, no one even knows exactly what the problem is yet!  If anyone has any insight at all it would be GREATLY appreciated! As for immediate family, my mother and my son are ALL I have! They are almost all I have in general although I feel I should mention, my moms parents are still alive. My grandmother is 87 and my grandfather is 92! My great grandparents also died in their 90's, so living to be very old runs in my moms family. Good health runs in her family, there are no genetic diseases or cancer in her family history at all, other than diabetes. This is why I do not get why her health is slipping so quickly.... She was fine 7 months ago, now she can't even do most things for herself? Seeing this is killing me and the doctors aren't a ton of help or in a big hurry around here, which I personally feel they should be! Please if you have any suggestions or insight I would love to hear it, thank you!"

I have Googled, asked everyone I know including a few nurses and her doctors, I have even read medical books! Since she has had both heart issues and breathing issues, I figured Heart Health was the appropriate place to post this. To start with, she will be 62 in September and has for the most part been in perfect health her entire life. Her immune system is a ROCK, she NEVER gets sick even though she works in a school where kids are sick all the time. She has always been a smoker, a pack a day or sometimes less. Always had a ton of ambition, has worked full time for as long as I can remember and used to work two jobs when I was little. She is less than two months away from retirement!  It all began around 6 months ago, she started developing a nasty cough. We figured it was caused by her smoking, so I told her it was time to quit! She cut down, first to around 5 cigarettes a day, then to 1 or 2. It did no good at all with the cough, it actually got worse and she started to lose energy mid day and was very tired and lathargic at night. This persisted for a few months, so she went to the doctors. The doctor seemed to think it was caused by acid reflux and prescribed her medication for that. It seemed to help a little, but not much. Her vitamin D was also low, so she was prescribed a supplement to take each day. None of this was really helping the problem, still coughing, still low energy later in the day but felt fine early in the day. Then one morning things got worse quick, she called me and said she wasn't feeling right and needed me to check on her (I live right next door). So I ran over as fast as I could, she couldn't stand up and walk without getting weak and falling down, she was sweating bad, dizzy, heart racing. I called 911 immediately and she was brought to the local hospital, diagnosed with AFIB. I thought this could be part of the answer, the lack of oxygen to her blood is causing her fatigue, which has been the most crippling part of all of this! She was given Xarelto and a few other meds, I know she was given a blood thinner, maybe that is what the Xarelto is? Anyways, after staying there for 48 hours, she was sent home! When she first got home she was feeling a little better, she went back to work after a few days and I figured half the battle was won! This sadly has not been the case, as the cough had gotten worse, as had her breathing. A lot of the time she was wheezing, especially during a coughing spell. The cough is productive, as it does produce phglehm but it never seems to get better and in fact, worsens. She hadn't been able to sleep a full night in over 2 months at that time, it has effected her sleeping down to maybe 4-5 hours a night, sometimes less! Then about 2 1/2 weeks ago, she had a doctors appointment. At this point she had been working most days, she has as many sick days as she needs to take off before retirment but being they were intended to pay for her health insurance, she don't want to use all of them. When she got to the doctors, they found an alarming abnormality in her EKG and wanted her to go to a hospital immediatly! This time they sent her to a hospital around 50 miles away, that specializes in heart health. The hospital is well known for it's cardiac unit and I figured she was in good hands and maybe we could finally get some answers! They did an EKG there, said it was fine, blamed it on the doctors offices EKG machine and said her heart was fine. We asked what was causing the fatigue and cough to get worse and he acted like he couldn't even look at it! Basically said since he checked her heart and it was fine, he wasn't doing anything else. Not check her breathing, not refer her to anyone, nothing! There were over a DOZEN overdoses in the emergency department during the time we were there and they seemed to take precidence over her, which is absolutely obsurd! At any rate, we left there with no more information than we had, her coughing getting more persistant to the point it makes her chest hurt from coughing so much and her fatigue getting worse! Was NOT impressed by that hospital and as I have chosen not to put them on blast, if you live in central NY, ask and I shall tell! As the past two weeks have went on, she has gotten even worse. Now just walking from her chair to the bedroom and back or through the store has her out of breath. She feels normal when she is sitting or lying down, besides the cough. She just has NO energy to do anything, even talk much sometimes. Gets winded and starts wheezing walking a short distance, especially in the heat. To recap, before 5 days ago we knew almost nothing of what is causing this. A week ago she went in and had a chest X-ray done, nothing abnormal came up on that. She had a breathing test done and her breathing is at 50% capacity. Her doctor ordered for her to have a CAT scan done 5 days ago, she went and had it done at our local hospital then came home. She couldn't have been home an hour and they called her up, wanted her to come back in right then to talk about the results! I was freaking out! All I could think was lung cancer as my brother died at 35 from germ cell carcinoma of the lungs. Turned out they found ""abnormal tissue"" at the base of her esophagaus. Her lymph nodes at the site were also swollen, which for whatever reason alarmed the doctors. This is what they are saying is causing the cough and the lack of oxygen, making her fatigued. They told her that her lungs were in great shape, which came as a surprise being she has smoked her entire life up until recently. There were no tumors or anything at the site of the abnormal tissue, her blood work also came back great. When my brother was battling cancer, there were markers in his blood which indicated cancer, none were found in my moms blood work. She has to have a scope and a culture done on her esophagaus this coming Monday, then see an oncologist. Issue is it KEEPS getting worse and is starting to worry me greatly! Sleeping a few hours a night, falling asleep during the day, she is starting to get depressed and down in her spirits which is not like her at all.

I do have A-Fib .... but only 3 episodes over 3 years .... all 3 episodes were due to stressful situations. One evening this week after i got home from work and was watching TV. My throat area of the neck ached and tightness across the chest. I waited for a little while ... Is this a heart attack. I decided I needed to go to the E/R and be evaluated for heart attack. It was not A-Fib ... my blood pressure was fine and even.  When I to to the E/R they did an EKG ... normal. They did blood tests ... several ... and there was no enzymes in my blood showing I had had a heart attack. They did a chest x-ray ... normal. In the past I have had Asthma, but has been totally non existent. But they decided to give me a breathing treatment. I felt better ... but I also had been sitting on a gurney and not moving.  I went home at 5 a.m.... and it started all over again, but worse. It was only on the right side of my front neck and going down to my breast area. I could not lay down, that made it much worse. So I sat up all night. Around 9 a.m. I called my PCP office and was able to get in that afternoon. The paid was still there. The PCP examined me and could not find anything wrong ... other than my pain.

Went and got tested at the local health department which only tests for HIV, G and C, and syphallus. All came back negative. This was a month after the encounter. A few weeks later I began to notice a *** discharge coming from the Urethra. Seemed to be heaviest as I slept and would really notice it after I woke up. Moderate to ,at times, intense burning during urination but not during ejaculation. As well as an intense itching mid shaft in the urethra.  Visited the Doc where he gave me the shot in the hip and another antibiotic for 7 days. This seemed to clear up all the symptoms for about a week or so. However when I ejaculate it’s a very thin, viscous liquid. Doesn’t seem to contain any white. Whereas it used to be quite thick and quite a bit.  Revisited the doc where he gave me another shot and put me on Flagel for 10 days. Again, symptoms came back a few days ago but this time to discharge seems less yellow and more clear and nowhere near as much.  Suggestions, life experiences, answers?"

Also, his calcium score has increased by 60 points in the last 3 years but is still considered low. All of this doesn't follow the ""multiple organ dysfunction"" line from what I can tell, but it seems that MODS is caused by infection which then leads to inflammatory responses by the systems of the body.

I know what sex should feel like because I can fully enjoy sex and orgasm when I'm intoxicated and when when I'm not intoxicated it's still very mentally pleasing and exciting but my body just isn't registering the same way my brain is. I have tried everything from going off of my medicine, not thinking at all, focusing really hard, sensory deprivation from blindfolds, etc and nothing makes sex really enjoyable other than drinking.

They are shiny, reflect off light, very small, don’t looked to filled with any liquid. I recently was giving myself a self-examination when I noticed all of those bumps around my penile shaft. What could this be? (Willing to provide pictures if needed.) Also to let you know about my sexual activity I’ve had a gf from the start of August 2016 until August of 2017. I was faithful throughout the whole relationship until we had broke up for a couple months without contact. Me and ex had unprotected sex almost all the time because we were comfortable with each other and trusted each other. So after we broke i had unprotected oral sex and partial unprotected vaginal sex with one of my friends. To clarify on the “partial” part I stuck my penis inside her and then took it out forgetting that I didn’t have a condom on. The reason I’m nervous is because she bled during sex and I was looking up symptoms for bleeding during sex and it said it’s more than likely hpv. I spoke with the recent girl I’ve had sex with and she assured me it’s because I tore her lining in her vagina but I’m not buying it at all. Because after we had sex a month later I see these bumps. Should I be worried? Well I’m already worried. So I should say is this something serious. Also if you could tell me what you think could be wrong with my penis head with all of those bumps.

I am a male, My age is 21 years old. I was diagnosed with hypertensive blood pressure this year in mid of February. I used to smoke sheesha a lot, have been doing it since the past 2-3 years almost every day. As soon as I got diagnosed with high blood pressure I immediately stopped smoking and tried controlling my blood pressure through several lifestyle changes such as diet, exercising, quit smoking, etc.  All of this did work for a while without medication but one day when I was driving back home I suddenly felt fast heart rate, heavy head, little short of breath kind of feeling, I got it checked at the hospital and it was my blood pressure shooting up all of a sudden although I did not even smoke or something.  The next day I went to my cardiologist who decided to put me on a very lighter dose of Diovan 80 (half dose which makes it 40mg). Nyow it has been almost 5 months since I am taking this medication. My blood pressure keeps controlled but sometimes all of sudden I feel high blood pressure symptoms I dont know why, mostly when I am driving back home and today also this happened because of which I had to stop by to the pharmacy and take my medicine. After taking my dose I felt better. Now is it actually getting worse or is it just my anxiety or something?  Because I have got Troponin, CBC, ECG, Kidney, BUN, Sodium, etc. blood tests done several times but all of my reports have come normal.  The only thing which bothers me is this can happen anytime with me even if I am with friends or out at work which can make the situation quite embarrassing for me. Plus, I am too young for all of this. I admit it was my own fault of smoking, eating food from outside, etc. but I really want to get over it. I want to become better. Because it just makes me feel depressed at times, I did started taking anti-depressants also and I am about to quit them in a month or two as my psychiatrist says.  Google has always scared me, reading posts which say blood pressure cannot be cured once you get it, bla bla it all just makes me upset. I do not want to rely on medicines, I want to get better, like before.  Can anyone please help me out on this? I really need genuine help. Answers from cardiologists, experienced people / doctors are preferred!"

When I start having problems in my testicles, I can't sit still I am in that much pain. Then my anxiety begins to go crazy. I've tried hormone replacement like taking testosterone shots and the cream. It didn't help. I try sleeping it off. Doesn't help. Even taking a cold bath, sometimes even a hot bath. That sometimes relieves the pain. But not my much. I have trouble getting my point across, so I thought I would type it all down.

I've been attempting to refrain from doing this. Too many, problems. There came a time where I would prefer masturbating than having sex. One of the problems is that I'm a lousy lover. I know I should never allow myself to feel self-conscious or inadequate in any way. When my wife and I do actually have intercourse, I struggle with keeping and maintaining my erection and by keeping stamina and hardness throughout the act. Whenever I lose my erection, I merely am discouraged and roll over and become seriously ticked off at myself, not with my wife. Because I can't stay hard enough to have sex. We've tried anal sex, it worked for a while, till all of a sudden it doesn't work anymore. Have no idea what happened. Just stopped working. Another problem I have is not getting ""satisfied"" by my wife giving me oral sex. I can't seem to get an erection. Weird, right? I am clueless. This is going to sound strange, especially coming from a male. Where men are expected to be ""sex animals"". But whenever my wife performs fellatio, I don't know how to react. I look at her. It's a very odd, and strange feeling. She has asked me once if I liked what she was doing. I couldn't answer her because I didn't know what to say. When I perform oral stimulation on my wife, I still fail to get an erection. *Sighs* Whenever I obtain an erection, and I'm really hard, it hurts like hell. Noticed the head of my penis would turn colors. The pain would start at the shaft and then move down to my testicles. My wife and I have tried reciprocal masturbation together, unfortunately, it never worked for me either. Learning to relax and eliminate distractions is something I have trouble addressing. I suppose I am size-obsessed. In my younger years, two of my ex-girlfriends would say that I had a big penis. Nonetheless, I also believed they just said that at the time, because I was with them. My wife had said I was ""big enough"" for her. Nevertheless, again, I don't think I will ever get past this. And accept me for me. My current counselor has stated that I need to learn to appreciate my body as it is. It's a task I have trouble accepting, despite my body insecurity. And she too was right, about having these sexual issues is without a doubt preventing genuine closeness between my wife and me. I am most positive. You are gonna think I’m perverted."

Since the beginning we are unable to indulge in the pleasurable sex. I always feel so much pressure at the opening of vagina and burning sensation inside vagina while penetration. Both of us feel that the passage of my vagina is so much narrow. Also there is lack of Lubrication. Frequent infection has also been diagnosed in my vagina.  We have been to 5 doctors and have taken many anti-infective medicines oral as well intravaginal. Nothing has changed much. The doctor we are consulting right now, has told us that my pubic bone is quite lower and therefore it comes in the vaginal passage. I can feel a convex shaped mass inside the vaginal opening. What I observe is that due to this bone, penetration becomes difficult and when we try to do so, I feel terrible pain and then get infected.  Gradually I have lost interest in sex. And that affects our relationship very much.  Is there anyone who can guide me?"

She takes suppressive medication, obviously wasn't having an outbreak, and for the time we were actually having sex, I was wearing a condom. I understand fully that the chances of me contracting herpes is EXTRAORDINARILY slim under these circumstances. Alas, I am obsessing over it, day and night. It has only been a couple of days but I am convinced that I'm having itching and burning and developing rashes that will soon become sores. Some of the reasons that I have been giving myself to rationalize my obsession, knowing that my chances are incredibly low, is that she gave me a bleeding scratch all the way down my side to my hip, gave me unprotected oral sex before and after intercourse, and tried (and momentarily succeeded) to put her finger up my anus during the second bout of oral sex (she was also very rough and I chafe easily). I would just like to know peoples thoughts on this. Even with these external factors, do you think that I am reasonably worried?"

(because i read degenerating will eventually stop and it is not harmful) also i read that surgery is not desirable when reaching age of menopause.  what should we do ? do the surgery or just wait it out? (remember in countries like ours they do anything for profit even if it isn't necessary) what is your opinion on degenerating fibroid ? are they indeed dangerous as 'doctors' here say?"

To give some background (I have no idea if this has anything to do with my current condition) I have had bad stomach tension in the middle right area of my stomach and pain for the past few years along with nausea. about a year and a half ago, I had my gall bladder taken out due to it not working properly and I thought that my problems were solved. A few months ago, the problem came back with more tension and less nausea. This has already been quite uncomfortable, causing so much tension that my neck and back end up extremely sore and difficult to move. 8 days ago, I started to feel extremely dizzy and lightheaded at work. I got sent home and the problem got worse. I started monitoring my blood pressure and it is fluctuating every minute or so pretty rapidly. The top number goes form 110-180 extremely quickly without any reason and the bottom number usually stays around 80, but yesterday it went to 120 multiple times. I am now always slightly dizzy and lightheaded and I cannot even do something like take the dog for a walk without losing all my color and falling. I have passed out twice after attempting to push myself. I have also gone to the ER twice, urgent care once and attempted to figure out the problem with my new primary care doctor. The ER did an EKG and bloodwork which were fine, though I I was experiencing syncopy, with my pulse at 46-49. My blood pressure was still all over the place, but they said they couldn't do anything unless it was a life threatening emergency and sent me home both times with a prescription for meclizine. The meclizine has not helped. The Urgent care doctor actually was able to have me almost pass out into her arms by having me sit down and stand up rapidly and recommended a CAT scan along with more monitoring how simple actions affect my blood pressure. They sent me to the ER that once again did nothing and did not even monitor my blood pressure on the second visit (Besides taking it once and seeing that it was 160/80) My primary care doctor was my last hope, but because of the fact that I was prescribed xanax over 6 years ago, he refuses to believe anything other than xanax withdrawal is the cause.I was also running a fever of 100.4 yesterday that ibuprofen took down and I have lost 6 pounds in the last week and a half despite eating normally. If anyone has an idea for some relief or a possible solution to this issue, please let me know. this last week has been an absolute nightmare and I don't know what I can possibly do. I have not been able to work and simple tasks are very difficult. I know there are so many random symptoms, but if anyone has any clue or similar experience, i would greatly appreciate the help"

We went back and convinced him to rest. The next day we went back to the lake but could only go halfway before he started vomiting. Had to take him back. He seemed a bit worried about this.  Can anyone tell me a solution for this?  Could this be something related to his heart condition?"

It is the second time it has appeared. I have a boyfriend but he does not have any herpes or anything like that, I know for a fact. I have never kissed or touched anyone else, nor do I touch things with my lips that are not from my family and I also know for a fact they don't have any std's or herpes. It suddenly appeared on my lip, specifically between my bottom and upper lip, and it's only one not clusters or anything like that. I asked my boyfriend about it and he said it looks more like a cut, and I would believe it but it appeared twice so it's clearly more than a cut. I have kissed my boyfriend multiple times during this thing is on my lips and he doesn't mind either, and nothing happened to him. Nothing transferred to his lips or body. I will take a picture of it, and I cannot go to a doctor for this because if it ends up being something I will be shamed by the whole family. So by this picture hopefully you can find something. If it looks like lumps it's not, its just one big red thing with a slice down the middle, no puss and not itchy, no burning, only soreness if applied pressure."

I just found out what meatitis was, and it's the ""inflammation"" or ""swelling"" of the urethral meatus of the penis, usually caused by circumcision. I'm 16 years old, not circumcised (intact), and I've noticed that my meatus doesn't seem normal compared to the meatus of others. (For example: Porn, pictures, etc) I noticed people's meatus tend to be small or doesn't stick out at all. It just usually tends to be a hole. However, with mine, if you look up a picture of meatitis, it's sort of like that. My meatus has never caused me any trouble. I don't have any STD's, have no trouble urinating, or if needed (yes, masturbation. Everyone does it, it's normal.) Although my meatus hasn't caused me any health trouble(s), the thing that bothers me about it is it looks weird, because it's rare. Someone posted a similar post like this 14 years ago, but only got 7 responses and none actually addressed the topic. Can someone help me please? **Is there anything I can do to make my meatus ""normal""/""go down"" (my meatus has been like this for as long as I can remember). Was I just naturally like this? Someone, help me please.** I need help, please. This has nothing to do with my foreskin either, as my foreskin has never caused me trouble. I just bring this up because meatitis is mostly common in circumcised males; I'm not circumcised."

I've had palpitations for years, by usually it's only a few per day. I've had my heart checked by echocardiogram, holter, blood tests, EKG, MRI.  Everything is always normal.  Well last night I had a small margarita and settled down to watch some tv before bed.  Then my heart started fluttering. It would feel like a flutter or strong beat. When I felt my pulse it almost seemed like it skipped a beat then would have a really strong beat.  This happened dozens of times per hour for at least 2 hours. I clocked it and I was getting a palpitation anywhere from every 2 seconds to every minute. Usually averaging about one every 10 seconds. Each palpitation only lasted a second or less.  I had no other symptoms: didn't feel pain or lightheaded. Pulse was slightly elevated for me (was around 80 bpm)  Eventually I thought it could be from dehydration so I drank 2 gatorades then that's when it began to dwindle and eventually stop. I've been awake about an hour and haven't had any today.  What's up with this? Do I need to see my dr about this?"

He listened to my heart and told I had a heart murmur I/II degree, did a 24 hour Holter and found I was having tachycardia, and sinusal breathing arritmia. The Dr said it was nothing serious so prescribed nothing. Meanwhile I had lost 5kg in a month ( probably because of the cold). Had an investigation of what was causing the heart murmur so I did:  Thyroid eco: found several cistes on thyroid  Heart eco- all normal and functioning normal no alterations  Thyroid hormones tested- TSH, T3 and T4 all within normal range  Blood work- all normal  Nose and throat bacteria test- found a Kleibsiela bacteria on my throat (antibiotics prescribed for that) nose come back clear.

I can't exactly pinpoint there the pain comes from, if it's from the testicle itself or, somewhere around it. It's not very painful actually, but still hurts enough that I can feel it. I would say about 3,5/10. I have tried massaging my right testicle, and It doesn't actually hurt MORE when I do it, but when I massage the stuff around it, the tubes, or the epididymis, it hurts a bit. The days after the kick, my right testicle was a bit redder and hung a bit lower, but everything looks normal now. Is this because of the kick? Because if it was testicular torsion, rupture or someting serious, it would hurt A LOT, right? Should I just see if it wears off like the redness did? It doesn't feel SERIOUS, but it is getting kind of annoying now."

They would then itch for a day and then close up. And then be ripped back open with sex or diva cup use. I have since become single and so only have a diva cup to test the situation, and even using lube when inserting the diva cup will still open a fissure. Last month with my second official outbreak, my diva cup tore the skin right at the base of the vaginal opening, and a day later, I developed a sore. My gyno has had me try estrogen cream, daily suppressives, and a steroid cream and nothing has worked to stop the tearing. Does HSV cause a thinning of the skin? Are these torn skin/vaginal fissures actually outbreaks? Please help! I'm afraid I can never have sex again without ripping open my vaginal skin, or afraid they'll rip and transmit the virus."

I never experience pain of any kind, only intense pleasure and I even have anal orgasms. Hubby's penis is very thick. I can't even close my hand around it. But with just a couple minutes of relaxation, plenty of lube, and making sure I'm totally aroused first I totally enjoy every second of it, especially very hard and deep. About a month ago after a session where that night my husband was extra hard and thick, the next morning I noticed bright red blood on the toilet paper after a bowel movement. Not alot, just a trace. Obviously I now must have a tiny tear or cut in my rear. So we stopped having anal sex hoping it would just heal quickly. Now I will go 3-4 days without bleeding, getting my hopes up, then have a bowel movement and see the blood again. Why is this taking so long to heal? It's barely a trace of blood, but it keeps coming back every 3-4 days.  Is there any way to speed up healing what has to be just a tiny little tear or cut in my rectum? I've tried sitting in hot baths which seems to stop it for a day or two, but then having a couple bowel movements seems to open it up again. Please help us, this is the most fun we've had in bed in 30 years and we're totally frustrated and anxious to get back to our back door fun!"

I advised the hospital of this and I suggested my teeth were the culprit and they basically thought I was crazy and that they have no connection with each other. The first appointment they diagnosed me with reflux so they prescribed me omeprazole and that didn’t work.  Then 2nd visit they finally did a chest x-ray, ekg, an ultrasound of my heart, blood and urine tests and did not find anything. I left the hospital still in pain and they basically shrugged it off as nothing.  I went to the dentist the next day and was advised that, in the lower left side of my mouth, I have a fractured wisdom tooth hitting the nerve.

I’m experiencing terrible chest pains that radiate down my arm and jaw. I’m also experiencing teeth pain on the lower left side. My neck is starting to hurt and im having new pain under my arm pit. I haven’t been sleeping due to the pain.  I advised the hospital of this and I suggested my teeth were the culprit and they basically thought I was crazy and that they have no connection with each other. The first appointment they diagnosed me with reflux so they prescribed me omeprazole and that didn’t work.  Then 2nd visit they finally did a chest x-ray, ekg, an ultrasound of my heart, blood and urine tests and did not find anything. I left the hospital still in pain and they basically shrugged it off as nothing.  I went to the dentist the next day and was advised that, in the lower left side of my mouth, I have a fractured wisdom tooth hitting the nerve.

It's hard for me to translate the pain into words, but I'll try. It happens behind my sternum. It feels... sore and heavy? It's also kind of difficult to breathe when it happens. It lasts for several minutes. I also get rib pains (not always at the same time). It kind of feels like someone is tying a corset onto me or that my ribcage is shrinking.  I have a possible cause: I have lost weight in this past year. In August 2017, I was 123 pounds and started to diet. I lost 5 pounds by January. Another 5 by the end of January, and 10 since March. I'm not sure if that's considered ""rapid"" weight loss, but I know rapid weight loss can cause chest pain.  Other possibilities include stress or anxiety. My job has been rather stressful since March and on, and I do suffer from anxiety.  So I have two questions: 1. Is there a way to definitively determine the cause of the pain if I go to the doctor? Are there physical tests to find the cause? Or will it be a guessing game? 2. If it is due to weight loss, are there any irreversible consequences from the chest pains? This is probably impossible to answer with a diagnosis, sorry! Thank you for taking the time to read this!"

I have always worn a condom no matter who I have sex with. I know condoms aren’t 100% full proof against STDs but they help. About a week and a half ago I had vagina sex with someone different. My penis went into her vagina at the beginning of sex twice for about 5 seconds, each time without a condom. I stopped and insisted I needed a condom. Again never had sex without one until then, for those few short seconds. So I put the condom on and we had sex. Came in the condom in her. A week and a half goes by and she tells me we need to talk and she tells me she has been having cramps and it burns when she pees. So she went to the doctor and said they did a UTI test in her that came back negative. And will get the Chalmydia results later this week. She had sex prior to me six months ago unprotected with her last boyfriend. And was with him for almost a year, and says she was tested right before she started dating him and was all clear.

For the past 6 months I have had a burning/stinging sensation in the tip of my penis and foreskin. Let me first say that I highly doubt this is a STD because I have only been sexually active with my wife in the past 12 years (and we were both virgins when we met). About 6 months ago my wife and I had unprotected intercourse (she was 7 months pregnant at the time). A few days after, I noticed a couple of bumps under my foreskin; I scratched them. A couple days after that the same patch of skin turned red and began to burn and now I also had stinging in the tip of my penis. I went to my GP who told be to try Lotrimin, which I did for a couple weeks with no results. I went back and he prescribed me an oral anti-fungal which appeared to help things a little bit but ultimately the stinging came back. My GP thought that it may be nerve issues and prescribed me Gabapentin(sp?), which hasn’t helped either. Finally, I asked for a referral to a Urologist, who told me that he could see no cause for concern and basically told me to”wait it out”.  The weird thing about this is, to look at my penis, there is no appearance of any real issue (though the pain is always present) unless I were to touch the foreskin and irritate it a little. The hole of my penis looks slightly red and inflamed to me. Does anyone know what this could be? Pain in the penis tip and left side only? My follow up appointment isn’t until January and I can’t live with this for much longer. Thanks!"

While my penis is flaccid I'm able to fully retract the foreskin well past the head of my penis without pain or discomfort. However, when I'm erect and I try to retract my foreskin it only goes down to the corona of my penis head. If I try to pull it down any further, it begins to hurt and my frenulum appears strained. As a result my foreskin bunches up at the corona (under the head of my penis) and that's as far as it can go. Also, when I'm flaccid my foreskin is able to roll forward over the head normally, but when I stop retracting the foreskin to roll it forward while I'm erect it only goes back halfway up the penis head and stops rolling forward. The only way I'm able to fully roll forward the foreskin is to wait until it becomes flaccid again. My main concern is that it would not be optimal during sex. and it might break the frenulum or tear the foreskin whenver I try to participate in intercourse. Does anyone know if this is normal or not? If it isn't normal, could there be a way to fix my problem? Any help would be greatly appreciated."

Okay, here we go: Let me start off by saying that I was identified female at birth, and was born with unambiguous female genitalia. My development was pretty unremarkable. As a child, I was a tomboy, but I also enjoyed typically ""feminine"" things like dolls and makeup. At age 14, I began puberty. I got my period and it was so regular, you could set your watch by it. However, other female characteristics which come with puberty did not happen for me, one primary example being the lack of breast development.  Then, by age 17, everything began to change. My periods became excruciating and irregular. I began growing facial hair. I sang in my school's choir (glee club, basically) and when I started my senior year, I sang as an alto. Halfway through the year, my range had dropped to tenor. Basically, in a sense, I had both a female and a penis-less male puberty. As I grew older and older, my facial hair became more prominent, my voice dropped to a lower and lower register, and now, at age 35, my periods are non-existent. I was very loosely diagnosed with PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome). I say ""loosely"" because no general practitioner or gynecologist has ever been able to find any significant cystic formations on my ovaries.  One thing my spouse noticed once, early on in our relationship, when we were having sex, is that my clitoris is located far lower than it should be. It is located more where it would be if it were a penis as opposed to a clitoris. So, I know you're wondering what my question is. I've seen documentaries and read a great deal of information about the different ways intersexuality reveals itself. One of these I've heard about is what is known as being ""chromosomally intersex"", where the individual potentially has unambiguous genitals, but they are intersex at the chromosome level, presenting with say, XY chromosomes, even though they appear outwardly to be female, or XX chromosomes though they appear to be male, or even XXY, and countless other variations. My question is this: Is there any possible way that I could be intersex at the chromosome level, even though it may not have manifested itself in an explicitly physical manner, such as having unambiguous genitals or internal testes, etc? Also, how would I go about finding out if this is really what's going on? Because I feel so utterly like neither sex (male nor female), I identify as ""gender non-conforming"", but I can't shake the feeling deep down in my soul that there's more to my physical sex. Please, I ask only respect from those who respond to my question. I have been through a great deal in regards to my physical sex and gender identity, and there are other variables as well. I am a nearly life-long sexual abuse/assault survivor, and I struggle with PTSD, as well as DID (dissociative identity disorder) because of it. Even this might subconsciously play into my gender identity issues, but I don't know. All that being said, if you are respectful and show empathy towards me, I will most certainly offer you the same. Thank you for taking the time to read this wall of text, and thank you, in advance, to those who offer me advice, support, and guidance in this matter. PS: Attached are two photos of what I look like at this very moment, to show the amount of facial hair growth I'm talking about."

I am pretty sedentary and not used to physical exhertion. I had pain going down my left arm and chest area so that was the most concerning to me. When I got there they took blood ran EKG and checked my blood pressure a couple times. They told me my blood work, ekg and blood pressure were all great and sent me home saying I probably pulled something. I wound up going back 2 days later because I can’t seem to shake the irritation. It vanished from my arm area but remains in my chest. Sometimes I feel pain on the right side and sometimes to the left. My back also hurts. It also feels like a lump in my chest area when I swallow. As if I’m swallowing a large chunk of something . The second ER visit was the same but they added a chest x Ray to the mix. Once again they said my blood work, ekg, blood pressure and x Ray were all great. They sent me home and Now im here two days later still feeling gross in my chest area. Could this really just be a bad strain or muscle pull from lifting such heavy things as someone very sedentary?? Should I have asked for more thorough tests? Could it be arteries or something else they are missing?? Please help."

But now I got another one it’s been about 8 years since I had one show up. Its hard and won’t pop like a pimple. It’s basically in the same spots as the other one. Like 2 inches above my genitals.

They did an EKG, and said everything was fine and her heart looked good. I know she has a lung problem, thyroid problem and possibly a brain problem. I am positive because of handwriting analysis. I backed off for a while after her EKG was good because I was worrying her and my parents were both getting upset. She had mild and completely random - maybe once a week or once every two weeks - problems with her memory. She had random leg pain only in one leg and she didn’t know how to describe it. She had a minor and very little cough I think she has been hiding from me. In December, around Christmas, she was watching my baby and she said she reached for something behind the radio and pulled a muscle. I kept telling her to go make sure that was all it was and she just kept ignoring it. She had the pain to where at times I could tell it was bothering her and at times it hurt her to sit and feed my baby when she visited which really bugged me. This pain she had was in her upper left quadrant (near her ribs and she described it as basically from the front of the lower rib area to the back of the lower rib area). She never had it looked at! It hurt her for ATLEAST a month probably more like 2 months.  I have noticed her “tripping” or losing balance for the past 3-6 months but it is becoming more and more often. I said something to her almost every time I seen it happen and she brushes it off as if nothing happened. Well, it has got more and more frequent to the point I’m worried she will fall and really hurt herself or while holding my baby, fall and hurt my baby along with herself!! :(  Also, she told me just recently she has been having a lot more symptoms than I realized. I made her go to the ER last night with the following symptoms: -Coughed up blood clot 2 weeks ago -Fatigue -Anxiety and Stress (she attributes to being from her job and some of it probably is) -Feels like it’s hard to swallow -she is always clearing her throat -recently I see her grabbing her neck more and more (universal sign for choking) -lack of balance -dry cough -feels like she is congested -coughed up almost a 1 inch blood clot less than 2 weeks ago -Charlie horse pains often in her right foot and lower leg (sign of DVT) -she described to me she “felt like there was a blood clot in her neck”  -she physically looks drained -she seems to know something is wrong -she is forgetting things she never should forget (she bought my baby an elephant and it’s head and ears flap - she was SO happy to show my baby this toy and less than ONE or TWO months later, she asked me who got it for my daughter!! I almost cried because I know something is wrong. Her grandma had mini strokes often and her grandma and grandpa were both on blood thinners. Last night they gave her a contrast ct of her chest, blood work and d-dimer and told her she did not have a PE or lun cancer. They didn’t even check her right leg for a DVT!  She is also lightheaded and said she gets dizzy when she goes to lay straight back or when she touches or lays on a specific area on the back top of her head.  They didn’t even do an MRI!!!! They released her with a diagnosis of coughing up blood - they didn’t even do enough testing to find out wtf is going on!!!!! Please help. Before her contrast ct last night they gave her Ativan via her IV... she went to work after the hospital without sleeping even though she assured me she would sleep. Today, on the way home from work, she actually went off the road and could have Really got hurt. That was almost a full 10-12 HOURS after the Ativan. I realize lack of sleep could cause it but I know something is SERIOUSLY wrong. She has an apt. Monday at 8am. I am going to type a letter with all of her symptoms and demand they admit me her and find out what is causing all of these symptoms. I’m frustrated and disgusted with the care she is receiving. I also took her to the PCP on Monday last week who listened and said that it couldn’t be a PE because coughing blood isn’t a sign of a PE (MORON) and he ordered a CBC diff and lipid panel or whatever and a CT without contrast which he said needed a pre with from insurance."

They released her with a diagnosis of coughing up blood - they didn’t even do enough testing to find out wtf is going on!!!!! Please help. Before her contrast ct last night they gave her Ativan via her IV... she went to work after the hospital without sleeping even though she assured me she would sleep. Today, on the way home from work, she actually went off the road and could have Really got hurt. That was almost a full 10-12 HOURS after the Ativan. I realize lack of sleep could cause it but I know something is SERIOUSLY wrong. She has an apt. Monday at 8am. I am going to type a letter with all of her symptoms and demand they admit me her and find out what is causing all of these symptoms. I’m frustrated and disgusted with the care she is receiving. I also took her to the PCP on Monday last week who listened and said that it couldn’t be a PE because coughing blood isn’t a sign of a PE (MORON) and he ordered a CBC diff and lipid panel or whatever and a CT without contrast which he said needed a pre with from insurance."

I'm a female & 46 years old. On February 2 I went to the ER because I was losing vision in my right eye. I was terrified. They discovered that my blood pressure was 270/150. They treated me, got the bp down a little and sent me home (crazy!). I visited an eye doctor that day and he said that I had suffered an eye stroke in my right eye due to uncontrolled high blood pressure. Back story, I'd been diagnosed with high bp about eight years ago but quit taking my meds because I didn't like my doctor. I felt fine so I figured it was fine. Dumb! So anyhow, we're assuming my bp has been incredibly high all these years. So, fast forwarded back to February. The next morning my bp was rising again and I was concerned so we went back to the ER. They admitted me that time, thankfully, and I was there for about four days. My bp seemed to be getting under control with the medication they put me on and it was 158/99 when they released me. Still high but much better. I was placed on 2 bp meds - Carvedilol 25 MG twice a day & Amlodipine 10 MG once a day - and told to follow up with a hypertension specialist and my family doctor. I also purchased a bp monitor and began taking my bp various times throughout the day. After a few weeks it was obvious the medication was working for sure because I was averaging about 125/82, sometimes much lower too. Unfortunately, I was feeling rotten. I was sleeping 12 to 13 hours at night and still needed two or three naps throughout the day. When I was awake I felt like a complete zombie. Miserable.  I had an appointment with the specialist on February 27. He said that the reason I was feeling so awful was because my body was trying to adjust to my bp being so much lower after being so incredibly high for so many years. He decided to raise my bp up to about 140/90 in hopes that I'd feel better. In order to do that he cut my Carvedilol down to 12.5 MG twice a day but left the Amlodipine the same. He said if that didn't work we'd cut the Amlodipine down to 5 MG once a day too. Well, it worked.....kind of. My bp is still only averaging about 130/85, sometimes alittle higher or lower. But hardly ever even close to 140/90. I'm able to stay awake more but I still feel rotten. I'm tired and weak all the time. I have some dizziness and feel out of breath sometimes. Plus my brain just feels ""foggy"" all the time. I'm frustrated! I finally had an appointment with my family doctor on March 19 (she'd had an emergency and wasn't available for quite some time). She thinks I'm okay the way I am. She wants to keep the meds the same and thinks I need to start walking on the treadmill. I am overweight and know I need to lose weight but right now the idea of walking on a treadmill is crazy to me. I'm so tired all the time. I'm lucky to stay awake and carry on a conversation. I'm seriously considering cutting the Amlodipine down to 5 MG once a day to see if that will help. I""m thinking it'll get me closer to the 140/90 goal that my specialist wants. Plus I've read a lot that Amlodipine can be very sedating. I'll be monitoring my bp closely and if it rises too high I'll go back to taking the 10 MG.  I'm just curious if any of you have had this type of thing. Have any of you lost vision in one of your eyes due to high bp? My vision still hasn't come back, by the way. The doctors say it may but it may not, they don't really know. And, also, have any of you experienced a situation like mine where you had incredibly high bp for a long time & have now lowered it significantly? Did you feel rotten all the time? How long did it take for you body to adjust to the lower bp?"

Whenever I get turned on by a person or from watching a flick I have never gotten this big in size and whenever I masturbate it seems that the blood does not rush to my penis full the way it should so I use my brain to try and keep a firm erection but I always end up with a headache and limp penis.

I put on a pad and throughout the day I've been seeing a very small amount of blood on my pad, and very small amount of blood mixed with pee when i wipe. this could be my period blood, although i usually get excruciating pain when my period comes and this time i have very very little pain close to no pain at all. i'm not sure if the blood is coming from my peehole or is period blood. i've been very, very stressed this month, way more than usual, and i haven't been sexually active in months. please help me."

I had a complete cardiac work up. I went through a number of tilt tests. I was put on at least six different meds and given tilt tests to see if the meds were helping.  None of the meds helped, but many of them had harsh side effects. With Theophylline for example, my heart rate was running about 30 beats per minute faster than normal, I felt like I was burning up most of the time and I could only sleep about 2 hours a night. I lost ten pounds in a week. And I am in pretty good shape to begin with.  Fast forward to now and I had another syncopal episode.  Are there any newer treatments? Looking on the internet I see the same drugs mentioned that I was put on ten years ago with out good results. Then and now there is talk of using pacemakers, but not any enthusiasm.  I saw two electrophysiologists ten years ago. Talking with the better of the two as I now understand, the problem, at least in my case isn't the heart. It is the medulla, the primitive part of the brain that controls blood pressure, heart rate and the other autonomic nervous system functions.  In the end, the best advice I got was try and avoid triggers for syncopal episodes. I live a healthy life style. But there are triggers you can't avoid, now matter how much you try.  So what are the latest treatments? Anything new out there? By and large it appears that electrophysiologists treat syncope. But at least in my case it seems to be more of a problem with the medulla. Wouldn't a neurologist be a better choice?"

My husband has oral herpes with a cold sore appearing atleast once a year. However, we are always very careful to avoid oral and genital contact when these outbreaks occur. Two days ago, I noticed redness in the corner of my mouth. In previous years when cold weather set it, I have had issues with the corner of my mouth cracking. I thought it was probably that or a zit.  That same day in the bathroom, due to lack of hands, I briefly placed a clean tampon between my lips as I was finishing up. I don't remember if the end that was inserted internally touched the developing sore. But the tampon touched my lips and came into contact with my saliva. Yesterday, I woke up with a full blown cold sore and have been mentally beating myself up ever since. I was at what I believe was the prodrome stage of the cold sore when the potential contact happened. I had a few small raised red bumps and tingling. There were no blisters, pus, leaking liquids, etc. I can't believe that I may have infected myself with herpes due to something that I really gave no thought to and have done hundreds of times before.

My journey started in September 2011, but it seemed to be a one-time occurrence and I could directly relate my 'episode' to something stupid I did. One night I took my friend's hydrocodone pills (please don't judge). The next day I started feeling a weird hot feeling in my sternum (not like heartburn), then I immediately felt the urge to have a BM, went to bathroom and then started feeling dizzy, lightheaded, seeing stars. Sweating profusely, laid down on bathroom floor, then felt urge for BM again, then it just kind of happened back and forth until BM was complete - all while dry heaving too.  December 2011 - my cousin was in the hospital after a terrible car accident, he looked awful. I had to run out of the room then collapsed in the hall and had same episode as above. September/October 2012 - I was really sick, might have been the flu, took a medication prescribed to my dad to help with fever, body aches, chills. Next day I went to class, started feeling sick, so I got up to go the bathroom, I collapsed in the doorway. Started having an episode - actually threw up this time. Ambulance came, but since I was 17 and coherent I could not consent to them taking me to the ER. I do remember them saying my blood pressure was low. Went to PCP and she said the only way to tell what was going on was if I was in the middle of the episode and they took my vitals. Dec. 2013/Jan. 2014 - I was getting my 2nd colonoscopy done, so the day before I had to cleanse. I probably did not hydrate enough and I definitely was not eating. Morning of the colonoscopy I had an episode. December 2016 - One night went to dinner mixed different alcohols, did not eat much food. Went on to mix very strong alcohols. Woke up still drunk, went back to sleep, then woke up again and had an episode. February 2017 - Went out for bachelorette party, did not eat much dinner, mixed a lot of alcohol. Woke up drunk, then when that wore off I had an episode. September 2017 - It was a normal Friday, I ate dinner and was full. I had some wine 24 hours beforehand, but did not get drunk and had plenty of water and food between. I started feeling hot and sick around 3 AM, forced self to lay down - then was taken home by a friend (I was at a retreat). When I got home I had a BM and felt better. Next day I was at lunch and I was really nervous I would have another episode. Went to a store that was a little crowded, started feeling hot and sick. Stepped outside, felt a little better, then it started hitting me. Got to car and started having episode, was able to hold in BM. Got home had BM, laid down with cool rag because I was sweating so much, but cold at the same time then fell asleep. Next 2 days I was fine, that Tuesday I was in class and started feeling sick, so I stepped outside, but it didn’t help, so I went back to class grabbed my stuff and left to go home. I was lightheaded and nauseous on my way home (which I know wasn’t smart to drive), I was sweating a lot and laid down with a cool rag then fell asleep eventually. That Friday I went to PCP, she suggested I see a cardiologist for POTS. It was hard for me to go to the cardiologist because I was out of town at school.  I had anxiety in public places because I was always scared I was going to have an episode. November 2017 – I was driving from Lubbock to Dallas, I had eaten a grilled cheese and a few tater tots from Sonic. About an hour into the drive I started feeling dizzy, had the burning sensation in sternum, hot, shaky, felt I needed to have a BM. My friend came and picked me up and drove me home and we got my car later.  December 2017 – I was driving from Dallas to Lubbock, I had eaten a little bit of a sandwich, and had powerade. I started feeling the burning sensation in sternum, got dizzy, pulled over, I was hot, shaky, nauseous, and I actually had a BM – I was not anywhere near a gas station/restroom. Mom drove to pick me up, about an hour and a half out. The night before I had a glass of wine, but I ate dinner and did not feel tipsy or a buzz even. January 2018 – went snowboarding. Felt bad when I woke up, ate breakfast, had BM, felt ok, started driving and about 2 miles from the hotel had to turn around because I started feeling an episode. I had another BM, then rode up front the rest of the way and felt extremely nauseous the whole drive (50 minutes). While snowboarding, a little higher on the mountain (I went on the smallest ski lift), I started feeling hot, nauseous and felt a BM, I tried to breathe and cool down, then it went away.  There have been a few mornings where I wake up with a racing heart and feeling very hot, but I force myself to stay laying down even though I feel very nauseous or like I need to have a BM. Eventually the feeling of hot and racing heart will calm down after 30-45 minutes, then I get up and have a BM and feel better. I finally saw a cardiologist in February and told her all my symptoms, they did orthostatic vitals, and my blood pressure is lower than normal and gets lower upon standing. Her suspicions are POTS/orthostatic hypotension. I’m just not sure if I should be seeking another type of doctor to talk about other issues that could be causing low blood pressure and these symptoms or if I’m on the right track. I had an echo done, which was normal. I had bloodwork done to test for magnesium and a couple other things which was all normal. I got an ETT done and I don’t think the results are back for that yet. But after about 12 minutes on the treadmill I started feeling very dizzy and nauseous, they wanted to get me to the HR of 168, so I did, but my blood pressure never went over 104/60.  On my way home from the ETT I ran out of gas on the highway and had to wait for someone to come with a gas tank, so I’m not sure if it was an anxiety attack or what. But I had an episode in the car and had a BM, in the car, in the middle of the highway.  I feel nauseous many days when I wake up and my blood pressure will be on the lower side.  I try and consume more sodium and drink a lot more water. I have cut out soda. I take Lexapro and Welbutrin. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms or something similar? Does it seem like I’m on the right track? Side note: I also used to see a pediatric gastro from 16-19 due to stomach issues. I would have diarrhea more often than normal, have abdominal cramping, a lot of gas build up that would cause a lot of pain, etc. I’ve had 2 colonoscopies done, which came back normal. I’ve had a hytascan which came back normal. My GI suggested chronic appendicitis and had me see a general surgeon, but the surgeon wouldn’t perform the surgery without proof of appendicitis. Then I stopped seeing the GI because I am no longer a minor and I just haven’t sought out someone new. I also had a laparoscopic exploratory surgery in my uterus to check for endometriosis, which I do not have. But before the surgery I had an ultrasound and my dr told me that I definitely have some sort of colon issue because there was a lot of built up gas in my stomach and it was hurting to press down on my stomach."

Felt bad when I woke up, ate breakfast, had BM, felt ok, started driving and about 2 miles from the hotel had to turn around because I started feeling an episode. I had another BM, then rode up front the rest of the way and felt extremely nauseous the whole drive (50 minutes). While snowboarding, a little higher on the mountain (I went on the smallest ski lift), I started feeling hot, nauseous and felt a BM, I tried to breathe and cool down, then it went away.  There have been a few mornings where I wake up with a racing heart and feeling very hot, but I force myself to stay laying down even though I feel very nauseous or like I need to have a BM. Eventually the feeling of hot and racing heart will calm down after 30-45 minutes, then I get up and have a BM and feel better. I finally saw a cardiologist in February and told her all my symptoms, they did orthostatic vitals, and my blood pressure is lower than normal and gets lower upon standing. Her suspicions are POTS/orthostatic hypotension. I’m just not sure if I should be seeking another type of doctor to talk about other issues that could be causing low blood pressure and these symptoms or if I’m on the right track. I had an echo done, which was normal. I had bloodwork done to test for magnesium and a couple other things which was all normal. I got an ETT done and I don’t think the results are back for that yet. But after about 12 minutes on the treadmill I started feeling very dizzy and nauseous, they wanted to get me to the HR of 168, so I did, but my blood pressure never went over 104/60.  On my way home from the ETT I ran out of gas on the highway and had to wait for someone to come with a gas tank, so I’m not sure if it was an anxiety attack or what. But I had an episode in the car and had a BM, in the car, in the middle of the highway.  I feel nauseous many days when I wake up and my blood pressure will be on the lower side.  I try and consume more sodium and drink a lot more water. I have cut out soda. I take Lexapro and Welbutrin. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms or something similar? Does it seem like I’m on the right track? Side note: I also used to see a pediatric gastro from 16-19 due to stomach issues. I would have diarrhea more often than normal, have abdominal cramping, a lot of gas build up that would cause a lot of pain, etc. I’ve had 2 colonoscopies done, which came back normal. I’ve had a hytascan which came back normal. My GI suggested chronic appendicitis and had me see a general surgeon, but the surgeon wouldn’t perform the surgery without proof of appendicitis. Then I stopped seeing the GI because I am no longer a minor and I just haven’t sought out someone new. I also had a laparoscopic exploratory surgery in my uterus to check for endometriosis, which I do not have. But before the surgery I had an ultrasound and my dr told me that I definitely have some sort of colon issue because there was a lot of built up gas in my stomach and it was hurting to press down on my stomach."

My journey started in September 2011, but it seemed to be a one-time occurrence and I could directly relate my 'episode' to something stupid I did. One night I took my friend's hydrocodone pills (please don't judge). The next day I started feeling a weird hot feeling in my sternum (not like heartburn), then I immediately felt the urge to have a BM, went to bathroom and then started feeling dizzy, lightheaded, seeing stars. Sweating profusely, laid down on bathroom floor, then felt urge for BM again, then it just kind of happened back and forth until BM was complete - all while dry heaving too.  December 2011 - my cousin was in the hospital after a terrible car accident, he looked awful. I had to run out of the room then collapsed in the hall and had same episode as above. September/October 2012 - I was really sick, might have been the flu, took a medication prescribed to my dad to help with fever, body aches, chills. Next day I went to class, started feeling sick, so I got up to go the bathroom, I collapsed in the doorway. Started having an episode - actually threw up this time. Ambulance came, but since I was 17 and coherent I could not consent to them taking me to the ER. I do remember them saying my blood pressure was low. Went to PCP and she said the only way to tell what was going on was if I was in the middle of the episode and they took my vitals. Dec. 2013/Jan. 2014 - I was getting my 2nd colonoscopy done, so the day before I had to cleanse. I probably did not hydrate enough and I definitely was not eating. Morning of the colonoscopy I had an episode. December 2016 - One night went to dinner mixed different alcohols, did not eat much food. Went on to mix very strong alcohols. Woke up still drunk, went back to sleep, then woke up again and had an episode. February 2017 - Went out for bachelorette party, did not eat much dinner, mixed a lot of alcohol. Woke up drunk, then when that wore off I had an episode. September 2017 - It was a normal Friday, I ate dinner and was full. I had some wine 24 hours beforehand, but did not get drunk and had plenty of water and food between. I started feeling hot and sick around 3 AM, forced self to lay down - then was taken home by a friend (I was at a retreat). When I got home I had a BM and felt better. Next day I was at lunch and I was really nervous I would have another episode. Went to a store that was a little crowded, started feeling hot and sick. Stepped outside, felt a little better, then it started hitting me. Got to car and started having episode, was able to hold in BM. Got home had BM, laid down with cool rag because I was sweating so much, but cold at the same time then fell asleep. Next 2 days I was fine, that Tuesday I was in class and started feeling sick, so I stepped outside, but it didn’t help, so I went back to class grabbed my stuff and left to go home. I was lightheaded and nauseous on my way home (which I know wasn’t smart to drive), I was sweating a lot and laid down with a cool rag then fell asleep eventually. That Friday I went to PCP, she suggested I see a cardiologist for POTS. It was hard for me to go to the cardiologist because I was out of town at school.  I had anxiety in public places because I was always scared I was going to have an episode. November 2017 – I was driving from Lubbock to Dallas, I had eaten a grilled cheese and a few tater tots from Sonic.

I was lightheaded and nauseous on my way home (which I know wasn’t smart to drive), I was sweating a lot and laid down with a cool rag then fell asleep eventually. That Friday I went to PCP, she suggested I see a cardiologist for POTS. It was hard for me to go to the cardiologist because I was out of town at school.  I had anxiety in public places because I was always scared I was going to have an episode. November 2017 – I was driving from Lubbock to Dallas, I had eaten a grilled cheese and a few tater tots from Sonic. About an hour into the drive I started feeling dizzy, had the burning sensation in sternum, hot, shaky, felt I needed to have a BM. My friend came and picked me up and drove me home and we got my car later.  December 2017 – I was driving from Dallas to Lubbock, I had eaten a little bit of a sandwich, and had powerade. I started feeling the burning sensation in sternum, got dizzy, pulled over, I was hot, shaky, nauseous, and I actually had a BM – I was not anywhere near a gas station/restroom. Mom drove to pick me up, about an hour and a half out. The night before I had a glass of wine, but I ate dinner and did not feel tipsy or a buzz even. January 2018 – went snowboarding. Felt bad when I woke up, ate breakfast, had BM, felt ok, started driving and about 2 miles from the hotel had to turn around because I started feeling an episode. I had another BM, then rode up front the rest of the way and felt extremely nauseous the whole drive (50 minutes). While snowboarding, a little higher on the mountain (I went on the smallest ski lift), I started feeling hot, nauseous and felt a BM, I tried to breathe and cool down, then it went away.  There have been a few mornings where I wake up with a racing heart and feeling very hot, but I force myself to stay laying down even though I feel very nauseous or like I need to have a BM. Eventually the feeling of hot and racing heart will calm down after 30-45 minutes, then I get up and have a BM and feel better. I finally saw a cardiologist in February and told her all my symptoms, they did orthostatic vitals, and my blood pressure is lower than normal and gets lower upon standing. Her suspicions are POTS/orthostatic hypotension. I’m just not sure if I should be seeking another type of doctor to talk about other issues that could be causing low blood pressure and these symptoms or if I’m on the right track. I had an echo done, which was normal. I had bloodwork done to test for magnesium and a couple other things which was all normal. I got an ETT done and I don’t think the results are back for that yet. But after about 12 minutes on the treadmill I started feeling very dizzy and nauseous, they wanted to get me to the HR of 168, so I did, but my blood pressure never went over 104/60.  On my way home from the ETT I ran out of gas on the highway and had to wait for someone to come with a gas tank, so I’m not sure if it was an anxiety attack or what. But I had an episode in the car and had a BM, in the car, in the middle of the highway.  I feel nauseous many days when I wake up and my blood pressure will be on the lower side.  I try and consume more sodium and drink a lot more water. I have cut out soda. I take Lexapro and Welbutrin. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms or something similar? Does it seem like I’m on the right track? Side note: I also used to see a pediatric gastro from 16-19 due to stomach issues. I would have diarrhea more often than normal, have abdominal cramping, a lot of gas build up that would cause a lot of pain, etc. I’ve had 2 colonoscopies done, which came back normal. I’ve had a hytascan which came back normal. My GI suggested chronic appendicitis and had me see a general surgeon, but the surgeon wouldn’t perform the surgery without proof of appendicitis. Then I stopped seeing the GI because I am no longer a minor and I just haven’t sought out someone new. I also had a laparoscopic exploratory surgery in my uterus to check for endometriosis, which I do not have. But before the surgery I had an ultrasound and my dr told me that I definitely have some sort of colon issue because there was a lot of built up gas in my stomach and it was hurting to press down on my stomach."

One night I took my friend's hydrocodone pills (please don't judge). The next day I started feeling a weird hot feeling in my sternum (not like heartburn), then I immediately felt the urge to have a BM, went to bathroom and then started feeling dizzy, lightheaded, seeing stars. Sweating profusely, laid down on bathroom floor, then felt urge for BM again, then it just kind of happened back and forth until BM was complete - all while dry heaving too.  December 2011 - my cousin was in the hospital after a terrible car accident, he looked awful. I had to run out of the room then collapsed in the hall and had same episode as above. September/October 2012 - I was really sick, might have been the flu, took a medication prescribed to my dad to help with fever, body aches, chills. Next day I went to class, started feeling sick, so I got up to go the bathroom, I collapsed in the doorway. Started having an episode - actually threw up this time.

Went to PCP and she said the only way to tell what was going on was if I was in the middle of the episode and they took my vitals. Dec. 2013/Jan. 2014 - I was getting my 2nd colonoscopy done, so the day before I had to cleanse. I probably did not hydrate enough and I definitely was not eating. Morning of the colonoscopy I had an episode. December 2016 - One night went to dinner mixed different alcohols, did not eat much food. Went on to mix very strong alcohols. Woke up still drunk, went back to sleep, then woke up again and had an episode. February 2017 - Went out for bachelorette party, did not eat much dinner, mixed a lot of alcohol. Woke up drunk, then when that wore off I had an episode. September 2017 - It was a normal Friday, I ate dinner and was full. I had some wine 24 hours beforehand, but did not get drunk and had plenty of water and food between. I started feeling hot and sick around 3 AM, forced self to lay down - then was taken home by a friend (I was at a retreat). When I got home I had a BM and felt better. Next day I was at lunch and I was really nervous I would have another episode. Went to a store that was a little crowded, started feeling hot and sick.

I don’t smoke and rarely drink alcohol. Not taking meds Ongoing issue ~6 months  I’ve had recurring chest discomfort over the last 6+ months that comes and goes. The pain is not severe and does not interfere with my day to day life. I originally went to a doc in a box who suspected GERD and gave me Ranitidine. It didn’t really seem to help anything. He did comment that my lungs and heart sounded fine with no abnormalities. I don’t exercise much but it does not seem to affect my level of discomfort. I have noticed movements like sit-ups trigger the pain. The pain is centered left of my sternum and is a dull ache to sharp pain, I have recently noticed that pressing on my sternum in a specific spot causes a similar sensation.  I also have the sensation of needing to frequently take deep breaths even when laying down. I do not know if this is related or just something like anxiety that I’m sure I have. It feels a bit like I have to manually breathe which forces me to think about every breath which is maybe where that is coming from.  Any ideas about what this might be?"

I treat with a pessary and external cream everytime as I have had it approx 5 times. The dr's always think I have an STD which I have already taken a test for and came back negative for everything and haven't had sex since. I have a feeling that I have over treated myself because after treating myself the most recent time the symptoms of thrush are still there although I was unsure if I had it or not. I did a canesten test and it was yellow meaning thrush or clear but at the time I thought to treat myself because I was suffering from symptoms which to this day I still am. I do not itch or burn I have watery and yellowish thick discharge with a fishy odour. I know I've knocked my PH out but I don't know what to do from here?? I am unable to go to the doctors as there are no appointments

I had unprotected oral sex with a new partner (partner 1) on 10th June, had no symptoms of any infection.  I had unprotected oral sex and inserted the penis into vagina of another new partner (partner 2) on 17th June, few days later I developed flu like symptoms, fever, sore throat with swollen glands to the point I was struggling to swallow, this subsided but didn't finally go for a few weeks, I did visit the doctors the week after and he said there was a lot of mucus on the throat but said to see how it goes.  Then on the 30th June I had protected sex with partner 1, at the time she had a cold sore so we only had sex and no oral or kissing, however we touched hands etc. A couple of days after this encounter I developed an itch in the anus and pubic hair, the anus got quite red and was sore when wiping but I thought this was just down to poor hygiene as I've had similar before, without the pubic itching, I did look and there were no obvious signs of blisters.  The sore anus has passed but the itchiness of the pubic area and anus, sometimes small burning sensation is still present which is now over 8 weeks. The itching comes and goes and isn't constant, there are no obvious blisters, or rash.

The last few months I've started having chest pains especially when I have anxiety attacks. I bought a blood pressure and pulse reader so I could keep an eye on it. I've been checking it every few hours while awake. During the day my blood pressure stays extremely low averaging around 88/55. I've been told by doctors before that I have low blood pressure so this doesn't surprise me. My pulse averages around 85 while at rest with occasional spikes that go closer to 100. After 7 pm my blood pressure starts rising up to what most would consider a normal rate around 110/68 but my pulse drops to around 55. Some nights if I stay up late my heart rate will occasionally start racing for no apparent reason and get as high as 115 but my blood pressure doesn't change when this happens. It takes about 20 minutes for my pulse to drop back to a normal level. I know some ups and downs throughout the day are normal but I'm afraid this is too much. I'm sure my anxiety plays a small part because last week during a major attack my pulse topped out at 124. I've tried researching this but everything I find talks about high blood pressure. Could use some advice. Should I be worried?

It primarily only occurs when in contact with things other than penetrative sex (hands/cloth/pants...). I don't think I have any other symptoms of balanitis, and it doesn't really get worse or better over time. But it does sometimes become an issue during sex, and makes it difficult to clean. I am really only comfortably able to run water over it, and even heavy water pressure can be painful (I often use the foreskin as a barrier between my hands and the tip to clean). My question is whether there is anything I can do to alleviate this pain and slowly adjust to not having discomfort to the touch."

When I do get cold sores, they tend to be on the lip, painful and do blister, scab, and weep.  Is this bump something else or is it a cold sore? Has anyone else ever had this?"

Just recently I've noticed 2 skins tags ( next to each other) on my anus, and as i proceeded to inspect more i noticed that i had a third one inside my anus. I've done some research and where i found out that the causes might be fissure from anal intercourse ( which i think is the most likely cause) or diarrhea ( which i have experienced recently). Is it safe for me to use home remedies suggested online ? (even for the one inside my anus?) and if so which one do you think i should use ? Please note that i live in a non-gay-friendly country, so i prefer not visiting a doctor and if it's necessary would it be believable or okay for me to lie and say that i think its the result of a diarrhea or do tags inside the anus only occur as a result of anal intercourse..? or i could just visit and tell them i have noticed them just recently as they might of appeared a long time ago and the cause remains unknown. I really really don't want to visit a doctor i hope you understand my situation.  (excuse my paranoia it's hard for me to be gay in my country).  Thank you."

Otherwise, allow others to answer","Before addressing my actual question, let me preface it with the following: I am fairly new, but highly competent, practicing ER veterinarian. I know how drugs work, what I should and shouldn't mix together, and typically try to make my best decisions when there are grey areas based on the clinical picture before me. While I feel that I do this well to dogs, cats, horses, and other non-humans species, I am not able to proficiently self-assess or provide anything but very cursory examination of a living human being. I have no illusions that because of my profession as a vet, it makes me remotely qualified to assess humans from a diagnostic standpoint, as I hope you have none that you would make a competent veterinary diagnostician without the training / background first. I just would like you to know that when you address my concerns, you can talk to me like a medical professional instead of the average layperson. I think the below entry will illustrate this to you quite effectively versus me just saying it is so. Unfortunately, with all that knowledge I have, it is my own irresponsible and potentially self-injurious behavior, that brings us to this point. And now I can start talking... First just some biographic info: 31 year old, adult male in average - below average physical condition. I currently weigh about 175 lbs and am six feet tall. I take three daily medications, 450mg Buproprion XL once daily, 600mg Gabapentin twice daily, and 5.7mg Zubsolv once a day.(more common formulation wound be Suboxone, or generic buprenorphine / nalaxone). I have been on all these drugs for about the same amount of time, approximately 7-8 years. The doses have not been changed in any way for any of them in recent years, the last being a reduction of my zubsolv 2 years ago by half. I am a semi-habitual drug user for the last 4-6 months, without any particular drug of choice at the moment. I don't discriminate other than I don't touch opiates any more - haven't once since being on the maintenance medications. I will even refuse them, and have, in the face of severe, refractory pain. I have not drunk any alcohol either for the same length of time as my abstinence from opiate drugs and pharmaceuticals. I do not wish to be moralized about drug use, and how it could be my license if I am caught, or that I could face legal / severe / other health issues, or any of the other stuff that I already know but ignore. If you can handle this, and think you know stuff about drug interaction and pharmacology, please read on and try to help me out as best you can. I already know the general answer to my ultimate question and what the safest thing to do is. However, sometimes the mind and body are telling each other something entirely different - this is one of those scenarios. Drug 11 (I will refer to it at this as the bag it came in had the number 11 on it, and only the number 11) produced dose-dependent, repeatable/reproducible increases in euphoria, awareness, concentration, and a perceived increase in general mental acuity. I have utilized amphetamine and methamphetamine in past on numerous occasions, as well as several of their analogues. The intensity of these effects produced by 11, lay somewhere right between the aforesaid drugs. Given the extraordinary noradrenergic and dopaminergic effects and their affinity for the respected receptors, and ability to cause their massive release, I believe this drug to be a probable analogue of methamphetamine. I know MDMA / MDA and other drugs like this have extraordinary similarity from a structural standpoint (as in they are both also analogues of the amphetamines), but I believe that because 11 lacks the psychedelic effects produced by and intended to occur with a good, average dose of MDMA, we are dealing with something much closer structurally to regular amphetamine or, more likely, methamphetamine. So, basically lacking an attached ring structure on the molecule. I feel that we are dealing with a drug that has a very strong affinity for noradrenergic and dopaminergic receptor binding, is causing release of their associated neurotransmitters by one of many different possible MoA, is inhibiting their re-uptake (also, take your pick as to the exact science, obviously we aren't going to know that here, sorry) or some combination thereof. I feel that the physical effects that 11 has had on me are nearly identical to a very large dose of amphetamine. This is why I leave out serotonin as a key player in 11. I know it has its role and function in the way amphetamine makes you feel while you are and aren't on it, but overall, the other two NTs are far more important in controlling MoA and drug behavior. I have yet to experience any significant down from the drug, which when I inevitably go through this, will provide me with some more potential insight into pharmacodynamic action. Potentially, this will even provide me with some (limited) insight into the pharmacokinetics, to the extent of onset and duration of action, methods of metabolism / excretion, and bioavailabilty through different RoA should I choose to utilize again.  Moving onto my actual concern, despite the fact that I am a vet, I am also a recreational drug user. I often venture into drugs of unknown chemical structure (aka research chemicals, unapproved for or untested for use in human use) that have had absolutely no testing performed in any official capacity by any official organization or respectable institution. My concern is how this one chemical, that very well fits the above description, has been having some mild to moderate cardiovascular side effects. I appear to have started experiencing dose-dependent sinus tachycardia, starting at 125 and reaching as high as about 150 BPM at what I imagine was the drugs peak plasma concentration. During my first course of ""experimentation"" I administered what have, if my drug concentration was what I had even come close to achieving (25-50mg / 1mL solution) was a total dose ranging in the 50-100mg over the course of about four to five hours. The total volume of fluid administered was approximately 1.8-2.0 mL through a series of five deltoid injections, spread apart both sides of my shoulders. This was for both practical and clinical purposes, as it is my understanding that exceeding 1.0 mL in a small muscle like the deltoids can effect the muscle, as well as slow / halt the absorption of whatever the substance delivered. I also know nothing about this drugs ability to cause abscess, the result of intramuscular extravasation to the subcutaneous tissue, or any possibility of tissue necrosis. Really, just picture picking up a random white powder sent to you in the mail from someone in China, diluting it in sterile water, and seeing what happens. In an attempt to have some semblance of harm reduction practice, I start with what I hope to me considered a low-dose, and titrate upward as needed, or downward when learning the hard way. I have noted four separate, but repeatably and reliably dose-dependent (in three of them) adverse effects of 11 that support my above conclusions about how the drug works. They include dry mouth, mild to moderate nausea (no resulting vomiting or causative reasons such as vertigo or vestibular disease), sinus tachycardia, and very mild perspiration (which I believe may have been an effect of coming off the drug, that I experienced for a couple of hours before making the decision to re-administer 10 mg additional IM in a new solution made at a lower (probably about 18 - 22 mg / 1 ml solution) concentration by about 15-25% . Of all the side effects the cardiac ones were most concerning, particularly as they got more pronounced with repeated, and more frequent administration. I believe that the tachycardia was likely at its highest when the drug was at its highest point of concentration in the plasma. Without know the drug's half life and a ton of other information, were not going to know what that plasma level was, and what other cardiotoxic effects this drug could cause at even higher levels. Once again, I know this is stupid, but it's what I have been doing for a long while, and I won't be stopping unless forced to by some circumstances, physical or otherwise.  Anyway, if we are operating under the assumption that this drug is moderately to markedly dopaminergic, it has the ability to cause vasodilation. I know in vet med, we use dopamine at low doses CRI (range of 1-5ug/kg/min) in order to produce cardiac positive inotropic results. It is extremely effective in doing so. While I realize that dopamine can also produce the opposite, and generally not as useful effects, at (much) higher doses, a drug such as pure crystal meth isn't even known to cause dopaminnergic bradycardia until you are in danger of overdosing. In fact, I believe that the bradycardia is the most sign and reason for fatalities associated with that drug - along with the other cardiotoxic effects it has over the long-term. While the nausea and dry-mouth I mentioned previously are typically side effects more closely-associated with serotoninergic drugs, I believe that the effects were mild and controllable because of the limited effect this neurotransmitter has on 11. I wish I had an MSDS for you, I really do, or some experimental data on a group of lab rats, but I simply don't. Just working off my own experiences with known similar drugs and a solid scientific background to try and make a decision about mixing this with another drug, one that has known vasodilatory effects. In all honestly, I would have chosen pharmacology instead of heart health had the choice been available to me on this site. However, I feel that a physician who sees lots of patients with heart problems on multiple drugs or better yet, a practicing cardiologist, would be able to give me their best guess working with the little concrete information available.  Also before I completely forget to mention, there was one other cardiac abnormality. I auscultated a grade 2/6 (that's how we grade them in vet med, don't know if its the same for human cardiology, but the number in ours just an indicator of volume; 1 is pretty much inaudible and 6 is you hear it without putting the scope on the chest, as well as having a thrill)holosystolic murmur with a PMI at the most anteromedial aspect of right second intercostal space. Knowing very little about human cardiac anatomy or physiology, I had to google where to listen on the chest to hear and assess valvular health and detect / not detect sounds. Once I had the diagram, I have a very serviceable, new and recently serviced, Littman Cardiology IV that I use daily for my own job. I feel that I am well above average in detecting low - grade, often previously unnoted murmursin dogs and cats. But I have no proficiency or point to which I can compare my ability in people to hear the same. All I can tell you is that I believe, based on point of location and time in the cardiac cycle, the murmur PMI, if truly present and not a drug induced imagination, was most likely associated with the opening of the right AV valve. Once again, having limited knowledge of human medicine, I had to look up some possible differentials for newly discovered murmurs associated with this valve. I came up with very little, finding it to be the most uncommon valve to produce murmurs, or flow issues, in adults.  I have a host of wild theories and possible causes for this murmur, but the most simple thing is usually the answer in my experience. In this case, I have to imagine it was induced by the drug by one of several different mechanisms, since I was not longer able to hear it approximately three hours after I had last used drug 11. When I was still able to hear it, the other more euphoric effects were also still largely present, and seem to come down at similar rate at which they rose. The murmur was also slightly louder with a PMI spanning further right laterally on deep inspiration. No difference could be appreciated on expiration. The tachycardia was also gone (92 BPM) by three hours after the last administration of the initial solution I made up.  I know this has been very long, and probably going in circles for a bit now - all a result of 11, which I am sure as a physician you likely deduced long ago. But here's my sum-up and question, and my reason for wanting to do so: I would like to experience some sexual arousal and see if this drug has the potential to enhance sexual experience. Failure to achieve an erection despite visual and tactile stimulation by myself and/or my girlfriend was the ultimate result. Drug 11 caused sexual excitement and desire, which obviously sucked big time in the face of temporary ED. In truth, we didn't try for too long because I knew after a couple of minutes that it simply wasn't going to happen. In addition to it feeling somewhat physiologically impossible at the time, I think I was more interested in documenting the reasons for it in my experience report. I realize that sexual side effects are usually associated with drugs effecting serotonin release, making all those anti-depressant drugs all so popular. I am theorizing that their could be low level serotonergic reuptake inhibition associated with 11, just enough to cause the unpleasant sexual side effects. So here it comes...as a result of the ED, I have been toying with taking a low oral dose of sildenafil in order to try and retake control of my ability to become aroused. I have the generic tablets in the house for treatment of pulmonary hypertension in dogs. I don't know if this will help me reach orgasm (I might find that's an entirely separate problem), but I would like to at least be able to try and say I failed. I also felt that I needed to take into effect that sildenafil having its own noradrenergic effects might have the possibility to potentiate or synergize any activity being caused by the drug 11. I read in a research paper that PDE5 inhibitors have an effect on noradrenergic nerve fibers, though the MoA was getting to be a little technical for me, even on a good day. I wasn't really sure if the MoA affecting noradrenaline release in a PDE5 I would have any effect on any drugs that are presumably noradrenergic in their effect on the brain. From what I could make of the MoA, it sounded like the noradrenergic nerve fibers of the penis were the only thing it was really directly affection. Since you are a physician reading this and can't possibly advise me to take a drug that has a tachycardic (without knowing more about why it is occurring to a certain degree of assurance), I already know you are going to recommend not to take the Sildenafil, or anything like it given my cardiovascular response. I guess what I am more interested in hearing from you is, if I plan to ignore your advise on using it in conjunction with 11, what are my chances for a reaction that is going to result in a clinically (and therefore, potentially dangerous, and cardiotoxic interaction) significant tachycardia? Given that there have been no auscultated arrhythmias, is their still a potential for the two drugs together, if working by certain MoAs, will result in one that just required some additional synergy to jumpstart things? Without knowing the MoA, in general, how common are tachyarrhythmias seen with adverse drug interactions? What type would you expect if my suspicions are close to correct about the pharmacodynamics of this structure?  I don't need exact science here or true stats since I haven't provided you with experimental data or chemical information with which you would need to form such an answer. All in all, my main and most important question is, how good of a chance of there being any sort of clinically negative side effect if I stick with a dose of Sildenafil, 20 mg or less? I definitely have not even been considering taking a large, Viagra-sized dose. I have taken 20-30mg previously alone when I had to wear a condom while having sex, causing me to have weak, or nonexistent function. It worked extremely quickly and effectively at that time.  I am going to stop talking now, if you got all the down here and read everything all the way through, I am proud of you. I know I will get an from someone that truly cares, then."

I appear to have started experiencing dose-dependent sinus tachycardia, starting at 125 and reaching as high as about 150 BPM at what I imagine was the drugs peak plasma concentration. During my first course of ""experimentation"" I administered what have, if my drug concentration was what I had even come close to achieving (25-50mg / 1mL solution) was a total dose ranging in the 50-100mg over the course of about four to five hours. The total volume of fluid administered was approximately 1.8-2.0 mL through a series of five deltoid injections, spread apart both sides of my shoulders. This was for both practical and clinical purposes, as it is my understanding that exceeding 1.0 mL in a small muscle like the deltoids can effect the muscle, as well as slow / halt the absorption of whatever the substance delivered. I also know nothing about this drugs ability to cause abscess, the result of intramuscular extravasation to the subcutaneous tissue, or any possibility of tissue necrosis. Really, just picture picking up a random white powder sent to you in the mail from someone in China, diluting it in sterile water, and seeing what happens. In an attempt to have some semblance of harm reduction practice, I start with what I hope to me considered a low-dose, and titrate upward as needed, or downward when learning the hard way. I have noted four separate, but repeatably and reliably dose-dependent (in three of them) adverse effects of 11 that support my above conclusions about how the drug works. They include dry mouth, mild to moderate nausea (no resulting vomiting or causative reasons such as vertigo or vestibular disease), sinus tachycardia, and very mild perspiration (which I believe may have been an effect of coming off the drug, that I experienced for a couple of hours before making the decision to re-administer 10 mg additional IM in a new solution made at a lower (probably about 18 - 22 mg / 1 ml solution) concentration by about 15-25% . Of all the side effects the cardiac ones were most concerning, particularly as they got more pronounced with repeated, and more frequent administration. I believe that the tachycardia was likely at its highest when the drug was at its highest point of concentration in the plasma. Without know the drug's half life and a ton of other information, were not going to know what that plasma level was, and what other cardiotoxic effects this drug could cause at even higher levels. Once again, I know this is stupid, but it's what I have been doing for a long while, and I won't be stopping unless forced to by some circumstances, physical or otherwise.  Anyway, if we are operating under the assumption that this drug is moderately to markedly dopaminergic, it has the ability to cause vasodilation. I know in vet med, we use dopamine at low doses CRI (range of 1-5ug/kg/min) in order to produce cardiac positive inotropic results. It is extremely effective in doing so. While I realize that dopamine can also produce the opposite, and generally not as useful effects, at (much) higher doses, a drug such as pure crystal meth isn't even known to cause dopaminnergic bradycardia until you are in danger of overdosing. In fact, I believe that the bradycardia is the most sign and reason for fatalities associated with that drug - along with the other cardiotoxic effects it has over the long-term. While the nausea and dry-mouth I mentioned previously are typically side effects more closely-associated with serotoninergic drugs, I believe that the effects were mild and controllable because of the limited effect this neurotransmitter has on 11. I wish I had an MSDS for you, I really do, or some experimental data on a group of lab rats, but I simply don't. Just working off my own experiences with known similar drugs and a solid scientific background to try and make a decision about mixing this with another drug, one that has known vasodilatory effects. In all honestly, I would have chosen pharmacology instead of heart health had the choice been available to me on this site. However, I feel that a physician who sees lots of patients with heart problems on multiple drugs or better yet, a practicing cardiologist, would be able to give me their best guess working with the little concrete information available.  Also before I completely forget to mention, there was one other cardiac abnormality. I auscultated a grade 2/6 (that's how we grade them in vet med, don't know if its the same for human cardiology, but the number in ours just an indicator of volume; 1 is pretty much inaudible and 6 is you hear it without putting the scope on the chest, as well as having a thrill)holosystolic murmur with a PMI at the most anteromedial aspect of right second intercostal space. Knowing very little about human cardiac anatomy or physiology, I had to google where to listen on the chest to hear and assess valvular health and detect / not detect sounds. Once I had the diagram, I have a very serviceable, new and recently serviced, Littman Cardiology IV that I use daily for my own job. I feel that I am well above average in detecting low - grade, often previously unnoted murmursin dogs and cats. But I have no proficiency or point to which I can compare my ability in people to hear the same. All I can tell you is that I believe, based on point of location and time in the cardiac cycle, the murmur PMI, if truly present and not a drug induced imagination, was most likely associated with the opening of the right AV valve. Once again, having limited knowledge of human medicine, I had to look up some possible differentials for newly discovered murmurs associated with this valve. I came up with very little, finding it to be the most uncommon valve to produce murmurs, or flow issues, in adults.  I have a host of wild theories and possible causes for this murmur, but the most simple thing is usually the answer in my experience. In this case, I have to imagine it was induced by the drug by one of several different mechanisms, since I was not longer able to hear it approximately three hours after I had last used drug 11. When I was still able to hear it, the other more euphoric effects were also still largely present, and seem to come down at similar rate at which they rose. The murmur was also slightly louder with a PMI spanning further right laterally on deep inspiration. No difference could be appreciated on expiration. The tachycardia was also gone (92 BPM) by three hours after the last administration of the initial solution I made up.  I know this has been very long, and probably going in circles for a bit now - all a result of 11, which I am sure as a physician you likely deduced long ago. But here's my sum-up and question, and my reason for wanting to do so: I would like to experience some sexual arousal and see if this drug has the potential to enhance sexual experience. Failure to achieve an erection despite visual and tactile stimulation by myself and/or my girlfriend was the ultimate result. Drug 11 caused sexual excitement and desire, which obviously sucked big time in the face of temporary ED. In truth, we didn't try for too long because I knew after a couple of minutes that it simply wasn't going to happen. In addition to it feeling somewhat physiologically impossible at the time, I think I was more interested in documenting the reasons for it in my experience report. I realize that sexual side effects are usually associated with drugs effecting serotonin release, making all those anti-depressant drugs all so popular. I am theorizing that their could be low level serotonergic reuptake inhibition associated with 11, just enough to cause the unpleasant sexual side effects. So here it comes...as a result of the ED, I have been toying with taking a low oral dose of sildenafil in order to try and retake control of my ability to become aroused. I have the generic tablets in the house for treatment of pulmonary hypertension in dogs. I don't know if this will help me reach orgasm (I might find that's an entirely separate problem), but I would like to at least be able to try and say I failed. I also felt that I needed to take into effect that sildenafil having its own noradrenergic effects might have the possibility to potentiate or synergize any activity being caused by the drug 11. I read in a research paper that PDE5 inhibitors have an effect on noradrenergic nerve fibers, though the MoA was getting to be a little technical for me, even on a good day. I wasn't really sure if the MoA affecting noradrenaline release in a PDE5 I would have any effect on any drugs that are presumably noradrenergic in their effect on the brain. From what I could make of the MoA, it sounded like the noradrenergic nerve fibers of the penis were the only thing it was really directly affection. Since you are a physician reading this and can't possibly advise me to take a drug that has a tachycardic (without knowing more about why it is occurring to a certain degree of assurance), I already know you are going to recommend not to take the Sildenafil, or anything like it given my cardiovascular response. I guess what I am more interested in hearing from you is, if I plan to ignore your advise on using it in conjunction with 11, what are my chances for a reaction that is going to result in a clinically (and therefore, potentially dangerous, and cardiotoxic interaction) significant tachycardia? Given that there have been no auscultated arrhythmias, is their still a potential for the two drugs together, if working by certain MoAs, will result in one that just required some additional synergy to jumpstart things? Without knowing the MoA, in general, how common are tachyarrhythmias seen with adverse drug interactions? What type would you expect if my suspicions are close to correct about the pharmacodynamics of this structure?  I don't need exact science here or true stats since I haven't provided you with experimental data or chemical information with which you would need to form such an answer. All in all, my main and most important question is, how good of a chance of there being any sort of clinically negative side effect if I stick with a dose of Sildenafil, 20 mg or less? I definitely have not even been considering taking a large, Viagra-sized dose. I have taken 20-30mg previously alone when I had to wear a condom while having sex, causing me to have weak, or nonexistent function. It worked extremely quickly and effectively at that time.  I am going to stop talking now, if you got all the down here and read everything all the way through, I am proud of you. I know I will get an from someone that truly cares, then."

Otherwise, allow others to answer","Before addressing my actual question, let me preface it with the following: I am fairly new, but highly competent, practicing ER veterinarian. I know how drugs work, what I should and shouldn't mix together, and typically try to make my best decisions when there are grey areas based on the clinical picture before me. While I feel that I do this well to dogs, cats, horses, and other non-humans species, I am not able to proficiently self-assess or provide anything but very cursory examination of a living human being. I have no illusions that because of my profession as a vet, it makes me remotely qualified to assess humans from a diagnostic standpoint, as I hope you have none that you would make a competent veterinary diagnostician without the training / background first. I just would like you to know that when you address my concerns, you can talk to me like a medical professional instead of the average layperson. I think the below entry will illustrate this to you quite effectively versus me just saying it is so. Unfortunately, with all that knowledge I have, it is my own irresponsible and potentially self-injurious behavior, that brings us to this point. And now I can start talking... First just some biographic info: 31 year old, adult male in average - below average physical condition. I currently weigh about 175 lbs and am six feet tall. I take three daily medications, 450mg Buproprion XL once daily, 600mg Gabapentin twice daily, and 5.7mg Zubsolv once a day.(more common formulation wound be Suboxone, or generic buprenorphine / nalaxone). I have been on all these drugs for about the same amount of time, approximately 7-8 years. The doses have not been changed in any way for any of them in recent years, the last being a reduction of my zubsolv 2 years ago by half. I am a semi-habitual drug user for the last 4-6 months, without any particular drug of choice at the moment. I don't discriminate other than I don't touch opiates any more - haven't once since being on the maintenance medications. I will even refuse them, and have, in the face of severe, refractory pain. I have not drunk any alcohol either for the same length of time as my abstinence from opiate drugs and pharmaceuticals. I do not wish to be moralized about drug use, and how it could be my license if I am caught, or that I could face legal / severe / other health issues, or any of the other stuff that I already know but ignore. If you can handle this, and think you know stuff about drug interaction and pharmacology, please read on and try to help me out as best you can. I already know the general answer to my ultimate question and what the safest thing to do is. However, sometimes the mind and body are telling each other something entirely different - this is one of those scenarios. Drug 11 (I will refer to it at this as the bag it came in had the number 11 on it, and only the number 11) produced dose-dependent, repeatable/reproducible increases in euphoria, awareness, concentration, and a perceived increase in general mental acuity. I have utilized amphetamine and methamphetamine in past on numerous occasions, as well as several of their analogues. The intensity of these effects produced by 11, lay somewhere right between the aforesaid drugs. Given the extraordinary noradrenergic and dopaminergic effects and their affinity for the respected receptors, and ability to cause their massive release, I believe this drug to be a probable analogue of methamphetamine. I know MDMA / MDA and other drugs like this have extraordinary similarity from a structural standpoint (as in they are both also analogues of the amphetamines), but I believe that because 11 lacks the psychedelic effects produced by and intended to occur with a good, average dose of MDMA, we are dealing with something much closer structurally to regular amphetamine or, more likely, methamphetamine. So, basically lacking an attached ring structure on the molecule. I feel that we are dealing with a drug that has a very strong affinity for noradrenergic and dopaminergic receptor binding, is causing release of their associated neurotransmitters by one of many different possible MoA, is inhibiting their re-uptake (also, take your pick as to the exact science, obviously we aren't going to know that here, sorry) or some combination thereof. I feel that the physical effects that 11 has had on me are nearly identical to a very large dose of amphetamine. This is why I leave out serotonin as a key player in 11. I know it has its role and function in the way amphetamine makes you feel while you are and aren't on it, but overall, the other two NTs are far more important in controlling MoA and drug behavior. I have yet to experience any significant down from the drug, which when I inevitably go through this, will provide me with some more potential insight into pharmacodynamic action. Potentially, this will even provide me with some (limited) insight into the pharmacokinetics, to the extent of onset and duration of action, methods of metabolism / excretion, and bioavailabilty through different RoA should I choose to utilize again.  Moving onto my actual concern, despite the fact that I am a vet, I am also a recreational drug user.

The total volume of fluid administered was approximately 1.8-2.0 mL through a series of five deltoid injections, spread apart both sides of my shoulders. This was for both practical and clinical purposes, as it is my understanding that exceeding 1.0 mL in a small muscle like the deltoids can effect the muscle, as well as slow / halt the absorption of whatever the substance delivered. I also know nothing about this drugs ability to cause abscess, the result of intramuscular extravasation to the subcutaneous tissue, or any possibility of tissue necrosis. Really, just picture picking up a random white powder sent to you in the mail from someone in China, diluting it in sterile water, and seeing what happens. In an attempt to have some semblance of harm reduction practice, I start with what I hope to me considered a low-dose, and titrate upward as needed, or downward when learning the hard way. I have noted four separate, but repeatably and reliably dose-dependent (in three of them) adverse effects of 11 that support my above conclusions about how the drug works. They include dry mouth, mild to moderate nausea (no resulting vomiting or causative reasons such as vertigo or vestibular disease), sinus tachycardia, and very mild perspiration (which I believe may have been an effect of coming off the drug, that I experienced for a couple of hours before making the decision to re-administer 10 mg additional IM in a new solution made at a lower (probably about 18 - 22 mg / 1 ml solution) concentration by about 15-25% . Of all the side effects the cardiac ones were most concerning, particularly as they got more pronounced with repeated, and more frequent administration. I believe that the tachycardia was likely at its highest when the drug was at its highest point of concentration in the plasma. Without know the drug's half life and a ton of other information, were not going to know what that plasma level was, and what other cardiotoxic effects this drug could cause at even higher levels. Once again, I know this is stupid, but it's what I have been doing for a long while, and I won't be stopping unless forced to by some circumstances, physical or otherwise.  Anyway, if we are operating under the assumption that this drug is moderately to markedly dopaminergic, it has the ability to cause vasodilation. I know in vet med, we use dopamine at low doses CRI (range of 1-5ug/kg/min) in order to produce cardiac positive inotropic results. It is extremely effective in doing so. While I realize that dopamine can also produce the opposite, and generally not as useful effects, at (much) higher doses, a drug such as pure crystal meth isn't even known to cause dopaminnergic bradycardia until you are in danger of overdosing. In fact, I believe that the bradycardia is the most sign and reason for fatalities associated with that drug - along with the other cardiotoxic effects it has over the long-term. While the nausea and dry-mouth I mentioned previously are typically side effects more closely-associated with serotoninergic drugs, I believe that the effects were mild and controllable because of the limited effect this neurotransmitter has on 11. I wish I had an MSDS for you, I really do, or some experimental data on a group of lab rats, but I simply don't. Just working off my own experiences with known similar drugs and a solid scientific background to try and make a decision about mixing this with another drug, one that has known vasodilatory effects. In all honestly, I would have chosen pharmacology instead of heart health had the choice been available to me on this site. However, I feel that a physician who sees lots of patients with heart problems on multiple drugs or better yet, a practicing cardiologist, would be able to give me their best guess working with the little concrete information available.  Also before I completely forget to mention, there was one other cardiac abnormality. I auscultated a grade 2/6 (that's how we grade them in vet med, don't know if its the same for human cardiology, but the number in ours just an indicator of volume; 1 is pretty much inaudible and 6 is you hear it without putting the scope on the chest, as well as having a thrill)holosystolic murmur with a PMI at the most anteromedial aspect of right second intercostal space. Knowing very little about human cardiac anatomy or physiology, I had to google where to listen on the chest to hear and assess valvular health and detect / not detect sounds. Once I had the diagram, I have a very serviceable, new and recently serviced, Littman Cardiology IV that I use daily for my own job. I feel that I am well above average in detecting low - grade, often previously unnoted murmursin dogs and cats. But I have no proficiency or point to which I can compare my ability in people to hear the same. All I can tell you is that I believe, based on point of location and time in the cardiac cycle, the murmur PMI, if truly present and not a drug induced imagination, was most likely associated with the opening of the right AV valve. Once again, having limited knowledge of human medicine, I had to look up some possible differentials for newly discovered murmurs associated with this valve. I came up with very little, finding it to be the most uncommon valve to produce murmurs, or flow issues, in adults.  I have a host of wild theories and possible causes for this murmur, but the most simple thing is usually the answer in my experience. In this case, I have to imagine it was induced by the drug by one of several different mechanisms, since I was not longer able to hear it approximately three hours after I had last used drug 11. When I was still able to hear it, the other more euphoric effects were also still largely present, and seem to come down at similar rate at which they rose. The murmur was also slightly louder with a PMI spanning further right laterally on deep inspiration. No difference could be appreciated on expiration. The tachycardia was also gone (92 BPM) by three hours after the last administration of the initial solution I made up.  I know this has been very long, and probably going in circles for a bit now - all a result of 11, which I am sure as a physician you likely deduced long ago. But here's my sum-up and question, and my reason for wanting to do so: I would like to experience some sexual arousal and see if this drug has the potential to enhance sexual experience. Failure to achieve an erection despite visual and tactile stimulation by myself and/or my girlfriend was the ultimate result. Drug 11 caused sexual excitement and desire, which obviously sucked big time in the face of temporary ED. In truth, we didn't try for too long because I knew after a couple of minutes that it simply wasn't going to happen. In addition to it feeling somewhat physiologically impossible at the time, I think I was more interested in documenting the reasons for it in my experience report. I realize that sexual side effects are usually associated with drugs effecting serotonin release, making all those anti-depressant drugs all so popular. I am theorizing that their could be low level serotonergic reuptake inhibition associated with 11, just enough to cause the unpleasant sexual side effects. So here it comes...as a result of the ED, I have been toying with taking a low oral dose of sildenafil in order to try and retake control of my ability to become aroused. I have the generic tablets in the house for treatment of pulmonary hypertension in dogs. I don't know if this will help me reach orgasm (I might find that's an entirely separate problem), but I would like to at least be able to try and say I failed. I also felt that I needed to take into effect that sildenafil having its own noradrenergic effects might have the possibility to potentiate or synergize any activity being caused by the drug 11. I read in a research paper that PDE5 inhibitors have an effect on noradrenergic nerve fibers, though the MoA was getting to be a little technical for me, even on a good day. I wasn't really sure if the MoA affecting noradrenaline release in a PDE5 I would have any effect on any drugs that are presumably noradrenergic in their effect on the brain. From what I could make of the MoA, it sounded like the noradrenergic nerve fibers of the penis were the only thing it was really directly affection. Since you are a physician reading this and can't possibly advise me to take a drug that has a tachycardic (without knowing more about why it is occurring to a certain degree of assurance), I already know you are going to recommend not to take the Sildenafil, or anything like it given my cardiovascular response. I guess what I am more interested in hearing from you is, if I plan to ignore your advise on using it in conjunction with 11, what are my chances for a reaction that is going to result in a clinically (and therefore, potentially dangerous, and cardiotoxic interaction) significant tachycardia? Given that there have been no auscultated arrhythmias, is their still a potential for the two drugs together, if working by certain MoAs, will result in one that just required some additional synergy to jumpstart things? Without knowing the MoA, in general, how common are tachyarrhythmias seen with adverse drug interactions? What type would you expect if my suspicions are close to correct about the pharmacodynamics of this structure?  I don't need exact science here or true stats since I haven't provided you with experimental data or chemical information with which you would need to form such an answer. All in all, my main and most important question is, how good of a chance of there being any sort of clinically negative side effect if I stick with a dose of Sildenafil, 20 mg or less? I definitely have not even been considering taking a large, Viagra-sized dose. I have taken 20-30mg previously alone when I had to wear a condom while having sex, causing me to have weak, or nonexistent function. It worked extremely quickly and effectively at that time.  I am going to stop talking now, if you got all the down here and read everything all the way through, I am proud of you. I know I will get an from someone that truly cares, then."

Read ENTIRE POST prior to responding. Otherwise, allow others to answer","Before addressing my actual question, let me preface it with the following: I am fairly new, but highly competent, practicing ER veterinarian. I know how drugs work, what I should and shouldn't mix together, and typically try to make my best decisions when there are grey areas based on the clinical picture before me. While I feel that I do this well to dogs, cats, horses, and other non-humans species, I am not able to proficiently self-assess or provide anything but very cursory examination of a living human being. I have no illusions that because of my profession as a vet, it makes me remotely qualified to assess humans from a diagnostic standpoint, as I hope you have none that you would make a competent veterinary diagnostician without the training / background first. I just would like you to know that when you address my concerns, you can talk to me like a medical professional instead of the average layperson. I think the below entry will illustrate this to you quite effectively versus me just saying it is so. Unfortunately, with all that knowledge I have, it is my own irresponsible and potentially self-injurious behavior, that brings us to this point. And now I can start talking... First just some biographic info: 31 year old, adult male in average - below average physical condition. I currently weigh about 175 lbs and am six feet tall. I take three daily medications, 450mg Buproprion XL once daily, 600mg Gabapentin twice daily, and 5.7mg Zubsolv once a day.(more common formulation wound be Suboxone, or generic buprenorphine / nalaxone). I have been on all these drugs for about the same amount of time, approximately 7-8 years. The doses have not been changed in any way for any of them in recent years, the last being a reduction of my zubsolv 2 years ago by half. I am a semi-habitual drug user for the last 4-6 months, without any particular drug of choice at the moment. I don't discriminate other than I don't touch opiates any more - haven't once since being on the maintenance medications. I will even refuse them, and have, in the face of severe, refractory pain. I have not drunk any alcohol either for the same length of time as my abstinence from opiate drugs and pharmaceuticals. I do not wish to be moralized about drug use, and how it could be my license if I am caught, or that I could face legal / severe / other health issues, or any of the other stuff that I already know but ignore. If you can handle this, and think you know stuff about drug interaction and pharmacology, please read on and try to help me out as best you can. I already know the general answer to my ultimate question and what the safest thing to do is. However, sometimes the mind and body are telling each other something entirely different - this is one of those scenarios. Drug 11 (I will refer to it at this as the bag it came in had the number 11 on it, and only the number 11) produced dose-dependent, repeatable/reproducible increases in euphoria, awareness, concentration, and a perceived increase in general mental acuity. I have utilized amphetamine and methamphetamine in past on numerous occasions, as well as several of their analogues. The intensity of these effects produced by 11, lay somewhere right between the aforesaid drugs. Given the extraordinary noradrenergic and dopaminergic effects and their affinity for the respected receptors, and ability to cause their massive release, I believe this drug to be a probable analogue of methamphetamine. I know MDMA / MDA and other drugs like this have extraordinary similarity from a structural standpoint (as in they are both also analogues of the amphetamines), but I believe that because 11 lacks the psychedelic effects produced by and intended to occur with a good, average dose of MDMA, we are dealing with something much closer structurally to regular amphetamine or, more likely, methamphetamine. So, basically lacking an attached ring structure on the molecule. I feel that we are dealing with a drug that has a very strong affinity for noradrenergic and dopaminergic receptor binding, is causing release of their associated neurotransmitters by one of many different possible MoA, is inhibiting their re-uptake (also, take your pick as to the exact science, obviously we aren't going to know that here, sorry) or some combination thereof. I feel that the physical effects that 11 has had on me are nearly identical to a very large dose of amphetamine. This is why I leave out serotonin as a key player in 11. I know it has its role and function in the way amphetamine makes you feel while you are and aren't on it, but overall, the other two NTs are far more important in controlling MoA and drug behavior. I have yet to experience any significant down from the drug, which when I inevitably go through this, will provide me with some more potential insight into pharmacodynamic action. Potentially, this will even provide me with some (limited) insight into the pharmacokinetics, to the extent of onset and duration of action, methods of metabolism / excretion, and bioavailabilty through different RoA should I choose to utilize again.  Moving onto my actual concern, despite the fact that I am a vet, I am also a recreational drug user. I often venture into drugs of unknown chemical structure (aka research chemicals, unapproved for or untested for use in human use) that have had absolutely no testing performed in any official capacity by any official organization or respectable institution. My concern is how this one chemical, that very well fits the above description, has been having some mild to moderate cardiovascular side effects. I appear to have started experiencing dose-dependent sinus tachycardia, starting at 125 and reaching as high as about 150 BPM at what I imagine was the drugs peak plasma concentration. During my first course of ""experimentation"" I administered what have, if my drug concentration was what I had even come close to achieving (25-50mg / 1mL solution) was a total dose ranging in the 50-100mg over the course of about four to five hours.

I also know nothing about this drugs ability to cause abscess, the result of intramuscular extravasation to the subcutaneous tissue, or any possibility of tissue necrosis. Really, just picture picking up a random white powder sent to you in the mail from someone in China, diluting it in sterile water, and seeing what happens. In an attempt to have some semblance of harm reduction practice, I start with what I hope to me considered a low-dose, and titrate upward as needed, or downward when learning the hard way. I have noted four separate, but repeatably and reliably dose-dependent (in three of them) adverse effects of 11 that support my above conclusions about how the drug works. They include dry mouth, mild to moderate nausea (no resulting vomiting or causative reasons such as vertigo or vestibular disease), sinus tachycardia, and very mild perspiration (which I believe may have been an effect of coming off the drug, that I experienced for a couple of hours before making the decision to re-administer 10 mg additional IM in a new solution made at a lower (probably about 18 - 22 mg / 1 ml solution) concentration by about 15-25% . Of all the side effects the cardiac ones were most concerning, particularly as they got more pronounced with repeated, and more frequent administration. I believe that the tachycardia was likely at its highest when the drug was at its highest point of concentration in the plasma. Without know the drug's half life and a ton of other information, were not going to know what that plasma level was, and what other cardiotoxic effects this drug could cause at even higher levels. Once again, I know this is stupid, but it's what I have been doing for a long while, and I won't be stopping unless forced to by some circumstances, physical or otherwise.  Anyway, if we are operating under the assumption that this drug is moderately to markedly dopaminergic, it has the ability to cause vasodilation. I know in vet med, we use dopamine at low doses CRI (range of 1-5ug/kg/min) in order to produce cardiac positive inotropic results. It is extremely effective in doing so. While I realize that dopamine can also produce the opposite, and generally not as useful effects, at (much) higher doses, a drug such as pure crystal meth isn't even known to cause dopaminnergic bradycardia until you are in danger of overdosing. In fact, I believe that the bradycardia is the most sign and reason for fatalities associated with that drug - along with the other cardiotoxic effects it has over the long-term. While the nausea and dry-mouth I mentioned previously are typically side effects more closely-associated with serotoninergic drugs, I believe that the effects were mild and controllable because of the limited effect this neurotransmitter has on 11. I wish I had an MSDS for you, I really do, or some experimental data on a group of lab rats, but I simply don't. Just working off my own experiences with known similar drugs and a solid scientific background to try and make a decision about mixing this with another drug, one that has known vasodilatory effects. In all honestly, I would have chosen pharmacology instead of heart health had the choice been available to me on this site. However, I feel that a physician who sees lots of patients with heart problems on multiple drugs or better yet, a practicing cardiologist, would be able to give me their best guess working with the little concrete information available.  Also before I completely forget to mention, there was one other cardiac abnormality. I auscultated a grade 2/6 (that's how we grade them in vet med, don't know if its the same for human cardiology, but the number in ours just an indicator of volume; 1 is pretty much inaudible and 6 is you hear it without putting the scope on the chest, as well as having a thrill)holosystolic murmur with a PMI at the most anteromedial aspect of right second intercostal space. Knowing very little about human cardiac anatomy or physiology, I had to google where to listen on the chest to hear and assess valvular health and detect / not detect sounds. Once I had the diagram, I have a very serviceable, new and recently serviced, Littman Cardiology IV that I use daily for my own job. I feel that I am well above average in detecting low - grade, often previously unnoted murmursin dogs and cats. But I have no proficiency or point to which I can compare my ability in people to hear the same. All I can tell you is that I believe, based on point of location and time in the cardiac cycle, the murmur PMI, if truly present and not a drug induced imagination, was most likely associated with the opening of the right AV valve. Once again, having limited knowledge of human medicine, I had to look up some possible differentials for newly discovered murmurs associated with this valve. I came up with very little, finding it to be the most uncommon valve to produce murmurs, or flow issues, in adults.  I have a host of wild theories and possible causes for this murmur, but the most simple thing is usually the answer in my experience. In this case, I have to imagine it was induced by the drug by one of several different mechanisms, since I was not longer able to hear it approximately three hours after I had last used drug 11. When I was still able to hear it, the other more euphoric effects were also still largely present, and seem to come down at similar rate at which they rose. The murmur was also slightly louder with a PMI spanning further right laterally on deep inspiration. No difference could be appreciated on expiration. The tachycardia was also gone (92 BPM) by three hours after the last administration of the initial solution I made up.  I know this has been very long, and probably going in circles for a bit now - all a result of 11, which I am sure as a physician you likely deduced long ago. But here's my sum-up and question, and my reason for wanting to do so: I would like to experience some sexual arousal and see if this drug has the potential to enhance sexual experience. Failure to achieve an erection despite visual and tactile stimulation by myself and/or my girlfriend was the ultimate result. Drug 11 caused sexual excitement and desire, which obviously sucked big time in the face of temporary ED. In truth, we didn't try for too long because I knew after a couple of minutes that it simply wasn't going to happen. In addition to it feeling somewhat physiologically impossible at the time, I think I was more interested in documenting the reasons for it in my experience report. I realize that sexual side effects are usually associated with drugs effecting serotonin release, making all those anti-depressant drugs all so popular. I am theorizing that their could be low level serotonergic reuptake inhibition associated with 11, just enough to cause the unpleasant sexual side effects. So here it comes...as a result of the ED, I have been toying with taking a low oral dose of sildenafil in order to try and retake control of my ability to become aroused. I have the generic tablets in the house for treatment of pulmonary hypertension in dogs. I don't know if this will help me reach orgasm (I might find that's an entirely separate problem), but I would like to at least be able to try and say I failed. I also felt that I needed to take into effect that sildenafil having its own noradrenergic effects might have the possibility to potentiate or synergize any activity being caused by the drug 11. I read in a research paper that PDE5 inhibitors have an effect on noradrenergic nerve fibers, though the MoA was getting to be a little technical for me, even on a good day. I wasn't really sure if the MoA affecting noradrenaline release in a PDE5 I would have any effect on any drugs that are presumably noradrenergic in their effect on the brain. From what I could make of the MoA, it sounded like the noradrenergic nerve fibers of the penis were the only thing it was really directly affection. Since you are a physician reading this and can't possibly advise me to take a drug that has a tachycardic (without knowing more about why it is occurring to a certain degree of assurance), I already know you are going to recommend not to take the Sildenafil, or anything like it given my cardiovascular response. I guess what I am more interested in hearing from you is, if I plan to ignore your advise on using it in conjunction with 11, what are my chances for a reaction that is going to result in a clinically (and therefore, potentially dangerous, and cardiotoxic interaction) significant tachycardia? Given that there have been no auscultated arrhythmias, is their still a potential for the two drugs together, if working by certain MoAs, will result in one that just required some additional synergy to jumpstart things? Without knowing the MoA, in general, how common are tachyarrhythmias seen with adverse drug interactions? What type would you expect if my suspicions are close to correct about the pharmacodynamics of this structure?  I don't need exact science here or true stats since I haven't provided you with experimental data or chemical information with which you would need to form such an answer. All in all, my main and most important question is, how good of a chance of there being any sort of clinically negative side effect if I stick with a dose of Sildenafil, 20 mg or less? I definitely have not even been considering taking a large, Viagra-sized dose. I have taken 20-30mg previously alone when I had to wear a condom while having sex, causing me to have weak, or nonexistent function. It worked extremely quickly and effectively at that time.  I am going to stop talking now, if you got all the down here and read everything all the way through, I am proud of you. I know I will get an from someone that truly cares, then."

Read ENTIRE POST prior to responding. Otherwise, allow others to answer","Before addressing my actual question, let me preface it with the following: I am fairly new, but highly competent, practicing ER veterinarian. I know how drugs work, what I should and shouldn't mix together, and typically try to make my best decisions when there are grey areas based on the clinical picture before me. While I feel that I do this well to dogs, cats, horses, and other non-humans species, I am not able to proficiently self-assess or provide anything but very cursory examination of a living human being. I have no illusions that because of my profession as a vet, it makes me remotely qualified to assess humans from a diagnostic standpoint, as I hope you have none that you would make a competent veterinary diagnostician without the training / background first. I just would like you to know that when you address my concerns, you can talk to me like a medical professional instead of the average layperson. I think the below entry will illustrate this to you quite effectively versus me just saying it is so. Unfortunately, with all that knowledge I have, it is my own irresponsible and potentially self-injurious behavior, that brings us to this point. And now I can start talking... First just some biographic info: 31 year old, adult male in average - below average physical condition. I currently weigh about 175 lbs and am six feet tall. I take three daily medications, 450mg Buproprion XL once daily, 600mg Gabapentin twice daily, and 5.7mg Zubsolv once a day.(more common formulation wound be Suboxone, or generic buprenorphine / nalaxone). I have been on all these drugs for about the same amount of time, approximately 7-8 years. The doses have not been changed in any way for any of them in recent years, the last being a reduction of my zubsolv 2 years ago by half. I am a semi-habitual drug user for the last 4-6 months, without any particular drug of choice at the moment. I don't discriminate other than I don't touch opiates any more - haven't once since being on the maintenance medications. I will even refuse them, and have, in the face of severe, refractory pain. I have not drunk any alcohol either for the same length of time as my abstinence from opiate drugs and pharmaceuticals. I do not wish to be moralized about drug use, and how it could be my license if I am caught, or that I could face legal / severe / other health issues, or any of the other stuff that I already know but ignore. If you can handle this, and think you know stuff about drug interaction and pharmacology, please read on and try to help me out as best you can. I already know the general answer to my ultimate question and what the safest thing to do is. However, sometimes the mind and body are telling each other something entirely different - this is one of those scenarios. Drug 11 (I will refer to it at this as the bag it came in had the number 11 on it, and only the number 11) produced dose-dependent, repeatable/reproducible increases in euphoria, awareness, concentration, and a perceived increase in general mental acuity. I have utilized amphetamine and methamphetamine in past on numerous occasions, as well as several of their analogues. The intensity of these effects produced by 11, lay somewhere right between the aforesaid drugs. Given the extraordinary noradrenergic and dopaminergic effects and their affinity for the respected receptors, and ability to cause their massive release, I believe this drug to be a probable analogue of methamphetamine. I know MDMA / MDA and other drugs like this have extraordinary similarity from a structural standpoint (as in they are both also analogues of the amphetamines), but I believe that because 11 lacks the psychedelic effects produced by and intended to occur with a good, average dose of MDMA, we are dealing with something much closer structurally to regular amphetamine or, more likely, methamphetamine. So, basically lacking an attached ring structure on the molecule. I feel that we are dealing with a drug that has a very strong affinity for noradrenergic and dopaminergic receptor binding, is causing release of their associated neurotransmitters by one of many different possible MoA, is inhibiting their re-uptake (also, take your pick as to the exact science, obviously we aren't going to know that here, sorry) or some combination thereof. I feel that the physical effects that 11 has had on me are nearly identical to a very large dose of amphetamine. This is why I leave out serotonin as a key player in 11. I know it has its role and function in the way amphetamine makes you feel while you are and aren't on it, but overall, the other two NTs are far more important in controlling MoA and drug behavior. I have yet to experience any significant down from the drug, which when I inevitably go through this, will provide me with some more potential insight into pharmacodynamic action. Potentially, this will even provide me with some (limited) insight into the pharmacokinetics, to the extent of onset and duration of action, methods of metabolism / excretion, and bioavailabilty through different RoA should I choose to utilize again.  Moving onto my actual concern, despite the fact that I am a vet, I am also a recreational drug user. I often venture into drugs of unknown chemical structure (aka research chemicals, unapproved for or untested for use in human use) that have had absolutely no testing performed in any official capacity by any official organization or respectable institution. My concern is how this one chemical, that very well fits the above description, has been having some mild to moderate cardiovascular side effects. I appear to have started experiencing dose-dependent sinus tachycardia, starting at 125 and reaching as high as about 150 BPM at what I imagine was the drugs peak plasma concentration. During my first course of ""experimentation"" I administered what have, if my drug concentration was what I had even come close to achieving (25-50mg / 1mL solution) was a total dose ranging in the 50-100mg over the course of about four to five hours. The total volume of fluid administered was approximately 1.8-2.0 mL through a series of five deltoid injections, spread apart both sides of my shoulders. This was for both practical and clinical purposes, as it is my understanding that exceeding 1.0 mL in a small muscle like the deltoids can effect the muscle, as well as slow / halt the absorption of whatever the substance delivered.

Less than a month before his return, I noticed spotting between my periods, so I got tested & found out I had chlamydia, likely from one of my partners during that 6 months. I got treated, and was told to wait 30 days before having intercourse. My partner returned after about 20 days, he immediately got tested prior to us having intercourse again, and results came up negative, so we carried on with our relationship. I neglected to check back after 30 days to see if the chlamydia was eliminated, but I no longer noticed the spotting symptoms. Fast forward 2.5 years, I have been with that same partner the whole time & neither of us has had any other partners. We have not used condoms this whole time. I went to urgent care a couple weeks ago to get a UTI treated, and the urgent care physician decided to check my urine for chlamydia again as well. Much to my surprise, I had chlamydia again (or still), although I hadn't noticed any symptoms. My partner got immediately tested again, and AGAIN his results turned up negative. We were both given medication regardless, and now we are waiting to have intercourse again until we can figure out what is going on. 1. Is it possible that the chlamydia could have survived the first treatment and has been with me these past 2.5 years without symptoms? 2. Is it possible that he would not have contracted it over all that time having unprotected sex? 3. Is it possible I could have a false positive or that he could have a false negative?"

This is pretty embarrassing but curious if i need to go see my Gyno. My boyfriend and I were having sex, as we normally would but I was slightly dry towards the end, which left me pretty sore the next day. It almost seemed to get worse as the day went and especially when I peed. It would burn REALLY bad, only on the actually skin that felt like it had been burned or torn. (Kind of like what a rug burn feels like, very tender to touch). Throughout the day it wasn't too bad but every time I peed that part of my skin would burn and sting, bad. At first the burning sensation was only felt if I touched it, peed or wiped, but now when I wipe there's a little bit of blood, from when I pat dry. After doing some research it seems like I have a vaginal tear from dry sex. What should I do? Will it heal on its own? I put neosporin on it the first day and the. Read that I shouldn't, if it's internal, which it is. Are there any over the counter products I should use? I prefer not to go the the doctor, unless I really have to. Thanks!"

It is soft to the touch and not discolored. I can only see it in certain lighting but recently within the past month I have noticed it is pulsing with my heartbeat. I have felt my facial artery and followed it from the mandible and it feels larger on my left than on my right. I have gone to the dermatologist and they said they had never seen anything like that before. I then went to an oral surgeon who suggested I go and get an angiogram CT for the possibility it is a facial AVM. I have been worried about that possibility non stop and I wanted to post this because I have seen other people online post about similar pulsating bumps under the skin about the size of a pea near their mouths and I wanted to start this new thread because all the old ones were closed and didn’t allow me to post or comment. I was wondering if anyone has had a similar situation and if it was an AVM or if it was just that their facial artery was large and close to the surface in a particular area. I am a male and 21 years old so for it to be a facial AVM I feel that I would be diagnosed pretty late considering most AVM’s are formed around birth. I am looking to see if anyone could offer another possible theory on what it is and/or find people with the same condition so I can let you know what the results of my CT angiogram says because no one seems to know what is going on with this pulsing in my face. I am getting the CT next Friday so I will come back and post my results but in the meantime if anyone thinks they might have an alternate hypothesis please let me know and if you have this same issue, what did you find out."

It was bothersome this morning and I couldn't go back to sleep, then I went to work and felt better. Heck I even started feeling normal! But as soon as I got home , it started up again, and I can't even get comfortable without feeling stimulated to the point where I feel like I have gas or have to poop. It's not constant, but the more I think/worry about it, i seem to get more stimulated. What should I do?! I wanted to wack it out (lol) but I'm worried that if I do it will make it worse. Any suggestions?"

I’m 19 years old and am very active I’ve played sports all my life. Back then when I first started feeling these discomforts I would worry but it went away after about 5 Min so then I would be back to normal. Okay so here is what happens... at rest my heart rate is 53 bpm... which is low for my age... but when I exercise or run for instance out of no where with no warning I will get an immediate shock of a rapid heart beat. The feeling is unbearable and I immediately have to stop or else I get the feeling that I will pass out. It feels like my chest is going to explode and even when stopped and taking deep breaths it beats rapidly. I am not tired from the exercise but it drains me at that time that the incident occurs. Now what really scares me is when the heart beat will almost feel like it revives itself and in 1 second goes back to normal. That’s how quick it goes back on normal beats. I feel it through my whole body when it happens. This problem is very hard to explain so this was the best I could. I had an irregular heartbeat as a child but I’ve received EKG in the past and there were no problems... what is happening? I’ve searched and cannot find anything this relates to this feeling

With a resting heart rate of 165bpm and a blood sugar level of 2.2,after a series of ECHOs, MRIs, X-rays and ultrasounds it was apparent that my heart function rested on 15% and there was fluid entering my lungs.  The cause is still not yet identified. I have began trials with beta blockers to some success in lowering my heart rate, but the agony from side effects left me without them.  So the questions I have to ask, generally  How much is this going to effect my life?  How long am I expected to live?  Is threat of death through heart attack or sudden death, cardiac arrest imminent?"

We are both lost as to why I have both and he has 1 which is why currently all fingers point at me because it seems I was the one infected first and passed it on to him. Thanks in advance.

It runs low and I can feel the beating in my chest skip. I check my blood pressure and it’s in the normal range. I get extremely anxious and begin to worry that I’m going to have a heart attack. I am on a beta blocker and I take a 3mg alprazolam XR daily for anxiety.  When these attacks happen I feel tightness in my chest, difficulty breathing, pounding, sometimes I’ll breakout in a cold sweat, sometimes tingly and lightheaded, and my anxiety goes through the roof. Sometimes I’ll feel a tingling sensation in my anus or testicles. I am incapacitated because I’m scared to do anything. The slightest thing in my chest scares me.  I’ve had gastric bypass surgery around 19 years ago. I am still overweight. I take zegerid to help with acid reflux. I feel very gassy when these attacks happen and sometimes if I get in the right position I can open my mouth and not burp but instead it’s almost as if air is escaping. It makes a gurgle sound. I can do this for 30 minutes sometimes. Sometimes this alleviates the attack, other times not.  I don’t know what other info to give. I’d just like help. My doctors act like nothings wrong and just brush it off, but it scares me to death. I don’t want to die and leave my wife and two kids behind. I don’t know if the one time I don’t go to the ER is going to be the one time I should have. I just want peace... can ANYONE help?"

The pains are either in the center or the left side of my chest, beneath my rib cage. I feel constant pressure, and it's difficult to breathe deeply. It hurts even worse when I lay flat on my back or on my right side, but it's difficult to get comfortable at all, honestly. I have shortness of breath, and I get dizzy/ light headed sometimes. The pain shoots down my left arm. My left arm was numb and tingling for a few hours on Wednesday, and there were sharp pains in my left hand and fingers, as well as numbness. Today, I feel the pain in my back, as well. Yesterday, I had a nuclear stress test. The pain increased AFTER my heart rate was supposed to drop. Therefore, my heart rate didn't slow down, and my BP was elevated. They had to inject me with something to slow my heart rate; it still took several minutes to get it below 100 bpm. After I left, the vessels on either side of my neck were throbbing and bulging and my neck hurt so badly, I thought I was going to have a stroke. I feel like the cardiologist is being dismissive because I don't smoke, I'm not obese, nor do I have hypertension or high cholesterol. However, I'm a type-A personality, and I have a high stress job (middle school English teacher). I've always been high-strung, and I have a history of anxiety dating back to childhood. I also suffer from Raynaud's and migraines. Since the chest pains started, I've noticed an increase in how often my left hand is blue (2-3 times per day, versus only when I was cold or stressed before, and it would happen in both hands and my feet) and I've had severe headaches almost every day. I have never posted on a discussion forum, but I'm so tired of feeling like this doctor isn't taking me seriously. He's got it in his mind that it's not my heart, and he's acting like he's just indulging me by ordering further tests. The EKG and echocardiogram were both normal, but I wasn't having a spasm during either test. Also, he hasn't checked my vessels, which is where I think the issue lies. Meanwhile, I had to take a leave of absence from work because I can no longer perform my job well! I thought it was weird that I would get through the whole day and then be hunched over in pain when I finally sat down for planning during the last block, as well. Although there were moments when I had to step outside of the class because I felt like I was having a minor heart attack, I had a MAJOR incident one night after playing with my dog. I ended up curled in a ball on the floor, clutching my chest. It's a shame when I don't want to go to the ER because I'm worried they're just going to send me home and tell me, ""It's not your heart."" What else could it possibly be???

The pain shoots down my left arm. My left arm was numb and tingling for a few hours on Wednesday, and there were sharp pains in my left hand and fingers, as well as numbness. Today, I feel the pain in my back, as well. Yesterday, I had a nuclear stress test. The pain increased AFTER my heart rate was supposed to drop. Therefore, my heart rate didn't slow down, and my BP was elevated. They had to inject me with something to slow my heart rate; it still took several minutes to get it below 100 bpm. After I left, the vessels on either side of my neck were throbbing and bulging and my neck hurt so badly, I thought I was going to have a stroke. I feel like the cardiologist is being dismissive because I don't smoke, I'm not obese, nor do I have hypertension or high cholesterol. However, I'm a type-A personality, and I have a high stress job (middle school English teacher). I've always been high-strung, and I have a history of anxiety dating back to childhood. I also suffer from Raynaud's and migraines. Since the chest pains started, I've noticed an increase in how often my left hand is blue (2-3 times per day, versus only when I was cold or stressed before, and it would happen in both hands and my feet) and I've had severe headaches almost every day. I have never posted on a discussion forum, but I'm so tired of feeling like this doctor isn't taking me seriously. He's got it in his mind that it's not my heart, and he's acting like he's just indulging me by ordering further tests. The EKG and echocardiogram were both normal, but I wasn't having a spasm during either test. Also, he hasn't checked my vessels, which is where I think the issue lies. Meanwhile, I had to take a leave of absence from work because I can no longer perform my job well! I thought it was weird that I would get through the whole day and then be hunched over in pain when I finally sat down for planning during the last block, as well. Although there were moments when I had to step outside of the class because I felt like I was having a minor heart attack, I had a MAJOR incident one night after playing with my dog. I ended up curled in a ball on the floor, clutching my chest. It's a shame when I don't want to go to the ER because I'm worried they're just going to send me home and tell me, ""It's not your heart."" What else could it possibly be??? FYI: my paternal grandmother and her mother both had their first heart attacks at 50, and they both suffered from cardiac disease."

No one could find anything wrong. I went to multiple ENT, MRI nothing. In January I had an upper endoscopy. I had eosinophilic esophagitis, gerd, small hiatal hernia and multiple erosions in the stomach that were bleeding. Never had stomach pain go figure. I was on omeprazole for about 8 days then I stopped it. I had a VERY hard pound in my chest. No idea what it was but nothing happened after. It did it again the next day and nothing. The third and last time it did it I started getting skipped heart beats after. The first few days I had likely a thousand a day. As time went on they got less and less now I maybe have 5 to 10 a day. I used to get palpitations from proton pump inhibits in the past so I try to not take them.  Anyway the first day I had them I saw a cardiologist. He gave me low dose atenolol. I took it at night and when I woke up in the morning all my chest muscles and neck muscles were very stiff in the morning. As the day went on it got better. Then over the next week or so I started getting pain in my left shoulder that shot down my arm and the left side of my chest. The more I did the worse it would get. Finally one day it was terrible I called an ambulance. They did an EKG when they arrived and said it looked good. They gave me nitro and took me to the ER. They did blood work and said I was fine. This continued on and off and then I started getting pain the center of the chest low just below the sternum. During this time I started getting severe anxiety as I started thinking I was going to die any second every day. As time went on I started getting this chest discomfort right in the center of the chest. Originally I only got the pain after a painful skipped beat. Most were fine but now and then I’d get one that felt sharp and then I’d get chest pain after. Now I just get the pain all the time palpitation or no. When I have this discomfort if I go somewhere i get extreme tightness along my entire ribcage, front, back and sides. Like someone giving me a bear hug. Sometime it feels tight down my arms and into my jaw as well. I have this every day and the discomfort almost all day. I even wake up with it. To date I have had 12 EKG’s all normal.   As one doctor put it most people would wish their EKG looked that good. I have had a lot of blood work all normal. I had an echo, halter, stress test, and nuclear stress test all normal. The only thing they see is on the halter I get bouts of tachycardia and an occasional PAC. The cardiologist says that it looks like something is irritating the heart but he doesn’t think it’s the heart. The GI doctor says my esophagus is not the problem he said take antacids which I have tried many no help. I do not know what to do. My primary, rheumatologist and cardiologist all tell me see a shrink its anxiety/panic attacks. How can this be almost all day every day? To give an example I went to my wife’s parent’s house one day and I started getting the discomfort and shaking.   I tried walking it off but little to no help. They asked me to help move some light chairs outside all of 10 feet. I was fine during but about 5 to 10 minutes after I got the bear hug chest tightness and started panicking badly thinking I was going to die. I tried to relax to no avail. This continued till I got home and relaxed and it went away. The next day I went outside my house determined to figure this out and I started cleaning up my yard movie 35 to 50 pound blocks and other things for about 25 minutes. No pain no tightness no problems. Next morning I woke up and chest was tight but I did do heavy lifting and it didn’t feel deep. But I was home and relaxed. Other things I have noticed is I don’t care about sex as much as I did before this and I feel worn out very often. The chest discomfort feels like it’s about an inch deep right under the sternum and makes activity tiresome. I also concentrate on my heart all day.  Nothing else really runs through my head since I always feel it I can’t concentrate on anything else but solving this. I have been to the ER 3 times they said it’s likely costocondritis but I try nsaids and nothing plus it has been going on for 3 months or so now ever since that hard POUND or whatever that was. Is there a way I have a blockage and all of those tests missed it? Or am I really going insane?   Some extra notes about me. I am male, 34 and married with a 1 year old daughter. In my entire family tree only my father had heart problems. He had a heart attack at 57 but he also smoked for many years was very overweight 300 pounds or so and was a type 2 diabetic for at least 15 years. He did survive the heart attack and is fine now at 66.I have never smoked in my life. I do not drink. I was always very skinny and healthy but about 2 years ago I started gaining some weight. I am 6’3” and topped out at about 233 in December 2016. Now in April I am 220. I normally eat healthy LOTS of fruits and veggies. The occasional french-fry etc.  Since I developed a wheat allergy a few years back I try to eat gluten free as best I can but it can be hard. I take zyrtec every day since I developed the wheat allergy else I get hives all over head to toe even if I stay gluten free.   I’m not the most active person in the world since I do IT work and I’m on computers a lot but I do get out. A lot in summers. Winters here in NJ get cold. I do have ehlers danlos syndrome a connective tissue disorder but that has never affected my chest before just spine and knees/shoulders. I did have an mra in May of 2016 that saw no aneurysms in my chest. They look now and then even though I do NOT have the type that affects arteries. I just wait all day expecting to have a heart attack. I even shake my legs all day which I’m told is anxiety. I have tried Xanax but all it does is make me tired nothing else. Please help me. This is ruining my life I can not even leave the house anymore as the chest will get very tight and full panic will set in and this is not getting better just worse as time goes on."

This is ruining my life I can not even leave the house anymore as the chest will get very tight and full panic will set in and this is not getting better just worse as time goes on."

No one could find anything wrong. I went to multiple ENT, MRI nothing. In January I had an upper endoscopy. I had eosinophilic esophagitis, gerd, small hiatal hernia and multiple erosions in the stomach that were bleeding. Never had stomach pain go figure. I was on omeprazole for about 8 days then I stopped it. I had a VERY hard pound in my chest. No idea what it was but nothing happened after. It did it again the next day and nothing. The third and last time it did it I started getting skipped heart beats after. The first few days I had likely a thousand a day. As time went on they got less and less now I maybe have 5 to 10 a day. I used to get palpitations from proton pump inhibits in the past so I try to not take them.  Anyway the first day I had them I saw a cardiologist. He gave me low dose atenolol. I took it at night and when I woke up in the morning all my chest muscles and neck muscles were very stiff in the morning. As the day went on it got better. Then over the next week or so I started getting pain in my left shoulder that shot down my arm and the left side of my chest. The more I did the worse it would get. Finally one day it was terrible I called an ambulance. They did an EKG when they arrived and said it looked good. They gave me nitro and took me to the ER. They did blood work and said I was fine. This continued on and off and then I started getting pain the center of the chest low just below the sternum. During this time I started getting severe anxiety as I started thinking I was going to die any second every day. As time went on I started getting this chest discomfort right in the center of the chest. Originally I only got the pain after a painful skipped beat. Most were fine but now and then I’d get one that felt sharp and then I’d get chest pain after. Now I just get the pain all the time palpitation or no. When I have this discomfort if I go somewhere i get extreme tightness along my entire ribcage, front, back and sides. Like someone giving me a bear hug. Sometime it feels tight down my arms and into my jaw as well. I have this every day and the discomfort almost all day. I even wake up with it. To date I have had 12 EKG’s all normal.   As one doctor put it most people would wish their EKG looked that good. I have had a lot of blood work all normal. I had an echo, halter, stress test, and nuclear stress test all normal. The only thing they see is on the halter I get bouts of tachycardia and an occasional PAC. The cardiologist says that it looks like something is irritating the heart but he doesn’t think it’s the heart. The GI doctor says my esophagus is not the problem he said take antacids which I have tried many no help. I do not know what to do. My primary, rheumatologist and cardiologist all tell me see a shrink its anxiety/panic attacks. How can this be almost all day every day? To give an example I went to my wife’s parent’s house one day and I started getting the discomfort and shaking.   I tried walking it off but little to no help. They asked me to help move some light chairs outside all of 10 feet. I was fine during but about 5 to 10 minutes after I got the bear hug chest tightness and started panicking badly thinking I was going to die. I tried to relax to no avail. This continued till I got home and relaxed and it went away. The next day I went outside my house determined to figure this out and I started cleaning up my yard movie 35 to 50 pound blocks and other things for about 25 minutes. No pain no tightness no problems. Next morning I woke up and chest was tight but I did do heavy lifting and it didn’t feel deep. But I was home and relaxed. Other things I have noticed is I don’t care about sex as much as I did before this and I feel worn out very often. The chest discomfort feels like it’s about an inch deep right under the sternum and makes activity tiresome. I also concentrate on my heart all day.  Nothing else really runs through my head since I always feel it I can’t concentrate on anything else but solving this. I have been to the ER 3 times they said it’s likely costocondritis but I try nsaids and nothing plus it has been going on for 3 months or so now ever since that hard POUND or whatever that was. Is there a way I have a blockage and all of those tests missed it? Or am I really going insane?   Some extra notes about me. I am male, 34 and married with a 1 year old daughter. In my entire family tree only my father had heart problems. He had a heart attack at 57 but he also smoked for many years was very overweight 300 pounds or so and was a type 2 diabetic for at least 15 years. He did survive the heart attack and is fine now at 66.I have never smoked in my life. I do not drink. I was always very skinny and healthy but about 2 years ago I started gaining some weight. I am 6’3” and topped out at about 233 in December 2016. Now in April I am 220. I normally eat healthy LOTS of fruits and veggies. The occasional french-fry etc.  Since I developed a wheat allergy a few years back I try to eat gluten free as best I can but it can be hard. I take zyrtec every day since I developed the wheat allergy else I get hives all over head to toe even if I stay gluten free.   I’m not the most active person in the world since I do IT work and I’m on computers a lot but I do get out. A lot in summers. Winters here in NJ get cold. I do have ehlers danlos syndrome a connective tissue disorder but that has never affected my chest before just spine and knees/shoulders. I did have an mra in May of 2016 that saw no aneurysms in my chest. They look now and then even though I do NOT have the type that affects arteries. I just wait all day expecting to have a heart attack. I even shake my legs all day which I’m told is anxiety. I have tried Xanax but all it does is make me tired nothing else. Please help me.

The GI doctor says my esophagus is not the problem he said take antacids which I have tried many no help. I do not know what to do. My primary, rheumatologist and cardiologist all tell me see a shrink its anxiety/panic attacks. How can this be almost all day every day? To give an example I went to my wife’s parent’s house one day and I started getting the discomfort and shaking.   I tried walking it off but little to no help. They asked me to help move some light chairs outside all of 10 feet. I was fine during but about 5 to 10 minutes after I got the bear hug chest tightness and started panicking badly thinking I was going to die. I tried to relax to no avail. This continued till I got home and relaxed and it went away. The next day I went outside my house determined to figure this out and I started cleaning up my yard movie 35 to 50 pound blocks and other things for about 25 minutes. No pain no tightness no problems. Next morning I woke up and chest was tight but I did do heavy lifting and it didn’t feel deep. But I was home and relaxed. Other things I have noticed is I don’t care about sex as much as I did before this and I feel worn out very often. The chest discomfort feels like it’s about an inch deep right under the sternum and makes activity tiresome. I also concentrate on my heart all day.  Nothing else really runs through my head since I always feel it I can’t concentrate on anything else but solving this. I have been to the ER 3 times they said it’s likely costocondritis but I try nsaids and nothing plus it has been going on for 3 months or so now ever since that hard POUND or whatever that was. Is there a way I have a blockage and all of those tests missed it? Or am I really going insane?   Some extra notes about me. I am male, 34 and married with a 1 year old daughter. In my entire family tree only my father had heart problems. He had a heart attack at 57 but he also smoked for many years was very overweight 300 pounds or so and was a type 2 diabetic for at least 15 years. He did survive the heart attack and is fine now at 66.I have never smoked in my life. I do not drink. I was always very skinny and healthy but about 2 years ago I started gaining some weight. I am 6’3” and topped out at about 233 in December 2016. Now in April I am 220. I normally eat healthy LOTS of fruits and veggies. The occasional french-fry etc.  Since I developed a wheat allergy a few years back I try to eat gluten free as best I can but it can be hard. I take zyrtec every day since I developed the wheat allergy else I get hives all over head to toe even if I stay gluten free.   I’m not the most active person in the world since I do IT work and I’m on computers a lot but I do get out. A lot in summers. Winters here in NJ get cold. I do have ehlers danlos syndrome a connective tissue disorder but that has never affected my chest before just spine and knees/shoulders. I did have an mra in May of 2016 that saw no aneurysms in my chest. They look now and then even though I do NOT have the type that affects arteries. I just wait all day expecting to have a heart attack. I even shake my legs all day which I’m told is anxiety. I have tried Xanax but all it does is make me tired nothing else. Please help me. This is ruining my life I can not even leave the house anymore as the chest will get very tight and full panic will set in and this is not getting better just worse as time goes on."

No one could find anything wrong. I went to multiple ENT, MRI nothing. In January I had an upper endoscopy. I had eosinophilic esophagitis, gerd, small hiatal hernia and multiple erosions in the stomach that were bleeding. Never had stomach pain go figure. I was on omeprazole for about 8 days then I stopped it. I had a VERY hard pound in my chest. No idea what it was but nothing happened after. It did it again the next day and nothing. The third and last time it did it I started getting skipped heart beats after. The first few days I had likely a thousand a day. As time went on they got less and less now I maybe have 5 to 10 a day. I used to get palpitations from proton pump inhibits in the past so I try to not take them.  Anyway the first day I had them I saw a cardiologist. He gave me low dose atenolol. I took it at night and when I woke up in the morning all my chest muscles and neck muscles were very stiff in the morning. As the day went on it got better. Then over the next week or so I started getting pain in my left shoulder that shot down my arm and the left side of my chest. The more I did the worse it would get. Finally one day it was terrible I called an ambulance. They did an EKG when they arrived and said it looked good. They gave me nitro and took me to the ER. They did blood work and said I was fine. This continued on and off and then I started getting pain the center of the chest low just below the sternum. During this time I started getting severe anxiety as I started thinking I was going to die any second every day. As time went on I started getting this chest discomfort right in the center of the chest. Originally I only got the pain after a painful skipped beat. Most were fine but now and then I’d get one that felt sharp and then I’d get chest pain after. Now I just get the pain all the time palpitation or no. When I have this discomfort if I go somewhere i get extreme tightness along my entire ribcage, front, back and sides. Like someone giving me a bear hug. Sometime it feels tight down my arms and into my jaw as well. I have this every day and the discomfort almost all day. I even wake up with it. To date I have had 12 EKG’s all normal.   As one doctor put it most people would wish their EKG looked that good. I have had a lot of blood work all normal. I had an echo, halter, stress test, and nuclear stress test all normal.

The last two times I masturbated with a toy I noticed that I got really bad cramps that stopped maybe 30 mins after. Two days ago I had sex with my partner and I've been cramping on and off every since. When I checked the strings of my IUD, I felt them though one felt a little bit shorter than the other.... Is it a possibility that my IUD might have shifted?  I've had issues with cramping in the past on and off (without any sexual stimulation) but my gyno checked and sorted out that my IUD looked fine and it could just be my ovaries twinging."

The yeast treatment did work, but only for about two weeks, when after having another partner, the symptoms came back. this time the burning was more intense, and accompanied by itching...due to how busy i was with school i was unable to get tested again until the end of May...the burning and itching continued over this entire time but was very on and off (some days it was there, some days it wasnt).  When i was tested this time, yeast, BV, chlamydia, and gonnoreha were all negative..and my (family) doctor said it could just be yeast that didnt show up on the culture.
