He has a bad immune system and is older so he often has breakouts and generally always has some kinds of sores on his face. I've read multiple things about how long it can live outside of the body and cause transmission. One is that herpes cannot live on dead surfaces for more than 10 seconds, but I've also read it can live on non porous solid objects for 4-8 hours (like a faucet) and wet cloth for 2-4 hours and dry cloth for 15 minutes. Not sure what to go by and what my risk is considering it was a wet solid object and I immediately stuck my finger in my eye but it was an hour after the sink was last used. I don't want to make him feel bad about it so I don't bring it up but I'm crashing here for a little bit and when things like this occur I worry about transmission. It's not usually the first thing on my mind though so I do things like shut off the faucet and then rub my eyes thinking, 'oh, i just washed my hands so they're clean and I can clean my eyes,' and then start to worry ten minutes later realizing I didn't do the most sanitary thing and could have exposed myself to it. I do not have hsv1 or hsv2 so I do not have antibodies."

Pain Management is always part of the treatment and pain blocks. But, the last timeI had a pain block was in the year 1990. I actually got up and I should been completely anesthetic. Before that block a physician blocked from the neck down ( I was a nurse for this hospital ) one of the nurses that was helping with the block told the Dr. he was blocking me to high and he told her I am the Doctor and his block numbed me from my shoulders to my toes! That was the beginning of my life with RSD or COMPLEX REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROME! After I had my Sympathectomies I went into remission! It came back when I pulled my shoulder out of socket! I pulled out our medical bag from my SUV and it pulled me backwards, hence RSD again since 2000! It has robbed me of my identity and in place of my identity RSD has caused severe anxiety, Depression and isolation with searing pain 24 hrs a day! Some times I have wondered how I’m still here!!!!!! My conviction to the Lord is the reason I am still here and I have no respect or relationship with my only child! She blames me because I was always in pain with other issues. I still took her and her friends to where they wanted to go and picked them up when their ready to come home! I might see my grandson once every two months if there’s a holiday or something that benefits my Daughter. I just had a birthday she put it on my text and called me later. She asked me “what I wanted to do on Saturday night for my birthday “ So I sat home all day weighting for her to call and her true nature shined and she could care less that she is being hurtful!! She is such a narcissist and if it benefits her she will do whatever it takes to make it happen!!!!! Ex: It was her Birthday last month and of course she invited us to the party and as usual we had to pick up a lot for her!!!!!!! A Ice Cream cake, s’mores holders and her Birthday present! I had a knee replacement about 2 1/2 weeks ago and she didn’t visit me in the hospital or at home!!!!! I can’t take it anymore!!!!!!! All she does is play with my heart and my emotions! I am going to stop calling, texting her. It has to be done so I can live without another negative experience and her lies! Well now you know my story and history!!! GOD BLESS!!!!"

I'm thinking it might just heal in time. I think I remember Dr telling me I would have a hard time hurting the new knee."

It started when I was on a 12 hour / day project from the past two months (which just ended last week). I still have the back pain though, and it seems like it has got worse. I am a 35 year old female. I have been to a couple of physiotherapy sessions, but it didn't help at all. I am in agony, and this pain doesn't seem to subside. I can't be on painkillers all the time. I am also deficient in Vitamin D; maybe that's contributing to this as well? I have started doing some exercises as well - Hollow Body Holds, Stomach Vacuums, L-Sits etc, and it helps a bit. But I want to get rid of this pain altogether. It is very disabling. I am also going to get myself a recliner for back pain. It really is that bad. I honestly hope someone can help me out here. It's so bad that I am going for an expensive recliner for back pain now. Would fixing my Vitamin D deficiency help reduce the pain?"

I had not done that before and hoping I didn’t damage anything. My muscles are still not back to normal so I’m just a little sore. Any thoughts on whether this is an okay thing to do?

There is no pain at all if I don't apply any pressure to the thumb.  Any suggestions would be great. Thank you.

So, this injury happened on the night of a local Carols event in late November. Most of the younger population of my town go out in groups and get drunk for the Carols, see where the night takes them and whatnot, and naturally I was with them. I definitely didn't get the worst, a mate fell on his own Jack's bottle he threw on the ground and split his hand open quite badly. Later that night, I was at a friends house with a couple other mates. We decided it would be a good idea to play punchies (One for one arm punches). On my second hit, something else caught my eye as I swung and I basically stabbed his shoulder with my thumb at full power. Also, when I connected, instead of my thumb bending back like it should've, it stayed straight and drove into his shoulder like a lance. About 20 minutes later it was thrice the size, and all the little creases in your skin around the joints seemed like they were bleeding under the skin. By the next day it had lessened in swelling quite a bit and I had slight range of motion with my thumb. The next day, I had gained some more range of motion, although not much, and the swelling had mostly gone down, although it was still noticeably larger than my left thumb. I saw my GP and she said that I might have soft tissue damage in the joint at the base of the distal phalanx, and to get it X-Ray'd. I did that later that day, and they did find a fracture at the top of the proximal phalanx. The GP called me when she got her copy of the X-Ray, and said that I should see a specialist that she'd referred me to. I couldn't see that specialist because I had no money, and I was supposed to go the next day to a Medical clinic a significant distance away from me. I don't have a car to get there, and even a consultation with any specialist is more than I can afford, so I'm just dealing with it. However, what's worrying me is the way my thumb acts now. In the enclosed picture, you can see three tags on key areas: 1: The actual fracture. My thumb is no longer producing the same kind of pain as the initial weeks of recovery, so I believe this is actually healing fine. 2: This joint is the most worrying to me. I can no longer place a good amount of pressure with that thumb, and examples are the best way for me to describe this: -If I squeeze something (i.e. a cup, or a pen because I have a habit of squeezing my pen really hard when I write) hard it hurts sharply enough for me to jerk my hand back and possibly drop whatever I'm holding. -If I unscrew a lid, or something that requires constant pressure, I don't notice anything until I attempt to bend my thumb back, at which point it painfully clicks back into place. 3: This one is pretty hard to explain, even to someone in person. You know how the base bone in your thumb sorts of stays where it is when you independently bend your thumb back? Well when I bend my thumb back, the base bone moves inwards opposite the rest of my thumb. It could resemble what happens when you use a crowbar to lever something. The bone below #3 is the object being lifted, and my thumb above #3 is the crowbar lifting it. Make any sort of sense? I can also feel but *not* hear a click in the base joint when my thumb is bent fully back. Sorry again that this is so damn long, but the details are necessary to fully understand what happened. I am particularly concerned about this being permanent because it somewhat affects my ability to play guitar, and this is the last thing I need when I'm about to start my new job and start properly working with my band.

Another woman at this site reported that her rheumatologist had told her she has mild rheumatoid arthritis but is seeking a second opinion because her pain has not been ""mild"". I felt for her. I know that when a person is having pain and interference with their life it is disheartening to be told you have ""mild"" anything! It is easy to feel like people think you are a fraud or just being a big baby. When I try to work full time, I am in so much pain it is difficult to concentrate. Until the joints of my hands began to visibly swell & twist my friends, colleagues, and even my family just ignored my distress. I find myself wondering if I will ever be able to depend on my body to do what I want it to do when I want it to do it again."

No Meds beside some herbal stuff. My MD performed a nerve block injection ""test"" (which alleviates the pain for 4-5 hours).

My knee issues started roughly 1.5 years before i stopped lifting. They would hurt 1-3 days after leg days depending on how hard I worked out but would always go away. My elbows started hurting only about 2 months before i stopped lifting. My right one started bugging me and soon my left began as well a couple days later. I continued lifting for 2 months until i decided it was not leaving so I stopping in hopes of it leaving in 1-2 months. Its now been 6 months and not only have my elbows not healed but my knees are still hurting as well even though the pain would go away after workouts in the past. I have seen many different doctors. My sports medicine doctor even ordered mri’s on all 4 joints and found that there is very slight tendonitus and muscle strains on my elbows but found nothing on my knees. Both my elbows and knees get slightly irritated when rubbing against clothing. My elbows mostly hurt on the back side where the tricep connects to the elbow. It usually begins to get more irritated once i type a lot, write a lot, or pick things up. It goes away right after I stop doing that activity but lingers. My knees hurt all over and usually hurt if i stand too long or try to do light excersizes like body weight squat holds. I have been going to the physical therapist for my knee pain and have been doing the excersizes they give me but seem to be of little help and sometimes even makes them ach afterwards. Stretching and cycling on a stationary bike seem to help along with hot showers. I have gone to a chiropractor and occupational theropist for my elbows. I am currently going to a DO doctor who does massage therapy on my elbows. Nothing seems to be helping with healing. I have seen no change after the second month of rest. No doctor has been able to tell me why it is that I have not healed. I am beginning to wonder if it is some some of arthritis. I am wondering if i should go see a rheumatologist at this point. I am confused on why both my knees and elbows are in this situation at once. I limit lots of movements now and can not do the things that I like. Any workout on my legs that need me to bend my knees even a little makes then hurt a couple hours after. My elbows as well. This is also just with light weight when I was testing out to see if im doing any better. I have been taking vitamins and minerals, glucosamine, tumeric and many others. I took naproxin for 1 month in the beginning 1000 mg a day and saw only slight change. I have not gotten any cortizone injections yet and am still going to physical therapy for my knees and to massage therapy for my elbows.

I had severe back pain for weeks afterward when lying down but just thought it was probably a bad bruise, possibly a muscle strain/sprain. Fast forward to 6 months later I got checked out by a local clinic doctor because I was having weird numbness, shocking, and stabbing leg pain. They did one X-ray and prescribed a ton of various pain meds including an opioid and said to come back in 6 months. A few months after that I had a competent Doctor who requested I get an MRI and put me on a muscle relaxer to help me sleep. The MRI revealed 4 herniated discs in the lumbar section of my spine/back. Over this whole year and a half long healing process I have taken too many medications to name, and tried Physical Therapy for about 2 months with little to no improvement, and multiple issues became worse because of it. The pain gets worse off and on every week and some days my Meloxicam just doesn't cut it. My question to anyone out there is: What should I try now? Is there anything I can buy over the counter that helps with severe pain like this? All the doctors I've been to so far have told me there's nothing that can be done to fix/heal it. Should I try a different doctor?"

I had it Xray'd and the Dr. said the knee cap looks terrific (for a woman my age, I guess) and he just recommended PT. I did some exercises on my own since my insurance didn't cover PT close to my house. Things got better and I was walking like I used to until about 2 weeks ago, then it was like a dagger being plunged into my leg, just below the knee. Started exercises again, but now I feel like I have muscle fatigue. When I get up from sitting in a chair, I'm S L O W to get moving and I feel like I have to hobble like an old lady - it's awful! I want to go back to the orthopaedist who originally saw me and xray'd me, but not sure if that's where I should start. I'm losing my insurance at the end of the year and not sure if I'll be able to find something as good, so I'd like to take of as much as I can before 12/31/17. Thanks for any suggestions!"

Is it possible for the arthritis to return to an area where it was supposedly removed? I also have my lower spine fused with 6 screws in my spine. Could one of the screws have come loose?

FINDINGS: Disc desiccation. Mild intervertebral disc space narrowing L4-5 and L5-S1. There is 3 mm retrolisthesis L5 on S1. No compression deformity. Paraspinal soft tissues are grossly unremarkable. A retroverted uterus is incidentally noted. Conus medullaris is identified at the L1 vertebral body level with orderly descent of the cauda equina. L1-2: No stenosis. L2-3: No stenosis. L3-4: Shallow disc bulge. No significant stenosis. L4-5: Dorsal annular tear with broad-based disc protrusion that effaces the anterior thecal sac. No significant neural foraminal narrowing. L5-S1: Left paracentral disc protrusion likely impinges on the descending nerve roots (series 8, image 3) and measures approximately 17 x 6 mm in transverse dimension and extends 14 mm craniocaudal. Moderate neural foraminal narrowing on the right, mild on the left.

I found some water quality data on USGS showing that fluoride levels in ground water near my home were extremely high - it averaged around 7 ppm, which would result in about a 70% chance of getting skeletal fluorosis, according to this meta analysis:     I have seen my GP and an orthopedist, and none of them seemed to know what I was talking about. The orthopedist said I probably just had bursitis and referred me to a rheumatologist. Am I going to the wrong place? Who would know how to diagnose this? Thanks!"

About 2 months ago, I was working out in the gym, doing a seated shoulder press with 15 kg dumbells. The chair shifted slightly underneath me, causing me to lose my balance and my hand, with the weights in its grip and mid-air, to go behind my shoulder. It was painful. So basically MRIs revealed a posteroinferior labral tear, along with a chondral defect in the glenoid and an osteochondral lesion (yes I know what this means. I'm not rattling off the report LOL). I sat on it for a while, as per the doc's advice, doing the recommended physio. It didn't help. So I got an arthroscopic surgery done on my shoulder to fix it. During the surgery, it was found that the region between the tear and the defect on the glenoid was loose and not attached to the socket of my shoulder. That loose segment of the glenoid was cut out and the labrum was stretched over to cover that removed segment. Also, micro-fracturing was done. Now the doctor's visit during the post-op recovery leads me to my problem. During this visit, he tells me that weightlifting and all to a certain light extent is fine after around four months and for the rest of my life (when I say light, I'm speaking in my terms, e.g. a bicep curl of 50kg or a deadlift of 120kg etc) but bodyweight exercise should be severely restricted unless I want a high likelihood of early-onset arthritis. The same goes for me exceeding the weightlifting parameters I just mentioned. I'm not trying to sound impossible here or seem like I'm throwing a tantrum, being of the young age that I am, but weightlifting and other sorts of fitness, in general, are crucial to me. I can live a life without them, but not a content one. On the other hand, the huge threat of early-onset arthritis is not a pleasant thought. I was hoping someone here would have suggestions for me. P.S. 1) Please do not suggest running, that is my base level of fitness, I could do that on my deathbed. 2) I am not trying to go against my doctor's wishes or such. 3) This is not a request for encouragement or a cry for attention. I am very focused towards my recovery, and nothing will stop me from returning to the world of fitness with full force, but I need to approach that return with extreme caution. Kind regards, and thanks in advance."

During the surgery, it was found that the region between the tear and the defect on the glenoid was loose and not attached to the socket of my shoulder. That loose segment of the glenoid was cut out and the labrum was stretched over to cover that removed segment. Also, micro-fracturing was done. Now the doctor's visit during the post-op recovery leads me to my problem. During this visit, he tells me that weightlifting and all to a certain light extent is fine after around four months and for the rest of my life (when I say light, I'm speaking in my terms, e.g. a bicep curl of 50kg or a deadlift of 120kg etc) but bodyweight exercise should be severely restricted unless I want a high likelihood of early-onset arthritis. The same goes for me exceeding the weightlifting parameters I just mentioned. I'm not trying to sound impossible here or seem like I'm throwing a tantrum, being of the young age that I am, but weightlifting and other sorts of fitness, in general, are crucial to me. I can live a life without them, but not a content one. On the other hand, the huge threat of early-onset arthritis is not a pleasant thought. I was hoping someone here would have suggestions for me. P.S. 1) Please do not suggest running, that is my base level of fitness, I could do that on my deathbed. 2) I am not trying to go against my doctor's wishes or such. 3) This is not a request for encouragement or a cry for attention. I am very focused towards my recovery, and nothing will stop me from returning to the world of fitness with full force, but I need to approach that return with extreme caution. Kind regards, and thanks in advance."

Throughout my life my health has been fair, rarely got sick, except a few crazy things that are not explainable. It all started at age 20 in 2010 when I was rushed to the hospital with meningitis. After recovery no issues for a few years, then in 2012 I was back in the hospital due to a severe infection in one of the lymph nodes, located in the back of my neck (only seen in small children). After recovery just like before no issues for a few more years, then in 2015 I tripped and fell (not a big fall at all) but suffered severe bruising, and could barley walk, it turned out that I had a full tear of my gracilis tendon (not common, except in major athletes) and almost a full tear of my hamstring. The recovery went great, I was determined to get off crutches and recovered after 4 months. Then 3 months later I got sick, which turned into a really bad sinus infection, and bronchitis. From there it went downhill, first my left wrist suddenly became swollen. Went into my orthopedic surgeon and he did an injection which helped tremendously. I then started to have pain that following month in my abdomen, that couldn't be explained on imaging. So my OBGYN and a General Surgeon put me under. They ended up removing my appendix, and I also had a bad case of endometriosis causing them to remove my tubes as well. Pathology reported I had chronic inflammation of my appendix, but a month later they removed my gallbladder as well, which as well appeared to have chronic inflammation and a polyp. Since then I have suffered from inflammation all over, was finally referred to my Rheumatologist July of last year. They did an ultrasound of my hands and feet, which showed inflammation of the synovial fluid and that I had erosion. Also I have photophobia and really bad dry mouth so they did an ultrasound of my salivary glands and said I have secondary Sjrogens disease.  Tests done that were normal range RA factor, Ana, ESR, CRP Tests done that were abnormal CBC - MCHC always high, MPV always low CMP - Bun, Creatinine, AST were low every time C3 should be between 80-180/C4 should be between 10-40 My results were C3 - 38 and C4 - 11 They have tried plaquinel, methotrexate, and then pulling me off all meds. No improvement... After pulling me off all meds for a few months my doc started Humira in January. My symptoms have improved (minor) but I still have bad symptoms as far as pain, fatigue, sunlight sensitivity, acne rash, abdominal pain, and stiffness that lasts throughout the day. I have asked questions as to how they came up with the diagnosis of seronegative ra and what other diseases mimic the disease including how lupus has been ruled out, and yet have only got the run around.

The recovery went great, I was determined to get off crutches and recovered after 4 months. Then 3 months later I got sick, which turned into a really bad sinus infection, and bronchitis. From there it went downhill, first my left wrist suddenly became swollen. Went into my orthopedic surgeon and he did an injection which helped tremendously. I then started to have pain that following month in my abdomen, that couldn't be explained on imaging. So my OBGYN and a General Surgeon put me under. They ended up removing my appendix, and I also had a bad case of endometriosis causing them to remove my tubes as well. Pathology reported I had chronic inflammation of my appendix, but a month later they removed my gallbladder as well, which as well appeared to have chronic inflammation and a polyp. Since then I have suffered from inflammation all over, was finally referred to my Rheumatologist July of last year. They did an ultrasound of my hands and feet, which showed inflammation of the synovial fluid and that I had erosion. Also I have photophobia and really bad dry mouth so they did an ultrasound of my salivary glands and said I have secondary Sjrogens disease.  Tests done that were normal range RA factor, Ana, ESR, CRP Tests done that were abnormal CBC - MCHC always high, MPV always low CMP - Bun, Creatinine, AST were low every time C3 should be between 80-180/C4 should be between 10-40 My results were C3 - 38 and C4 - 11 They have tried plaquinel, methotrexate, and then pulling me off all meds.

Shortly thereafter, I developed a burning sensation on the entire bottom of both of my feet. As I have gotten tired of the pain, I have started to scrub my feet with a pedegg kind of thing after showers. The pain has moved from my entire feet to where the injuries were on the balls. My feet have been numb, but seem to no longer be numb, and I am seeing the injuries, reappear, as if they were scars. What is this and will it go away entirely? Is it related to my feet pain? I have no insurance or money to see a doctor so I'm dealing with this on my own. I'm just hoping it will go away and I can get on with my life. Right now, this pain is controlling my life.

Now it seems to have morphed into knee pain..my last treatment was 3 injections of Euflexxa 1 week apart (last was 8/8/17) I know it takes a while to work and I have noticed some improvemet, but not as much as I hoped for..Still get a painful not quite ""locking"" feeling, mostly in left knee.

For several years I have experienced recurring pain in my lower right side. When it starts to flare up, it feels like a muscle cramp that makes it hurt to breathe and move in certain directions. It does hurt when I press the area. In the past, this pain would happen randomly, perhaps once every few months. I would be sitting and try to stand and feel the tug and pain. It would typically go away within 30 minutes to an hour. Recently, I've noticed the pain takes longer to fade. January 1 of this year I went to the hospital because I couldn't lie down (pain so intense but only when I would attempt the sleeping position. Literally did not affect me at work when I would walk around etc, only pain upon sitting, standing up, bending over to tie my shoe, trying to lie down, and sometimes taking a deep breath). After two nights of trying to sleep upright on the couch, I caved and went to get it checked out. Doctors did an ultrasound of my ovaries (thinking it was a cyst) and abdominal region but did not notice anything. They sent me home and said it was not an emergency, prescribed me some pain killers and said it could be a small hernia.  I'm now having a flare up again. It started this morning after breakfast. Not sure where to go from here... has anyone else experienced anything similar?"

They started his treatment with prednisone and methotrexate. He suffered severe muscle cramps all over his body. He pulled the pin on his treatment after about 8 months because he was exhausted from lack of sleep and couldn’t handle the pain anymore. He takes magnesium and potassium supplements which don’t change a thing. He started on azathioprine and Prednisone and suffered the same side effects. What we did find in his case is that by taking the prednisone in the morning and the methotrexate or azathioprine 12 hours later the cramps seemed to reduce to tolerable level. I’m posting this to help people that may have the same problem. I know I scoured the net looking for answers and the only advise I could find was eat a banana.  Cheers

You can read my biography by clicking on my user name. In 2015 I had both hips replaced - my right in June and left in November. The surgery was successful and I have been thrilled with the results.  About 3 or 4 weeks ago I started having pain in my left hip that is just like before the surgery. I did not fall, but slipped and ""wrenched"" my left hip. The pain is more towards the groin and in my left buttocks cheek, with pain and tingling radiating down my left leg (thigh, knee, shin and even my big toe). I see my orthopedic surgeon on September 1 and my chiropractor tomorrow. My chiro will leave my hips alone but adjust the rest of my spine as I really need that. My question is: anyone have pain like this after THR? Did you need revision surgery? Thanks for any insight you can offer. Blessings, -Dave"

Sporadic pain in leg","I am a 25 year old male, quite healthy, maybe a little unfit, but no smoking or drinking. A month ago I began to feel a light, hardly noticeable tension just above my calf behind the knee. Symptoms during the day are hardly noticeable and I can exercise without any discomfort, but at night my foot and leg feel inflamed and overall just uncomfortable to the point I started taking a few ibuprofen at night. There is a sporadic sharp pain around the center of my extensor digitorum longus and a less common, but similar pain around my sartorius muscle just above the knee. During the onset of these symptoms my foot had no issues, it was just in the leg. I went in for an ultrasound to rule out blood clots, as I do sit down for many hours a day to work at my computer. But now it seems my foot is causing all the problems. I rolled my ankle really bad 3 to 4 years ago. The attached image is the area of interest, I felt a pop and it swelled up like a bubble there. My foot healed within a month or so and I haven't had any notable injuries in the area since, and there was never discomfort up until recently. On my healthy foot, if I flex and touch that area I can feel the padding of tissue (muscle?), but on my injured foot it seems the tissue is missing and I can only feel bone, this leads me to think that the tissue is torn. It has always been that way since the injury, however the doctor at the ER said nothing about it and told me my foot will heal. Is it possible my foot finally decided to give in and I'm just now beginning to feel the long-term symptoms of that injury?"

I appear to be experiencing some Ulnar Nerve compression in my left arm. Here is some background on what led up to this. I am a 33 year old Male, about a week and a half ago I was working on cutting deer meat when I cut up near the left tip of my middle finger (of the left hand) with a knife. I cleaned up the cut, applied isopropyl alcohol and Neosporin to the cut and put a bandaid on it. At the time I had no numbness or odd sensations in my hand. About 3-4 days after I took the bandage off and was noticing that I appeared to have some numbness in my hand, along with some pressure around the palm of my hand. I then started experiencing some warmthness in this hand, extending partially up my arm. When this started occuring I went to a Walk In clinic who looked at the cut and my hand and other than the cut didnt see anything abnormal. They prescribed me a 10 day supply of Amoxicillin for an antibiotic (in case there eas an infection from the cut) along with a 5 day supply of Prednisone, along with a Tetnis shot. I am not on my last day of the Prednisone course and I feel like I have much better sensation in my left hand and that my numbess is gone, however I've had compression in my Ulnar nerve for the past few days. The compression appears to be centered mostly near my elbow, either on the inner side of the Funny bone, or just above it in my upper arm. It feels like in that one spot like the never is being pinched. I have no idea if the cut to my finger in any way could have caused this, or if it's pure coincidence. I will say that I have never experienced anything similar to this before. From what I understand the Ulnar nerve covers your pinky finger and right side of the ring finger, whereas my cut was to my middle finger so I dont know how the cut to the middle finger would affect the Ulnar nerve. Is it possible that I have some inflammation from the cut that is somehow affecting this nerve? Would you expect to see this compression if you did have an infection?  I'm trying not to worry too much but at the same time I don't want to ignore the problem. Would a hand Surgeon be a good option to make an appointment with if this doesn't resolve over the next fee days or what would you recommend doing? Thank you very much for your feedback! Kevin"

After looking at my x-rays, I was also told that I had ""shallow hips"" and that they could fix the tear with surgery but more than likely it would tear again within 5 years or so and I would be in the same boat as I am now. He gave me 5 options. 1) Do nothing. 2) Cortisone shots for as long as can take them. 3) Surgery to fix the tear. 4) Acetabular osteotomy. 5) Total Hip Replacement. After questioning hip on recovery and how long it would take to be up and walking, working etc. the best option to me would be Total hip replacement. Is this what I should do? I have read comments and reviews and heard both, good and bad. I am nervous. I do have a lot of questions for the doctor and have them written down but is there any advice on other questions that I need ask?"

Nearly a year later, she has no symptoms. This is her story: In March of 2016 she woke up with a very swollen knee, warm to touch, and couldn't walk on it. Our pediatrician immediately indicated it might be arthritis, as more and more children are developing it. After a normal X-ray and blood work (rheumatoid factor: normal), our pediatrician sent us to a rheumatologist, who watched it for 2 months.  Emotionally, our daughter had aways been VERY attached to mom, but she went into a state where she would not leave my side (literally, I could not go to the store, doctor's appointments) for months without her being hysterical.  After no improvement, our daughter began 10 ml/ day of Naproxen for 5 months. Due to inflammation and fluid, her knee wouldn't go straight. We took her to physical therapy twice a week and did chiropractic work.  After allergy, blood, and stool testing our pediatrician determined that our daughter had many allergies: pollen, food (dairy and egg whites), and minor hypoglycemia. Our pediatrician attributes our daughter's JRA with Leaky Gut which more doctors are looking at the correlation to autoimmune and inflammatory issues. Our pediatrician (an MD) also uses integrative medicine like a nutritionist on staff and herbal remedies.  We were diligent about removing allergens (egg whites, dairy, pine nuts, sesame seeds) from our daughter's diet. We increased omega supplements, digestive enzymes, and probiotics. Our daughter improved through June, July, August and got slightly worse again in September, October. We reduced medicine to 5 ml/day. She improved and got more emotionally independent (less clingy to me) in Nov/Dec. Any kind of high impact activities (trampoline, gymnastics, etc.) would aggravate pain. In January our rheumatologist took our daughter off medicine but continued PT. Our Dr. predicted our daughter's knee would swell up and she would need to undergo steroid shot under sedation.  Unexpectedly, our daughter did better. An ultrasound with rheumatologist 6 weeks later determined only minor fluid still in the knee (which would not justify the cortisone shot).  Our daughter continued to improve with no medication, and she still has no pain, no swelling, and no warmth. It has been 5 months. Our rheumatologist does not believe in leaky gut nor does she believe in a significant correlation between diet and allergies. We do, based on what we have seen with our daughter's improvement. We have no know family history of JRA but my husband has ulcerative colitis (auto-immune) and many food allergies, asthma.  There is not a day that goes by where I don't watch my daughter's walk (looking for a slight limp) or feel her knee for warmth and swelling in the mornings (typical of JRA). Whatever worked, we are beyond grateful. I know each case is different but feel free to reply if anyone needs more info. I know how overwhelmed and scared I was when we got our daughter's diagnosis."

Four years ago my G/P started me on oxycodone 5 mg and ultram after a couple months he went to 10 mg than 15 up to 30 mg QR . The last 3 1/2 years I was taking 30 mg 5 times a day . In January 2017 I called for refill and I was told the practice couldn't write any scripts for controlled substance, later I found out the federal crack down on these drugs were the reason that he wasn't following proper guidelines and was suspended. So I went to a G/P I used before my insurance changed and couldn't go to him and he refused to prescribe the oxycodone at all he said I needed to go to pain management which I did , I told her the whole story and she would only offer 5 mg 4 time a day which was a waste since I was taking 30 mg 5 times a day and it helped about 75 % of the pain . I took the offer for now but right now I'm in extreme pain especially in my left shoulder , I'm due for a another knee replacement 7/11 but I won't be able to have shoulder surgery for some time after . I have xray's to show severity of joint damage and I have copy of all meds I received since 2012 that proves qty and medication I was taking . Why should I have such a problem getting the medication I need to be able to somewhat function , I only ran short once in 4 yrs and that was my last refill for 135 instead of the 150 I was getting , my fault as I would monitor the counts once a week . I understand about the abuse and this is what's causing the problem but I don't think it fair to me and people like me , is their anything I can do or anybody I can present this issue to. I'm going for knee replacement soon and I asked the Dr to please put me back up to 30 mg and she looked at me in a strange way , I have a low tolerance to pain and I know how painful this surgery going to be , thank you in advance for your helpful comments"

So I went to a G/P I used before my insurance changed and couldn't go to him and he refused to prescribe the oxycodone at all he said I needed to go to pain management which I did , I told her the whole story and she would only offer 5 mg 4 time a day which was a waste since I was taking 30 mg 5 times a day and it helped about 75 % of the pain . I took the offer for now but right now I'm in extreme pain especially in my left shoulder , I'm due for a another knee replacement 7/11 but I won't be able to have shoulder surgery for some time after . I have xray's to show severity of joint damage and I have copy of all meds I received since 2012 that proves qty and medication I was taking . Why should I have such a problem getting the medication I need to be able to somewhat function , I only ran short once in 4 yrs and that was my last refill for 135 instead of the 150 I was getting , my fault as I would monitor the counts once a week . I understand about the abuse and this is what's causing the problem but I don't think it fair to me and people like me , is their anything I can do or anybody I can present this issue to. I'm going for knee replacement soon and I asked the Dr to please put me back up to 30 mg and she looked at me in a strange way , I have a low tolerance to pain and I know how painful this surgery going to be , thank you in advance for your helpful comments"
290,C0003864,Arthritis,C0564820,Pain in left arm,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/arthritis/9125/arthritis-pain-in-left-shoulder,Arthritis Pain in Left Shoulder,"I am concerned that the cartilage in my left shoulder has deteriorated or that there are bone splinters from an unknown injury in my left shoulder. I noticed this during Zumba two years ago, when I lost full range of motion in my left shoulder. I continued to dance, but could barely move my left arm without a lot of pain. Since then, I have been taking it easy, but recently began attending Zumba at my local gym again.  * Within 5-10 minutes into the Zumba session, I begin to feel a lot of heat in my left shoulder.  * When doing a full rotation of my left shoulder, I hear a crunching or cracking sound when my arm rotates upwards over my head. None of these symptoms appear in my right arm. My concern is that I might lose my full range of motion in my left arm again, but I would like to continue to attend Zumba. Is this something I should be concerned about, or is it safe to continue to attend as long as I don't lose my range of motion again?  Note: I am a 30-year old man who was a non-professional boxer, construction worker, fisherman, and now works online. I previously weighed 400 lbs, but have been in the 200 lbs range for the last 7-years."

My right hip was replaced in Feb 1997 and my left in Oct 1999. I was a ""young"" patient, only in my 40's and wanted the best outcome. Some of this was accomplished by finding the best ""hip surgeon"" in the greater Portland Maine area. That person was suggested by the anesthesia group I worked for at that time. Brian McGrory, MD informed me at my consult that he could be the best hip surgeon in the world but he could never make me 100% (I hadn't been since birth.) and that I also had to be the best patient in the world. Needless to say, after 20 years for the right hip and almost 18 for the left I am so thrilled to hear ""minimal wear"" for the liners and all else still perfect. For those who are afraid or uncertain, first find the best surgeon. Remember that pain should be your determining factor. When you can't stand the pain you will have the surgery so finding the best surgeon ahead of time is key. The types of surgery today are so different from 20 years ago. Much less recovery time and to be able to live life without pain is incredible. Please remember to be honest with your surgeon. I wish you all the very best outcomes."

(It cracks so much I've genuinely been asked if I just broke my neck) - In general, my knuckles, knees, elbows, shoulders, etc. are very stiff and will sometimes have dull pain until I manage to crack them  - Stiff and tense back  *Keep in mind, all of these issues are pretty minor and unfortunately normal for many of the people at my school due to backpacks and sitting at computers, etc.* In the past year I've been getting really strange sensations in both my wrists. Whether I'm lifting something really heavy or even going to high five someone, sometimes I'll feel this almost popping/snapping sensation (but unlike cracking ones knuckles purposefully) in my wrist and suddenly a strange pain will branch out up my hand. It almost feels as though I can feel the pain branching out from nerve to nerve. Then my hand and wrist will tingle/have pins and needles for a bit until I get normal feeling back. It doesn't happen every time I move my wrists but when it does it is an extremely strange feeling.

(It cracks so much I've genuinely been asked if I just broke my neck) - In general, my knuckles, knees, elbows, shoulders, etc. are very stiff and will sometimes have dull pain until I manage to crack them  - Stiff and tense back  *Keep in mind, all of these issues are pretty minor and unfortunately normal for many of the people at my school due to backpacks and sitting at computers, etc.* In the past year I've been getting really strange sensations in both my wrists. Whether I'm lifting something really heavy or even going to high five someone, sometimes I'll feel this almost popping/snapping sensation (but unlike cracking ones knuckles purposefully) in my wrist and suddenly a strange pain will branch out up my hand. It almost feels as though I can feel the pain branching out from nerve to nerve. Then my hand and wrist will tingle/have pins and needles for a bit until I get normal feeling back. It doesn't happen every time I move my wrists but when it does it is an extremely strange feeling. Non-professionals have told me it may be carpal tunnel or a pinched nerve, but I'd like a second opinion before I decide whether to get it checked out.

I've had a lot of problems with my feet. I have an excellent podiatrist. He removed a bone spur on top of my great toe that then caused a bunion, and I still have quite a bit of pain in the entire joint. He recommends a fusion of the big toe joint with plates and screws, but won't that mean I can't move my big toe for the rest of my life? Also, I've heard patients report having a lot of pain from the plates and screws in cold weather. Has anyone had this surgery and, if so, are you glad you did?

I was born May 14th, 1990. I came into this world in the most horrific agony you could ever imagine. You see, when my mother was in labor, I was trapped, hooked around her pelvic bone and the cord was around my neck multiple times. They lost my heart beat, and at the time, the doctor did what he knew. He reached in and dislocated my right shoulder, prying me out, and then performing CPR. By some miracle I lived, but I couldn’t use my arm, and I screamed for months. The only thing in this bright world I knew was pain, from the very moment I came into it.  Eventually, through persistent physical therapy, I regained use of my right arm, though I was never able to straighten the elbow out. I was diagnosed with erb’s palsy as a result of being born with true shoulder dystocia, and thus my life began. My toddler years were unfortunate. I showed excessive clumsiness my entire life, though there was no idea why until I was an adult. I was relatively healthy and happy for many years, showing promising intelligence despite beginning my time in this world dead. These few, precious years, I will know as the only time in my life I was not in agony. Shortly after turning 10, I was in a bicycle accident that changed everything about me. I was always slightly off, but the accident introduced me once more to my first moments in the world. I flipped the bike going very fast down a hill. I remember the pavement coming up towards my head as my feet went straight up. I blacked out, and woke a few minutes later a good 10 feet from where I impacted, with my neck and upper back in the worst pain I had ever known. Being young and indestructible, my family didn’t think much of it, as I went back to playing not 2 hours later. Little could anyone predict that this was the accident that started it all. Suddenly, I began having these horrible pains in my back, spontaneously. I began suffering from migraines and almost daily headaches. Doctors simply gave me a few ibuprofen and sent me on my way. A few months down the road, while my mother was in the hospital with sepsis after having my brother, I was at the roller skating rink with my girl scout troop. I was having fun and participating in games, when I did the splits to show off. I’ve always been unusually flexible, so I wanted to impress my friends. I was rushed to the emergency room by my father after I started screaming and crying after doing it. In the E.R. I learned I had torn all of the ligaments around my kneecap and was put in a leg brace for nearly six months. My elementary school, being full of adults who didn’t know kids could be in pain, wouldn’t let me use the elevator, so I had to learn how to climb stairs in a leg brace.  Someday, my leg healed and I was back to being a kid again, with the exception of chronic back pain and now, occasional knee pain. When I was 16 I was diagnosed with arthritis in my knee, and sent to a chiropractor for my back, but it wasn’t helping. I began hurting more and more as the days turned to months and the months to years and no doctors cared. Eventually I was taking over 1800 mg of ibuprofen a day and my activity dropped substantially. My ankles began dislocating partially almost daily, and my knees both began suffering. I started twisting my good knee often, and falling down more and more. Still no one helped me. When I was 22 I had another accident. This one I refer to as the catalyst, because it threw my entire life into disarray. I was a groomer, and I loved my work. One day I was grooming a rather large australian shepherd, and went to lift him. When I did, I heard a loud pop in my right shoulder. I braced for the pain, but when it didn’t come, I felt relieved.  The next day I was unable to use my arm at all. It hurt so bad, and it felt hot to the touch. I saw an orthopedic doctor who told me to just not use it and wait a few months. I waited. Again I saw him and he put me in physical therapy. I went and within 10 minutes the physical therapist called my orthopedist and told him there was something structurally wrong, and I was being physically blocked by something because he could not move my arm. Half a year after my accident, they did a surgery on my shoulder. I had multiple bone spurs, one shaped like a hook that was cutting the muscle with every movement, and my collarbone had fractured and been held in place by the amount of swelling I had. When they opened my arm up, the collarbone was almost powder. They shaved it off and rotated my bursa, which was also inflamed. Then it was back to PT for another 6 months. My pain became intolerable, my right shoulder muscles atrophied, my left shoulder started to hurt, and all of the pain I’d had before was now even worse. I was suffering. Some time later I started fighting. I went to doctor after doctor after doctor searching for answers. I changed jobs, finding one I could do without using my arms too much. One where I could sit, because my back and my knees hurt so bad. I went to every doctor and did every test and every stupid procedure and holistic treatment they threw at me from meditation and acupuncture to neck injections. Eventually I found a few doctors who all had a small piece of the puzzle that were the answers to my problems. MRIs that showed nothing, labs, xrays, nerve conduction tests, all came up normal. Somehow, though, I was diagnosed with dystonia, fibromyalgia, and facet joint syndrome. Do you know what they did for treatments? Muscle relaxers, some nerve blocks, a few epidurals, almost an entire year of steroids (which gave me diabetes, thank you), and nerve ablation. Do you know what has worked? Nothing. After the nerve ablation I’m in even worse pain and now I struggle to use my hands. My neck is in more agony than my shoulders, which still also hurt, and my upper back is in so much pain I can barely stand it. My knees and my ankles dislocate almost daily, and I’m unable to do anything anymore. I can barely hold a fork. I’m now on actual pain medicine, thanks to my ablation, but they’re already trying to take that away, altering it to now be oxy and ibuprofen, putting more emphasis on going on ibuprofen, which has never helped ever since I was a child. I’ve been flagged by some as a drug seeker, an addict by others, and a hypochondriac by some more. “You’re too young to hurt so much” I hear. Yeah, I am, and yet here we are. I discovered a disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which would explain so much of my problems, including the famous clumsiness, but yet I cannot find a single doctor in over 300 miles to test me.  I have racked up over $80,000 in medical debt just trying to survive. I’ve been denied any actual procedures that could help, and no one will treat my pain properly. I’ve been suffering for almost my entire life, however short it’s been, and not one person has actually helped me. My pain specialist in Omaha, over 200 miles away, has been the only one to keep trying after every failure. He’s the only one who seems to genuinely believe me. The others have all given up after one or two attempts. I’ve had neurosurgeons and pain specialists and oncologists and rheumatologists and orthopedic surgeons and therapists and psychologists and even a stem cell doctor all shrug me off as either an addict or a lost cause, or my favorite, blaming my weight. (I weighed 98 pounds until I was 14, I was in pain long before I was heavy.) I keep grasping at every possible lead on someone who could do something. Someone who could help me, in any way. I don’t want to be on pain medicine, I don’t. I hate being drugged. I hate the feeling. Please believe me when I say I’ll try anything at all to feel better, yet the medicine is the only thing that makes me able to function so I can keep fighting to find someone who could possibly know how to help me. This has been my entire life for so long, an endless cycle of pain and hurting and doctors and helplessness and hopelessness and desperation for someone to help. I am going to be 28 in a month. I’m not even halfway through this life. There are millions of doctors and specialists in this world. Someone, surely, has the answers I need and the ability to fix me. Is it so much to ask to be able to go through the day without hurting? Is it so much to ask for someone to help? I have so much I want to do. I want to study radiology. I want to have children. I want to be someone more than just a pain sufferer. My body just hurts so much.  I’m hoping someone will read this story and find it in them to help me. I know someone out there has to have answers, or ideas, or options. Please help me, I have so much life I want to live."

Somehow, though, I was diagnosed with dystonia, fibromyalgia, and facet joint syndrome. Do you know what they did for treatments? Muscle relaxers, some nerve blocks, a few epidurals, almost an entire year of steroids (which gave me diabetes, thank you), and nerve ablation. Do you know what has worked? Nothing. After the nerve ablation I’m in even worse pain and now I struggle to use my hands. My neck is in more agony than my shoulders, which still also hurt, and my upper back is in so much pain I can barely stand it. My knees and my ankles dislocate almost daily, and I’m unable to do anything anymore. I can barely hold a fork. I’m now on actual pain medicine, thanks to my ablation, but they’re already trying to take that away, altering it to now be oxy and ibuprofen, putting more emphasis on going on ibuprofen, which has never helped ever since I was a child. I’ve been flagged by some as a drug seeker, an addict by others, and a hypochondriac by some more. “You’re too young to hurt so much” I hear. Yeah, I am, and yet here we are. I discovered a disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which would explain so much of my problems, including the famous clumsiness, but yet I cannot find a single doctor in over 300 miles to test me.  I have racked up over $80,000 in medical debt just trying to survive. I’ve been denied any actual procedures that could help, and no one will treat my pain properly. I’ve been suffering for almost my entire life, however short it’s been, and not one person has actually helped me. My pain specialist in Omaha, over 200 miles away, has been the only one to keep trying after every failure. He’s the only one who seems to genuinely believe me. The others have all given up after one or two attempts. I’ve had neurosurgeons and pain specialists and oncologists and rheumatologists and orthopedic surgeons and therapists and psychologists and even a stem cell doctor all shrug me off as either an addict or a lost cause, or my favorite, blaming my weight. (I weighed 98 pounds until I was 14, I was in pain long before I was heavy.) I keep grasping at every possible lead on someone who could do something. Someone who could help me, in any way. I don’t want to be on pain medicine, I don’t. I hate being drugged. I hate the feeling. Please believe me when I say I’ll try anything at all to feel better, yet the medicine is the only thing that makes me able to function so I can keep fighting to find someone who could possibly know how to help me. This has been my entire life for so long, an endless cycle of pain and hurting and doctors and helplessness and hopelessness and desperation for someone to help. I am going to be 28 in a month. I’m not even halfway through this life. There are millions of doctors and specialists in this world. Someone, surely, has the answers I need and the ability to fix me. Is it so much to ask to be able to go through the day without hurting? Is it so much to ask for someone to help? I have so much I want to do. I want to study radiology. I want to have children. I want to be someone more than just a pain sufferer. My body just hurts so much.  I’m hoping someone will read this story and find it in them to help me.

I was born May 14th, 1990. I came into this world in the most horrific agony you could ever imagine. You see, when my mother was in labor, I was trapped, hooked around her pelvic bone and the cord was around my neck multiple times. They lost my heart beat, and at the time, the doctor did what he knew. He reached in and dislocated my right shoulder, prying me out, and then performing CPR. By some miracle I lived, but I couldn’t use my arm, and I screamed for months. The only thing in this bright world I knew was pain, from the very moment I came into it.  Eventually, through persistent physical therapy, I regained use of my right arm, though I was never able to straighten the elbow out. I was diagnosed with erb’s palsy as a result of being born with true shoulder dystocia, and thus my life began. My toddler years were unfortunate. I showed excessive clumsiness my entire life, though there was no idea why until I was an adult. I was relatively healthy and happy for many years, showing promising intelligence despite beginning my time in this world dead. These few, precious years, I will know as the only time in my life I was not in agony. Shortly after turning 10, I was in a bicycle accident that changed everything about me. I was always slightly off, but the accident introduced me once more to my first moments in the world. I flipped the bike going very fast down a hill. I remember the pavement coming up towards my head as my feet went straight up. I blacked out, and woke a few minutes later a good 10 feet from where I impacted, with my neck and upper back in the worst pain I had ever known. Being young and indestructible, my family didn’t think much of it, as I went back to playing not 2 hours later. Little could anyone predict that this was the accident that started it all. Suddenly, I began having these horrible pains in my back, spontaneously. I began suffering from migraines and almost daily headaches. Doctors simply gave me a few ibuprofen and sent me on my way. A few months down the road, while my mother was in the hospital with sepsis after having my brother, I was at the roller skating rink with my girl scout troop. I was having fun and participating in games, when I did the splits to show off. I’ve always been unusually flexible, so I wanted to impress my friends. I was rushed to the emergency room by my father after I started screaming and crying after doing it. In the E.R. I learned I had torn all of the ligaments around my kneecap and was put in a leg brace for nearly six months. My elementary school, being full of adults who didn’t know kids could be in pain, wouldn’t let me use the elevator, so I had to learn how to climb stairs in a leg brace.  Someday, my leg healed and I was back to being a kid again, with the exception of chronic back pain and now, occasional knee pain. When I was 16 I was diagnosed with arthritis in my knee, and sent to a chiropractor for my back, but it wasn’t helping. I began hurting more and more as the days turned to months and the months to years and no doctors cared. Eventually I was taking over 1800 mg of ibuprofen a day and my activity dropped substantially. My ankles began dislocating partially almost daily, and my knees both began suffering. I started twisting my good knee often, and falling down more and more. Still no one helped me. When I was 22 I had another accident. This one I refer to as the catalyst, because it threw my entire life into disarray. I was a groomer, and I loved my work. One day I was grooming a rather large australian shepherd, and went to lift him. When I did, I heard a loud pop in my right shoulder. I braced for the pain, but when it didn’t come, I felt relieved.  The next day I was unable to use my arm at all. It hurt so bad, and it felt hot to the touch. I saw an orthopedic doctor who told me to just not use it and wait a few months. I waited. Again I saw him and he put me in physical therapy. I went and within 10 minutes the physical therapist called my orthopedist and told him there was something structurally wrong, and I was being physically blocked by something because he could not move my arm. Half a year after my accident, they did a surgery on my shoulder. I had multiple bone spurs, one shaped like a hook that was cutting the muscle with every movement, and my collarbone had fractured and been held in place by the amount of swelling I had. When they opened my arm up, the collarbone was almost powder. They shaved it off and rotated my bursa, which was also inflamed. Then it was back to PT for another 6 months. My pain became intolerable, my right shoulder muscles atrophied, my left shoulder started to hurt, and all of the pain I’d had before was now even worse. I was suffering. Some time later I started fighting. I went to doctor after doctor after doctor searching for answers. I changed jobs, finding one I could do without using my arms too much. One where I could sit, because my back and my knees hurt so bad. I went to every doctor and did every test and every stupid procedure and holistic treatment they threw at me from meditation and acupuncture to neck injections. Eventually I found a few doctors who all had a small piece of the puzzle that were the answers to my problems. MRIs that showed nothing, labs, xrays, nerve conduction tests, all came up normal.

You see, when my mother was in labor, I was trapped, hooked around her pelvic bone and the cord was around my neck multiple times. They lost my heart beat, and at the time, the doctor did what he knew. He reached in and dislocated my right shoulder, prying me out, and then performing CPR. By some miracle I lived, but I couldn’t use my arm, and I screamed for months. The only thing in this bright world I knew was pain, from the very moment I came into it.  Eventually, through persistent physical therapy, I regained use of my right arm, though I was never able to straighten the elbow out. I was diagnosed with erb’s palsy as a result of being born with true shoulder dystocia, and thus my life began. My toddler years were unfortunate. I showed excessive clumsiness my entire life, though there was no idea why until I was an adult. I was relatively healthy and happy for many years, showing promising intelligence despite beginning my time in this world dead. These few, precious years, I will know as the only time in my life I was not in agony. Shortly after turning 10, I was in a bicycle accident that changed everything about me. I was always slightly off, but the accident introduced me once more to my first moments in the world. I flipped the bike going very fast down a hill. I remember the pavement coming up towards my head as my feet went straight up. I blacked out, and woke a few minutes later a good 10 feet from where I impacted, with my neck and upper back in the worst pain I had ever known. Being young and indestructible, my family didn’t think much of it, as I went back to playing not 2 hours later. Little could anyone predict that this was the accident that started it all. Suddenly, I began having these horrible pains in my back, spontaneously. I began suffering from migraines and almost daily headaches. Doctors simply gave me a few ibuprofen and sent me on my way. A few months down the road, while my mother was in the hospital with sepsis after having my brother, I was at the roller skating rink with my girl scout troop. I was having fun and participating in games, when I did the splits to show off. I’ve always been unusually flexible, so I wanted to impress my friends. I was rushed to the emergency room by my father after I started screaming and crying after doing it. In the E.R. I learned I had torn all of the ligaments around my kneecap and was put in a leg brace for nearly six months. My elementary school, being full of adults who didn’t know kids could be in pain, wouldn’t let me use the elevator, so I had to learn how to climb stairs in a leg brace.  Someday, my leg healed and I was back to being a kid again, with the exception of chronic back pain and now, occasional knee pain. When I was 16 I was diagnosed with arthritis in my knee, and sent to a chiropractor for my back, but it wasn’t helping. I began hurting more and more as the days turned to months and the months to years and no doctors cared. Eventually I was taking over 1800 mg of ibuprofen a day and my activity dropped substantially. My ankles began dislocating partially almost daily, and my knees both began suffering. I started twisting my good knee often, and falling down more and more. Still no one helped me. When I was 22 I had another accident. This one I refer to as the catalyst, because it threw my entire life into disarray. I was a groomer, and I loved my work. One day I was grooming a rather large australian shepherd, and went to lift him. When I did, I heard a loud pop in my right shoulder. I braced for the pain, but when it didn’t come, I felt relieved.  The next day I was unable to use my arm at all. It hurt so bad, and it felt hot to the touch. I saw an orthopedic doctor who told me to just not use it and wait a few months. I waited. Again I saw him and he put me in physical therapy. I went and within 10 minutes the physical therapist called my orthopedist and told him there was something structurally wrong, and I was being physically blocked by something because he could not move my arm. Half a year after my accident, they did a surgery on my shoulder. I had multiple bone spurs, one shaped like a hook that was cutting the muscle with every movement, and my collarbone had fractured and been held in place by the amount of swelling I had. When they opened my arm up, the collarbone was almost powder. They shaved it off and rotated my bursa, which was also inflamed. Then it was back to PT for another 6 months. My pain became intolerable, my right shoulder muscles atrophied, my left shoulder started to hurt, and all of the pain I’d had before was now even worse. I was suffering. Some time later I started fighting. I went to doctor after doctor after doctor searching for answers. I changed jobs, finding one I could do without using my arms too much. One where I could sit, because my back and my knees hurt so bad. I went to every doctor and did every test and every stupid procedure and holistic treatment they threw at me from meditation and acupuncture to neck injections. Eventually I found a few doctors who all had a small piece of the puzzle that were the answers to my problems. MRIs that showed nothing, labs, xrays, nerve conduction tests, all came up normal. Somehow, though, I was diagnosed with dystonia, fibromyalgia, and facet joint syndrome. Do you know what they did for treatments? Muscle relaxers, some nerve blocks, a few epidurals, almost an entire year of steroids (which gave me diabetes, thank you), and nerve ablation. Do you know what has worked? Nothing. After the nerve ablation I’m in even worse pain and now I struggle to use my hands. My neck is in more agony than my shoulders, which still also hurt, and my upper back is in so much pain I can barely stand it. My knees and my ankles dislocate almost daily, and I’m unable to do anything anymore. I can barely hold a fork. I’m now on actual pain medicine, thanks to my ablation, but they’re already trying to take that away, altering it to now be oxy and ibuprofen, putting more emphasis on going on ibuprofen, which has never helped ever since I was a child. I’ve been flagged by some as a drug seeker, an addict by others, and a hypochondriac by some more. “You’re too young to hurt so much” I hear. Yeah, I am, and yet here we are. I discovered a disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which would explain so much of my problems, including the famous clumsiness, but yet I cannot find a single doctor in over 300 miles to test me.  I have racked up over $80,000 in medical debt just trying to survive. I’ve been denied any actual procedures that could help, and no one will treat my pain properly. I’ve been suffering for almost my entire life, however short it’s been, and not one person has actually helped me. My pain specialist in Omaha, over 200 miles away, has been the only one to keep trying after every failure. He’s the only one who seems to genuinely believe me. The others have all given up after one or two attempts. I’ve had neurosurgeons and pain specialists and oncologists and rheumatologists and orthopedic surgeons and therapists and psychologists and even a stem cell doctor all shrug me off as either an addict or a lost cause, or my favorite, blaming my weight. (I weighed 98 pounds until I was 14, I was in pain long before I was heavy.) I keep grasping at every possible lead on someone who could do something. Someone who could help me, in any way. I don’t want to be on pain medicine, I don’t. I hate being drugged. I hate the feeling. Please believe me when I say I’ll try anything at all to feel better, yet the medicine is the only thing that makes me able to function so I can keep fighting to find someone who could possibly know how to help me. This has been my entire life for so long, an endless cycle of pain and hurting and doctors and helplessness and hopelessness and desperation for someone to help. I am going to be 28 in a month. I’m not even halfway through this life. There are millions of doctors and specialists in this world. Someone, surely, has the answers I need and the ability to fix me. Is it so much to ask to be able to go through the day without hurting? Is it so much to ask for someone to help? I have so much I want to do. I want to study radiology. I want to have children. I want to be someone more than just a pain sufferer. My body just hurts so much.  I’m hoping someone will read this story and find it in them to help me. I know someone out there has to have answers, or ideas, or options. Please help me, I have so much life I want to live."

I went and within 10 minutes the physical therapist called my orthopedist and told him there was something structurally wrong, and I was being physically blocked by something because he could not move my arm. Half a year after my accident, they did a surgery on my shoulder. I had multiple bone spurs, one shaped like a hook that was cutting the muscle with every movement, and my collarbone had fractured and been held in place by the amount of swelling I had. When they opened my arm up, the collarbone was almost powder. They shaved it off and rotated my bursa, which was also inflamed. Then it was back to PT for another 6 months. My pain became intolerable, my right shoulder muscles atrophied, my left shoulder started to hurt, and all of the pain I’d had before was now even worse. I was suffering. Some time later I started fighting. I went to doctor after doctor after doctor searching for answers. I changed jobs, finding one I could do without using my arms too much. One where I could sit, because my back and my knees hurt so bad. I went to every doctor and did every test and every stupid procedure and holistic treatment they threw at me from meditation and acupuncture to neck injections. Eventually I found a few doctors who all had a small piece of the puzzle that were the answers to my problems. MRIs that showed nothing, labs, xrays, nerve conduction tests, all came up normal. Somehow, though, I was diagnosed with dystonia, fibromyalgia, and facet joint syndrome. Do you know what they did for treatments? Muscle relaxers, some nerve blocks, a few epidurals, almost an entire year of steroids (which gave me diabetes, thank you), and nerve ablation. Do you know what has worked? Nothing. After the nerve ablation I’m in even worse pain and now I struggle to use my hands. My neck is in more agony than my shoulders, which still also hurt, and my upper back is in so much pain I can barely stand it. My knees and my ankles dislocate almost daily, and I’m unable to do anything anymore. I can barely hold a fork. I’m now on actual pain medicine, thanks to my ablation, but they’re already trying to take that away, altering it to now be oxy and ibuprofen, putting more emphasis on going on ibuprofen, which has never helped ever since I was a child. I’ve been flagged by some as a drug seeker, an addict by others, and a hypochondriac by some more. “You’re too young to hurt so much” I hear. Yeah, I am, and yet here we are. I discovered a disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which would explain so much of my problems, including the famous clumsiness, but yet I cannot find a single doctor in over 300 miles to test me.  I have racked up over $80,000 in medical debt just trying to survive. I’ve been denied any actual procedures that could help, and no one will treat my pain properly. I’ve been suffering for almost my entire life, however short it’s been, and not one person has actually helped me. My pain specialist in Omaha, over 200 miles away, has been the only one to keep trying after every failure. He’s the only one who seems to genuinely believe me. The others have all given up after one or two attempts. I’ve had neurosurgeons and pain specialists and oncologists and rheumatologists and orthopedic surgeons and therapists and psychologists and even a stem cell doctor all shrug me off as either an addict or a lost cause, or my favorite, blaming my weight. (I weighed 98 pounds until I was 14, I was in pain long before I was heavy.) I keep grasping at every possible lead on someone who could do something. Someone who could help me, in any way. I don’t want to be on pain medicine, I don’t. I hate being drugged. I hate the feeling. Please believe me when I say I’ll try anything at all to feel better, yet the medicine is the only thing that makes me able to function so I can keep fighting to find someone who could possibly know how to help me. This has been my entire life for so long, an endless cycle of pain and hurting and doctors and helplessness and hopelessness and desperation for someone to help. I am going to be 28 in a month. I’m not even halfway through this life. There are millions of doctors and specialists in this world. Someone, surely, has the answers I need and the ability to fix me. Is it so much to ask to be able to go through the day without hurting? Is it so much to ask for someone to help? I have so much I want to do. I want to study radiology. I want to have children. I want to be someone more than just a pain sufferer. My body just hurts so much.  I’m hoping someone will read this story and find it in them to help me. I know someone out there has to have answers, or ideas, or options. Please help me, I have so much life I want to live."

I was born May 14th, 1990. I came into this world in the most horrific agony you could ever imagine. You see, when my mother was in labor, I was trapped, hooked around her pelvic bone and the cord was around my neck multiple times. They lost my heart beat, and at the time, the doctor did what he knew. He reached in and dislocated my right shoulder, prying me out, and then performing CPR. By some miracle I lived, but I couldn’t use my arm, and I screamed for months. The only thing in this bright world I knew was pain, from the very moment I came into it.  Eventually, through persistent physical therapy, I regained use of my right arm, though I was never able to straighten the elbow out. I was diagnosed with erb’s palsy as a result of being born with true shoulder dystocia, and thus my life began. My toddler years were unfortunate. I showed excessive clumsiness my entire life, though there was no idea why until I was an adult. I was relatively healthy and happy for many years, showing promising intelligence despite beginning my time in this world dead. These few, precious years, I will know as the only time in my life I was not in agony. Shortly after turning 10, I was in a bicycle accident that changed everything about me. I was always slightly off, but the accident introduced me once more to my first moments in the world. I flipped the bike going very fast down a hill. I remember the pavement coming up towards my head as my feet went straight up. I blacked out, and woke a few minutes later a good 10 feet from where I impacted, with my neck and upper back in the worst pain I had ever known. Being young and indestructible, my family didn’t think much of it, as I went back to playing not 2 hours later. Little could anyone predict that this was the accident that started it all. Suddenly, I began having these horrible pains in my back, spontaneously. I began suffering from migraines and almost daily headaches. Doctors simply gave me a few ibuprofen and sent me on my way. A few months down the road, while my mother was in the hospital with sepsis after having my brother, I was at the roller skating rink with my girl scout troop. I was having fun and participating in games, when I did the splits to show off. I’ve always been unusually flexible, so I wanted to impress my friends. I was rushed to the emergency room by my father after I started screaming and crying after doing it. In the E.R. I learned I had torn all of the ligaments around my kneecap and was put in a leg brace for nearly six months. My elementary school, being full of adults who didn’t know kids could be in pain, wouldn’t let me use the elevator, so I had to learn how to climb stairs in a leg brace.  Someday, my leg healed and I was back to being a kid again, with the exception of chronic back pain and now, occasional knee pain. When I was 16 I was diagnosed with arthritis in my knee, and sent to a chiropractor for my back, but it wasn’t helping. I began hurting more and more as the days turned to months and the months to years and no doctors cared. Eventually I was taking over 1800 mg of ibuprofen a day and my activity dropped substantially. My ankles began dislocating partially almost daily, and my knees both began suffering. I started twisting my good knee often, and falling down more and more. Still no one helped me. When I was 22 I had another accident. This one I refer to as the catalyst, because it threw my entire life into disarray. I was a groomer, and I loved my work. One day I was grooming a rather large australian shepherd, and went to lift him. When I did, I heard a loud pop in my right shoulder. I braced for the pain, but when it didn’t come, I felt relieved.  The next day I was unable to use my arm at all. It hurt so bad, and it felt hot to the touch. I saw an orthopedic doctor who told me to just not use it and wait a few months. I waited.

You should seek opinion from another specialist."" This troubles me immensely and I don't understand why I have such a burning desire for their cognizance. Why is their clear understanding and acknowledgment of this crippling disease almost robbing me of my ability to seek solace in the support and comfort offered by others in my life of equal value?

Before the surgery I was in immense pain and could not walk.  Since the surgery I have had numbness in my left foot and leg where the sciatic pain was. Is it normal for the numbness to remain?  My ankle is also slightly swollen, is that normal? More recently I have had numbness and swelling in my left arm and an MRI found that I had moderate right paracentral disc profusion at T2/3 but no neural compression, and a disc bulge at C3/4 with narrowing of the exit foramina.  The neurologist said there is no need for surgery but the numbness and swelling is persisting. How can I manage this?  I am worried this will all get worse in the future.  Thanks in advance!"

I started OT and did all of my exercises as I was told to and was eventually discharged, but months later the pain has yet to go away and is at the same intensity that it was when it started last year.

I just joined, and this is my first post because I've seen to have been getting nothing but dismissive responsive for every doctor I've seen regarding this issue, and it's a very crippling issue to endure - I basically can not function normally throughout any given day due to this strange, scary pain that occurs on my left side neck/shoulder, in the ""pocket"" space where your neck and shoulder meet. I've been experiencing this pain since September of 2017, and have been dealing with it for about a year now, obviously. The pain is triggered by any one of these certain events, and those events are as follows: increased heart rate, heavy breathing, heightened pulse, use of left arm when lifting something heavy, deep breath all the way in, heightened blood pressure (like when entering a hot shower), having sex, especially as I reach closer to orgasm, and a few other events that I can't quite think of at the moment. The pain can be described as a ""pulse"" pain, that occurs WITH my pulse, as if a vein, nerve, or blood vessel is being compressed, and it's a strange, sharp, stinging pain that I can't quite describe other than what it might feel like to have your pulse hurt. The pain itself is about a 7 out of 10, but it's a 10/10 in its crippling effect; after it happens, I continue to have anxiety about it for pretty much the remainder of the day, and general anxiety about it even when it doesn't happen because I know it will happen when I do any of the things that trigger it. Since December of 2018, I've basically been regulating my heart rate and breathing so that I don't feel the pain - it only occurs for a few seconds, but my GOD is it crippling. Regulating my breathing and actions include things like resting at every landing after climbing stairs so that I don't exert too much energy, holding my breath when bending over to pick up something, or limiting my breath capacity allllll day, so that I never inhale too much air, which potentially triggers the pain, either because of lung expansion, or heart rate increase - I'm not sure which. Another thing, which may be unrelated, is that the same region where the pain occurs seems swollen or bigger than the other side, but I'm right handing and typically do everything with my right hand and right side, so there's no real reason why the muscle should be bigger on the left side than on my right. I've had CT scans, MRIs, XRays, and carotid Doppler, and nothing has been found yet. I've even had massages and chiropractic work - the chiropractic work seemed to cure it completely for about a week, then it came back again in full force. Another thing that may be related is that when I breathe very deeply, or when I'm reeaaalllyyy full from eating, there's a slight pain in my shoulder, somewhat near the area where I experience this pain, but it's not the same kind of pain. Feels like maybe a nerve is being pressed or something along those lines, which can only be associated with the fact that my stomach is very full, thus pushing other organs up and around etc, ultimately causing something up there to be pressed - like I said, I'm not sure if it's related.

Before I continue, I'd like to hear some responses as to what you all might thing it is, and also what kind of specialist might I need to see to find out what it is, and what kind of tests should I seek, etc Age: 30 years old Height: 5'10"" Weight: 188lbs I'll continue to provide as much information as I can to anyone who asks, and I certainly appreciate the help of the WebMD community.

He is 66 years old and of Indian ethnicity. He had high uric acid level (of 8.5) six months back and he couldn't move right hand's fingers in his hand, they were very stiff and turning black in colour. Doctor adviced him to take Zyloric tablet after which uric acid got under control (at 5.2). He is also a dibatic and BP patient since few years. Few months back his doctor asked him to stop Zyloric. Within few days he started having severe pain in his right hand's wrist (earlier it was just fingers). His uric acid level went up very high (over 9) and after that his doctor asked him to start Zyloric again. But the wrist pain never went away, he still suffers from pain in his right wrist. Is there anything to worry about side effects from long term use of Zyloric? Can anyone please recommend a good Rheumatologist in Hyderabad we could consult with? Please advice. Thanks in advance. Regards, Riya."

I'm hoping someone can help me figure out these mystery symptoms I've been having. I've been to see 5 doctors (now seeing a rheumatologist & awaiting more bloodwork results), and they all seem to be stumped. So far, rheumatoid, Lyme, CRP, ANA, sed rate, TSH, & CBC have all been normal.  Beginning about 4 months ago, I began having intermittent aching pains over the first bone in my R foot and some pain in my R elbow when lifting heavy objects. Then, suddenly a month ago, all the joints on the right side of my body began hurting (incl foot, ankle, knee, wrist, elbow, & shoulder). Over the past few weeks, more and more joints have become involved, including the first knuckle of a few fingers...and it's slowly starting on my left side too, although the vast majority are still on the right side. I'm currently having up to 40 episodes of pain per day. I have NO swelling, warmth, burning, numbness, tingling, rash, etc. Basically no other symptoms. The weirdest part is that they're usually very fleeting and migrating pains, most lasting only a few seconds to a minute or two. Occasionally, something may hurt for hours though. The pains range anywhere from 2/10 to 7/10. Ibuprofen does nothing to help.  Anyone have any thoughts?"

I called my doctor again to make another appointment for the same chest pain, he told me that with the meds I’m on I could very well have a blood clot. They drew my blood and called two days ago saying that my blood was pretty thick and that they want to draw my blood again next month. Today I had the same chest pain and had to actually leave work and call up my grandmother to come get me.

If i use my thumb on the same hand to push down on my pinky's nuckle the pain is really profound. The pain is starting to effect my day to day tasks and any help will be immensely appreciated. Thank you for reading."

However I have not been taking it. I took it over 90 days prior but not since then as it is not in my pain management plan. Does any one know how this can show up? I take other medications for blood and heart issues. Can any of these show up as Tram? I am prescribed Hydro 10/325 and Methadone. Methadone is a new prescription to me and I believe this with something else may show up as Tram. Please advise. My doctor is tone deaf on the subject.

I had my first hip replacement when I was 41. If I did some hard work around the house or some sort of physical activity with the family, I would pay for it that night with heavy pain in the lower half of my body. To shorten up this story, I am now 61 and I have had 2 more hip surgeries( the new right one had problems, so after 2 years they had to do a revision which is causing heavy pain problems), both knees scoped, minor back surgery, shoulder surgery, 2 different pain management doctors, countless chiropractors, and one final hip + knee surgeon and 1 back surgeon to help me find what to do. Even though over the past 10 years I have had an unbelievable amount of Xrays and MRI's, The hip Doctor wanted a new set including a Bars MRI and other test that I have not heard about. I also point out that if you feel the bottom of my right buttocks you will feel a prominent lump and it starts from the top of my right buttocks all the way down to almost my knee and is very painful. It feels like a pipe or tube of some kind, but hey, what do I know,right. He did feel it and did acknowledge it, so at least I wasn't nuts. I had the test done and on the xrays, the technician put a marker from the top of the lump to the bottom so the doctor could focus on that area. The Doctor said that all the test came back negative. Even the long lump I talked about, the xray showed that area was completely black. It showed nothing. He said it was not my hip,however he said that both my knees should be replaced. But why buy a new garage door if the car doesn't work. I saw the back surgeon that he recommended, and after reading and looking at all the tests I had done, he told me that it wasn't my back and it had to be the hips. He recommended that I go back to the pain management doctor and see what he could do. That was in September and my situation has increasingly has gone south. Next week I am going to another pain management Doctor because I have run out of options. The hip Doctor has told me that if I go to another Doctor, he will me glad to send him everything he did on me. I am wary to go to another surgical place like the Rothman Institute in Philadelphia, because they are surgeons and not diagnoticians, and if they can't make money for all the time they are going to spend, there are a lot of patients in the waiting room where they can.

I also have a litany of other health problems that no doctor has been able to decipher.  What I’m looking for is someone who can point me in the direction of an effective, affordable medical professional close to home (NE Dallas suburbs) who can provide real solutions to my health problems. Here is the long list of my health problems, things I’ve tried, and restrictions on what I can try next: Health problems Upper back and neck pain for about 12 years No MRI, X-ray, or other scan has ever revealed anything significant to any doctor, including the nation’s best spine specialists in the DC area. Back pain has spread to my lower back over the past three years It now feels like I have a severely broken joint/disc of some kind in my lower back It is impossible to stand up straight anymore It is very difficult to walk My poor posture from the back problems has led to pain spreading throughout my legs, causing very strained thighs and knees. It has also led to very weak and clumsy arms and hands I also have severe digestive problems that have loosely been called IBS-D. This keeps my energy level, appetite, and strength very low Things I’ve tried  Many many licensed, respectable, highly reputable doctors across the country, literally from coast to coast. Including general primary care doctors, spine specialists, GI specialists, pain management specialists, chiropractors, rolfing, airrosti, physical therapy, massage therapy, accupuncture, nutritionists, psychologists, psychiatrists, etc. I’ve actually followed the directions of these specialists for years and found little to no relief. Restrictions that make it hard to find help now My health has gotten much worse over the past two years. It is now very difficult to walk, keep my energy level up, and focus for very long.  I’m now very low on money.  I worked decent-paying white collar desk jobs around DC as a PR manager for a few years. I had some income and full benefits. But health insurance covered very little of the financial burden. So I burned through a great deal of money trying new doctors and trying to pay for the exorbitant testing and treatments they prescribed. I started my career in the US Air Force. So I am a veteran with an honorable discharge and proof of service (DD Form 214). I’ve been to military hospitals across the country while on active duty and to VA hospitals as a veteran. The level of care is atrocious. And they have taken to blatantly lying about how much the care will cost me. They have claimed it will be free only to send me massive bills several months later. The VA has been unable to offer any help. But my status as a veteran means that I don’t qualify for other low-income health care options. I also don’t qualify for the veterans choice program because I’m within 40 miles of the Dallas VA hospital.  I have no one who will help. Due to worsening health problems, I was coerced into moving home with my parents at the age of 32 last year. I didn’t know what to expect but didn’t think I could manage on my own at the time of decision. Once I had given up a lucrative job, friends, and a home in DC, I was stuck in Dallas in my parents house. They are upper middle class and enjoy perfect health in their late 60s. But they are extremely religious pseudo-faith healer believers and refused to offer any assistance to get medical help. And my health has worsened over the last year since moving home.  I do not fall into any other so-called “sympathy demographics” other than being a veteran. And I’m not a combat veteran, so I do not qualify for any of the countless charities helping combat veterans (such as the wounded warrior project). I’m 33, straight, white, male, single, no kids, veteran, with no medical testing to prove any health problems. I’m not healthy enough to work anymore to get money or health insurance. And I don’t have enough money to cover much more health care. And I have no one willing to help me find good health care. And I have no one to help me deal with the endless hassle and confusion of battling with doctors and their offices even if I could afford their services. This is another significant obstacle to getting help. I’m not in good health so I don’t feel strong enough to fight doctors to demand good solutions. And doctors have a first instinct to get rid of the patient as fast as possible while saddling them with an array of unfamiliar expensive tests. My health continues to worsen. I have been very blunt about this with my parents. They have clearly said they refuse to help. They said to get a job and move out. That is also my end goal. But I need better health to pull that off.  Please let me know if you know of anyone offering low-cost effective health care in the NE Dallas suburbs. I have a bit of money, no health insurance, and must drive myself to any appointments. So it must be within a short driving distance so I can safely get there. Thank you very much for any help."

The orthopedic surgeon said it was a patellar subluxation and outer knee bone bruising, but not ligament tears. He then told me to do physical therapy. I told him my wedding was October 13 and my honeymoon was based on hiking, and he said I'd be healed enough to hike by then. I've had two follow up since my initial appointment and little improvement. I have fallen twice since my original injury and physical therapy believes something more is wrong. I have a severe, sharp pain when trying to bend my knee past 45 degrees. My ROM hasn't improved very much in the last month and pt asked me to bring this up to my doctor. The Dr quickly dismissed anything else could be wrong and told me that ""physical therapy should stick to physical therapy.""

Wow, this got long. Oh well, even if no one reads i can use it elsewhere i guess ) Okay, firstly i'm here now because after just getting off the phone with my doc who I wont see till the tenth I am flummoxed to her advice and what I should or can do.  ( For the second time, she suggested to 'lay in a dimly let room with a warm cloth on my head' and when she asked what im taking for the pain, Ibprofen like she told me to and if it helped, which is not much, she told me then to not take it. )   I've only seen her a few so far, so she is a rather new doctor for me and I feel there is alot more she should know about my issues.   ...but personally, so far I feel like she is not actually concerned or taking my problems seriously.   Her first advice for the migraine issue ( before the chronic onset )   was to stop taking any kind of headache medicine for a couple weeks or so and that taking it so often was the cause of them being so frequent. I went along with it, it wasn't fun and resulted in me simply suffering through them and inhibiting me from being able to do anything else really.   Before getting into some past info, whats been going on for the past several weeks has been rather unbearable...  I often have migraines, but been a very long time since theyve been this bad.   Every day, there is pressure on both sides of my head, specifically at temporalis area. Along with a horrible knot on the back of my skull, (occipatilis). My necks been stiff ( Sternocleidomastoid and trapezius mostly, but much of neck really ) especially awful are then occasional pops in the vertebrae, which despite all my efforts stretching properly usually feel like an awful pinch and burning instead of relief.  At the onset of this onslaught, i also had severe vision problems, eyes were very red and had ocular pain even when closed. My temples throbbed and ached, really my entire head. I felt feverish and been having awful memory problems and some problems with my balance too. And the terrible ringing in my ears, UGH. Sometimes its a real high pitched, intense tone that gradually fades ( feels kinda like someone hit the reset button on my brain for a moment) And ive realized the ear ringing is actually constant and nonstop now, just varying in strength.   I eventually was able to make a next day appointment with another doctor at the physicians building, who gave me a shot of turidol and something else for the nausea. I immediately regretted not remembering to ask if i should get an MRI or could be referred to a chiropractor or something. Honestly, i have no idea how i failed to bring that up when it was all i had been thinking about before.   So the shots helped, I was able to relax and get some relief for a while. As the migraines returned, they were accompanied by the severe neck issues and lower back ( lumbar ) as well.   It feels EXTREMELY stiff, like my spine is totally kinked and any kind of movement associated with it is met with very uncomfortable pain and resistance.   Im not sure if its possibly an underlying cause, or was made worse by not getting it enough exercise or something lately.   HOWEVER, just before all this I was lent a gazelle and have been using it frequently since. If anything ive been alot more active, despite the few days after the shot which I spent in bed primarily. After that though is when the overall stiffness became most apparent.   One thing i noticed right away using it is how strange it felt to use, as much as ive been using it ( this is rather hard to explain exactly ) it feels like my legs arent fully 'engaging', as if theres some disconnection or total weakness in my thighs an upper legs. I know how a total stride should feel, but even when i assist with my arms to get a stronger, deeper one... nothing.   And despite my efforts, ive gained back the weight i recently lost last month somehow.  I've gained considerable weight over past couple years, never been over 190 and now Im at 212-220. =(   My only past surgery was for my eyes years ago when i was having   similar migraine issues ( 6-8 hours at least, fever, unable to focus ) 'Strabismus' he diagnosed.   As scary as eye surgery was to me, I was willing to do whatever it took so i could do things like enjoy drawing again.  I have to wonder though now if it was merely a temporary fix to an underlying problem, as now Im experiencing the same thing again.   ...my eyes are visibly scarred forever and noticeably ( to me at least ) altered in position. Frequently dry eyes as well and most eye drops i cant use as they instead cause burning pain and irritation.  A couple years ago I saw a physical therapist who after making me into a pretzel, etc ( lol ) concluded I could have Marfans syndrome as i showed alot of characteristics. And after reading bout it, I felt the same. Enough to go and get an EKG done as he suggested, which came out fine. However, that just means it hasnt progressed to that stage ( aortic dilation or aneurysm ) which is the last fatal stages.   Further diagnosis however has eluded me so far, as there doesnt seem to be an easy way for me to get tested genetically locally.   Anyways, one of the symptoms is dural ectasia, which I feel perfectly fits several issues ive been having over the past few years.   ( the occasional bladder issues which have dumbfounded me, and the numbness which i apparently have just become accustomed too )  Last time when i mentioned bladder issues, i was sent to get xrays and mris done. ( i was kinda surprised how serious they take it ) But all they said was that there was a slight disc bulge or something, prescribed me some muscle relaxers, etc..   ...I'm wondering now if it was possibly misdiagnosed as that instead.

Wow, this got long. Oh well, even if no one reads i can use it elsewhere i guess ) Okay, firstly i'm here now because after just getting off the phone with my doc who I wont see till the tenth I am flummoxed to her advice and what I should or can do.  ( For the second time, she suggested to 'lay in a dimly let room with a warm cloth on my head' and when she asked what im taking for the pain, Ibprofen like she told me to and if it helped, which is not much, she told me then to not take it. )   I've only seen her a few so far, so she is a rather new doctor for me and I feel there is alot more she should know about my issues.   ...but personally, so far I feel like she is not actually concerned or taking my problems seriously.   Her first advice for the migraine issue ( before the chronic onset )   was to stop taking any kind of headache medicine for a couple weeks or so and that taking it so often was the cause of them being so frequent. I went along with it, it wasn't fun and resulted in me simply suffering through them and inhibiting me from being able to do anything else really.   Before getting into some past info, whats been going on for the past several weeks has been rather unbearable...  I often have migraines, but been a very long time since theyve been this bad.   Every day, there is pressure on both sides of my head, specifically at temporalis area. Along with a horrible knot on the back of my skull, (occipatilis). My necks been stiff ( Sternocleidomastoid and trapezius mostly, but much of neck really ) especially awful are then occasional pops in the vertebrae, which despite all my efforts stretching properly usually feel like an awful pinch and burning instead of relief.  At the onset of this onslaught, i also had severe vision problems, eyes were very red and had ocular pain even when closed. My temples throbbed and ached, really my entire head. I felt feverish and been having awful memory problems and some problems with my balance too. And the terrible ringing in my ears, UGH. Sometimes its a real high pitched, intense tone that gradually fades ( feels kinda like someone hit the reset button on my brain for a moment) And ive realized the ear ringing is actually constant and nonstop now, just varying in strength.   I eventually was able to make a next day appointment with another doctor at the physicians building, who gave me a shot of turidol and something else for the nausea. I immediately regretted not remembering to ask if i should get an MRI or could be referred to a chiropractor or something. Honestly, i have no idea how i failed to bring that up when it was all i had been thinking about before.   So the shots helped, I was able to relax and get some relief for a while. As the migraines returned, they were accompanied by the severe neck issues and lower back ( lumbar ) as well.   It feels EXTREMELY stiff, like my spine is totally kinked and any kind of movement associated with it is met with very uncomfortable pain and resistance.   Im not sure if its possibly an underlying cause, or was made worse by not getting it enough exercise or something lately.   HOWEVER, just before all this I was lent a gazelle and have been using it frequently since. If anything ive been alot more active, despite the few days after the shot which I spent in bed primarily. After that though is when the overall stiffness became most apparent.   One thing i noticed right away using it is how strange it felt to use, as much as ive been using it ( this is rather hard to explain exactly ) it feels like my legs arent fully 'engaging', as if theres some disconnection or total weakness in my thighs an upper legs. I know how a total stride should feel, but even when i assist with my arms to get a stronger, deeper one... nothing.   And despite my efforts, ive gained back the weight i recently lost last month somehow.  I've gained considerable weight over past couple years, never been over 190 and now Im at 212-220. =(   My only past surgery was for my eyes years ago when i was having   similar migraine issues ( 6-8 hours at least, fever, unable to focus ) 'Strabismus' he diagnosed.   As scary as eye surgery was to me, I was willing to do whatever it took so i could do things like enjoy drawing again.  I have to wonder though now if it was merely a temporary fix to an underlying problem, as now Im experiencing the same thing again.   ...my eyes are visibly scarred forever and noticeably ( to me at least ) altered in position. Frequently dry eyes as well and most eye drops i cant use as they instead cause burning pain and irritation.  A couple years ago I saw a physical therapist who after making me into a pretzel, etc ( lol ) concluded I could have Marfans syndrome as i showed alot of characteristics. And after reading bout it, I felt the same. Enough to go and get an EKG done as he suggested, which came out fine. However, that just means it hasnt progressed to that stage ( aortic dilation or aneurysm ) which is the last fatal stages.   Further diagnosis however has eluded me so far, as there doesnt seem to be an easy way for me to get tested genetically locally.   Anyways, one of the symptoms is dural ectasia, which I feel perfectly fits several issues ive been having over the past few years.   ( the occasional bladder issues which have dumbfounded me, and the numbness which i apparently have just become accustomed too )  Last time when i mentioned bladder issues, i was sent to get xrays and mris done. ( i was kinda surprised how serious they take it ) But all they said was that there was a slight disc bulge or something, prescribed me some muscle relaxers, etc..   ...I'm wondering now if it was possibly misdiagnosed as that instead.

Her first advice for the migraine issue ( before the chronic onset )   was to stop taking any kind of headache medicine for a couple weeks or so and that taking it so often was the cause of them being so frequent. I went along with it, it wasn't fun and resulted in me simply suffering through them and inhibiting me from being able to do anything else really.   Before getting into some past info, whats been going on for the past several weeks has been rather unbearable...  I often have migraines, but been a very long time since theyve been this bad.   Every day, there is pressure on both sides of my head, specifically at temporalis area. Along with a horrible knot on the back of my skull, (occipatilis). My necks been stiff ( Sternocleidomastoid and trapezius mostly, but much of neck really ) especially awful are then occasional pops in the vertebrae, which despite all my efforts stretching properly usually feel like an awful pinch and burning instead of relief.  At the onset of this onslaught, i also had severe vision problems, eyes were very red and had ocular pain even when closed. My temples throbbed and ached, really my entire head. I felt feverish and been having awful memory problems and some problems with my balance too. And the terrible ringing in my ears, UGH. Sometimes its a real high pitched, intense tone that gradually fades ( feels kinda like someone hit the reset button on my brain for a moment) And ive realized the ear ringing is actually constant and nonstop now, just varying in strength.   I eventually was able to make a next day appointment with another doctor at the physicians building, who gave me a shot of turidol and something else for the nausea. I immediately regretted not remembering to ask if i should get an MRI or could be referred to a chiropractor or something. Honestly, i have no idea how i failed to bring that up when it was all i had been thinking about before.   So the shots helped, I was able to relax and get some relief for a while. As the migraines returned, they were accompanied by the severe neck issues and lower back ( lumbar ) as well.   It feels EXTREMELY stiff, like my spine is totally kinked and any kind of movement associated with it is met with very uncomfortable pain and resistance.   Im not sure if its possibly an underlying cause, or was made worse by not getting it enough exercise or something lately.   HOWEVER, just before all this I was lent a gazelle and have been using it frequently since. If anything ive been alot more active, despite the few days after the shot which I spent in bed primarily. After that though is when the overall stiffness became most apparent.   One thing i noticed right away using it is how strange it felt to use, as much as ive been using it ( this is rather hard to explain exactly ) it feels like my legs arent fully 'engaging', as if theres some disconnection or total weakness in my thighs an upper legs. I know how a total stride should feel, but even when i assist with my arms to get a stronger, deeper one... nothing.

Frequently dry eyes as well and most eye drops i cant use as they instead cause burning pain and irritation.  A couple years ago I saw a physical therapist who after making me into a pretzel, etc ( lol ) concluded I could have Marfans syndrome as i showed alot of characteristics. And after reading bout it, I felt the same. Enough to go and get an EKG done as he suggested, which came out fine. However, that just means it hasnt progressed to that stage ( aortic dilation or aneurysm ) which is the last fatal stages.   Further diagnosis however has eluded me so far, as there doesnt seem to be an easy way for me to get tested genetically locally.   Anyways, one of the symptoms is dural ectasia, which I feel perfectly fits several issues ive been having over the past few years.

( i was kinda surprised how serious they take it ) But all they said was that there was a slight disc bulge or something, prescribed me some muscle relaxers, etc..   ...I'm wondering now if it was possibly misdiagnosed as that instead.

Could it happen that quickly or does it normally take longer than 2 weeks to occur? I'm resting it now to see if maybe I've just done too much too fast.

At the time of and shortly after the collision I felt OK. About 90 minutes after the accident, however, I began to experience a headache the likes of which I'd never even imagined. I'm 56 years old and have never had headaches with any regularity. Sinus headaches occasionally but other than those, none. With this headache, my entire skull throbbed painfully and I experienced constant nausea and felt lightheaded upon standing. Because of NY state's no-fault laws it took two months to finally locate a physician who would take my case. During that time the headache was relentless.  After a diagnosis of migraine secondary to a whiplash injury, I began a regimen of trigger point and nerve block injections. After a few treatments, I began to experience a few pain-free days and the headaches that did occur were mostly mitigated with Sumatriptan tablets in between injections. A few months ago I had to change doctors. The new doctor seems to think that my headaches are coincidental despite my never having had more than one or two per year prior to the collision. I have had multiple CT scans which show herniation of C2-3. C4-5 are fused from another accident which occurred in 1980. The repair was completed using wire and I've had issues with MRI attempts in that region.  My question is, could my headaches simply be coincidental despite the cervical herniation? As stated earlier, I have no history of severe headaches, nor do any of my family members.  Thanks"

My orthopedic surgeon determined I have lumbar spondylosis (via hip x-rays when I had a right total hip arthroplasty) about a year ago. I was taking meloxicam (Mobic) for various arthritis pain (including hip and left knee replacements) but had to stop abruptly more than 2 weeks ago as it was eating my gut. My PCP says absolutely NO NSAIDS, not even aspirin, and my osteo says just Tylenol. Right now I am wearing a TENS unit set to the highest {burst} setting which makes it bearable but the minute it shuts off I am in pain again. This is beginning to affect my daily activities, my work and my life. Anyone have any suggestions? No one will prescribe any narcotics and Tramadol is about as useful as a Tic Tac."

Lumbar MRI revealed no impingemen!!??,"Hello folks, My injury started when I was playing basketball and my back did not feel ""right"", it felt as though my back was aligned. After playing for about five minutes I felt my back to seize up on me and getting stiff. I immediately stopped playing and sat down when my lower back started to spasm to a point where I could not stand straight up without severe pain. I got home and laid on the carpet floor in a fetal position for about three hours due to the intense pain and the fetal position was the only relief. I finally got up when my legs started to tremble in pain and legs were very weak to stand on. That night I had back spasms and started to have numbness to both my legs. The next morning the spasms were gone however still had terrible low back pain and legs were very weak and numb to my feet!!  To fast forward to 8 weeks later and having an MRI and X-rays done I still have both legs numb with little improvement however I'm able to walk very gingerly and a little off balance. I cannot run or do lunges or jump due to leg weakness and fatigue. My legs are very very slowing gaining strength back and the back pain has improved a lot faster than my legs!! The MRI did not reveal any impingement on the nerve but did show spinal stenosis which does not explain the leg numbness and weakness... I did go to the spine specialist who did not provide any answers due to ordering more testing which takes a month to perform!! He ordered an MRI to the Thoracic spine and an EMG test which I will have done in two weeks... Any thoughts or someone have a similar experience??? Thank you"

Also they let me leave the clinic 15 pills behind the first day I seen them because when I left the clinic that I was at before they called me in 10 mg of oxycodone and 25 MCG of Fentanyl to hold me over until I got into another pain clinic but I took that medicine like I taking my medicine before 15mg 5XDay and 50mcg and I told the new pain clinic I was doing that! Now WHY would they let me leave 15 pills behind after I told them because they told me just to keep the 10 mg oxycodone but cut up the 25mcg Fentanyl and wrote me a prescription for the 75mcg!

Background: About 10 mos ago while playing volleyball, I dove for the ball and my leg was in front of me and jammed while the rest of my body followed and kind of crunched together. Immediately I had an excruciating, sharp pain in my lowest back, near the tailbone- that pain where you almost pass out. I could not walk- my left leg just gave out. My friends carried me to the playground and I hung from the monkey bars while they pulled on my legs. Whatever slipped out, seemed to slip back in and it was nearly instant relief. It still ached, but it was completely fine by the next day.  Then 2 days ago, I was playing and I felt a twinge on my left side in the same place but there was no dive or moment I can pinpoint- it just started to hurt gradually and the pain spread to the rest of my lower back. I stopped playing and went swimming, hoping that would help, but by the time I got home, I could barely walk. The pain is unbearable and I can't bend over at all or sit or stand or do anything- even lying on the floor is uncomfortable. I can only lie on my side with a pillow in between my knees. I've done nothing but stay in bed for two days. I have an appointment with the doctor tomorrow and the pain has gotten slightly better, but it still constant and intense. I can't sleep and I have terrible reactions to pain meds so I have minimal relief options other than NSAIDs and xanex.  Here's the reason I'm posting: The pain still feels MOSTLY on my left side, very lower back, but there is no shooting pain down my leg, and only moderate hip tightness. The strange thing that I can't seem to find anything about is this weird thing that happens when walking- the point where my left foot starts to leave the ground, I immediately get this sharp, acute pain in my left back and near by tailbone. I feel something shift/slip near by tailbone and left side of my lower back. It's such a creepy, strange feeling- something should not be moving or sliding around. Pain does not shoot up my leg- as soon as that foot leaves the ground, it triggers pain like pressing a button and I want to collapse, the pain is so sharp and intense. I can't find anything online about this- everything talks about sacroiliac hip/sciatic nerve pain, but I have no pain down my leg and it's closer to my tailbone than my hip. Just wondering if anyone knows anything about this. I am so worried I'm going to be immobile for the rest of the summer and I may lose my mind."

On Tuesday, I received an ultrasound-guided cortisone injection into the bursa of my greater trochanter. I masturbated and ejaculated the night of the day I received the treatment. Afterwards, I found an online article on the possibility of sexually transmitting medications through semen and it noted that small amounts of bioactive substances may appear in semen. I have not masturbated after this, and I am wondering if it is okay to do so."

So, let me start this journey. Let me go back to when I was about 12 to 13. I know I was still in middle school. My dad and I were out shopping and my dad grabbed my neck to try to scare me, but he notice that my spine connect to my neck was very large. My godmothers husband is a chiropractor, so my dad decided to go get x-rays done. He told me that my spine is completely straight. Didn’t think much of it. I wasn’t in pain at all at the time. Fast forward to about 15, I started getting muscle spasms regularly. To the point, at the end of the day I’m crying alone in my room. Not letting anyone know how much pain I am. Over the years until about 17, it was just annoying and occasional would be in bed crying. When I got about 17, I would crying every night. Losing sleep, had to be on the phone or watching some sort of movie I have watched over and over again to try to at least ease it. Around that time or at 18, I went to the doctor and I got prescribed ibuprofen because they believed it was period pain. So I took that, didn’t help much unless I was super distracted and only during the day. But at night time, completely different ball field. I took so much ibuprofen over the next two to three years. I started pooping blood. So I went to urgent care and they prescribed tramadol which made me feel like I just took a sugar tablet.  And then went back to annoying and coming back occasionally. So when i was late 22, it all started coming back. Taking naproxen and using the heating pad, shower or bath, (which I have done both of those the whole time) and that helped to get me to sleep for awhile. Now for the past nine to six months, I will have to fight back tears almost every night because I feel like I am baby for crying. I try all the things I usually do, but to no avail. During the day, it feels like it needs to be cracked constantly. I will have relief for a few minutes and then back to where we started. So, now I’m stilling here at 3 in the morning. I can’t get comfortable, and I just want to cry. I just wat to know if I am just crazy, overrating, or what to do? I just feel like no one believes the extent of what pain I am in. I try to hide as much as I can. But there are so many more symptoms but I can go into that later.  Any help will be great."

This past weekend I was volunteering at a local event where various companies set up booths to advertise, promote and sell some of their products. One of the booths was set up by a company called ""Twisted Extracts"" who's main product is CBD cannabis oil and other CBD products. A few years ago I was referred to a Physical Medicine specialist who, after a thorough workup, prescribed medical cannabis for pain management and sleep but I have never used the prescription as I had tried recreational marijuana before and thought that I would have the same experience with the medical type. I didn't realize it until someone explained the difference between medical and recreational marijuana, and I didn't want the feeling of being high all the time.  Anyway, I purchased some CBD gummies and something called Twisted Extracts Cara-Melts which is just another type of CBD candy. The gummies are 80mg each and you are supposed to be able to easily cut them into 8 - 10mg doses. The Cara-Melts are 70mg per dose. I really would like to to try them to see if they would be of some value in managing my pain and then possibly reducing or eliminating some of these heavy medications.  To get to the point and my question, I'm wondering if I try them, should I use it in place of the meds while testing out or along with the prescription medications?

I know of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome as it is very common among gamers, but it says that the main symptoms are numbness in the fingers, but I fully feel my hand, and my wrist doesn't even hurt when I leave it in a neutral position, it is only until I bend it left that it starts to hurt. I also have my mouse in a pretty low position, so I can see why my wrist would hurt because I have to kind of bend it upwards. I really hope this doesn't develop into CTS. Thanks for any help! For now I'm trying to use my mouse less and at least elevate my arm by using the mouse on the upper portion of my desk (which I notice it relieves the bending pressure)."

Genetically modified foods, pollutions, toxins, etc., have affected the ability of our body to function in the way it was naturally intended. The inventions of radio, cellular communication and other such devices that transmit electromagnetic waves have also caused a new kind of stress to the body known as electromagnetic pollution. The way in which we deal with pain, injuries, ailments, and stressors to the body has advanced immensely in the past few centuries. The medical field has been a blossoming industry that deals primarily with correcting these problems. In modern times, it appears that the cure to these problems is in the form of some sort of chemical that is ingested into the body.  For example, when a part of the body is injured, our natural protective mechanisms go to work. White blood cell count at the site of the injury increases, which causes heat, loss of function, and pain. All of these effects are potentially beneficial; but after we know we are injured, the pain is not a good thing. Taking ibuprofen acts as a painkiller due to its ability to inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins. It does this by interfering with the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which will in effect help alleviate the pain and solve one problem, but may also create others. As well as being harmful to your liver, ibuprofen may cause stomach pain, constipation, gas, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Alternative solutions to these problems – such as Eastern medicine – take a different approach to this. While the Western medicine approach clearly separates health and disease, the Eastern medicine approach considers health as a balanced state, versus disease as an unbalanced state. Eastern Chinese medicine divides the body into parts by their function rather than their structure: the anatomical, physiological, and psychological. These parts are all connected by what they call “meridians” which are electrical pathways that carry energy and information throughout the body. When the flow of energy and information throughout these pathways is blocked or slowed down, our body enters a state of disease, which ultimately leads to illness and sickness. Electricity, magnetism, electromagnetic waves/fields, and acoustic waves can all be used to send messages to the body and its energetic field. Different forms of electromagnetic waves/fields and frequencies can influence the human body."

They estimated him to die 2 months ago but he is still doing pretty well. When he first went on hospice he was on low dose oxycodone and low morphine. As his pain got worse they took him completely off the oxycodone and kept raising the mg on his morphine till he is now on 100mg tablets and liquid morphine. The morphine is not enough he is still in bad pain in his private areas. They raised his mg so fast (and it still not working) that he really doesn't have any further to go except getting it in a IV which of course they want him in the hospice home. (I believe they thought he would be dead now so they just kept giving more morphine and his still not comfortable as he should be). I cannot understand why they raised the morphine so much so quick without trying to up the mg on his oxy. Now that it is 2 months past his death date and he is still trying to walk around the house and enjoy what he can, they added methadone to his morphine regimen. Since then he is confused and cannot swallow properly. My question is, how can taking methadone (that is suppose to block opiods) and strong morphine help with his pain? Would that not stop the morphine from doing its job as a whole? Would it not be better to add the oxy back and get him off the methadone. He has not been on it long I would like him off of it, but I want him pain free."

He was riding his motorbike and he met with an accident on his way home. He was in critical condition. His right hand had several cuts and multiple fractures and he had to undergo surgery to get it fixed. The worst part is that when he fell, he hit his back pretty hard on the ground. Ever since the accident, he can only sit upright for 5 mins. He can't go to work, can't drive, can't even lie down properly. He visited many doctors but they keep saying that he just needs to rest and suggested some painkillers for him. But the fact is that he has been resting for a long time now. It's high time that he got better. His friend came to visit him recently and told him to visit his chiropractor in North York (   ). Apparently, his mum also had back pain issues and was up and running in no time after going there. So we are planning to go there next week. Before that, can you tell me how effective is this chiropractic treatment? Is there any medication involved? Please do share your experiences and knowledge."

Until recently I didn't have a problem getting them. Then the law changed and my PM doctor retired. She recommended a Dr and that's where the problems started. The doctor said he was cutting my meds and I had to get epidurals in place of some of the meds. I said I had no problem as long as my PAIN stayed under control. Long story short, my pain was not under control and my BLOOD PRESSURE skyrocketed to Around 211/103. I ended up in the emergency room. I received a morphine shot and boost control medicine for my blood pressure. I could have had a stroke or something even worse than that. The social worker at the hospital called around and got me an appointment for 6 days later with a new PM Dr. The doctor was very understanding and I couldn't be happier. I am on a lower dose of PAIN meds, but they are being lowered at a slower pace.(not cut in half in just a few visits) As for the epidurals, I'm not sure that they are good for me. My blood pressure remains high, 168/86. I will discuss this with my new PM Dr, because I need to get my bp lowered immediately. My advice to you would be to research the doctors by reading blogs, by researching their background, or to call the social worker at the hospital to recommend some doctors. It might take some time to find the right doctor, but with time and patience I am sure you will.GOOD LUCK!"

I found this resource, I studied several articles about the pain that I had. I applied few tips from those articles and in a while I felt better. Here are some tips from this site: Exercise: Regular exercise not only helps to build strength and endurance, it also helps keep your weight under control which can help prevent back pain. Most experts agree that low-impact aerobic exercises are the best because these activities avoid straining or jerking the back. Exercises that help strengthen the back and abdominal muscles, core-strengthening exercises, will help protect your back. Flexibility exercises, targeting the flexibility in your upper legs and hips may be beneficial also to reduce the potential for back pain. Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional before beginning any exercise program. Stop Smoking: Back pain occurs at a significantly higher rate among smokers compared to non-smokers of the same weight, height, and age. Maintain a healthy weight: Being overweight also increases your risk of developing back pain. The more overweight you are, the greater your risk of having pain in your back. Maintain good posture when standing: Keep your pelvis position neutral. To do this, keep your back straight with your head facing forward. Balance your weight equally on both feet, with your legs straight. Maintain good posture when sitting: To reduce your risk of back pain, your seat or chair should have adequate support for your low back, armrests and ideally, it should be able to swivel if you are working. When you are sitting, keep your knees and hips level and your feet flat on the floor. If your feet don't rest on the floor, use a small footrest or footstool to prevent back pain. Ideally, you should be able to sit straight up with good support in the ""small"" of your back. (the lumbar spine area). When you use a keyboard, your forearms should be horizontal with your elbows at right angles. Lift properly: The key to preventing back pain when lifting is to lift with your legs, not your back. Keep your back straight, with your feet shoulder-width apart. Place one foot slightly in front of the other to keep your balance and bend from your knees, not from your waist. Hold the object close to your body, maintain your back as straight as possible and tighten your abdominal muscles. This will pull your pelvis in. Remember to not straighten your legs before you lift. If you do, your back will be forced to do most of the lifting. Never lift and turn or twist at the same time. If the load is too heavy, prevent back pain by getting help. While lifting, keep your eyes focused straight ahead. Don't look up or down. This will keep your neck in a straight line with your spine and prevent back strain and back pain. Move objects correctly: It's is easier on your back to push objects than to pull them across the floor. Wear the proper shoes: High heels put the strain on your back. Shoes with no heel are better for preventing back pain. Drive and ride correctly: To prevent back pain when travelling, make sure to have proper support for your back. Make sure the rear-view mirrors are positioned correctly so you can avoid twisting. The pedals should be squarely under your feet. If you are travelling long distances, take frequent breaks to get out of the vehicle and walk around to avoid back fatigue and back pain. Rest right: The how to prevent back pain formula may be connected to how and where you sleep. The mattress on your bed should be able to support the weight of your buttocks and shoulders while keeping your spine straight. Keep a pillow under your head, but it should not force your neck into a sharp angle, which can cause upper back pain. Read more in this article:"

I don't really know what's going on.. even the little I'm telling you I can't tell you I'm saying everything 100 percent correct. I'm not told much because he's my boyfriend of a little less than a year who has a son with a woman who is very obsessed with him and doesn't want to let go of the relationship and who he's kept our relationship mostly private from. As you can imagine she's aware of a lot now and doesn't like that I come see him even though I'm the one who sleeps with him every night and took care of him and loved him! I know how selfish I sound but I can't take how selfish someone can be in a situation this devastating. I'm honestly avoiding any conversation with her because I know he wouldn't like for me to tell her anything.. and his family told me not to as well. My boyfriends family (mother and sister) are quite aware of how she is though they don't want to lose the ability to see their nephew and grandson, understandably. So I was told that his sons mother is talking about taking me off of the hospital visiting list, because she's upset at the relationship we had. So I guess my question is.. is that possible? If they were never married? And we already have to go to the precinct to get paperwork every single day that we want to see him that states in his sister, because he was arrested because of problems that occurred during the accident. So that makes it incredibly difficult to see him besides having my own child that I have no help caring for. I can only really see him during school hours and it's never enough time and I just keep trying to understand how people function daily when a loved one is in this condition going through these circumstances and drama. I can barely function I just want to be with him and do right by him cause I know if he had a say in anything he'd want me to be the one staying with him every night but as of now and probably a long time he won't have a say in much, I honestly don't know whether I'm right or wrong .. if I should be visiting every day or calm down and visit every other day maybe? last I heard they were going to try and wake him up 72 hours after the surgery but he woke up himself a little before then and they said that he was basically in stable condition. He has a breathing tube and he's very sedated. I'd like to believe he hears me and knows I'm there. Whenever I'm there visiting since he's “woken” his eyes are still dazed but I feel as if they move to where I'm speaking. when I talk to him and tell him I'm leaving he occasionally lifts his arm or starts jumping a little, it's scary but it's usually right when I'm telling him I'll see him later and leave him, and then when I tell him to calm down he does. Does anyone have any advice anything positive that they know about injuries like this and also realistic expectations to what I'll be dealing with in the next few months to a year. Is there even a possibility with the little info I gave you to tell me whether or not there's a chance I'll speak to him again where he'll understand or be able to communicate back? Any info on traumatic brain injury? I would love any positivity but obviously realistic expectations are welcomed too!"

She had previously been on Norco 7.5/325, and due to worsening symptoms, her dosage was changed to 10/325, with both prescriptions for 1 tablet 3 times daily. She reports better pain relief with the 10/325, but has been experiencing dizziness since switching to this dosage. I'm wondering if returning to 7.5mg, but with 4 tablets per day, would be better for her, as she would still get a total of 30mg daily, and she may have more consistent pain relief with medication q4h versus q6h. Does anyone have experience with this?"

I’m a 31 year old male. The pain is a stabbing/tender pain under my left pectoral muscle bordering on my armpit, and is there most of the time at varying degrees. At times it’s also accompanied by nausea (felt in my throat), occasional headaches, neck, shoulder and middle back pain. I also have ankle pain most of the time in both ankles and a bad right wrist (wrist is most likely from a bicycle crash 2 years ago).  In the last year, I’ve been to the ER twice, and both times the EKG and blood work came back fine. The second time, they did a CT scan of my upper left chest and found nothing wrong.   I’ve also visited with my PCP, who did a comprehensive metabolic panel and a couple other blood tests, all of which came back fine. She also ordered chest Xrays, which came back negative for anything wrong with the lungs or chest area.  She referred me to a cardiologist, who ordered a lipid panel for cholesterol. Cholesterol levels came back fine, with all levels bordering on ideal or not worrisome. I also did a stress echo at the cardiologist, and he said that nothing is wrong with my heart.  I went to a gastroenterologist, and he recommended an upper endoscopy, which I just had today. He stated after that my throat, stomach, and intestines looked completely normal and that he took biopsies which I will have the result for in 1-2 weeks. He prescribed me a proton pump inhibitor, because in the last few months I’ve seen my conditions improve on/off with these (not sure if they’ve actually helped or not).  At this point, I’m just not sure where to turn. Seems I have a lot of the symptoms of Fibromyalgia (I also urinate frequently and have anxiety/depression over the situation), but I’m not convinced the chest pain is from that because for one I’m male (mostly females get Fibro), and secondly from what I’ve seen chest/armpit pain doesn’t normally line up with the normal Fibro pain spots.  If anyone has any ideas what may be going on here, I’d love to hear them.

I’m a 31 year old male. The pain is a stabbing/tender pain under my left pectoral muscle bordering on my armpit, and is there most of the time at varying degrees. At times it’s also accompanied by nausea (felt in my throat), occasional headaches, neck, shoulder and middle back pain. I also have ankle pain most of the time in both ankles and a bad right wrist (wrist is most likely from a bicycle crash 2 years ago).  In the last year, I’ve been to the ER twice, and both times the EKG and blood work came back fine. The second time, they did a CT scan of my upper left chest and found nothing wrong.   I’ve also visited with my PCP, who did a comprehensive metabolic panel and a couple other blood tests, all of which came back fine. She also ordered chest Xrays, which came back negative for anything wrong with the lungs or chest area.  She referred me to a cardiologist, who ordered a lipid panel for cholesterol. Cholesterol levels came back fine, with all levels bordering on ideal or not worrisome. I also did a stress echo at the cardiologist, and he said that nothing is wrong with my heart.  I went to a gastroenterologist, and he recommended an upper endoscopy, which I just had today. He stated after that my throat, stomach, and intestines looked completely normal and that he took biopsies which I will have the result for in 1-2 weeks.

I’ve never used it recreationally and just recently have been able to reduce the dose gradually to 100mg/day. Today I noticed my doctor put “opioid dependence” on my chart. What does that mean?

That lasted about 2 days. Then the pain mostly went away for a couple days. Then it came back pretty strong and has been there every day for about a month. It hurts the most when I put pressure on it while walking, specifically when I lift my left foot and ""push"" forward off my right. I got x rays (will try to include in this post, hope it works) but the doctor didn't say anything about arthritis or not.

I was in a wrestling match (Girl wrestler) and I twisted my knee. It didn't really hurt at first. I could still walk but from here and there, I can feel a sharp pain, so I went tp the medicial attention center. All the medical attention center at the competition is put some ice on what's hurting. I went home and told my peoples what happened but of course, I knew what answer I was going to get. My mom doesn't have enough money to send me to the hospital for treatment. Now, after two months of walking on my bad knee ALOT, I can't do simple home workouts with feeling a pain and I can crack my knee whenever I please. When I crack it, I hold my foot with my other foot and rotate towards the left. Doing this helps random tightness I feel from here and there. The crack is louder than a pen dropping in a quiet room.  But anyways, I was wondering what should I do? Since I obviously don't have money for medical attention (also, no insurance), should I invest in a knee brace? and if so, what kind? Tell me everything. I really need to help my knee before it goes too bad. A teen with a knee of a 50 year old will only hinder my future. Thank you in advanced :)"

I have been taking my medications for 20 years without any problems just like millions of other pain patients. The drugs that are killing people are the drugs that people are either not taking as they are prescribed or that they bought off the street for illegal means. Chronic pain patients are not the problem but we seem to be the scapegoat and are the ones who are being punished.

I am 20 years old. Recently, and experienced strange headaches. I'll tell you in order. Once I was sitting at the computer and felt a muscle tension in the neck and shoulders. There was discomfort, the head was ""heavy"" to hold. Did not attach much importance. Then headaches began. They are rather strange. There are only (!) With excitement and anxiety, how calm emotionally, instantly pass. Accompanied by fear (stroke, etc.), and the stronger the fear, the greater the pain. Begin with a spasm in the neck. She whines and muscles are tense. Then I start to wind myself, and there is an alarm. The power of pain is completely proportionate to the strength of anxiety. The pains are compressive and bursting, the pain is dull and aching, the ears are burning. At the peak of my anxiety, there is a strong pulsation of blood vessels in my head (pain is not pulsating, just pulsation). It seems that the blood vessels now burst, there is a fear of death. It becomes hot in the face, the face ""blows out"" with a hot wind, the whole head is compressed and strongly aching, especially the ears. As soon as I relax, smile, reduce anxiety with the help of auto-training - the pain ceases and immediately passes. When completely relaxed, the muscles of the neck stop being clamped and a wave of pleasant trembling, a shiver rolls over the back. At the peak of fear during pain, the face is poured cold with sweat, hot flashes and then hot flashes. Hands are also icy and wet. Sometimes such pains are accompanied by discomfort and mild pain in the back, as well as painful tension of the muscles of the hands and feet, their stiffness. There was some anxious waiting for the next attack of such pain. I measured the pressure at the peak of the headache (I was all scared then, I was afraid of a stroke or something), it was 175 by 90. Calmed down, measured a second time after a small interval - 140 to 90. Once there was another unpleasant condition, I think associated with this pain. Has arisen once and has not been repeated. I woke up in the morning with stuffed ears, as if stunned. The condition was similar to the presence of a sulfur plug. Audibility was good, the only thing, the surrounding sounds a little resonated in my head with a light echo, my ears were a little wadded. After hours 4 this stuffiness has passed. What's with me and is it dangerous?"

Had a private consultation with a spinal consultant who made his own diagnosis of the MRI scan, which was that degenerative scoliosis was producing narrowing @ L4/5 and L5/S1 plus grade 1 spondyolisthesis @ L4/5 level. He suggested a lateral recess decompression surgery which I had December 2017. Result being that the surgery made no difference and the specialist said that I would have to learn to live with it! Have tried living with it but GP sent me for a further MRI scan June 2019, followed by another nerve block injection, which also has had no effect. GP now also says that I will have to live with it.

I've done three rounds of antibiotics. They didn't help. I take cranberry pills three times a day and pain killers to help me sleep at night. I've come to accept that I'm always going to have abdominal pain. It is always going to hurt to pee. Recently, my husband has started to get UTIs. He went to urgent care and received antibiotics. I know UTIs are not supposed to be contagious, but now I'm wondering if there is a way I could have gotten my husband sick. He's been feeling very run down and has had an upset stomach. Or is there an environmental factor that could get us both sick? It seems really strange that we're both getting UTIs, and I know he can't handle living with the pain like I can."

If I don't have an autoimmune condition, lyme, mono, or any infection, why on earth am I feeling so sick and what can I do to feel better? I feel like I have tried everything, and I eat and exercise well. Even pain meds do a poor job of relieving my symptoms. If anyone has any ideas on what I can do to feel better or what the issue is, it would be greatly appreciated."

This is going to be a bit long and embarrassing story. So please bear with me. I am a 35 year old male who grew up in a really traditional family in a really traditional country where talking about sex, or anything related to genital is a big taboo or stigma. So until a couple of days ago, I did not know that boys needed to retract foreskins and clean it daily to prevent infection. But my genital never felt itchy or pain or discomfort. This is how I stumbled into this: I have never had sex before, but I was desperate to find out what I missed out. So I bought a sex doll and applied lots of lubes before trying it on. The first time I thrust my genital into it, the toy pulled back my foreskin. Since the glans was never exposed before, it felt really sensitive. I did some online searching and it turned out to be normal. I could retract and put back my foreskin with no problem. After a couple of day, especially my glans started to feel natural when exposed, I decided to try the toy again. But this time my glans became big all of a sudden (within a few seconds) and it literally looked like a mushroom head. So even after my penis became flaccid I couldn't pull the foreskin over my glans. I was finally able to do that after maybe 15 minute of trying. Now I am scared and embarrassed. Could you please let me know what has happened to me? Greatly appreciate it!"

I’ve always had pain in my penis and especially when I urinate. I have been to the urologist and they tested me and did an ultrasound and found nothing. This is an ongoing problem for years now and it has been driving me crazy because I can’t figure out what’s wrong with my urethra, i’m always in some kind of discomfort down there and just by wearing boxers makes it worse. I have even tried switching to a fragrance free detergent and tried washing down there in a different way. So i’m wondering if I just should try a diet and if I do it and my problems go away, will I ever be able to enjoy coffee and spices ever again? I grew up eating spices. And id like to be able to enjoy alcohol every once in awhile but it starts burning as soon I drink (my urethra). I also started doing pelvic muscles release stretching to see if it helps.

I have pain on my inner right knee and a protrusion that, to me, feels like a bone that is not on my left leg. The pain was gradual until it started hurting to walk. I have tried to self diagnose and nothing seems to fit my symptoms. I originally thought it was pes anserine bursitis so I thought rest would help, but it has come back anyway and I realize now that the location of my bump is on the joint line and not below so it cannot be pes anserine bursitis. The pain seems to go away after about a week or two of rest. I wish I had taken note the last time but I don't believe the bump ever goes away because it's still there this time even though the pain has started decreasing.  The bump is super hard. I cannot push it in or move it. At the height of my knee pain, it hurts just walking or even laying down and not using it. Once it calms down, it still hurts to press on the bone/lump.  (I live an active lifestyle and lift weights and do cardio regularly. This exacerbated the injury and I stopped doing exercises involving my legs while it was painful. After about a month of not doing anything and I thought it had healed I started lifting heavy again being extremely careful to not overly exert myself and use proper form. The pain still came back and it now hurts to walk again.) I know it's extremely hard to diagnose something without going in to see a doctor. I am only trying to avoid getting an MRI as it would be at least $1,000 where I am in California and I can't afford it anyway."

But this pain is terrible I know something is wrong. My jaw gets stuck sometimes in place if I yawn or sometimes I can't bite down on one side. That same side my ear hurts too. I have to move my jaw in funny ways to get it out and it's incredibly painful. It's hard to chew, and the more I talk it hurts, don't even like kissing my husband anymore.

I cannot have an orgasm while erect. I started masturbating a strange way as a child (about 5 years old if I recall) and I haven’t EVER been able to do it the regular way. I have no idea how or why I started doing it this way.  But basically I lay on my stomach, cupping my flaccid penis in my palm, and basically just hump and grind until I finish. The problem is, I can’t orgasm while erect now. Never have been able to. I’ve only ever had sex with a condom and I usually kind of fake it when I think I should be done (or after she’s done). I’ve only been with two girls, one was a serious relationship. And I never told them about this. I was my ex’s first (The girl from the serious relationship) so I don’t think she knew any better and didn’t know anything was wrong. The first girl I was with we had sex a few times and I think she was catching on after a while but we only had a short relationship.  I can’t get an orgasm from receiving oral sex either. But now I’m single and I really think I need to get this figured out. This isn’t something I should keep doing. Especially if I want to get in another serious relationship, she’ll figure it out sooner or later. If I want to have children one day, etc. Oh and also the most important reason to get this resolved...because I’m sure everyone would agree: orgasming during sex is probably the best. Duh! I just hope I haven’t completely ruined my penis or something.  I’ve tried plenty of times to orgasm while hard. Tried a number of things. When I’m aroused, I get hard. Just like everyone else. It feels *kind of* good to stroke it, have it touched, have sex, etc. But nothing really gets my heart rate going like I’m working my way up to an orgasm quite like the method I use. When I’m aroused, I wait until I calm down and get flaccid and then that’s when I do it.  I don’t even know who I talk to about this. I don’t know what the problem is at all. Is it a complete mental block? Is it a physical issue and I’ve actually screwed my penis nerves up so much that this is what I’m stuck doing forever?  I just don’t know where to turn. I’m completely embarrassed to talk to anyone about it. Even to a doctor. I could barely work up the courage to type this out.  So I don’t know where I’m going with this anymore. Has anyone else ever dealt with this? Does anyone have any advice on what I should do to get this fixed?"

Other times it hurts to walk so badly that I have to limp around school and look like a complete idiot. My left leg will also get numb sometimes. I’ve gone to the doctors so many times that I feel like they think I’m just lying at this point, and my dad says I’m a hypochondriac. I thought being diagnosed would help me feel better but it hasn’t. I am also overweight, which I know is a contributing factor to my pain (and I’m slowly but surely working on losing that extra weight, I have depression so it isn’t that easy). I know there is something else that is going on. I just feel like I’ve been incorrectly diagnosed.  So, here are my main questions. What are some things I can do to stop the pain?

I had a knee reconstruction surgery done back in 2003 that is due for a replacement, but due to my age (32) we're trying to hold off as long as possible since my ortho said I would have to have it re-done every 15 years. Combine that with an insurance company that doesn't want to really pay for anything and I'm pretty much left with PM. I've done years of PT, tried every over the counter or non-narcotic medicine they've suggested and the only thing that seems to work has been Oxycodone. I'm on 15 mg 4x/day. It's held the pain at bay successfully and has allowed me to have my life back!  I see my PM doctor every 3 months and I have never failed a urinalysis or been short on my meds when they count them. I have mentioned to him that on weekends that I have big shoots (I'm a sports photog) that I do use more than 4/day. I've never been anything less than candid with him and haven't had an issue until now. I seem to be developing a tolerance to the medicine and it's no longer as effective as it was. It's now taking 1.5 pills to work the way 1 used to. I was going to call and talk to a nurse, but the office he is at was recently bought out by another company and the phone number I had for him no longer worked. I figured I could suck it up and talk to him at my next appointment in April. I had 2 HUGE shoots back to back and used between 5-7/day instead of 3 over a several day period. For the first time ever, I was hit with a random pill count call today. Depending on how they count days, I'm going to be either 8 or 12 short of where I should be. I really like every single person in their office except for one particular nurse and of course she's the one that's going to administer the count this afternoon. She flat out told me that if my count is off, they will dismiss me on the spot and nullify the 2 prescriptions that I have sitting at the pharmacy for February and March.

I had a knee reconstruction surgery done back in 2003 that is due for a replacement, but due to my age (32) we're trying to hold off as long as possible since my ortho said I would have to have it re-done every 15 years. Combine that with an insurance company that doesn't want to really pay for anything and I'm pretty much left with PM. I've done years of PT, tried every over the counter or non-narcotic medicine they've suggested and the only thing that seems to work has been Oxycodone. I'm on 15 mg 4x/day. It's held the pain at bay successfully and has allowed me to have my life back!  I see my PM doctor every 3 months and I have never failed a urinalysis or been short on my meds when they count them. I have mentioned to him that on weekends that I have big shoots (I'm a sports photog) that I do use more than 4/day. I've never been anything less than candid with him and haven't had an issue until now. I seem to be developing a tolerance to the medicine and it's no longer as effective as it was. It's now taking 1.5 pills to work the way 1 used to. I was going to call and talk to a nurse, but the office he is at was recently bought out by another company and the phone number I had for him no longer worked. I figured I could suck it up and talk to him at my next appointment in April. I had 2 HUGE shoots back to back and used between 5-7/day instead of 3 over a several day period. For the first time ever, I was hit with a random pill count call today. Depending on how they count days, I'm going to be either 8 or 12 short of where I should be. I really like every single person in their office except for one particular nurse and of course she's the one that's going to administer the count this afternoon. She flat out told me that if my count is off, they will dismiss me on the spot and nullify the 2 prescriptions that I have sitting at the pharmacy for February and March.

I did therapy, etc and was on medication and bed rest for a year. About 3 years ago, I noticed that if I take painkillers, the same muscles would ache when they wore off. I stopped taking painkillers unless absolutely necessary (serious, unbearable pain). No tylenol, advil, or anything more, unless prescribed by a doctor (and even then I'd avoid it). Every so often, I'd have to take it but I'd really just like to know what's causing the muscle pain when the painkillers wear off. It's extremely debilitating, and I can't have this when I have to work.  For example, I got a respiratory infection this week, and the doctor gave me some shots (one of which I presume was a painkiller), and now I'm in office and my limbs hurt to move. My ribs have begun to hurt, and I assume I will be unable to walk before long. I need to know how to fix this, as avoiding painkillers is obviously not the best workaround. Thanks"

It began when I was carrying heavy backpack in the mountains for months at a time. When I arrived back home, my pain was present but it was not as intense as it is now. I also began working immediately in a job where i was standing or sitting still, and my neck was always looking down. Moreover, I have been going to school which doesn't help the situation either. I have had X-rays and bone density scans, both of which have come out negative, I have also had blood tests to rule out arthritis which also came out negative. To try and help, I have seen physics, massage therapists, manual therapists and chiropractors all of which have told me a variety of things. Some say stretch, some say don't, some say exercise, some say don't. I have been seeing a manual therapist who has been doing IMS which seems to relieve the intensity of the pain but comes back a few days later. I have also only started taking ibuprofen so I can't tell for sure how much the IMS is working or not. I have only been doing the IMS for 5 weeks and I understand that chronic pain is a slow recovery process, but what I haven't receiced is a sure fire answer as to what the issue may be. I am an extremely active person, however with this injury, I am unable to do the things I want to do, and I am constantly thinking and worrying about the pain. I am willing to do anything to get it dealt with or to at least have an answer. If anyone has had any similar injuries or know of anyone I should talk to, please let me know.  Thanks"

It started out with the sudden appearance of two sort orange/pinkish aging spots on the head of my penis, which quickly grew into jagged lines that covered the front and sides of the head, but never reached the back for some reason. This was accompanied by random feelings of needle-pricking on the tip of my penis, and occasionally difficulty/a burning feeling when urinating. The needle-pricking sensation stopped not long after this, seemingly only being part of the start of the condition. The condition plagued there for awhile, until I noticed that skin around my urethra opening was peeling off, about a centimeter from the hole all the way around. Not long after that these horizontal jagged and grooves started appearing on my penis head, but they are very infrequent. Showing up at most twice a week. It platued there again until a few months ago, when the entire head would occasionally start burning and look red and irritated, which was sometimes accompanied by a sort of stabbing pain. It was also around this time that I started experiencing constipation, and the occasional pain when pooping. The only improvement is that the total red/burning system doesn’t happen anymore, and the only burning feeling is from the urethra when I pee. Also, there are actually some days where my penis looks completely normal, but these never last more than a day every couple weeks. Terrified but lacking insurance and funds, I have not seen a doctor for this at all. Can anyone give me a thoughts/suggestions? I’m very terrified that this is some sort of cancer."

About 4 years ago, I was taken to the hospital with intestinal problems complicated by a facia between my colon and bladder. After surgery to repair this, I still was not able to be sexually active for about two years, until I recently lost a lot of weight by cutting carbs (almost all) out of my diet, about 100 pounds. I'm 6' 1"" and now tip the scales at 180 lbs and feel a lot better, sleeping better, and my overall health has improved.  Except for one thing. While I'm now able to achieve an erection without medication, my erections aren't the same. At the base, the shaft of my penis is quite smaller (girth) and narrower, and while further up the shaft, around my circumcision scar is still the normal girth, it's cocked (no pun intended) slightly to the right and about 1"" to 2"" shorter. (when erect, flaccid state is the same as before) It is not painful at all, and I've felt around for the scales and scar tissue associated with Pyrone's I haven't found anything that would suggest that, with the exception of the slight right-hand curve.  One final thing, my ejaculations have far less volume, and simply ooze out, not shoot as they used to. (This is not painful either) Any advice would be helpful, as this is rather upsetting."

Hello all, I'm a 21 year old. Gender: male as you may have assumed. About a year ago I tried jelqing, a natural ""penis enlargement"" technique where you try to push blood flow into your penis and trap it there supposedly making it larger over time. In reality, I think it creates scar tissue which in a way does make your penis slightly bigger over time but of course is very damaging. After the last session, I had an ache in my shaft for some days. I quit cold turkey after that.  I noticed a pretty significant loss of sensitivity but ignorantly figured it would just heal itself and regularly masturbated the next couple months. I noticed it took much longer than usual to ejaculate and harder to hold onto an erection. I had lost a significant amount of sensitivity and was having to heavily rub my foreskin to make anything happen. I started getting to a point where I had to wait a week between masturbation to successfully make myself climax. I know it was idiotic to continue this but at the time, I stupidly stayed optimistic and figured things would magically heal themselves. As a guy that always had a sub-average sized penis, I constantly got erections whether it was because I had to pee, my penis rubbed slightly the wrong way on my shorts, something pushed against it, etc would cause me a never ending erection to the point where I usually had some daily discomfort in my shaft from constant stimulation. I decided to believe that maybe this new lack of erections was a step in the more normal direction. After some months, I noticed even more sensitivity loss and quit masturbating completely. Its been about 5 months since I last masturbated. I've seen 4 different doctors (2 being urologists) and no answers. Symptoms: White spots on foreskin, less noticeable when erect b/c blood flow. A lot of spider veins. Entire shaft has almost no sexual sensitivity in it; the feeling of rubbing it can be compared to rubbing your finger; I feel it but no pleasing feelings/sensation. I sometimes get dull pain at the base of my penis, between the base and my pelvic floor only on the left side when I use the muscle for pushing out pee/poop. When I masturbated often after the injury I noticed pain in this spot except much sharper when I achieved hard erections and would pull my penis to my stomach to relieve it. The belly of my shaft, only on the half closer to the glands is my most sensitive area since the injury and seemed to be the least effected spot. I do still achieve erections while sleeping so I don't think it's a vascular issue. If there's anyone that has experienced something similar, any advice is greatly appreciated. If you're going through what I'm going through, lets talk! I'll tell you things I've tried and vice versa. If anyone has any knowledge or idea of how I might regain some sensitivity, please share your thoughts. If there are any new procedures/techs out there you've heard of I'm open to any suggestions I can bring up to a new highly recommended Uro I'm seeing in a month. Thank you"

First started with some low back pain and some disc problems. Spinal stenosis. I have arthrititis through my body. Also signs of M.S. Being told 20 years ago I have it. My spinal tap won't show the rings. Other stuff in my spinal fluid like very high protein. Those problems I have to deal with when they come. The rings that show up in spinal fluid is because autoimmune problem won't let me fight inflammation anymore because of this in my spine. I had one pain specialist that fracture my spine in 4 places showing me these parts of my spine problems with these twists. Felt something in the 3rd twist. Percocet wore off and more pain I didn't want. Next pain specialist gave me an injection in buttock area. Doctor was interupted during this and forgot the second numbing shot. Felt like a 6 inch nail went in my poor crippled and hurting body severely stiffen and I learned tears can actually shoot out like bullets. NO more needles and no more steroids because I am diabetic.Steroids were messing with me so bad my PC doctor had to call them and said no more steroids. After that my orthodedic doctor found me another doctor. I had a really bad fall 3 years ago.Top of back foot stepping went completely under a mat. When my back foot let loose I went straight down into hard packed dirt. I was in wheelchair for 5 months. All the injuries were multiple lower fracture ribs and cartledge, hairline fracture in tibia, my spine went out like an accordin and when I hit it came back in. Torn meniscus in each knee and fluid in the one knee made a 2mm cyst go up to 78 mm and needed drained 4 times. Now it gets big and drain on it's own. Spine injury never stopped. Right arm was severely bruise as my right shoulder that can be painful. I have spinal stenosis in spine and neck also. Found out during this time I have scoliois at a number where 2 more numbers that it will need to be treated. Will know soon if the scoliosis was from fall, that can happen. Never felt it till after the fall. So where was I with pain control? My orthopedic was limited to percocet and I was taking ten mil. every 6 hours. Still screamed and cried alot and he sent me to pain specialist. Yea the one who is forgetful giving injections. He was trying differant meds and it was rather they wouldn't work or had a bad reaction. Doesn't matter what is going on you had to wait for your next appt for the month. I cried so much and call them after holding my spine over from pain balling my eyes out for four hours and office said wait till your appt. I had what the nurse call like phantom pain. I really actually had thoughts of using a chainsaw and cut my knees off and stepping in front of a moving car thinking it would stop the pain. It was horrible. I cried and moaned and up hours at night from the pain. This went on for 2 1/2 years. I don't know even how I even went through it. That doctor was putting me on meds that were not helping at very small doses because of this scare. This new doctor put me on 10 mil. of Opana 12 hour. I tell you what.....I had release of pain. It was sooooo like night and day. I do not know how I even did it for that long suffering like that. The medicine last for 8 hours not twelve. So four hours during sleep I can wake up with pain but I get through nights being I am laying down. Four hours during day can be brace or heating pad. I really don't mind that because so much of the pain was killed. Recently went to my orthopedic doctor and he said he seen things in my spine has been progressly getting worse last two years from tests I had . He said I needed surgery and then said BIG surgery. OK...I needed surgery on my knees and it would not be done because my sleep doctor stated I was to have no surgery unless it was no other choice that has to be done. I have sleep apnea and central sleep apnea where I stop breathing 98 time an hour. Brain won't tell me to breathe when sleeping. See surgeon on February first. IDK. Ortho doctor said I would end up in wheelchair. Then 2 years after the fall I was driving and stopped behind a car that was turning left and I looked in my rear view mirror and seeing this jeep vehicle coming real fast and as I turned my head to tell my husband this man hit us speeding and there was no skid marks. My husband and I had both grabbed our necks. My spinal stenosis was so bad and for an hour and half could feel things moving in my neck. It ended up disc hit and pinched nerve and knock disc and hit spinal cord and it bled a little bit. I never had pain in my neck. Just bothersome one time when talking to my son with my head turned. Now the breakthrough of pain with that is a differant pain I do not want. Yes I need surgery on a disc that moved. Not going to happen right now. Surgeon said if I start losing things dropped in hand or losing feeling surgery will have to be done right away or it will never get it back. It is not very good right now. Get brain attacks that is painful. Have 10 plus lesions. Neuro problems that go with that. I tell you what.........I pray that no one else has to go through this with this medication problem caused by other people. It is coming into this country. It was inhumane to let me suffer so bad. People that was dying from herione with Fentanyl made a choice, A very sick choice. I am not understanding it, A mother died here in our city at Childrens Hospital. Her child was very sick. Both parents used up in bathroom and mother died in there. A newspaper story where parents used up and both died upstairs and they were found a week later and their 6 month old baby was found dead in bassinet. Parents found pulled over somewhere OD or passed out with there children just sitting there. One guy in our city used and decided he felt so good he could speed in his car which caused a horrible crash where a little child was toss out of the car and was moved out of the car seat and rolled on the pavement. It is all sad and there is people going crazy now it seems for narcotics. Unfortunate people need medication. There has to be a line drawn on peoples conditions that show on their medical records. I would also say keep urine testing. It is pure inhumane what was happening to me."

Percocet wore off and more pain I didn't want. Next pain specialist gave me an injection in buttock area. Doctor was interupted during this and forgot the second numbing shot. Felt like a 6 inch nail went in my poor crippled and hurting body severely stiffen and I learned tears can actually shoot out like bullets. NO more needles and no more steroids because I am diabetic.Steroids were messing with me so bad my PC doctor had to call them and said no more steroids. After that my orthodedic doctor found me another doctor. I had a really bad fall 3 years ago.Top of back foot stepping went completely under a mat. When my back foot let loose I went straight down into hard packed dirt. I was in wheelchair for 5 months. All the injuries were multiple lower fracture ribs and cartledge, hairline fracture in tibia, my spine went out like an accordin and when I hit it came back in. Torn meniscus in each knee and fluid in the one knee made a 2mm cyst go up to 78 mm and needed drained 4 times. Now it gets big and drain on it's own. Spine injury never stopped. Right arm was severely bruise as my right shoulder that can be painful. I have spinal stenosis in spine and neck also. Found out during this time I have scoliois at a number where 2 more numbers that it will need to be treated. Will know soon if the scoliosis was from fall, that can happen. Never felt it till after the fall. So where was I with pain control? My orthopedic was limited to percocet and I was taking ten mil. every 6 hours. Still screamed and cried alot and he sent me to pain specialist. Yea the one who is forgetful giving injections. He was trying differant meds and it was rather they wouldn't work or had a bad reaction. Doesn't matter what is going on you had to wait for your next appt for the month. I cried so much and call them after holding my spine over from pain balling my eyes out for four hours and office said wait till your appt. I had what the nurse call like phantom pain. I really actually had thoughts of using a chainsaw and cut my knees off and stepping in front of a moving car thinking it would stop the pain. It was horrible. I cried and moaned and up hours at night from the pain. This went on for 2 1/2 years. I don't know even how I even went through it. That doctor was putting me on meds that were not helping at very small doses because of this scare. This new doctor put me on 10 mil. of Opana 12 hour. I tell you what.....I had release of pain. It was sooooo like night and day. I do not know how I even did it for that long suffering like that. The medicine last for 8 hours not twelve. So four hours during sleep I can wake up with pain but I get through nights being I am laying down. Four hours during day can be brace or heating pad. I really don't mind that because so much of the pain was killed. Recently went to my orthopedic doctor and he said he seen things in my spine has been progressly getting worse last two years from tests I had . He said I needed surgery and then said BIG surgery. OK...I needed surgery on my knees and it would not be done because my sleep doctor stated I was to have no surgery unless it was no other choice that has to be done. I have sleep apnea and central sleep apnea where I stop breathing 98 time an hour. Brain won't tell me to breathe when sleeping. See surgeon on February first. IDK. Ortho doctor said I would end up in wheelchair. Then 2 years after the fall I was driving and stopped behind a car that was turning left and I looked in my rear view mirror and seeing this jeep vehicle coming real fast and as I turned my head to tell my husband this man hit us speeding and there was no skid marks. My husband and I had both grabbed our necks. My spinal stenosis was so bad and for an hour and half could feel things moving in my neck. It ended up disc hit and pinched nerve and knock disc and hit spinal cord and it bled a little bit. I never had pain in my neck. Just bothersome one time when talking to my son with my head turned. Now the breakthrough of pain with that is a differant pain I do not want. Yes I need surgery on a disc that moved. Not going to happen right now. Surgeon said if I start losing things dropped in hand or losing feeling surgery will have to be done right away or it will never get it back. It is not very good right now. Get brain attacks that is painful. Have 10 plus lesions. Neuro problems that go with that. I tell you what.........I pray that no one else has to go through this with this medication problem caused by other people. It is coming into this country. It was inhumane to let me suffer so bad. People that was dying from herione with Fentanyl made a choice, A very sick choice. I am not understanding it, A mother died here in our city at Childrens Hospital. Her child was very sick. Both parents used up in bathroom and mother died in there. A newspaper story where parents used up and both died upstairs and they were found a week later and their 6 month old baby was found dead in bassinet. Parents found pulled over somewhere OD or passed out with there children just sitting there. One guy in our city used and decided he felt so good he could speed in his car which caused a horrible crash where a little child was toss out of the car and was moved out of the car seat and rolled on the pavement. It is all sad and there is people going crazy now it seems for narcotics. Unfortunate people need medication. There has to be a line drawn on peoples conditions that show on their medical records. I would also say keep urine testing. It is pure inhumane what was happening to me."

First started with some low back pain and some disc problems. Spinal stenosis. I have arthrititis through my body. Also signs of M.S. Being told 20 years ago I have it. My spinal tap won't show the rings. Other stuff in my spinal fluid like very high protein. Those problems I have to deal with when they come. The rings that show up in spinal fluid is because autoimmune problem won't let me fight inflammation anymore because of this in my spine. I had one pain specialist that fracture my spine in 4 places showing me these parts of my spine problems with these twists. Felt something in the 3rd twist. Percocet wore off and more pain I didn't want. Next pain specialist gave me an injection in buttock area. Doctor was interupted during this and forgot the second numbing shot. Felt like a 6 inch nail went in my poor crippled and hurting body severely stiffen and I learned tears can actually shoot out like bullets. NO more needles and no more steroids because I am diabetic.Steroids were messing with me so bad my PC doctor had to call them and said no more steroids. After that my orthodedic doctor found me another doctor. I had a really bad fall 3 years ago.Top of back foot stepping went completely under a mat. When my back foot let loose I went straight down into hard packed dirt. I was in wheelchair for 5 months. All the injuries were multiple lower fracture ribs and cartledge, hairline fracture in tibia, my spine went out like an accordin and when I hit it came back in. Torn meniscus in each knee and fluid in the one knee made a 2mm cyst go up to 78 mm and needed drained 4 times. Now it gets big and drain on it's own. Spine injury never stopped. Right arm was severely bruise as my right shoulder that can be painful. I have spinal stenosis in spine and neck also. Found out during this time I have scoliois at a number where 2 more numbers that it will need to be treated. Will know soon if the scoliosis was from fall, that can happen. Never felt it till after the fall. So where was I with pain control? My orthopedic was limited to percocet and I was taking ten mil. every 6 hours. Still screamed and cried alot and he sent me to pain specialist. Yea the one who is forgetful giving injections. He was trying differant meds and it was rather they wouldn't work or had a bad reaction. Doesn't matter what is going on you had to wait for your next appt for the month. I cried so much and call them after holding my spine over from pain balling my eyes out for four hours and office said wait till your appt. I had what the nurse call like phantom pain. I really actually had thoughts of using a chainsaw and cut my knees off and stepping in front of a moving car thinking it would stop the pain. It was horrible. I cried and moaned and up hours at night from the pain. This went on for 2 1/2 years. I don't know even how I even went through it. That doctor was putting me on meds that were not helping at very small doses because of this scare. This new doctor put me on 10 mil. of Opana 12 hour. I tell you what.....I had release of pain. It was sooooo like night and day. I do not know how I even did it for that long suffering like that. The medicine last for 8 hours not twelve. So four hours during sleep I can wake up with pain but I get through nights being I am laying down. Four hours during day can be brace or heating pad. I really don't mind that because so much of the pain was killed. Recently went to my orthopedic doctor and he said he seen things in my spine has been progressly getting worse last two years from tests I had . He said I needed surgery and then said BIG surgery. OK...I needed surgery on my knees and it would not be done because my sleep doctor stated I was to have no surgery unless it was no other choice that has to be done. I have sleep apnea and central sleep apnea where I stop breathing 98 time an hour. Brain won't tell me to breathe when sleeping. See surgeon on February first. IDK. Ortho doctor said I would end up in wheelchair. Then 2 years after the fall I was driving and stopped behind a car that was turning left and I looked in my rear view mirror and seeing this jeep vehicle coming real fast and as I turned my head to tell my husband this man hit us speeding and there was no skid marks. My husband and I had both grabbed our necks. My spinal stenosis was so bad and for an hour and half could feel things moving in my neck. It ended up disc hit and pinched nerve and knock disc and hit spinal cord and it bled a little bit. I never had pain in my neck. Just bothersome one time when talking to my son with my head turned. Now the breakthrough of pain with that is a differant pain I do not want. Yes I need surgery on a disc that moved. Not going to happen right now. Surgeon said if I start losing things dropped in hand or losing feeling surgery will have to be done right away or it will never get it back. It is not very good right now. Get brain attacks that is painful. Have 10 plus lesions. Neuro problems that go with that. I tell you what.........I pray that no one else has to go through this with this medication problem caused by other people. It is coming into this country. It was inhumane to let me suffer so bad. People that was dying from herione with Fentanyl made a choice, A very sick choice. I am not understanding it, A mother died here in our city at Childrens Hospital. Her child was very sick. Both parents used up in bathroom and mother died in there. A newspaper story where parents used up and both died upstairs and they were found a week later and their 6 month old baby was found dead in bassinet. Parents found pulled over somewhere OD or passed out with there children just sitting there. One guy in our city used and decided he felt so good he could speed in his car which caused a horrible crash where a little child was toss out of the car and was moved out of the car seat and rolled on the pavement. It is all sad and there is people going crazy now it seems for narcotics. Unfortunate people need medication. There has to be a line drawn on peoples conditions that show on their medical records. I would also say keep urine testing. It is pure inhumane what was happening to me."

It was more of a consultation for a change in my birth control pills. They never asked me at all if I was sexually active; however, they did get a urine and blood sample (which I figured is normal). I’ve never had any STD testing done before, so I have no idea how it works, but would they have just done the testing automatically without telling me (if the urine and blood samples can be tested; once again idk how it works)? I’m kind of confused."

It is fairly small, doesn't seem to be raised up much if at all but it is painful. There seems to be no redness around the spot. The spot showed up about 6 days ago. 3 days ago while I was eating it hurt more and I looked in the mirror and what was left was a small cut (canoe shaped hole) where it was, it was not bleeding or did not appear to be leaking anything. Its been getting a little less painful and this morning It was all white again and still the same oval shape. Eating lunch again tore off the white portion and its what appears to be a cut again. The pain seemed to be the worst about 4 or 5 days ago and has been getting less painful but still noticeable.  I had protected sex with a stranger about 3 months ago and we did kiss."

Very painful urination, constant itch and burning sensation. I went to an urologist, gave a urine sample but doctor told me it’s most likely STD and we don’t have to wait for the urine sample results, he will just put me on 1g antibiotics and a shot and it should take care of it. Two days after the treatment my symptoms didn’t go away in-fact got worsen and I started to have white cloudy discharges. So I called the doctor and told them what’s going perhaps there should be a different treatment option based on my urine sample results.  And hold tight here, they told me “sorry we lost your urine sample so we need you to come in and give another sample” So I am pissed and frustrated, went there again, and that new sample came in negative while I had cloudy discharge, screaming pain when I urinate and itch and burning at all times. They told me because of the antibiotics I took the other day results probably came negative. So at that point they put me on 14 days doxycycline. that actually helped and my symptoms and pain, burning, discharge disappeared within a 4-5 days. I completed the doxycycline treatment. However burning pain went away, discharge etc went away, itching and constant needle rubbing like sizzling coming somewhere inside my urethra didn’t go away! i went back to doctor, same thing, urine sample negative but there is blood in there.  They put me back to doxycycline another 14 days, which didn’t do anything. Plus towards end of the treatment I started to feel fever and tenderness on my lymp nodes.  I called the doctor let them know about it. They told me I should get a full panel STD test, which I did right away and results came negative. And they told me to wait 3 months and if the itch feeling doesn’t go away I should contact them again. (Also I noticed something odd with the look of my penis that I didn’t have before all these happened. I noticed small white spots on the bottom middle of my penis, it’s a group of them round and almost looks like folling a line towards the tip on the head. Which later doctor told me they are pearly penile papules.)  A month after I decided to go to another urologist at that point. They took a urine sample, results came negative but they told me there is blood in my urine sample so doctor will further examine that. Doctor ordered abdominal CT Scan, blood test for kidney functions and a cystoscopy. Ct scan and blood test came good, cystoscopy; she said I had a minor structure before the globe. She told me to wait another 4 months and follow up, because cystoscopy sometimes treats the stricture. Itchy feeling disappeared after the procedure but came back a week after. It’s constant and never ending. I tried different diets, and eating habits, nothing makes it lessen or worsen.  So, 4 months after, around the time I am going to reschedule a follow up visit my health insurance changed with the new enrollment period and I couldn’t go to the same doctor because they wouldn’t accept my new insurance. I found another urologist covered under my new insurance.  I brought him all my medical records gave him a detailed scoop of the story.  Same thing over there with my urine sample, everything negative but there is blood in my urine.  First he put me on anti inflammatory pills for two weeks and scheduled me a visit right after that. Anti inflammatory pills didn’t do anything. So he scheduled another cystoscopy to see if the structure still exist or if there is anything else.  After the cystoscopy he said there is no stricture and everything looks okay.  At this point he thinks that my brain makes the itchy painful sensation and having blood in my urine may not always mean there is something wrong with me.  So he put me on antidepressant pills and told me to not to worry about it perhaps itching and pain will go away with time. So this is where I am now. I am not taking any antidepressants pills, I am refusing it to do so. I don’t think my brain is jacked up and if there is blood in my urine there is something these doctors are not taking the extra mile to look in to.

She told me to wait another 4 months and follow up, because cystoscopy sometimes treats the stricture. Itchy feeling disappeared after the procedure but came back a week after. It’s constant and never ending. I tried different diets, and eating habits, nothing makes it lessen or worsen.  So, 4 months after, around the time I am going to reschedule a follow up visit my health insurance changed with the new enrollment period and I couldn’t go to the same doctor because they wouldn’t accept my new insurance. I found another urologist covered under my new insurance.  I brought him all my medical records gave him a detailed scoop of the story.  Same thing over there with my urine sample, everything negative but there is blood in my urine.  First he put me on anti inflammatory pills for two weeks and scheduled me a visit right after that. Anti inflammatory pills didn’t do anything. So he scheduled another cystoscopy to see if the structure still exist or if there is anything else.  After the cystoscopy he said there is no stricture and everything looks okay.  At this point he thinks that my brain makes the itchy painful sensation and having blood in my urine may not always mean there is something wrong with me.  So he put me on antidepressant pills and told me to not to worry about it perhaps itching and pain will go away with time. So this is where I am now. I am not taking any antidepressants pills, I am refusing it to do so. I don’t think my brain is jacked up and if there is blood in my urine there is something these doctors are not taking the extra mile to look in to.  I am clueless and if I have to take those antidepressants I am going to take it because of my desperate situation.  Because it effects my daily life, gives me mood swings and I don’t feel any sex drive constantly thinking I still have something going on and I don’t want to infect anyone. Please share your thoughts, past experiences or comments, what next step I should take?  Is there other tests that I could take to get bottom of this?"

I can't turn my head or lift my head if I'm lying down. I'm pretty sure it's the big neck veins that got messed up, so I'm wondering if this'll be, like, any lasting damage? Are my veins bruised on the inside even though I can't see anything? Are they gonna be weakened forever now or something 'cause of one lousy chokehold?

I can't take it anymore. I'm an Expat living in Japan. We have socialized health care, so I can go to a wide range of clinics, pharmacies, and hospitals for a hell of a lot lower price than if I were back in the States. But I feel like the service is terrible and the doctors more-a-less make me feel like they just want you to keep coming back for months and months, rather than fix the problem as quickly as possible. A year ago, upon waking up one morning, my neck was in extreme pain. Moving it, turning my head and pretty much doing anything was impossible without hurting. Spent a day or two on Ibuprofen and relaxing to see if it went away, but didn't. Pain stayed in my neck and then slowly continued down to my shoulder, and bicep. Throbbing, pulsing pain. Retreated back to shoulder and neck. Then back down the arm all the way to my hand/fingers (hand felt tingling, asleep). Went to a nearby clinic. Explained the amount of time this was going on and all the symptoms and pain(s). He took some x-rays and found out I basically had a compressed disk in my neck. And this is what was causing the pain. Was given some meds and told to rest. Not much more I could do as it would work itself out in time. Within the next month, the right arm pain went away, but then switched to my left arm. Same pain, same progressive path of neck, shoulder, bicep, forearm. Go back to the same clinic. Told to do neck stretches and some other exercises at home. Didn't help. Meds didn't do anything. Pain remained. Tired of hearing generalities and basically making it sound simply as this is just the way it is. Went to hospital. This is 3rd month of pain. The neck issue is gone. But the pain I have is still this intense, non-stop throbbing, pulsing pain that feels like it's in my bones. It's not superficial. Whether I am laying down, sitting, standing, doing something or nothing at all, the throbbing pain is there 24/7. There are certain extremes of bending my arm in certain positions which does cause more pain, but honestly, as I've told every doctor, if I know that doing X hurts, at his point I am ok to just not do X. But the 24/7 from waking until sleeping constant, non-stop throbbing pain has consumed my thoughts, life and any ability to be happy for 1 minute. I was going to the hospital once a month for 7 months. The took X-rays and scans of various types. They said I have calcium deposits on both shoulders - left and right. And that THIS was the new cause of the pain I have. First doctor I saw at hospital gave the impression the calcium deposits will never go away so I'll always have this pain. Second doctor I saw there (filling in for first doctor) said they will go away with time, thus the pain will go away, too. Taking meds to help reduce them, for pain (just ibuprofen) and one other med to help build up something in the area to help. Pain kinda came and went. Finally he referred me to a physical therapist. But since leaving the hospital visits a few months ago, and going to physical therapy, the pain is back stronger than ever. Pulsing pain only in the right arm - shoulder to elbow. Physical therapy doesn't work at all. And their thinking there is the calcium deposits have no role in this pain, but that it's because of posture? Scratching my head over this comment. Doctor there finally gave me Tramcet, which helped for the first 1-2 weeks, but now that doesn't do anything at all. And now here I am. It's been 11 months since the start of this. I've been to 1 clinic, 1 hospital and 1 physical therapy place. 3-5 doctors in total. 5 different stories from each doctor. And the pain is worse then ever. I am at a total loss as to what to do. It's unbearable. This pain is my life. Sure I can go to work, go out, and do whatever I want. But the pain is always there. It's with me right now as I write this, and it makes me want to cry, get angry, yell at these doctors who insist I keep coming back and smiling as they give me ibuprofen as pain relief which has zero effect. When I mention if it's something requiring surgery or injections (when they told me about the calcium deposits), their reaction was like not even comprehending how surgery would be necessary."

It was protected vaginal and oral. We'd both been drinking quite a lot though, but the condom stayed on. Anyway.. I've developed a little red sore on my penis shaft. It's about 3mm wide in diameter, and flat. Cropped up about 5 days ago, and it's now been 5 weeks since the sex. I'm concerned it could be syphilis, as I think that point would have been outside the condom coverage. However, it's not raised like a syphilis chancre. It's neither full of pus like herpes. Any idea what something like that could be?"

I ran Monday, but last few minutes was unbearable. The pain had subsided on my flank side. However, my left kidney still remains tender and hurts when breathing. My concern is recovery time.

Ive been having issues with my menstrual cycle, pretty much, ever since I started having them. It straightened out when I hit my late teens and then about 6 or 7 years ago it started getting bad again. I couldnt keep track of my periods (it would just start out of no where with no signs or symptoms) and it would last 2-3 weeks. I actually had a few that lasted for 4 weeks. I saw my GP about it and she put me on birth control to straighten it out. It seemed to work for a while, but then I started having ""break through bleedings"" (Bleeding while your taking the pill and not supposed to bleed). We tried a different pill and that worked for a bit and then it didnt so we tried another pill and that worked, but then it didnt so the doc started upping the dose. I was on a high dose of sprintec and I still started bleeding through. I went to a regular gyno and she put me on the lo-lorestin pill and said it would work and this was the best pill she has worked with. I havent even been on it a year and I had a ""break through bleeding"" last month and then another at the beginning of this month (October). It started off as spotting, but has worked up into regular bleeding. The current week is my ""period week"". After this week I will have been bleeding for about 3 weeks. Ive been taking this pill religiously! The same time every day! Im so sick of this problem! Ive never had bad PAP test results and Ive even had external and internal ultrasounds and nothing was found. What do I do? I want this problem to end because its making me sick."

My really bad pain started around 11 years ago now when I say really bad I mean pain all over my body different parts worse then other at times .I have had pain In my ankle but the pain I have now is totally different . The right ankle pain is where all this started . I was seeing  A arthritis doctor and physical therapist over the years and I was prescribed Mobic which worked for a little while then I was taking ultram then hydrocodone . Then because of the drug crisis gripping our nation well it's a heroin problem but that's a whole other subject I was told I was to find another doctor (a pain management doctor) to have the medication prescribed. Well the pain doctors I went To were not willing to help me either after paying them 3 to 5 hundred for the first visit . So I took to the streets where I found what I needed but at a very hefty price . Also it made me feel like a drug addict . But it also took away the horrible pain I was feeling all over my Body and helped me have some kind of a normal Life , After working a 9 Hour day on my feet I just didn't want to walk another step . I would drive home and before I would even pull into driveway I Would start crying because I knew I was going have to stand up and walk and the pain was unbearable I would open the car door stand there holding onto door crying and saying it's only 30 steps to. The bed and that's where I would spend the rest of my night till I had to get up for   work the next day . If my son did not make me something to eat I just didn't eat , to much pain to Get out of bed to feed myself . One good thing is I lost 15 pounds over 5 months .so anyway I am still on pain medication from my friends. Not Cheap . I  Don't go to a dark alley or street corner or go into a a home where there are guns being pointed at me and pit bulls guarding the front door as my co-worker has this picture in her mind . That's where she thinks I buy from . She watches to many music videos or crime shows .  I go to work and some times I even cook dinner and do things around my home . I have somewhat of a normal life now but if I don't have the medication forget it I would not be able to work. It's a catch 22 sistuaton . I need to work to pay for my pills and I need pain pills to work so now if I could just get my Co-worker to understand all of this my time at my work place would be easier to show up to . I was just recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia and was given cymbalta . Don't feel any difference .  My co-worker tells me she is in pain to, which I totally belive ,but she is not doing anything about her pain she complains about her neck ,back and knees . I have recommended that she see a chiropractor or do physical therapy. Because she will not take pain medication she thinks that I should not and that my pain can't be all that bad or I would be out of work. She has no ideal how hard it is to get permanent disability. I also think that I need work just less time because I don't want to become useless or a shut in . Because of the pain I also have depression and no outside contact would be the worse thing for me .  So in closing if you have a co-worker who has confided in you please don't dismiss them or pick on them , show a little compassion and maybe it could help them to feel better . Don't talk about people behind thier backs either because they will find out and it only hurts both of the parties involved and sometimes all your other co- workers . Don't let anyone take away who you are !! Be proud of yourself ! Do not be taken advantage of !!  BE WHO YOU ARE AND WANT TO BECOME !!! Be strong !!!"

The calf muscle that is bigger has spider veins and deeper dark blue veins in it. It also has stretch marks from growing bigger than it should have. I would like to find out if this has contributed to my bulging disc/left side pain or vice versa. Could it have been created on it's own with no explanation. Could it be a congenital birth defect? Would this be something that I would see a neurologist about? I have already been to an orthopedic doctor and chiropractor. I never had an injury that would have caused this.

I was drunk when it happened and I noticed the bleeding few minutes later. But i didn't notice any scratches or cuts and couldn't determine where was the blood leaking from. There was no pain, bleeding was minimal and stopped in 30-45 mins. Since then I am having difficulty to get it hard. Sometimes my left testicle feels slightly tighter or there's a feeling of discomfort, but there's no pain. The scrotum looks totally normal, i didn't see any veins or changes and Urination is fine too. But it's been 4 days and I couldn't get it hard. I tried watching porn and I noticed my testicles (specially the left one) feels pressure if I try to get it up. I do sense that I can get it hard slightly with some discomfort but not easily like it used to be. I am also under a lot of stress and fatigue and have been drinking a lot lately. I thought if I give it some rest, it will heal in a week or so. Is it serious? Will it heal by itself? Has anybody ever experienced this before? Should I be worried? Please help!!"

I was prescribed azithromycin, which reduced the burning sensation while urinating as well as the smell. However, upon testing it again a month later, I was told that it did not go away. I was subsequently prescribed doxycycline. It has been two weeks since I finished taking the doxycycline but the burning sensation still occurs (especially in the morning). My doctor had instructed me to go directly to the lab and get tested a month after the treatment so I don't have to pay the copay to visit the office. However, since my symptoms haven't disappeared even though it's been 2 weeks since I finished the doxycycline, should I go directly to my doctor instead?"

The head of the penis itself, though looked a bit red before (and the area around the tip can look like a patch of dry skin), feels completely fine, while the foreskin is distinctly redder, irritated and seems dry. Also there is periodic mild burning sensation when I urinate that seems to occur at random.  I had unprotected sex in early July and have since had an STI screening for everything except herpes, which my doctor tells me would have become obvious long ago. A second doctor told me it looked like I had balanitis, to which I was given a mild, over the counter cream that alleviated the feelings for a week.  Ever since then, which was well over a month ago, I have still had persistent feeling of on and off irritation. It often feels like the veins in my penis itself are irritated or even swollen, especially one vein on the right of the shaft that loops around the top of my foreskin, goes down the right side of my penis shaft and down a little to my leg, which often feels irritated when I wear certain clothes, like suit pants. I should mention I have sebopsiorasis as well, which leads my regular doctor to tell me to avoid anything with yeast (which I have been lazy about for a long time), but I have no idea if it is related.  It is honestly not debilitating, nor does it come with any other symptoms (say, fever or whatever) nor stop me from being able to have sex or masturbate, though when I do either in excess the vein on the right shaft of my penis get swollen and irritated. But it is persistent and annoying presence, and makes me wonder if balanitis can even exist for this long or is it a sign of something worse.

My condition was caused by a surgery on a cervical disc that had ruptured & during surgery the surgeon permanently damaged the nerves. I still remember that ""no skin on my arm, hand with a cold but burning like a knift scraping up & down my arm"" pain. The reason I still remember is because to varying degrees I still have that pain. If it is cold inside or outside. If I am outside & the wind is blowing cold air/warm air it doesn't matter. I can't stand having anything on my arm. It took a 2nd surgery to take care of the disc. It took me yrs. to get to a pain mgmt dr. After years, literally, of going to this ctr., my dr retired & now the drs., drs. that don't know me, just saw me and immediately are cutting back my medication! They say I am on ""way too"" high doses. I know there is an Opioid epidemic but I have been successfully living on my origional dosage. First, they cut my Soma from 3 to 2 and say I must completely come off to another non-opiod muscle relaxer. I was allowed 2 10/325 Oxycodone/ acetaminophen. They have cut that to 1. I am on a 75 Fentanyl Patch. Oh I change it every 48 hrs. Now they tell me I have to go first to 72 hrs then back the dosage down to 50 and see from there. Now when this all started in Sept. I thought I can try. So far, I can't last 72 hrs between changing the patch & I have to do that in January. If I can't do that, how am I going to drop to a 50 patch? Is it true? Am I taking ""way too"" high a dosage? I need advice. Can someone help me. I 'm not asking for too much am I?"

It appears that the entirety of my epididymis is swollen and filled with fluid. It seems to be somewhat spontaneous, but I'm wondering if the growth comes from ejaculation, as if there is a blockage somewhere and not all sperm is freed from the testicles when I do. But I don't experience pain, nor a low volume or unusual consistency to my sperm. My guess is that it is a spermatocele or some epididymal blockage, but the symptoms of each don't quite match up.

It wasn't anything too bad but it certainly caught my attention. I went to the restroom and I noticed there was a bump that looks almost exactly like a bug bite. It's red and raised up a little from the skin and about the same diameter a mosquito bite would be, just raised higher. There are no other outstanding details I can give about it. It's about an inch below the head and it's red, itchy, and raised skin. I've never had sex before so I'm positive it isn't an std, but an hour long google search has inspired some concern for what it might be. Last night I decided to masturbate without any lube because I don't feel like purchasing any, so naturally there was quite a bit of friction. About a minute after I finished it started itching in the same spot but not bad enough to really get my attention. I just scratched a little bit and then went to bed. Could this bump have something to do with friction or what? I'm not terribly worried considering that Ive never had any sexual contact, but it is uncomfortable and any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you for your time"

Apologies for the length Thursday 14th March i met a lady that id been talking to for months and met a couple of other times just socially, we met and had lunch..and we booked a room in a place with a private booth. Now before i went in the booth i went into the toilet and washed my penis with some handwash that was in the restroom (haha stupid i know!) that was strongly perfumed on the sink and was dark orange in colour..i put lots on all over the head of my penis without even diluting it with water! and to be honest don't think i washed it off properly...i did rinse a bit but not fully and some stayed on my penis head Anyway things got heated and she ended up with my penis in her mouth for around 10 seconds..that was it. I also put my fingers inside her vagina. Nothing else happened on the day apart from LOADS of kissing, deep french tongue kissing (literally loads) So the next day (Friday), i notice a bit of a painless rash on my penis head, like little spots or pimples. Now to add another dimension to this i have suffered from a fungal jock itch condition in my groin, and i am constantly constantly scratching it...ive suffered with this on and off for years..and might well have scratched and then touched the head of my penis inspecting it etc (i was inspecting it and pulling the foreskin back a lot on the Friday)..Saturday the spots started to fade..by Sunday they had completely gone and then on the Monday morning i noticed a little bit of burning near the opening and right underneath my peehole. NO other symptoms..nothing on the glans. So i spoke to her and she is mortified...she had a coldsore a week earlier that had dried up and dropped off and completely healed 2 days before we met(she even went to the pharmacist earlier that week and the pharmacist said it had completely healed and there was nothing there (as we wanted to kiss loads)..she had no symptoms of anything, she has had no sexual contact since last October (with her husband) and she split with her husband at In January (due to him being unfaithful)..again with no symptoms of anything So i got some canesten (thrush cream) and been putting that on, Smothering it all over and the burning although its not really burnining was just a slightly uncomfortable feeling, had been getting better..but now i think smothering my penis in canesten has also made it a bit sensitive..there is a slight bit of red irritation, no lesions or anything. So i go to the doctor...he takes a look and says this is nothing to do with herpes (i exlained everything to him) and that i have dermatitis. So gives me some Daktakort..i dont read the instructions and smother my penis head in it...which seems to make it worse...as in red dots under the glands skin (nothing raised) when i squeeze it, like little dots or blood vessels. I then read instructions and apparently you are only supposed to put it on thinly as it thins the skin and can cause irritation. In the meantime i go for an STI screen (two weeks after the 14th)..see the sexual health nurse who explains..the encounter was a risk..but a low one given the circumstances..she looks at my penis under a spotlight and cant see any lesions and says dermaitits is likely due to the stupid idea of putting strong perfumed and probably alcoholic handwash all over my penis and says with all the anxiety and stress if sores were going to come out they would have by now...and that also a lot of my symtpoms could be down to stress and anxiety Of course all this time my anxiety is going through thew roof..every little itch, feeling of warmth is amplified by ten. I was getting some warmth and a burning sensation between my scrotum and anus..no lesions or rash..but i do sit all day...so started to think i had prostate problems due to stress Have now started putting the daktakort back on and it feels slightly better but it still looks like there are tiny red small dots under the skin of the glans...and it still burns slightly from time to time with an occasional itch. Ive never felt ill, never got the flu...dont ever remember having a coldsore in my life and i am absolutely going out of my mind that i have herpes..it's causing me some serious mental strife!...If i am still getting these mild symptoms will go back to the doctor but the stress and worry is killing me.

I then read instructions and apparently you are only supposed to put it on thinly as it thins the skin and can cause irritation. In the meantime i go for an STI screen (two weeks after the 14th)..see the sexual health nurse who explains..the encounter was a risk..but a low one given the circumstances..she looks at my penis under a spotlight and cant see any lesions and says dermaitits is likely due to the stupid idea of putting strong perfumed and probably alcoholic handwash all over my penis and says with all the anxiety and stress if sores were going to come out they would have by now...and that also a lot of my symtpoms could be down to stress and anxiety Of course all this time my anxiety is going through thew roof..every little itch, feeling of warmth is amplified by ten. I was getting some warmth and a burning sensation between my scrotum and anus..no lesions or rash..but i do sit all day...so started to think i had prostate problems due to stress Have now started putting the daktakort back on and it feels slightly better but it still looks like there are tiny red small dots under the skin of the glans...and it still burns slightly from time to time with an occasional itch. Ive never felt ill, never got the flu...dont ever remember having a coldsore in my life and i am absolutely going out of my mind that i have herpes..it's causing me some serious mental strife!...If i am still getting these mild symptoms will go back to the doctor but the stress and worry is killing me. Anyone had similar? Or like everyone else do you all think i am worrying over what is a low risk encounter and my syptoms are driving me crazy in my own head and making the dermatitis worse Thanks All Gordy x"

Apologies for the length Thursday 14th March i met a lady that id been talking to for months and met a couple of other times just socially, we met and had lunch..and we booked a room in a place with a private booth. Now before i went in the booth i went into the toilet and washed my penis with some handwash that was in the restroom (haha stupid i know!) that was strongly perfumed on the sink and was dark orange in colour..i put lots on all over the head of my penis without even diluting it with water! and to be honest don't think i washed it off properly...i did rinse a bit but not fully and some stayed on my penis head Anyway things got heated and she ended up with my penis in her mouth for around 10 seconds..that was it. I also put my fingers inside her vagina. Nothing else happened on the day apart from LOADS of kissing, deep french tongue kissing (literally loads) So the next day (Friday), i notice a bit of a painless rash on my penis head, like little spots or pimples. Now to add another dimension to this i have suffered from a fungal jock itch condition in my groin, and i am constantly constantly scratching it...ive suffered with this on and off for years..and might well have scratched and then touched the head of my penis inspecting it etc (i was inspecting it and pulling the foreskin back a lot on the Friday)..Saturday the spots started to fade..by Sunday they had completely gone and then on the Monday morning i noticed a little bit of burning near the opening and right underneath my peehole. NO other symptoms..nothing on the glans. So i spoke to her and she is mortified...she had a coldsore a week earlier that had dried up and dropped off and completely healed 2 days before we met(she even went to the pharmacist earlier that week and the pharmacist said it had completely healed and there was nothing there (as we wanted to kiss loads)..she had no symptoms of anything, she has had no sexual contact since last October (with her husband) and she split with her husband at In January (due to him being unfaithful)..again with no symptoms of anything So i got some canesten (thrush cream) and been putting that on, Smothering it all over and the burning although its not really burnining was just a slightly uncomfortable feeling, had been getting better..but now i think smothering my penis in canesten has also made it a bit sensitive..there is a slight bit of red irritation, no lesions or anything.

The calf muscle that is bigger has spider veins and deeper dark blue veins in it. It also has stretch marks from growing bigger than it should have. I would like to find out if this has contributed to my bulging disc issue/pain or vice versa. Could it have been created on it's own with no explanation. Could it be a congenital birth defect? Would this be something that I would see a neurologist about? I have already been to an orthopedic doctor and chiropractor. I never had an injury that would have caused this.

Not sure if any of its connected but if you have some ideas on what this might be let me know! :)"

I have never had a cold sore, though I do get something resembling angular cheilitis once or twice a year. I have noticed a small patch of skin on my penis that is covered in small scabs, that was simply red yesterday, and a few of the hair follicles at the base of my penis look red and slightly enlarged. The two areas do not connect. I also noticed that my penis appeared very dry with flaky skin last night. I masturbate fairly frequently, typically in the shower. Is it possible that I still have hsv-1 and spread it to my genitals, or does this seem like simple irritation? I don't know how to ask my parents to get a test done, but would like some opinions on what this could be."

Recently I masturbated without realizing I had a few blisters on my penis (discovered them the next morning). When I finished I was reaching around for a pillow (in the dark) and my partner, who was asleep, turned her head at the same time and basically put her open mouth on the side of my hand. I felt two wet lips make contact and freaking just land there, so definitely at least some mucous membrane from her mouth touched my hand. I can’t seem to get a straight answer as to whether or not hsv-2 can survive “outside the body”, and does that mean off the main infection site or does it include warm skin on a hand, and for how long? Reasonable chance I had at least some of the virus on my hand I would think. I’d say maybe a minute (or two) had gone by between my hand on my penis and it colliding with her mouth. I’ve seen posts that say “it dies in 10 seconds” but if that is the case why would sharing sex toys be an issue? So much contradictory information out there. Even my health care provider said “no one really knows” how long the virus can live when off the main area of infection. Anyone thoughts? This is so stressful."

I am a 73 year old male in good health. People, myself included regard me as fit.  I am still employed full time in a rather stressful position but am able to handle that well. I get job satisfaction out of what I do. I have a very active life and am sexually active. The problem is that orgasm just does not happen while having intercourse.  My doctor prescribed testosterone injections which are helping to keep the libido levels up but not for the lack of orgasms at all.  It is not easy to talk about this, but, when I masturbate, it is also VERY strenuous to finally achieve orgasm, leaving me utterly exhausted afterwards.  All that is required is there. Erection, desire, everything.  During intercourse it actually feels as if my orgasm is going to happen any moment. I do not try to stop the feeling but alas, nothing happens. PLEASE help me here.

There even looks like there may be a bruise there.  The stretch I was doing involved holding the edges of a bench with both my arms shoulder length, lowering my body and legs downwards, and then lifting myself back up, so as to work the bicep muscles on the arm. As I bent my elbows to lower my body, and was on my way to lift myself back up, as I started the motion, I felt something ""pull"" within my chest, and actually fell for a moment from the pain.  Do you know what type of injury this may be, how I might go about healing properly, or have any suggestions as to what I could do so I don't further injure myself?"

When I was in middle school (around age 12 almost 13) while trying to do a handstand for PE, I landed badly on my face (lol) and chest and some of my stomach area, and I fell sort of like a...scorpion landing, where my legs were in the air and curved toward my head. Basically I landed pretty badly and my body was curved awkwardly, and it was very hard to move afterwards. But I didn't want to tell my mom about it (she had breast cancer and i didn't want to be a burden) so I acted like everything was fine. I felt pain in my lower spine/back and the area around the lower spine was bruised and felt swollen. I guess I pulled something, fractured something, strained something, etc. I just tried to stay away from sports for a few weeks while still going to school and doing everything I can in PE class. After a few weeks it wasn't hurting as much anymore. When I pressed down on it, it still felt kind of bruised. I had a growth spurt when I was 11 -12, where I grew around 4.5 inches. After this injury, I grew two more inches from, I think, age 13-15/16. But I grew so slowly. VERY slowly. My older sister was around the same height as me at that age I got the injury, but after my injury, I started growing slowly. She, however, kept growing at a much faster rate, and is now two inches taller than me. I got this injury in 7th grade and only grew half an inch in 8th grade I think. She grew like two inches in 8th grade. She never had an injury. When I was little, everyone in my family thought I was going to grow taller than her. I also have longer feet than her. I was lactose intolerant as a child, though. But now I'm worried I stunted my growth from the injury. I did track and field when I was 11 - 12 years old. I stayed athletic in middle school. In high school, I did track and cross country. I was a very fast runner and was in the varsity team. However, since that injury, I noticed that my lower spine area felt more ... flexible? and whenever I stretch it, I hear and feel this spongy sound/feeling. I also feel like my posture is bad ever since. It also hurts to sit for a certain period of time. Anyways, my mom is 5'5'', dad is 5'9'', older sister is 5'6''. My sister grew a lot even after her growth spurt :( I'm worried that I stunted my growth from this injury. I'm also worried about my lower back because it bothered me on and off ever since. I did a lot of research about spinal injuries and disc herniation in growing preteens but all I find are articles I can't really read. My lower back does bother me occasionally but I don't know if it's all in my mind, since I left the injury untreated. Sorry for long read. Also.. would a specialist be able to tell me much in relation to stunted growth if I get it checked now? And if I actually did injure it pretty bad, would they be able to help much? It's been 9-10 years... Thanks if anyone can give me a response."
