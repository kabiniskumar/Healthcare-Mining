I had been prescribed a liquid cough syrup (hydrocodone) for bronchitis. Normally narcotic meds make my hands mildly itchy for several days once off of the meds. Initially, my palms and feet started to itch very badly and worse at night. I ended up taking Benadryl which helped for a day and then did not help anymore.  I visited the doctor who put me on Prednisone. While on the meds, I did not have any itching. After completing the treatment, 3 days following the last dose my itching came back but was worse and more intense. My hands and feet no longer itched but my legs and arms started itching badly. I was put on another round of Prednisone which again stopped the itching. 3 days after the last dose the itching came back again and much worse. At this point, most of my body was itching. Strangely however, my hands and feet, scalp, face, and neck did NOT itch.  I went back to the doctor and was put on another round of Prednisone for 12 days instead of 6-7. Blood work was done and my CBC and CMP were normal. Again, Prednisone helped. Although the last few days on smaller doses it did not seem to help as much. I also noticed that I would then have sharp stabbing pains in ny palms but no itching.  I ended up taking Gabapentin because my restless leg and insomnia were severe. This worked and helped the Prednisone as well. I just had another appointment. I still have extreme itching and no Prednisone is being offered. This itching is driving me insane. I have no rashes, no dry skin, no blisters, no hives, no redness. More blood work was done. My CBC showed an elevated White blood cell count (20) but that's presumably from the Prednisone. My CRP and thyroid were fine. There were no allergy/inflammatory responses found. I have not changed shampoo, body wash, lotions, clothes, foods, or detergents. Water, heat, and cold make no difference. I even went so far as to get fragrance free and hypo allergenic. I have cats, but have had them for 8 years. The only consistent medication has been omeprazole daily. I do not take anything else.  I am at a loss as to what this could be. A skin issue should show some outward signs but there is nothing. I was placed on Hydroxyzine and told to supplement with Diphenhydramine and Zyrtec. None of these are working at all! Next steps are referrals to Neuro (to check for auto immune and neuropathic causes). They want to refer to dermatology, but the patch tests and blood work were all negative for any of that.  What could this be? And what can I do to offset the itching? I also tried Zantac/Prevacid as an H2 blocker. Nothing but Prednisone is working and they dont want to prescribe more due to its long term nasty side effects, unless they know the cause. What can I do on my end? Blood work is being repeated Friday. But, I am severely itchy and cant sleep or concentrate."

That didn't help...I have seen my primary care and a dermatologist twice...Prednisone helped some while I was on it, but I've finished that and now the itching has returned. I am using clobetasol shampoo...T-Gel and Nizarol shampoo with ketoconazole. I am taking Claritin. My derm put me on diflucan today...I have no scaling, patches, redness or signs of bites on my head or neck.

13,C0024198,Lyme Disease,"C0015230, C0221232","Exanthema, Welts",https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/allergies/10333/bug-bites-ringworm,Bug Bites / Ringworm?,"Hello, About a week ago, I had what I believed to be bug bites starting to appear on my body, maybe 1 or 2 at a time. They were mainly on my chest, stomach, sides, and back, with only a couple on my thigh, a couple on my arms, and one on my neck. These bumps would just be an itchy spot, which I would try not to touch, and would start to slowly turn into a small welt that looked exactly like a mosquito bite over the course of an hour, but within maybe 6 hours or less would completely disappear, looking no different than a slight pinprick, or long-passed pimple.  There were maybe two times that I had 6 or more bumps at a time, but typically they appear 1-3 at a time, spread out randomly, and mainly on my chest, stomach, or back. I searched absolutely everywhere for what I had though were possibly bedbugs, mites, fleas, etc. and even using a lint roller constantly on my couch, sheets, bed, carpet, everywhere, I never find a single bug, looking as closely as possible. I tried lint rolling on my body, checked my hair meticulously, showered and it would all be consistent, maybe 1 or two appearing every few hours and disappearing shortly after. From everything I've seen, the bumps I have are always much more mild than any reports on bug bite types. Now, I'm hardly getting any more bumps, today I got my first one since yesterday, which I only had one yesterday, but I have developed 3 rashes on my back, one on its own and disappearing, and two on my back currently. I also have two on my leg, one being on my inner thigh, and one on the outer thigh. They start as mildly itchy slightly to moderately red circles about the size of a dime, and over the course of a day, it becomes about the size of a half dollar, and usually around 36 or 48 hours later the center starts clearing, leaving a ring of slightly less red, more pink, typically not itchy skin. This looks to me a lot like ringworm, and less like Lyme disease, but I don't know if it has any relation to the welts that I started with. Is that the beginning stage of ringworm, where it doesn't penetrate the surface, but once it does I start getting the rings? On the rash that turns into rings, there is a hardly noticeable texture difference between the ring skin, the skin inside the ring, and the skin outside of it. Like I said, it hardly itches, and the whole rash from beginning to end runs its course in five days or less. I've been washing my sheets, clothes, and towel every night, applying a topical ointment, washing with tea-tree oil, and ensuring that I don't itch anything at all. As one last side note, for as long as I can remember, the back of both of my heels have very dry, very hard skin. It's cracked, but only on the dead skin that has built up, it has never bothered me, but if I try to file it off, it's smooth for a week and ends up coming back. It seems to me that this is a minor case of athlete's foot, again not as bad as pictures I've seen, but I know athlete's foot is in the same fungal family as ringworm, so I'm wondering if this is related as well. The first attached image show's the bumps/welts/bites at their worst, and this only happened once. Like I said, it's only a few at a time typically.

They were mainly on my chest, stomach, sides, and back, with only a couple on my thigh, a couple on my arms, and one on my neck. These bumps would just be an itchy spot, which I would try not to touch, and would start to slowly turn into a small welt that looked exactly like a mosquito bite over the course of an hour, but within maybe 6 hours or less would completely disappear, looking no different than a slight pinprick, or long-passed pimple.  There were maybe two times that I had 6 or more bumps at a time, but typically they appear 1-3 at a time, spread out randomly, and mainly on my chest, stomach, or back. I searched absolutely everywhere for what I had though were possibly bedbugs, mites, fleas, etc. and even using a lint roller constantly on my couch, sheets, bed, carpet, everywhere, I never find a single bug, looking as closely as possible. I tried lint rolling on my body, checked my hair meticulously, showered and it would all be consistent, maybe 1 or two appearing every few hours and disappearing shortly after. From everything I've seen, the bumps I have are always much more mild than any reports on bug bite types. Now, I'm hardly getting any more bumps, today I got my first one since yesterday, which I only had one yesterday, but I have developed 3 rashes on my back, one on its own and disappearing, and two on my back currently. I also have two on my leg, one being on my inner thigh, and one on the outer thigh. They start as mildly itchy slightly to moderately red circles about the size of a dime, and over the course of a day, it becomes about the size of a half dollar, and usually around 36 or 48 hours later the center starts clearing, leaving a ring of slightly less red, more pink, typically not itchy skin. This looks to me a lot like ringworm, and less like Lyme disease, but I don't know if it has any relation to the welts that I started with. Is that the beginning stage of ringworm, where it doesn't penetrate the surface, but once it does I start getting the rings? On the rash that turns into rings, there is a hardly noticeable texture difference between the ring skin, the skin inside the ring, and the skin outside of it. Like I said, it hardly itches, and the whole rash from beginning to end runs its course in five days or less. I've been washing my sheets, clothes, and towel every night, applying a topical ointment, washing with tea-tree oil, and ensuring that I don't itch anything at all. As one last side note, for as long as I can remember, the back of both of my heels have very dry, very hard skin. It's cracked, but only on the dead skin that has built up, it has never bothered me, but if I try to file it off, it's smooth for a week and ends up coming back. It seems to me that this is a minor case of athlete's foot, again not as bad as pictures I've seen, but I know athlete's foot is in the same fungal family as ringworm, so I'm wondering if this is related as well.

We figured it was an allergic reaction considering what he comes in contact with on a daily (bugs, chemicals, etc). It gradually got worse, even with applications of cortizone, benedryl, and even tried aloe vera gel. The rash itches on a torturous level. Not contagious because it would have spread to me by now. A few days ago, his breathing started getting labored, wheezing coughing fits keeping him up at night (he hasn't had a peaceful night sleep in a week. He's coughing up weird consistency, kind of gritty pasty, phelgm, sort of beige color and he said it's a weird taste (not something he could pinpoint but not the usual taste of mucus). We finally broke down and went to the doctor, they brushed off his labored breathing, weird phlegm and coughing fits as a cold. They gave us prednisone for the the rash. Doctors visit cost $200 which we don't have and we can't go back. Rash has gone down, less red, still itches. We've continued applications of benedryl (pill and cream) and cortizone and aloe vera gel. He said he felt better throughout the day yesterday, but in the evening it was like he had reverted back to mass coughing fits, woke up through the night as well wiht mass coughing fits and wheezing. Tomorrow is his last day of the prednisone, rash is still not completely gone. It kills me to watch him suffer like this and be powerless to do anything, we can't afford another doctor's visit. Please tell me someone can shed some light on this. We have changed nothing in the house (detergents, etc), we do have a flea problem but it's been there for a while and we're waiting for some new treatment for the cats to come in. Treatment suggestions for his condition would be greatly appreciated (remember we can't afford another doctor visit, our insurance is deductible-based so basically we're out of pocket even though we don't even have a pocket to pull anything out of...)."

it seemed perfectly normal and in fact i thought that everyone ""knew"" and believed in it. in addition i believed that this was also true of everyone else in the world, and that that was why people start charities and do good things for strangers, because it was the moral option to pay the suffering debt that everyone has. and finally, i also believed that everyone else had this belief-- not just about me but about everyone else. i never brought it up with another person because i had an unspoken assumption that everyone else ""knew"" this too and was acting accordingly. i remember watching the movie ""the secret"" as a kid, learning about what they call the ""law of attraction"", and considering it further evidence that i was right and was always killing people with my generated thought power.  as you can probably imagine, i was extremely depressed as a result of this belief and viewed the world as a negative place. it affected how i interacted with others, and it made me irritable and constantly guilty because i felt like in order to pay what i called ""my suffering debt"", the only moral option was to spend literally every remaining instant of my waking moment of my entire life helping others-- i believed that since i was ""bad"" and had ""bad thoughts"" that i hurt more people than average. even when i wasnt actively thinking about this belief, i was never able to feel really proud of or happy about anything i ever did or accomplished my academics, art, or writing because i believed that all of my actions except volunteering at charities were ""sins"". now, i dont have too much materially in this life, but i do donate to charities and i help out as much as i can, just because it truly is good to help others. when i had this belief, though, i would actually purposefully avoid people in public seeking donations because they triggered panic attacks; i feared if i got too close to them, let them look me in the eyes, etc that theyd be able to tell i was a sinner. starting one year ago i began having brief (days, weeks, 1-2 months) periods of lucidity about this belief before i see it as true and stop challenging it again. even if i am shown evidence or proof that my belief is not true i simply assume that the evidence is false or misleading and continue. clearly i am in one now. to be honest, this whole time i have been writing this  i am still not sure that i'm not just right and that this is the truth. i feel like there is no way of ever being able to prove whether or not powers generated by our thoughts. i am also thinking about how, in terms of provability and following known natural laws, this is not much worse than the beliefs many religious people have, and that therefore it is maybe a reasonable belief to have after all. i really dont want it to be true and am afraid. so anyway, thats what my weird transient by convicted beliefs are. am not sure if i should call them as delusions, since i'm not schizophrenic, and because for most of them over time my belief in them wanes and my conviction weakens in one particular one, until usually i have some kind of aha-moment where i realize quite suddenly that the belief makes no sense, and i find myself, unawarely, repeating the pattern and developing another false/bizarre and obsessed over belief. assuming that my brain is working the same way it always has, i most likely believe several things right now that make no sense and are bizarre, but i have no way of identifying which ones. i am currently seeing a therapist for my OCD, or i will be again in a few months, he is taking a holiday. i have never brought up the belief about thought killing to him because i never realized it was unusual. i feel very strange and confused right now. although i have many low-insight obsessions, this one has shaped a large amount of my life and contributed to a large amount of what i had thought was my necessary and deserved suffering and unhappiness. i didnt used to think i had a right to live and now im startinn to think maybe i do, so thats good even if its a strange and unfamiliar feeling. but i am mostly afraid of this belief returning. and i also wish i could tell what other beliefs i have that make no sense because i cant tell which ones do and dont. does this sound like anything beyond low insight OCD to you? i am wondering if i should see a practitioner who has special experience with psychotic disorders to help me come up with strategies for dealing with this particular aspect of my condition, or if i should stay with my current practitioner instead. he is an incredible listener, but i have mostly ended up using him as a venting board for various negative emotions more than anything, because the lack of insight about which of my beliefs, thoughts, and behaviors are and arent obsessions is currently severely hampering my success with practicing ERP outside the field (i dont know which behaviors to abstain from and which are good ones to continue doing. literally any action causes me to have anxiety so i can't use that to tell either). also, obviously this is a very rare moment of lucidity for me or i wouldnt be having this problem. im making sure to write this all down now because i know that in a few weeks ill be back to how i usually am. i dont know if itll help or if when i remember this post ill just think i was being ""super paranoid"", which has happened most of the times before"

Also since I rarely ever see a doctor not sure if I can just go to a regular physician and tell him all this...

I have been prescribed Xanax a couple of times in the past, and with the exception of two flights where I asked for a script so I could actually take the trip) I trashed the prescriptions thinking I shouldn't take them. At almost 40, (and since they helped me take a flight), I'm thinking I might be one of the few people who actually need them but also know I'd have to go back on one of the other drugs in addition since they aren't meant to be used all the time. Also since I rarely ever see a doctor not sure if I can just go to a regular physician and tell him all this... Anyway, this morning on my way to work I had to pull over twice, and I almost couldn't even get to work.  I am SOOOOO tired of dealing with it... Most people (understandably) can not imagine how HORRIBLE the feeling is. It's the most extreme terror imaginable - might as well be driving over a rickety broken pair of planks 5 miles high over a black hole instead of just making a commute to work. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for here other than moral support and maybe to let someone else know they aren't alone..."

Should I see a doctor?,I was in a wooded area I must have got bitten by something. I thought it was just a mosquito bite and it only itches tht night but a few days later it was this huge wound that is still healing 2 weeks later. I thought it’ll heal but now I have 3 red bumps around it tht itch. Could they just be dry skin bumps or ingrown hairs? Or is there something wrong?

On March 26,2007 I was diagnosed with osteomyelitis (staff infection) in my right ankle. I was given an immediate pick line(left arm)) for internal injections (saline, cytosine & heparin). I did not leave the hospital for about 2 weeks. Finally I came home. Crutches for 6 weeks, pick line for 6 months. A nurse would come to the house to clean/change the bandages around the pick line.  (I also had ADHD and I have been on medicine since the 2nd grade. I have been on aderall XR 30mg since 2008.) In 2010 I had really bad acne so I decided to go on izatretinoine ( acutane). Since I’m a female I took this for 5 months, orally. Acne went away and hasn’t been back :)! In 2011, I had a horrible allergic reaction to Methylisothiazolinone, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, polyquarnium-10/20 & all sulfa’s. I order to find this out I had to get allergy tested. My skin had massive rashes on it, especially my face. It was like raw skin and hurt so bad. I needed a lotion steroid to calm it down. Mind you, Pantine pro-v has all these ingredients in it. I was also losing the hair on the right side of my head. So I unfortunately had to cut my hair short in order to get both side to grow evenly, including a shampoo and conditioner change. :( Was this allergic reaction caused because of the acutane ?? Did it weaken my immune system? I know it messes with your liver sightly..:( In 2015, my boyfriend, friends and I went to Cancun, Mexico. Personally it was my first time leaving America. Had a good time. One of the days we were on vacation my boyfriend had eaten what we thought was a “hamburger” and he got perfusly sick for 12 hours. Throwing up nothing but clear liquids. He was 100 percent better the next day. Now I wasn’t feeling to good this next day. I felt like I had to poop but I was legitimately peeing. It was like every 10 minutes. I had never experienced anything like that before I was like oh it’s just the food being different. Everything at our hotel was filtered, so I wasn’t too worried. On our way home from Mexico, April 11th, all of us were literally s***ing our pants because we finally had American food. Our bodies were adjusting.  For the next month my stomach wasn’t right and it hurt so bad where I would have explosive diarrhea, perfuse sweating ( I would need a change of clothes) and horrible stabbing stomach pains. I would just cry because it hurt so much. I finally go to a GI and they sent me in for all the tests when you reach 50 years old... this is all over the time frame of a year so now we are in 2016... All my tests came back negative and I was pissed because I’m like how the F*** can’t they find anything wrong with me!!! I felt like a guenie pig or a lab rat!  I get a 2nd opinion from another doctor in the middle of 2016. She tells me to take miralax and if it didn’t help for a month to come back. Welp i ended up back there. She has me take a test called the breathe test and it picks up and measures how much Heliocoptor bacteria ( H. Pylori) are in your digestive tract. It finally came back positive and I had to go on antibiotics 580mg for 2 weeks. Then they would measure it again to make sure it was fully gone.  So it is 2019 now and I still have on going bathroom issues like the stools and pains I described earlier. I have tried probiotics, mastic gum, organic foods, changing my diet.... like everything... EVERYTHING. I have been sent home from work because I can’t leave the bathroom. I just feel disgusting and self conscious now because anytime I go anywhere I need to make sure I have Tylenol, pepto bismol, tums... anything that will stop my stomach from hurting so I can have a decent day. I have been told the H.pylori ruined my stomach lining and It needs to rebuild it self but it will take a long time for this to happen.  So now when I have butter I’m in the WORST PAIN OF MY LIFE, so it seems. Everything else is fine. It’s just butter like... I can seriously eat anything but that..it’s it just me or have these medications hurt me internally? Why do I have so many issues? Now doctors are saying I DONT have food sensitivity, ulcerative colitis, gluten allergy or intolerance... I’m so done with the bull crap ... what is wrong with me now?? Any suggestions?? .. I’m hopeless"

I just feel disgusting and self conscious now because anytime I go anywhere I need to make sure I have Tylenol, pepto bismol, tums... anything that will stop my stomach from hurting so I can have a decent day. I have been told the H.pylori ruined my stomach lining and It needs to rebuild it self but it will take a long time for this to happen.  So now when I have butter I’m in the WORST PAIN OF MY LIFE, so it seems. Everything else is fine. It’s just butter like... I can seriously eat anything but that..it’s it just me or have these medications hurt me internally? Why do I have so many issues? Now doctors are saying I DONT have food sensitivity, ulcerative colitis, gluten allergy or intolerance... I’m so done with the bull crap ... what is wrong with me now?? Any suggestions?? .. I’m hopeless"

I did not leave the hospital for about 2 weeks. Finally I came home. Crutches for 6 weeks, pick line for 6 months. A nurse would come to the house to clean/change the bandages around the pick line.  (I also had ADHD and I have been on medicine since the 2nd grade. I have been on aderall XR 30mg since 2008.) In 2010 I had really bad acne so I decided to go on izatretinoine ( acutane).

In 2011, I had a horrible allergic reaction to Methylisothiazolinone, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, polyquarnium-10/20 & all sulfa’s. I order to find this out I had to get allergy tested. My skin had massive rashes on it, especially my face. It was like raw skin and hurt so bad. I needed a lotion steroid to calm it down. Mind you, Pantine pro-v has all these ingredients in it. I was also losing the hair on the right side of my head. So I unfortunately had to cut my hair short in order to get both side to grow evenly, including a shampoo and conditioner change. :( Was this allergic reaction caused because of the acutane ?? Did it weaken my immune system? I know it messes with your liver sightly..:( In 2015, my boyfriend, friends and I went to Cancun, Mexico. Personally it was my first time leaving America. Had a good time. One of the days we were on vacation my boyfriend had eaten what we thought was a “hamburger” and he got perfusly sick for 12 hours. Throwing up nothing but clear liquids. He was 100 percent better the next day. Now I wasn’t feeling to good this next day. I felt like I had to poop but I was legitimately peeing. It was like every 10 minutes. I had never experienced anything like that before I was like oh it’s just the food being different. Everything at our hotel was filtered, so I wasn’t too worried. On our way home from Mexico, April 11th, all of us were literally s***ing our pants because we finally had American food. Our bodies were adjusting.  For the next month my stomach wasn’t right and it hurt so bad where I would have explosive diarrhea, perfuse sweating ( I would need a change of clothes) and horrible stabbing stomach pains. I would just cry because it hurt so much. I finally go to a GI and they sent me in for all the tests when you reach 50 years old... this is all over the time frame of a year so now we are in 2016... All my tests came back negative and I was pissed because I’m like how the F*** can’t they find anything wrong with me!!! I felt like a guenie pig or a lab rat!  I get a 2nd opinion from another doctor in the middle of 2016. She tells me to take miralax and if it didn’t help for a month to come back. Welp i ended up back there. She has me take a test called the breathe test and it picks up and measures how much Heliocoptor bacteria ( H. Pylori) are in your digestive tract. It finally came back positive and I had to go on antibiotics 580mg for 2 weeks. Then they would measure it again to make sure it was fully gone.

I'm a dog lover. Animal lover really, but dogs ard the only animal i'm not allergic to (or so i thought) so that's the only type of animal i can be around. I have a dog at home (for 9 years now) but since i'm studying away from home i don't see her much. So naturally i go 'awwww!!' Over every dog i see and praise myself lucky whenever i get to cuddle one. The other day i met a lovesick puppy (very loveable bulldog) on the bus making a racket trying to get to me for cuddles. Naturally i go over, sit down by the pup and try to quiet it down, since the owner is busy on the phone and the pup is pulling his leash and staring at me and whining. Licks all over my face and tries to jump into my arms, paws at my face in the process, for several minutes until i have to get off the bus. Totally made my day, who doesn't enjoy some puppy love? But just a few minutes later, while i'm walking home, my face starts itching, and it just gets worse. Pretty soon it's burning and stinging. When i get to the nearest mirror my face looks like i used poison ivy as a facial scrub. It takes an hour and three thorough washes for the stinging to go away and the angry red welts to vanish, but now the rest of my day is a nightmare. That was very obviously an allergic reaction. In all my life i have never had an allergic reaction to any dog, not even a little sneeze, and it's not like i haven't been petting other dogs every few weeks. It was entirely out of the blue. But the strange thing is i got no other symptoms than the burning itchy spots where the dog licked. No watery itchy eyes or clogged nose or full-body itching or breathing problems, and it went away with water and soap. Any other day my allergy attacks last for hours, and i usually have symptoms into the next day. The following day i decided to test... the puppy had nibbled at my gloves, so they should be full of allergens. I rubbed the gloves thoroughly on both my wrists, since wrist skin is some of the most sensitive on the body. I'd definitely welt up again if i was allergic. But nada, no red welts, no mad itching, no burning or stinging. I promised myself i'd pet the next dog i saw and see if i could provoke a reaction (as i'm going home to my own dog in a few days i want to know if i need to bring my heavy duty medication or not.) Today i met another puppy (this one a bulldog too if species matters, but just a few weeks old, wee tiny little adorable thing). He was very eager for cuddles and i consciously let him lick my hands and wrists, then proceeded on my way, careful not to wipe any off. It sounds disgusting, but i had to find out if it would provoce a reaction and it taked a few minutes. I waited half an hour... still nothing. My first encounter with the loveable puppy had provoked a quite noticeable reaction in just one or two minutes. I rubbed my hands on my cheeks and throat just to be sure... still nothing, so i washed off thoroughly. More 'testing' will ensue but... has anyone ever heard of something like this happening, or experienced it themselves? Any idea what could possibly provoke such a random and not exactly mild reaction, or why?"

She craves people liking her so much that she has ended up allowing other men to flirt with her and when I have found out, she's gotten mad at me!   I have been in ill health for 11 years now, and am no longer able to operate in this horrible situation! My illness keeps me from getting more than 3-4 hours sleep a night, and that is divided into 2-3 segments.   And to make it worse, I was a pastor until I had to quit due to my health.   I now find myself wanting to either divorce and live alone in a studio apartment, or even die. (I am being checked now for prostate cancer.) I can't even enjoy my grown kids anymore - and I know it is not all her fault, but I do find myself hating to interact or be with her because she will start another negative or start a fight. I will not commit suicide, but I do not feel any reason to live. I hate to complain or whine, but that's all I do in my mind anymore. What can I do?"

My wife of 17 years suffers from severe depression and anxiety and has since she was a teenager. Our relationship was good for the first couple years and since then its been varying degrees of hell.

She refuses to get any sort of help and when she does it is because I'm at my wits end and she does it usually try to make me happy or shut me up. When she goes to a Doctor or therapist she is never honest and gives up after a few weeks and never really tries. She says ""why bother, it has never worked in the past and I've seen so many"". Yes she has seen various professionals over the years (most of them before I met her when she was 18) but she never goes through with it. Just gives up and goes back to locking herself in the bedroom and sleeping all day. She is also a type 1 diabetic and is slowly killing herself because she doesn't take care of it. We have two amazing kids that are my, as I call it ""reason why"", my reason for doing anything. I have tried reaching out to crisis or some other forms of that and they just blow me off. They ask if she is suicidal or homicidal. As far as I know she is not actively thinking of it, but she has been near death from her diabetes a few times a year, I tell them. They give a list of phone numbers to what ever doctor's office is sponsored by the state at that point. I think sometimes she may be in the spectrum of bipolar depressive. She is almost always depressed to the point of agoraphobia but then at times she is delusional to where its almost like she thinks everyone else has some sort of serious mental illness. A few years ago she had me convinced I was bipolar and I would see these ""clinic"" type doctors that would not listen to you and you were in front of them for 10 minutes, they would give you a script for whatever the drug reps were pushing and you wouldn't be back for 6-12 months. I have ADHD I've had it for as long as I can remember. When I finally saw a doctor worth anything they recognized that and I've been fine being treated for my ADHD. She is a hypochondriac. She swore up and down she was developing rheumatoid arthritis and went to all these different specialists telling her she does not have that. Her ""joint issues"" were most likely from not being active. To make the point here, she plays the victim and tries to saying I am abusive or something like that. I am not abusive. There have been times where I've tried to leave because our argument is going no where and I just want away from the situation at that moment and shes jumped on my back to try to stop me and she digs her fingernails into whatever she can get them into, and I've called 911 to try to get her help and the police show up first and start on me. I tell them I was trying to leave she jumped on me. I show them the fingernail marks and they've told me to take it easy next time they don't want to arrest me. I've done nothing wrong. For some reason my physical size makes me automatically guilty. I am 6'5"" 250+lbs and she is 5'4"" 120lbs. I have never been abusive to her. I could probably fill the internet with examples so I will put a few more main points here and wait for a reply. She has had minor issues with substance abuse over the years. I grew up in a family full of addicts and can see it from a mile away. I recently had to have major surgery and I busted her stealing my narcotic pain medication (that I only took when I was in too much pain). A few months prior, she was busted stealing pain meds from her mother. She was developing a drinking problem as well as taking loads of OTC allergy medication to ""help her sleep"". When she was caught stealing them from her mother, I told her that she gets no other chances, because for me, doing that is worse than cheating because I know what its like to have addicts in my family. I would never put my kids through that. I was suspicious of her when I caught her within the past 2 weeks so I set her up, by set up I counted what I had when I went to bed and recounted them when I got up. She took 3 that time and for the whole month I was about 15-20 short. After denying it for a few hours she finally admitted to taking a total of 7, from my experience addicts will only admit to the minimum they think the can get away with, usually about half or less of what they actually took. I've seen my share of professionals myself and they tell me that my depression is situational. They say that they cannot tell me to leave my wife that that is up to me, but it would probably be more healthy for myself. Honestly, I do not want to leave my wife. I love her. She is a great woman. I've seen her when she is not depressed. I guess I am in love with that part of her. Leaving her would be the easy way out. I really feel that if I left her (she would go, I'd get the kids and the house is in my name and she also waived her rights when I caught her stealing pain meds from her mother) she will die sooner rather than later. The little bit she does push to try is because I am there to give her as much as a nudge as I can without her shutting down. If I left her she would completely stop taking her insulin all together and die within a few weeks. I would rather suffer with her and have her alive then have her dead and not with me. Sorry so long. I wanted to put 10 times more in. Thank you. I just do not know what I can do. I have tried everything that I know and no one helps."

I have read that an allergy would cause symptoms such as runny nose and fever and I don't have that. I am wondering if I could have an intolerance? Or maybe I am just sensitive to alcohol. It's frustrating because people think I'm just hungover and should be able to push through it but I am honestly almost bed bound today, I feel that unwell."

The doctor used a large gauge needle to inject the anesthetic. I felt the needle go in as the medicine took a while to work (and burned like heck), but it felt like he was just pressing a toothpick on my skin. Not painful, just annoying. That same day, I received a Tetanus shot through a smaller needle, and the thing hurt like heck.  I recently got a TB test, and it hurt so badly I nearly cried. I had my navel pierced with a 15 gauge needle and I only felt the cold of the needle. No sharp pricking pain. So I guess my question is, has anyone else experienced this?

Yes, it can return. my husband had it twice around the trunk of his body. There is nothing to compare to the electric pain of shingles. what I can say is talk to your doctor about antidepressants, they can help with the pain and stress of this terrible, life changing condition!"

It's always there. There are no real signs of irritation other than my scratch marks. No bumps, no redness, no dry skin. I've tried everything that anyone can think of. I tried moisturizing, medicine that doctors have recommended me, medicine that dermatologists have recommended me, I've tried switching shampoos and body washes, I've tried switching laundry detergent and dryer sheets, and nothing works. Every doctor I've been to is stumped. Some of them think that it is all in my head, but even if it is, I don't know how to get rid of it. It's been unbearable, and I just wanted to stop.

Please do not say anything alarming to me or just half-hazardously throw ideas out there.

I went to the emergency room and the doctor glued it shut. My nurse—who I BEGGED not to scare me, as medical concerns of any kind are my WORST nightmare—scared me absolutely senseless. She told be about an infection called cellulitis that, if bad enough, could be fatal. So knowing me, I studied up on the subject. Fast forward a week later. My laceration had healed, no problem, but my hand was swollen to three times its size and itching like ants lived under my skin. My doctor diagnosed me with atopic dermatitis, reacting negatively to the glue or the surgical tape that had closed my wound. They weren’t sure which. They pumped me full of steroids and sent me on my way. Present day... now my palms and my arms seem to be having a very mild form of this same reaction to any bandage adheisives. I’ve been wearing bandaids all over for a week. First off, I had a horrible reaction to some mosquito bites about a week ago. I covered them with Neosporin and slapped bandaids on them. But now because of the itching I had feel like there’s more sores. Mind you, there’s no open bloody sores. Only cracked skin like you would see from itching or dry skin. The bandages I’m sure are further irritating that. I’m scared to take them off because I’m terrified of that cellulitis horror story, and I’m scared to keep them on if I’m making the skin worse. I have had bandaids on my hand and arm as well—those have been removed, except for one on my finger. My finger doesn’t seem to be affected, but my arm and especially the one that was on my hand seems irritated far worse than anything going on with my leg. My leg just looks like dry skin, a little pink (like you would see from having a bandaid on, period). But the hand and arm you can see exactly where the bandaid was placed, as there’s a prominent red outline of it having been placed there. It’s not warm or hot or itchy or painful. Or even raised. No bumps. Just red. My doctors are sick of me, because I’ll be honest... this OCD over my health makes me unbarable to deal with. I need to know what’s going on. I don’t know if it’s safe to take my bandages off my leg. If there’s ANY cracked skin I’m terrified, as I’ve read you can contact cellulitis through just a crack and the most common place for it happening is the lower leg, with obesity being a risk factor—which I’m overweight. I’m just scared and want answers on what to do. I don’t know what will make it better or worse. Bandaids or no? Can anyone give me any information without scaring me??? I don’t know what to do and why I seem to have a sudden bandaid reaction I never had before since the laceration incident. Edit: There is occasional itching on my leg, and I will NOT use Hydrocortisone cream. Vets and the pharmacy said that could be dangerous to house pets, so with my OCD I just can’t bring myself to use it.

Anything that has to do with the nerves in your body such as Fibromyalgia can cause this. If you have Fibromyalgia which is very hard to diagnose your nerves in your body can be highly sensitive. All Auto Immune Disorders have a side effect of itching from head to toe which is my problem. A Rhumatologist is the doc you want to see for Auto Immune Disorder testing. I have APS syndrome diagnosed at 20 now about to turn 45 and not one symptom other than 2 miscarriage untill 2 months ago. Also anxiety can have a side effect of itching mild to severe. If you don't drink enough water a day your body can itch. It's actually a very common side effect to many things. Allergies period seasonal or nonseasonal can cause itching. Having oily skin or dry skin can cause this. I hope you find your answers and resolve your itching as I know how you feel. Try yoga or some meditation to relax. Your body can be thrown out of wack by the slightest of things. I hope this helps and I think I listed everything I could think of to help. Unless combined with some other symptoms and believe me your body will let you know I wouldn't worry about it being serious. More so to find things that help the itching get better.

I have been a nurse for 16 yrs. I was looking up something and came across your posts and read them as I am having itching from head to toe. I thought I would drop my thoughts down hoping it would help. First I wanted to ask your ages as hormone I'm balance can cause this and it would not be checked on a CBC Panel (blood work). Anything that has to do with the nerves in your body such as Fibromyalgia can cause this. If you have Fibromyalgia which is very hard to diagnose your nerves in your body can be highly sensitive. All Auto Immune Disorders have a side effect of itching from head to toe which is my problem. A Rhumatologist is the doc you want to see for Auto Immune Disorder testing. I have APS syndrome diagnosed at 20 now about to turn 45 and not one symptom other than 2 miscarriage untill 2 months ago. Also anxiety can have a side effect of itching mild to severe. If you don't drink enough water a day your body can itch. It's actually a very common side effect to many things. Allergies period seasonal or nonseasonal can cause itching. Having oily skin or dry skin can cause this. I hope you find your answers and resolve your itching as I know how you feel. Try yoga or some meditation to relax. Your body can be thrown out of wack by the slightest of things. I hope this helps and I think I listed everything I could think of to help. Unless combined with some other symptoms and believe me your body will let you know I wouldn't worry about it being serious. More so to find things that help the itching get better. Drink lots of water girls and check your hormones! You never know!

I had balloon sinuplasty today. I have suffered from chronic sinusitis since I was a child and just learned of the balloon sinuplasty this year. I went to a local ENT at the recommendation of a coworker. They did a CT scan and noticed that my passageways were very narrow and said I would be a candidate for surgery. After fighting battles with insurance and paying an ungodly amount of money in copays I finally got my surgery scheduled. I wasn’t nervous as I had done a lot of research and heard that it wasn’t painful. Turns out.... IT WAS! The doctor came in and looked in my nose and asked if I had used Afrin as asked beforehand.. I had but apparently not close enough to surgery time so i was a little congested. He seemed annoyed and threatened not to do my surgery. He placed some afrin swabs in my nose and let them sit and then opted to do the surgery. I was given no sedative. They simply sprayed numbing spray and inserted some gel. When they went in and did the balloon, it hurt so bad I was hysterically crying. I was not nearly numb enough for this to be happening. They were able to do 3 of the 4 passageways but it was absolutely unbearable. After the surgery, my head had a dull headache but the pain medication has helped with that. I was wondering if anyone else had a similar experience with the balloon sinuplasty as far as pain goes. I was really upset with the whole process and the way the surgery was performed. I am hoping that I won’t have any problems moving forward."

My name is Nicole and I'm 27 years old. I'd like to tell my story and possibly get feedback from you... My maternal grandmother committed suicide when I was 10 years old. Nowadays, my doctors believe the trauma of losing my grandmother may have sort of jump started my depression. She was the first person close to me that I had ever lost and I didn't understand depression and suicide at the time. I've always felt guilty about my grandma's death, like maybe I could have done something to save her. I know logically that I didn't do anything wrong and my grandma knew I loved her, but it doesn't prevent me from feeling this way. At the age of 14, I attempted suicide for the first time. I didn't understand why I was in so much pain and hated my life so much and depression never crossed my mind. My mom found me and I was rushed to the hospital. I survived and was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. The doctors started me on medication and I started going to therapy. It was around the age of 16 that I was diagnosed with anorexia and exercise bulimia after I went to the doctor because I hadn't had a period in over 6 months. I was obsessed with being skinny and I've always had a distorted view of my appearance. Not long after being diagnosed, my eating seemed to return to a more normal state. About a year later, my mom caught me before I could attempt suicide again and I was taken to the hospital. At about this time, my eating patterns had flipped and I was diagnosed with binge eating disorder. I gained around 40 pounds my senior year of high school. My high school didn't want to allow me to graduate because I had missed 2/3 of the school year in absences, but my parents managed to change their mind. During all my school years, it was readily apparent that I was a perfectionist. I was incredibly smart and I was in all advanced placement courses. I was also obsessed with being perfect, so I was never skinny enough, never smart enough, never good enough in general. For example, I scored a 34 (out of 36) on my ACTs and I was so upset with myself. I had convinced myself that a perfect score may not be reasonable, so I decided I would be satisfied with a 35. I've also set very high goals and standards for myself, which I believe tend to backfire. After high school, I wanted to go to college so badly and I thought that everything would change once I did, but I was wrong. I didn't even make it three months into the school year before I had to withdraw and return home. About 3 or 4 years ago, I was in a emotionally and physically abusive relationship that has really impacted me. About two years ago, I attempted suicide again. My dad found me and again, I was rushed to the hospital and I survived. During these past 17 years, I've tried what feels like every medication possible. I've gone through numerous therapists and I have now been seeing the same one for the past two years on a weekly basis. I've also tried acupuncture. I've gone through eating disorder treatment. I was in a DBT group. I tried ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) and it seemed to work at first. However, after several months of treatments, I no longer noticed any positive results and I had suffered significant memory loss, so my doctors decided I should stop treatment. Presently, I am suffering from major treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and binge eating disorder. I'm also on medical leave from my job. I have gained about 100 pounds over a period of 7 months and just last week, started therapy at an eating disorder facility, where I will also see a dietician on a weekly basis. There is a binge eating group coming up June at the eating disorder facility and I'm pretty sure I'm going to do that. The memory loss from ECT has greatly effected my condition. My long term memory feels like its been wiped clean and I struggle with my short term memory. My mom is just about the only support system that I have (although my brothers and dad would be there for me if I asked them or if I needed them) besides my doctors because I've really isolated myself from what few friends I have lately. I'm in such a dark place, but I've been managing to keep going. My two main goals in life were to have my grandpa walk me down the aisle for my wedding and to have a baby girl, which I would name after my grandpa and grandma, and she would be able to meet my grandpa. I wanted to be able to show her a picture of them together when she got older while I tell her stories about him and what a great man he was. When I was in town for my grandma's funeral, my grandpa had taken me for a walk outside his apartment. My cousin was getting married a month later and had been asking my parents if they would be back for the wedding. While on the walk, I asked my grandpa if he would be at my wedding and he promised me he would. I asked him if he'd walk me down the aisle and he said yes. Ever since then, that had been my dream. I've actually been dreaming a lot about my wedding lately and the only clear part of my dreams was my dad pushing my grandpa in his wheelchair down the aisle while I held his hand. It really helped me believe that I could get through this and it gave me something to work for. I knew my grandpa was getting older, but I had convinced myself he would hang on until he walked me down the aisle like he promised. My grandpa died yesterday. I've already recognized that my high school dreams of going to college and becoming extremely successful in a legal or psychological field among many other dreams are, perhaps, not realistic at this time. I feel okay about it, but yesterday, my remaining dreams and goals were crushed. My grandpa was such an important part of my life and I loved him so much. He was also the main reason I hadn't attempted suicide - I didn't want him to have to go to my funeral. I'm so lost and hurt right now. Lately, I've been considering TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) and Ketamine infusion, but I'm still in the research phase. My weekly therapy appointments haven't been helping as much lately and I've started eating disorder treatment because my therapist doesn't feel equipped enough to handle my eating and body image issues. My psychiatrist has been weaning off my medication one at a time because she thinks I'm suffering from Serotonin Induced Apathy and she plans on starting completely new on medication after she takes me off all the ones I'm taking now (I'm at maximum dosages of all my medications). My grandpa's death is a major blow to my state of mind right now. I want to pull through, I want to get better, I want to have a normal, healthy life and be happy, but I'm so confused as to how to get there and right now, I'm in so, so, so much pain. I feel like I've tried just about all of the possible treatments and medications and I'm still so depressed. I was wondering if anyone knows of any other treatments that have been successful for them or others? Any really helpful tools or suggestions? I'm really desperate at this point."

My name is Nicole and I'm 27 years old. I'd like to tell my story and possibly get feedback from you... My maternal grandmother committed suicide when I was 10 years old. Nowadays, my doctors believe the trauma of losing my grandmother may have sort of jump started my depression. She was the first person close to me that I had ever lost and I didn't understand depression and suicide at the time. I've always felt guilty about my grandma's death, like maybe I could have done something to save her. I know logically that I didn't do anything wrong and my grandma knew I loved her, but it doesn't prevent me from feeling this way. At the age of 14, I attempted suicide for the first time. I didn't understand why I was in so much pain and hated my life so much and depression never crossed my mind. My mom found me and I was rushed to the hospital. I survived and was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. The doctors started me on medication and I started going to therapy. It was around the age of 16 that I was diagnosed with anorexia and exercise bulimia after I went to the doctor because I hadn't had a period in over 6 months. I was obsessed with being skinny and I've always had a distorted view of my appearance. Not long after being diagnosed, my eating seemed to return to a more normal state. About a year later, my mom caught me before I could attempt suicide again and I was taken to the hospital. At about this time, my eating patterns had flipped and I was diagnosed with binge eating disorder. I gained around 40 pounds my senior year of high school. My high school didn't want to allow me to graduate because I had missed 2/3 of the school year in absences, but my parents managed to change their mind. During all my school years, it was readily apparent that I was a perfectionist. I was incredibly smart and I was in all advanced placement courses. I was also obsessed with being perfect, so I was never skinny enough, never smart enough, never good enough in general. For example, I scored a 34 (out of 36) on my ACTs and I was so upset with myself. I had convinced myself that a perfect score may not be reasonable, so I decided I would be satisfied with a 35. I've also set very high goals and standards for myself, which I believe tend to backfire. After high school, I wanted to go to college so badly and I thought that everything would change once I did, but I was wrong. I didn't even make it three months into the school year before I had to withdraw and return home. About 3 or 4 years ago, I was in a emotionally and physically abusive relationship that has really impacted me. About two years ago, I attempted suicide again. My dad found me and again, I was rushed to the hospital and I survived. During these past 17 years, I've tried what feels like every medication possible. I've gone through numerous therapists and I have now been seeing the same one for the past two years on a weekly basis. I've also tried acupuncture. I've gone through eating disorder treatment. I was in a DBT group. I tried ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) and it seemed to work at first. However, after several months of treatments, I no longer noticed any positive results and I had suffered significant memory loss, so my doctors decided I should stop treatment. Presently, I am suffering from major treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and binge eating disorder. I'm also on medical leave from my job. I have gained about 100 pounds over a period of 7 months and just last week, started therapy at an eating disorder facility, where I will also see a dietician on a weekly basis. There is a binge eating group coming up June at the eating disorder facility and I'm pretty sure I'm going to do that. The memory loss from ECT has greatly effected my condition. My long term memory feels like its been wiped clean and I struggle with my short term memory. My mom is just about the only support system that I have (although my brothers and dad would be there for me if I asked them or if I needed them) besides my doctors because I've really isolated myself from what few friends I have lately. I'm in such a dark place, but I've been managing to keep going. My two main goals in life were to have my grandpa walk me down the aisle for my wedding and to have a baby girl, which I would name after my grandpa and grandma, and she would be able to meet my grandpa. I wanted to be able to show her a picture of them together when she got older while I tell her stories about him and what a great man he was.

I got a couple more similar bites and then one that I knew was a tick bite (I pulled the tick off) that refused to stop itching. When the weather turned warm, the first bite swelled horribly, and all of them itched like crazy, so I went to the doctor. He said it looked like an allergy and gave me some steroid cream, which didn't help at all. Then he sent me to a dermatologist, who agreed it looked like an allergy but put me on doxycycline due to the known tick bite and took a biopsy. About an hour after I took the doxycycline, the itching drastically reduced. Unfortunately the medicine gave me such severe heartburn that I was only able to take it a few days. The biopsy results confirmed it was just an allergy, so she put me on a stronger steroid cream, and that one does seem to be doing the trick. The bites seem to be continuing to shrink. I wanted to share this because I initially looked for help on the internet and found only stories of despair. I want people to know that there is hope."

I am very groggy and could easily go back to sleep for the rest of the day after one of these episodes. I've been on several different medications and have been hospitalized once with numerous tests (EKG, EEG, MRI, XRAYS, CT scans, bloodwork, etc.). So far I've gotten no answers. There doesn't seem to be a common denominator...until I came across the possibility that there may be a link to the Serotonin levels and Bipolar Disorder. Could this be a possibility?

ALWAYS has. He chooses to eat that more than anything else .  So we thought it was absolutely weird and we would have NEVER thought that it was the pizza... My sister & the kids went to a Birthday party at Chuck-e-Cheese that evening,  (Remind you they ALL ate the pizza, all 4 of them ate the pizza, but ONLY my nephew broke out) so when they got home they noticed that he had broken out all over his body even behind his ears & all that. We thought it was from when we gave him a shower and used this new cheapish kid shampoo ... They ended up going away after a oatmeal bath & some children's allergy meds... But the next early afternoon about 11:30am this kid of course wanted some pizza.. He had just woken up & everything so we know he hadn't done anything, nor ate anything yet as well BESIDES the left over pizza from Chuck-E-Cheese.. We come back in the room after 5 MINUTES of giving it to him, he was COVERED again, he had broken out all over again. We called to get the ingredients but NOTHING was standing out.. Of course we gave him another oatmeal bath and then gave him a bit of allergy meds as well and of course it went away again.  They have not came back at all thank God but we are just curious and VERY confused so if anyone thinks they know what it was could you let me know i'd absolutely appreciate it... Hes doing great now, there's no signs of it anymore! But I am just extremely curious to know what it was!"

Drawn blood, vaccines, shots for illness, steroid injections, you name it. Everything online is stating it's most likely due to nerves, but unless it's deeply rooted psychologically, I don't believe that to be correct. I don't get nervous or anxious about the shot and I warn the physician ahead of time what will happen. It's consistent to the point where I'm not anxious because I already know what's going to happen. It sets in roughly half-way through blood being drawn and a handful of seconds after shots. The doctors are always confused by it and state that my reactions to the shot are definitely noticeable.  Is there a chance it could be some type of allergy or am I really just more anxious that I think I am?"

About a week ago, I went to my first carnival and on the first and only ride I went on I had what I guessed was a anxiety attack. The funny thing is, a few months ago I went to Disney World and went on almost every ride, but no problems. It was extremely fun. My mom told me that it might be because I had no control over that ride and that triggered anxiety. I'm not sure though. Ever since then, I wake up at night gasping for air and sometimes when I'm laying down, my hands start to randomly shake. I'm also easily startled now and my breaths become shallow. I have always been an anxious worrisome person, fearing the worst. I am a 13 year-old girl. Like it has gotten worse. Sometimes at night I think someone is going to come and murder my family or steal us and I always make sure to check every door and windows and double check everything. I feel like I may have anxiety. I'm terrified of car crashes, death, kidnap and anything bad that could go wrong that I always cant stop myself from thinking about. I'm always fearing the worst. Any little noise scares me also. Can someone tell me what it is?"

About the end of November his half brother moved in for a few weeks. They started hanging out all the time and going out places and to parties. So we thought maybe he was feeling better...  But then things started getting really weird. One day I came home from work and he started saying all these weird spiritual things. Telling me I needed to protect myself my mind and my spirit. Telling me he had seen things. Then he told me that the previous night, he had channeled an angel. He's a religious person. But the was he was talking was not like him at all. Over the next couple of weeks he got stranger. He would be talking with us and then mid sentence just stop and stare. And he wouldn't remember anything about what we were talking about. He kept randomly saying weird things like ""Do you know?"" And we'd ask what. He'd just smile and say we weren't ready. Or that he knew we did know. I'd walk in and he'd just be standing and looking at nothing. And then talk nonsense again.  Then one night he wanted to talk to me. So I sat down with him to talk and he kept getting distracted and stalling. Finally I got him to settle down and get comfortable. The next hour I experienced a conversation with two distinct versions of him. One (it seemed more like the real him) would cry and say things like ""Help me I'm so scared!"" ""I don't know what to do. What do I do?"" ""I hate the way I am. This isn't me"" The other version was saying really bizarre things. Asking me how long I'd been in this world. Then asking ""Are you my mom?"" I'd reply no. ""Are you my sister?"" ""Are you my daughter?"" ""Well then are you me?"" He kept finding all these ""deeper"" meanings to things and talking about all these spiritual things. It was very unsettling. I could tell which one was which. His whole face would change.  The next day my boyfriend, a friend and I all sat down and talked to him. For four hours we talked to him about what had been going on in his life. He told us he'd been blacking out. Getting lost while driving and asking people on the side of the road how to get home. He told us he'd had a vision the world was going to end on Christmas Day. Slowly we started to uncover childhood trauma. The closer we got to it the more prominent and nonsensical the other version of himself was. At one point he just stared at me and said ""Should I listen to him?"" We asked him who. He wouldn't tell us at first but then he told us someone right at that moment was telling him he was sick in his heart. After we finally brought out the repressed memories from his childhood he seemed so relieved.  He seems to be okay currently. But we are very concerned. I know he was seeing a therapist but he won't go anymore. He has anti depressants but he had stopped taking them at the time and isn't taking them now. And I know he was smoking a lot of marijuana at the time. We've done a lot of research but we don't know if it could be Multiple Personality Disorder, Schizophrenia, Manic Depression.....we have no clue. We also don't know how to get him help. Or if its dangerous to have him living with us. He's 22. We don't know his parents and don't have a way to get in contact with them.  Even though he seems to be normal.

It's probably been ongoing for a year or more but is now much worse. It makes no difference to scratch the skin. What seems to help sometimes is to massage the area which is the upper rib cage right side near the nipple. There is no definite source I can determine other than this area which is about the size of my hand. If I scratch it it comes back with vengeance. This condition asserts itself several times day and night. An episode lasts for up to an hour. Constant massage probing and pushing with fingers will to calm it. Sometimes it's best to just bear the itch which will then stop after a few seconds turning to something between pain and itching. Then in a few seconds it returns. Again I can't pinpoint a definite location as you could with a bug bite. So could this be a symptom of a disease? I know itching can be a sign of healing. A year or two ago I had gynecomastia surgery-no cancer was detected but there was an area near and under the nipple that was sensitive to pain and may still be present. This was in addition for appearance sake the reason for the surgery. However the itching along with that pain may have been present before the surgery.

I am a 40 year old male in good overall health with no dietary or food allergy issues. About 8 mos. ago I had to stop drinking alcohol because of a stomach ulcer, which has since healed. My doctor gave me the go-ahead to consume alcohol again occasionally. For ~20 years prior to that I regularly consumed alcohol. I have always had a very high alcohol tolerance, never had any issues with feeling ill while drinking, and very rarely would have a hangover.  A few weeks ago I had one glass of wine with dinner (the first alcoholic beverage since I had stopped), and very shortly thereafter developed a massive headache and extreme nausea. I had to go to bed early, did not sleep well, and felt really off the next day. I did not connect this with the wine at the time; I thought I was just under the weather.

I've been blessed as a beautiful, professionally successful woman with a graduate degree from a world's no.1 university. But now I quit my well-paid job and staying at home watching cheesy movies for 10 months despite being buried in college loan. It is hard for me to go out and meet people since I am in fear of social judgement. I came from a poor background so I have to work a lot to support myself and my family and my degrees. But when I got accepted to a top university, my female friends criticized me for not supporting my family but paying for my degree instead. (I bought a house for my family and supporting them from food to vehicles). But my close friends said I am a bad person who is not treating my family well because I did not pay for a more expensive wedding of my brother. (I was studying and in debt with my college degree and I could not even afford enough food for myself at that time. So I paid for my brother's wedding from my part-time job and could not afford to have the wedding in a good hotel as my friends said it should). What they said hurt me to the point that I decided to cut off ties with them. The problem is they told other friends about that and it started spreading to my professional circle.   It was not better at university. The university I went to is a top university dominated with rich people. I found some of my classmates could not bear with the fact that I was from a much more underprivileged background but still perform well in class. So when they found out that I was in a financial situation (I did not have a grant for second year), they said I am a liar. (They did not believe I came from an underprivileged background). It was to the point that I decided not to attend any class event anymore.( Another Asian classmate made the same decision so we hang out together instead).  I was very disappointed because I expect a very happy time with peers.  Now my family is supporting me. They no longer demand me for my financial support. Few months ago, my mother told me my sister in law did not like me to stay with them in my house. (I bought a house and brought my mother and my brother's family to live with since they don't have enough income). So I rented a place to live alone until I ran out of money and came back. The problem was my mother thought my brother would support her since he is a son, so she was very insecure that the house belong to me. I gave my house to my brother to secure her (long story. They are not bad people at all. They just don't know what to do in a city since we are immigrants from a remote area). By the way, I know my family may run out of patience if I keep continue not to work and not to have income. But I am still in a lot of pain, and fear, to meet people and to start working. What can I do now???"

I could not get out of bed. Six months later my elderly Father-in-law passed away and in the next year my cousins six year old Daughter died, my 56 year old cousin passed away and my close Friend who just turned 40 also passed away of a brain tumor. For 1 1/2 years I could not catch my breath! If I was not at work you could find me curled up in the fetal position in my bed. In the beginning my Husband was supportive however as time went by he told me to ""Get a grip and get over it as he had done with his Father's death!"" Our circumstances were entirely different in as he said ""Getting over it"" support wise. He was the baby of the family and still had his Mother who favored him and was well taken care of along with his Father by both of us over the first 18 years of our marriage. I on the other hand had very little support due to the fact that my Father was verbally, mentally and physically abusive to myself and my Mother and still trying to control me as an adult. My only sibling who was 7 years older than I obviously inherited my Father's traits since she tried to smother me to death in my crib, throw me down a well, locked me in the cellar of our house with no lights on every time she was supposed to babysit me, gave me black eyes and split lips, etc, etc. The more my Husband aggressively pushed me to have sex at his whim, go out, do the ""Norm"" the more depressed I became. Then the accusations came from him that if I no longer was interested in having sex when he wanted it I must be cheating on him. OMG! Was he kidding me? Nope. Turns out he was the one cheating. So finally a Doctor friend of mine sent me to a Psychiatrist friend of hers when I could no longer get out of bed, go to work, stop shaking, stop crying and had the look of death in my eyes. I can't say I remember anything from my first several appointments except being curled up in the fetal position in a chair in the Psychiatrists office. But within a couple of weeks I felt like a totally different woman. The medication started to kick in and the shaking, excessive crying, out of control racing thoughts all slowly came into control little by little. Not once did she say to me: ""And how does that make you feel?"" I've told her many times over the years that is the stupidest question Psychiatrists ask and had she said that to me I would have walked out. She chuckles. My Psychiatrist lets me know that she is amazed at the ""Strength and Power I have within me to make it to my 40's before having a break down with all the abuse I suffered from birth."" She is my ""Safe Place"" and has helped me through a messy divorce, helped me deal with all the abuse from my Father and Sister and supported me in my decision to permanently walk away from both of them for the betterment of my mental health. I have to say my life has been much more peaceful since that decision. But, it was not a decision I made lightly or quickly or that would be right for everyone. It has been 11 years that I have been seeing my amazing Psychiatrist and taking Seroquel and I can't tell you what a difference she and the medication have made in my life. I had held everything in for 40 some years but there came a breaking point. I'm so grateful for the professional help I received when that breaking point came. I am 58 years old now living a fantastic single life by my own choice, travelling to Africa by myself for a month at a time with no fear what so ever and coming home feeling like I have just lived the dream. I've taken and will take other trips by myself and with my girlfriends. Life can be good, don't ever give up."

Usually around 2 or 3 rash patches will form and then go away. After they go away another 2 or 3 rash patches come up. I've been taking Cetirizine & methylprednisolone for it. I first started with the 6 day pack and it worked really well, but it never stopped my hives from appearing it just prevented them from becoming a rash. After I was finished with the 6 day pack it returned bad. My doctor is putting me on 1 daily methylprednisolone pill. It didn't stop it so I've been also taking Cetirizine. That worked out really well for awhile but now its not working that much anymore. Just a hour ago I started to get hives on my arm and I went to check on the rash patch I have on my leg and it was a deep purple. I took another Cetirizine and in just a couple of mins my leg rash was pretty much gone (a couple of red specs). Has anyone or does anyone know why its this constant pattern of one going away and another appearing?  I'm going to my doctors Friday and if there are any certain treatments or things I should ask to check id love to be informed!"

I don't want to scare you, but there is a forest just up ahead. One so dense and dark, the sunlight won't reach you for awhile. You will wander lost, in this long, perilous night, not knowing if it will ever come to an end. But believe me, the light will find you again, and when it does, you will no longer be afraid of the dark.  Stop to catch your breath. Soon, a jagged mountain of ice will rise before you, so steep it will make you want to turn back around. Don't despair; the first foothold is always the most difficult and every inch you claim of that cold, hard precipice will only make you stronger. Before you know it, the ground will level out beneath you, and you will look back to see you had conquered what you once thought impossible.  See that turn just up ahead? That's the place where love will meet you, with arms so warm it will melt away the winter in an instant. And then, it will be summer for a very long time.  [This was written by Lang Leav]"

I grew up in a very abusive and horrible environment with no supervision no parents around and nobody to protect me. Im writing this because i know how many people are out there suffering right now. whether your addicted to pills or dope or just sex. or Maybe all 3 and then some. Let me tell you about me i have suffered abuse for decades that is hard for most people to fathom. I started doing drugs at a very young age and by the time i was 17 i was addicted to extacy and oxycontin. I kept it hidden from almost everyone because the moment i started to take them my brain finally shut down and my problems went away. This became my coping mechanism for many years and in addition, I have overdosed so many times i should be dead a 100 times over. I got tired of being another statistic and i figured out a whole new way to deal with life a much better one and im happy for the first time in 30 years when i was a baby. I did every opiete that existed and eventually went to heroin in 2010. it took a few more wake up calls before i finally got gods message to me. God basically told me stop trying to kill yourself you have a big purpose and to trust the universe. That is something thats hard for me. However, I figured out how to beat everything and finally live a normal life. I have been living the best part of my life ever in the last 3 years. 3 years ago i quit smoking cigerettes and methadone at the same time along with xanax and all kinds of other medications and drugs. I took the drugs to mask my pain and feelings from childhood and when i was young adult, Furthermore, I really hit rock bottom 3 years ago I was trying to die and i wanted to yet part of me still wanted to live. I have knowledge now through a program i developed on my own without anybody's help on how to get off drugs how to change everything around and actually be happy. Is it easy? Hell no but after several months and a couple years of fighting myself and everything else nonstop i finally realized that i was waisting my life and my potential and i have unlimited potentional i guess that happens when you have an IQ in the 160s. The way hospitals in this country and any other know nothing about treating people that are mentally ILL they know nothing about substance abuse and thats all it is substance abuse. That bs about it being a disease in my oppinion its a cop out so that person can use it to try and forgive themselves but it wont work it never does. Eventually even after 5, 10,20 and even 30 years of sobriety they still relapsed. Doing drugs and letting yourself get addicted to them is a choice. not a disease. If i could get my message out there i can help so many of you. If the rehabs and hospitals had my knowledge and adopted the protocols that 92% failure statistic would easily drop down below 10%. I have kicked everything you can think and yes i even kicked methadone a bunch of times cold turkey it was insanity. It takes work but if your willing to try my program works. Im not trying to make any money or sell my knowledge or services for any reason other then to help those who suffer. My name is Jimmy and 3 years ago i was in the hospital with kidney failure i was basically dead my entire body shut down. My right arm suffered severe nerve damage on all 3 nerves that run through your hands and up your arms and into your neck. I was told i would never write again and that i would not fully recover. I decided no this is not going to be my life i used my anger and rage to get back in college and to exercise at the gym all the time. For those of you reading this wondering whos this guy? he doesnt know how i suffer and your all wrong. I went through it for 21 years my parents were told by drs i was too far gone and that it was hopeless. 3 years later ive never been better and i fixed my credit i earned myself a better life and you can to. The first thing is stop thinking the world owes us anything or people because nobody owes us a single thing. We owe it to ourselves. This is not a sales pitch and im not asking for money i only want to help and i know i can. The rehabs and mental hospitals arnt structured to help people they are structured to keep them sick. I know this because it was me and then i went against medical advice because i couldnt take it anymore. I have alot more to say and im even writing a book about addiction & mental illness ill post on here when i release it which wont be for a long time. IF YOUR STILL READING THIS HAVENT YOU HAD ENOUGH? HAVENT YOU SUFFERED ENOUGH? AND YES NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK YOU DO DESERVE TO HAVE A HAPPY LIFE.

I kept it hidden from almost everyone because the moment i started to take them my brain finally shut down and my problems went away. This became my coping mechanism for many years and in addition, I have overdosed so many times i should be dead a 100 times over. I got tired of being another statistic and i figured out a whole new way to deal with life a much better one and im happy for the first time in 30 years when i was a baby. I did every opiete that existed and eventually went to heroin in 2010. it took a few more wake up calls before i finally got gods message to me. God basically told me stop trying to kill yourself you have a big purpose and to trust the universe. That is something thats hard for me. However, I figured out how to beat everything and finally live a normal life. I have been living the best part of my life ever in the last 3 years. 3 years ago i quit smoking cigerettes and methadone at the same time along with xanax and all kinds of other medications and drugs. I took the drugs to mask my pain and feelings from childhood and when i was young adult, Furthermore, I really hit rock bottom 3 years ago I was trying to die and i wanted to yet part of me still wanted to live. I have knowledge now through a program i developed on my own without anybody's help on how to get off drugs how to change everything around and actually be happy. Is it easy? Hell no but after several months and a couple years of fighting myself and everything else nonstop i finally realized that i was waisting my life and my potential and i have unlimited potentional i guess that happens when you have an IQ in the 160s. The way hospitals in this country and any other know nothing about treating people that are mentally ILL they know nothing about substance abuse and thats all it is substance abuse. That bs about it being a disease in my oppinion its a cop out so that person can use it to try and forgive themselves but it wont work it never does. Eventually even after 5, 10,20 and even 30 years of sobriety they still relapsed. Doing drugs and letting yourself get addicted to them is a choice. not a disease. If i could get my message out there i can help so many of you. If the rehabs and hospitals had my knowledge and adopted the protocols that 92% failure statistic would easily drop down below 10%. I have kicked everything you can think and yes i even kicked methadone a bunch of times cold turkey it was insanity. It takes work but if your willing to try my program works. Im not trying to make any money or sell my knowledge or services for any reason other then to help those who suffer. My name is Jimmy and 3 years ago i was in the hospital with kidney failure i was basically dead my entire body shut down. My right arm suffered severe nerve damage on all 3 nerves that run through your hands and up your arms and into your neck. I was told i would never write again and that i would not fully recover. I decided no this is not going to be my life i used my anger and rage to get back in college and to exercise at the gym all the time. For those of you reading this wondering whos this guy? he doesnt know how i suffer and your all wrong. I went through it for 21 years my parents were told by drs i was too far gone and that it was hopeless. 3 years later ive never been better and i fixed my credit i earned myself a better life and you can to. The first thing is stop thinking the world owes us anything or people because nobody owes us a single thing. We owe it to ourselves. This is not a sales pitch and im not asking for money i only want to help and i know i can. The rehabs and mental hospitals arnt structured to help people they are structured to keep them sick. I know this because it was me and then i went against medical advice because i couldnt take it anymore. I have alot more to say and im even writing a book about addiction & mental illness ill post on here when i release it which wont be for a long time. IF YOUR STILL READING THIS HAVENT YOU HAD ENOUGH? HAVENT YOU SUFFERED ENOUGH? AND YES NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK YOU DO DESERVE TO HAVE A HAPPY LIFE. Remember one thing you have to want it bad enough, but i promise you this you will get better and you can do thosethings that u think are impossible. Im here for anyone that has a problem in life or mental illness or drugs. I do not judge but i can help. Dont be afraid if your still reading this then you want the help and ill talk toyou soon"

Firstly, a bit of background information. I am a 22 year old male working as a bartender in a nightclub. I have been suffering with bad anxiety from the age of 15 or 16, progressively getting worse as the years went on. In the past few years it has been extremely bad due to lots of reasons, the main one being the drama behind my parents break-up which was about 2 - 3 years ago (but the fighting started about 8 years ago). I'll spare all the little details, lets just say I have been through a lot of stress, being the peace keeper day after day with a constantly fighting family. I now just live with my mother and brother. Things can still be pretty bad at home. I am generally quiet and calm during all fights and I always try figure out who is right and who is wrong (if I am wrong I will admit straight away), but when shouting (and i mean constant shouting) arguments go on for over an hour with nobody else even trying to understand anyone elses side of the argument , I reach boiling point and lose my mind and go completely mental. I used to be able to keep my cool, but after going through this literally every day for years on end, I now start smashing, cursing at the top of my lungs, and punching everything (including myself) for about 10 - 20 seconds, like a mad man. Once I calm down after those few seconds I do be in total shock, feeling nearly as if someone else had gone crazy and not me. I do be nearly uncontrollable, so much built up rage comes out of me that I fear for my own safety and others around me. I have gone for councelling and I am on anti-depressants for my anxiety but neither worked that well. I (stupidly) turned to drink for a few years too, but I have recently stopped. Anyways, I suffer with a lot of unusual body aches and pains. Previously I have gone to the doctor about abdominal pains and chest pains, which I was very worried about as I googled my symptoms and most websites said I had cancer or some other terrible illnesses. The doctors put them down to Anxiety and that's when they sent me for councelling. I am finished my councelling a few months now and I have recently decided to come off my anti-depressants (I only have about 2 weeks of tablets left until I will be off them completely) as the side effects are also ruining my day to day life. I constantly feel tired and have no energy, I also don't feel much emotion anymore. Most days i feel like i'm in a dream, walking around as if nothing is real. My memory is absolutely terrible, and everybody notices it too (not that them noticing bothers me) but not being able to remember what I've done in my own life is horrible. I don't feel excited for much, I just worry more about my health problems, constantly. I wake up worrying and fall asleep worrying. I have had (and am currently having) health scares. Some consist of finding hard lumps on my testicles - the lumps sometimes dissapear so the doctors told me they are fine, i have also found unusual lumps on different parts of my body, etc etc. But the doctors told me they are all nothing to worry about, but unfortunately I still worry. I also used to get all these really random uncomfortable pains in my abdominal area and chest. They would never stay in one place for more than a few hours though, it was like the pains moved to another area in their own free will. I went to the doctor and they told me it was because of my anxiety. I think they were right because the pains went after a few days of knowing there was nothing wrong with me. Now, however, I am in a similar situation again. I just got back from the doctors the other day after going complaining about more aches and stomach problems. Basically I went in and told the doctor that my stomach is bloated and is sore, mostly in the right hand side under my right ribcage. There is a dull ache there and sometimes it feels hard inside, but sometimes it softens again. Every now and then my chest gets this tight feeling, and then it feels like some breath has been sucked out of me. Sometimes i get stabbing pains in my chest and what feels like my heart too. She had a look at my file and said that when i got my tests done last year that I was low in folic acids. She then just prescribed me tablets for that and also vitamin D tablets, and put my pains down to anxiety again. Normally once I find out this news then the pains go, but they don't seem to be going this time. Although, the pain isn't so much on the right side now, but more in the middle where my solar plexus is. My stomach can sometimes be sensitive to the touch too. I forgot to tell her that I am very gassy, flatulating a lot and excreting about 4 or 5 times a day (although I have always gone often enough per day, i have a very fast metabolism), it's just now when I need to go I feel like I wont be able to hold it for too long without it being really uncomfortable. I think I could have seen tiny specks of red in it, which worries me more. I also forgot to tell her that I amgetting bad acid reflux again (I told one of the other doctors before though so it's on my file), i feel like my chest and throat are burning a lot and yesterday after dinner i burped up this white foamy stuff. Even today I feel when I burp that a bit of food is going to come up. Actually when i just swallow my saliva I have this weird feeling in my throat like there's something there that needs to be swallowed, but it wont go down. And just there tonight in work I start getting a sore back (bottom right area) that made me feel a bit sick. I was doing a bit of heavy lifting today though, so it could be just from that? The worry is killing me, because no matter what is wrong with me I always think the worst. To make matters worse, we are broke and can't afford to pay for our house anymore so we have to sell it by January or we lose it. It's not making me too sad but it is just an addition to all of my stress, as I will be leaving my family home for good and moving to a different side of the country, leaving all my friends. So what I really want to know is can all these physical symptoms just be down to severe anxiety and stress? Or do you think I should go visit the doctor again? I am very sorry for the length of this, but any help and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

On my recent visit, the doctor prescribed Aripiprazole (5mg) in addition to the above, as a mood stabilizer.  Now, I have a severe family history of diabetes on both sides of the family, with most family members already suffering against it and found several articles online mentioning a link between this drug and blood sugar levels. . When I asked my doctor, he said it is safe, most drugs are contraindicated to diabetes, and I should just go ahead and take it.  I guess I just wanted a second opinion on this?

BUT that seems to be the problem area because after a week or so i found i was COVERED with BIG itchy welts that i thought was mosquito bites, after all it was summer and hot and we had the windows open that had no screens.  So i dismissed the bites thinking they were no more than mosquito bites even though they was weird in triangular 3s and not disappearing for days to weeks at times. But i gave birth to my first child around 10 months ago and been told that stuff could happen since pregnancy can change certain things on your bodys reactions. Its winter now, and a week ago i awoke with my face itching like heck, had a bite mark atop my eyebrow, below the same eye on my cheek, and two marks almost diagonal (but really close) on my jawbone.

A few minutes ago i found two on the back upper side of my arm. I kept feeling like i was being crawled over but whenever i looked i never found anything. I had a few people come and check for bedbugs, and the welts dont resemble any scabie marks that i googled. I got scars from the intensely itchy marks along my legs and feet as well as my arms now.

Recently I've been told my family is in real danger of losing our home as 1 brother has cut off all ties with us, no reason given, and is demanding we sell it so he can get his share now. Another brother moved in XMas of 2015 with his 2 teenagers when his wife walked out saying she's tired of being a wife & mother. She's living with her parents & grown son from a previous relationship. My brother has begged for counseling but to no avail. In October, he was laid off & is struggling to pay his share of expenses. My Mother is fighting breast/stomach cancer for the 2nd time in 14 years, 2 of her 3 sisters have just wrapped up cancer treatments & I've been told I've 4 very suspicious areas in my breast. I'm up to my eyeballs in debt and can truly say that I've no support. I've absolutely no friends as I get so frustrated with them telling me to snap out of it. My Mother and brother feel the same and keep telling me to stop isolating in my room. I own the only working car in the house but never get to use it unless I leave a note on the fridge of when I'll need it for doc appts & even then it's a fight if my Mom has appts or my brother or his boys have appts, sports, interviews, etc. I've a psychiatrist & psychologist & am on meds that seem to work for awhile then stop. My co pay is $45 & the docs want to see me 3x 's a month which I can't afford to do and check in with other docs such as my oncologist, diabetes doc, eye doc, etc. She has also suggested that I apply for a Section 8 efficiency apt. I'm so overwhelmed with all of this & my extended family telling me that I'm the biggest spoiled brat for not helping out more that I want to swallow every pill I can find but can't because it's against my religion & I believe it would devastate my nephews if nobody else. Can anyone suggest something that I'm missing ?? Thank so very much."

As I started to reintroduce some dairy, I've noticed that when I have butter on my food I react within 15-30 minutes; experiencing severe gas pains and essentially spending 3-4 hours in the bathroom with constipation for several days afterward. I do not experience this same reaction with cheese. I've had cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan with no problem. Any ideas?"

Before, I used to be the funny friend who was loud and interested in a conversion but now, instead of concentrating on what someone is saying, I'm trying to focus on what I'm going to say next or if the person is getting bored or when to keep/stop talking. I also pretend to laugh all the time when I'm with my friends and when I actually find something funny, I am the only one laughing. Its become so stressful that I avoid talking to my friends all together. I have declined so many plans to hang out with them and I never answer phone calls unless its important. I struggle to keep conversations going and I would much rather listen to my own thoughts. I hate small talk but I always run out of things to talk about. I do not have issues talking to my mother and father but I don't speak to my sister or brother at all anymore because I have nothing interesting to say so I completely ignore their existence. I can't ignore my friends because I will end up with no one to ""talk to"" and being alone actually makes me more prone to feeling upset.  I have also been getting weird thoughts which lack morals. I feel like I do have empathy which means I can see life from someones else's point of view but I don't feel sorry for anyone. I enjoy seeing other people envy me but I never boast or make someone feel small. Seeing myself more successful than anyone else makes me feel powerful and seeing a friend do better than me fuels me with anger I try to contain. I would say I'm a polite person and I ever insult anyone but I do have very horrible thoughts of what I would do to my enemies since I don't have the guts to stand up for myself. I do try, but my head spins and i feel sick when confronting someone. I don't know whats wrong with me, I feel like I will never have healthy relationships and I just want to disappear."

Please HELP!,"So here is my story in a summarized way: I am a 29 years old male. I was born and raised in the middle east. The way I was raised was very unhealthy. My parents were over protective and they spoiled me. I was living in my own world within my house. It felt safe and that nothing is awful out there. I had friends and we were playing all the time and then I would come back home to my fortress (house) where I feel great. I never had fear or anxiety and I never thought of such things or bad things could happen in the future. Thanks to my parents. I could say I had a happy childhood. Things started to worsen for me when I discovered that I like boys rather than girls. I experienced that heavily in high school. I was feeling the urge to spread my wings and set free to be who I was meant to be. I wanted to be a normal gay teen who has a healthy gay life. It was impossible in my country. Then when I was about 18 years old, I fell for a guy. It was mutual affection. He was 7 years older than me. He was everything I wanted to have in a guy from looks and manners. I fell in too deep for him. Here things started to change drastically for me. He began to be the center core of my interests. I couldn't see other things. I no longer was interested in spending time with my friends or family. I no longer have this geeky passion for video games and movies. All I wanted to do is be with him 24/7. After a few months and with the crazy amount of religious and cultural pressure, he said we could no longer do what we do! At that point, I felt as if a thunderbolt had fell on my head. I was no longer the safe invincible kid who was happy and felt that the world cannot harm him. I was crying rivers for the first time with unbearable pain and weight occupying my chest. My head felt heavy and tight as if someone was squeezing my brain. I was addicted to him like a drug and I knew it was unhealthy but I couldn't change it. I tried to change his mind over the course of a month or so, but he was not ok with it. Finally I decided to be take my pain and give up until some miracle takes place and make me forget about him. When I stopped contacted him. I was just in my room crying and in mental and physical pain all the time. My parents didn't know what to do and they couldn't know what was going on. Two weeks later my boyfriend approached me and he was wanting us to be back! I knew I shouldn't do it, but I had to do it because I was weak, pathetic and needed a relief for my dark pain. We resumed our relationship for a week and during that I was all normal again. Then he wanted to stop again. Things were on and off like that until one night I was completely breathless! I was suffocating and felt like my life was about to end! I was panicking. It went on for a few minutes, then I was ok... My father decided enough was enough and he forced me to go see a psychiatrist. Of course I could not tell him why I was feeling this, but I told him I had an emotional shock because my best friend had passed away. He diagnosed me with depression and hook me on fluoxetine 20mg one pill a day, two months later he increased the dosage to two pills, and later to three. It took around 2.5 years to get back on my feet and get over my ex, but I was still weak. I felt dependent on my family and the only way for me to feel content and safe is home around them. I basically couldn't have my own life and be independent. Later on, I started to think of my family and imagine scenarios that they will die and I will be all alone. What would I do, then? Life made no sense at all. I was miserable in college and living on campus was a living hell. I couldn't concentrate on my education nor could I do homework. I hate daytime and all I like is the night time where I stay up late. I skipped most of my days to be back home where I feel safe. I spent my time hanging out with my friends, listening to music, playing video games and watching movies. Somehow I managed to graduate from college, then I got a job and it was an extreme challenge for me getting up in the morning. I feel awful when I wake up thinking I have to go to work. I quit my job later and it felt good to just be home and stay with my family. However, thoughts never seemed to stop! I felt lost and couldn't find purpose in life. I see my friends growing up and getting married while I am stuck in the age of 18 when I got all messed up. I wanted to get married just to have a family, but I couldn't bear the idea of lying to myself and others. Honestly I even fear that I cannot be potent in bed with my wife if I chose to take that path. Later on, I got an opportunity to move to the US and I always wanted to move there where at least I could be myself. It felt good to do that and finally break free. When things got real and I got my visa, I started to get anxious again and all of my thoughts were upside down! I was torn to half. Part says go and the other says are you crazy? So I had to step on it and take the risk even though it was so much of a mental pain. I lived in the US for one year. I had so much fun, but life was extremely over challenging for a guy in a condition like mine. I felt homesick and my family was calling me daily to check on me. The only way it felt good is when I meet guys where I could have feelings for them. That was the only way to keep me going forward, but thoughts were always taking over. I was thinking that what if I fall in love with a guy and then fail? How am I supposed to have a family with no children to give you a purpose and sense of a family. Life was stressful and I was worrying and stressing out about hundreds of things. Then the only light I could see is to move back home to my shell where I don't worry about life challenges. I moved back, but things never stop. I feel like I need to be in control of everything going on! When my mom gets sick, I go insane. I want to change that. When I don't like my job, I just feel the urge to give up and do something else. Basically I am stuck in a loop of ongoing stressful negative thoughts and scenarios of the creation of my mind that they never seem to stop at all. They get triggered with any minor occurrence in my life or those around me. Now I got a new opportunity to move back to the US. In the beginning it felt good, but now when it is real, it scares the hell out of me. Life is moving forward and I am stuck doing nothing but worrying and thinking. I am almost 30 and I do not have a life literally. I need to study, work and have a healthy relationship with a guy that I cannot do here. What do you think I should do? Is there anyone who has been through something like this? Is there any medication that could help ease my mind and make me stop thinking?

I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I started Cymbalta about 4-5 months ago. This combined with clonazepam has completely countered my anxiety and depression. I no longer have panic attacks and have low anxiety, and very very rarely do I feel depression. When I started the medication, I was at 127 lbs. I am a very short girl (5' 1.5""). The Cymbalta made me want to start doing things again, like exercising and being productive in general. I had been very unhappy with my weight and started cutting back on calories and I now exercise every day. I make certain to get my recommended 10,000 steps, at least on weekdays. Most weekends I shoot for 5,000. I have kept this up and my goal weight was 110 lbs. I got there and was still unhappy so I made my goal weight 107 lbs. Today, I am at 106 lbs. My BMI is 19.8 and my body fat is at 15.64%. But, I look in the mirror and am still unhappy. All I see is fat. I even feel that clothes don't look good on me because my stomach is too big or something along those lines (this is the part of myself that I obsess over).  However, I'm not starving myself or anything. I tend to get hungry often, but usually ignore it as I have myself on a strict time schedule for eating. I generally have a bowl of oatmeal (1/2 cup with about 1/4 cup milk) with cinnamon and sugar or cranberry sauce for breakfast. I then eat a fiber bar at 1:30, a pb&j at 4:30, and a serving of pasta (56 g before cooking) with a cut up chicken strip in it and an apple on the side for dinner at 7:00. I also have a granola bar on my way home from work at 10:30. On the weekends, however, I typically eat too much. I will eat multiple large meals. Last week, I even ate 2 full pans of 6 cookies each. I tell myself I won't binge eat on the weekends but I inevitably always do.  Do I even have a problem, or is this normal? Do I have an eating disorder, or am I on the path of possibly having one? I would just like to know so that maybe I can change some things in my life. However, part of me wants to keep losing weight since I'm unhappy with how I look. Unfortunately, if I lose 6 more lbs I will then be considered ""underweight"". I would appreciate any advice."

Every day I open a new can of tuna to hide the dogs medication inside of it. Although this morning my sister was in the kitchen beside me and I was talking with her, just usual chit chat and I said ""let me see if there's tuna left"", to which my sister replied ""What? You have one right there?"". I said ""how long has it been open (thinking someone opened it last night)?, She looked at me puzzled and said ""are you serious? You just opened it"". I had and still have 0% recollection of opening or even fetching that can from the pantry. I'm a semi forgetful person in general but this really shocked because when I forget something I always remember hints of where I left something or a favor that was asked of me, so naturally this worries me. I'm 25 years old, smoker, slightly over-weight, taking 1mg Risperidone and 100mg Paxil for anxiety, depression and ODC (albeit under control). I've rarely had an episode like this before except for 2 times I can remember in my life such as once I was in the car with my father riding as a passenger, he said open the window and I opened the door instead (while the car was moving). The other one was a couple of months ago when I briefly forgot (or was simply confused) as to how to use my fork and knife to cut a steak (I got there but it was very awkward watching my father stare at me trying to figure out what I was doing), this might have been attributed to light anxiety that I get when I'm getting stared at.

I have felt like I lost her and she is really the only person I truly opened up to in my life but we were both going through different personal struggles at the same time and it was obvious to me that if we ever wanted to have a chance to fix it, we would have to separate for a time. I tried to convince myself that it was over so that I could grow as a person, but I never fully felt like it was. In continually trying to distance myself from her I have severely burnt that bridge, and it has been very hard to understand.  I left my home and moved back in with my Mom, again hoping it would be temporary. Of course, it hasn't been, but everything is in limbo and I really just want to have a home again that is mine. Additionally, I left my job of eight years without a plan of action on getting a new one, figuring that it was time for me to move on from that aspect of my life as well. I left on good terms, but it was not the best decision in retrospect. That's where I am up to now when it comes to my current dilemma. I accepted a job in a new city. My brother's fiancee worked for the company and helped me get it. It was not a job that I really felt was right for me, but I told myself that it was and so I moved in with my brother and fiancee last week. I was quickly overwhelmed and flooded with sadness and anxiety. Nothing felt ""right"" about where I was or what I was doing. I attended the first day of orientation and was panicking all day--everyone else was so happy to be starting work with this company and I was not, I was scared and miserable. I didn't really want to talk to anybody after weeks of psyching myself up to being my former social self... At the end of the day I tried convince myself that it was first day jitters but that it all hit me...I couldn't stay there...That night I couldn't sleep and the feelings of sadness and depression hit so hard that I couldn't breathe. I felt as though this was my last shot at redeeming my life...I couldn't go ""home"" to my wife, because that life is essentially over, I couldn't go home to my Mom because I knew she would be so disappointed and let down. I felt trapped and at that point, contemplated suicide...But in the end, I called my Mom and told her what I was feeling and asked if I could come back to stay with her a bit longer (but of course, the last thing I wanted to do, she had dealt with me enough). I got up and told my brother and his fiancee what I was feeling and of course they didn't understand and were upset that I wasn't giving this change a chance. I know I disappointed them as well--burnt another bridge. I let them down, but I had to leave.  But what was I leaving for? Nothing really...the same sad life I have been living for the five months since I left my wife and my job.  I don't really know what to do or where to go from here. I need to find a purpose and was wondering if anyone out there has gone through a similar situation and if they were able to come out of it. Thanks"

I know the last parts e normal but the thing that worries me is none of the medicine is working ive been to the hospital many times for this and still nothing. They have no cause every time there is no common denominator. With the headache i have had a headache for three months straight and it never goes away no medication helps at all it is aroung my head neck and it makes me very dizzy and my vision blurs. The brusing has no cause i have had labs done and they all came back perfectly fine they are all up my arms, legs, head, and body. I have no ideas if these are connected. I just want some imput. Also i am seeing a physiologist and a counselor both have found no causes of anything.

It started with extreme itching all over my legs. Later, I am itchy pretty much everywhere. I never had any sign of a rash, or allergic reaction. Sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the night from scratching.( I have no known allergies )  First Steps:  Doctor: I first started by changing the detergent I was using. Then, I went to the doctor who ran blood tests, stool samples, urine tests, and everything came back normal. In the mean time, she suggested I take an anti-histamine for relief and sent me off to get an allergy test. I went to get a full comprehensive allergy test - everything came back normal. However, I hadn't stopped taking the anti-histamine as I was not advised to so I am unsure if it could have been a false test as a result. She then referred me to a dermatologist Dermatologist: I went to the dermatologist, and after describing my symptoms, he did not inspect my skin, but he advised that I do a scabies treatment. (Neither my partner nor I have any signs of scabies and we live together ) I went ahead and did the treatment regardless. Itching persisted. I went back for a follow up, and he suggested that I do it again - out of frustration I asked him, if it wasn't scabies what we would be trying next and he said we would start blood tests etc over. Needless to say I did not go back to him. Doctor: I went back to the doctor to explain my frustrations, and hope for an alternative solution to my problem. She prescribed me steroid creams to try, but it was difficult as the itching was not localized. She advised that this could be something environmental that I never find out - which wasn't something I was willing to accept. This condition has been making me extremely irritable and has begun to affect my professional and personal life. Naturopath: At this point, I've turned to a naturopath. Over the last 6 months, I feel like we have tried almost everything. She reviewed my blood work, and did a new stool sample to rule out parisites. My symptoms now include: itching everywhere, including the bottoms of my feet until they peel and get hot. Itching my legs until they scab. Dry stinging chest, itchy eyes. Painful sweating and itching in areas where there is pressure from clothing ie; waistband, bra straps. Clamy hot skin waist band, bra, underwear lines. More comfortable in loose fitting clothes. Sensitive skin to the point where any fabric ( sheets on my bed included ) touches me, and its almost a painful sensation, prickly burning.

Low histamine diet, B12 injections, & NAC SAP Antioxidant, Cyto-Calm to help with my sleepless nights. 3. Liver Cleanse - Live SAP & Chelidonium Plex drops 4.

Going off birth control (Nueva Ring) - I was on Yasmine from age 16 - 20, went on Seasonale for about 1 year - went off the pill for 4 months - went back on to yasmine for about 1 year - swtiched to Nueva Ring, on it for approx. 6months) She has given me Femco & Chaste tree to help with the symptoms.  I have been off the Nueva ring for about 1.5 months now. I got my first period normal timing. Since then, my symptoms have increased, and I have scabs all over my shins, now starting to my thighs from itching my skin so hard. Symptoms seem to be worse with clothing on. At work I get hot flash symptoms. I have been consistently waking up at 3am and having trouble falling asleep for the last 3-4 months now. Often wake up in a cold sweat. When I exercise, and sweat my scalp becomes incredibly itchy almost stinging sensation.  My libido is non-existant, and the irritability from itching doesn't help.

It started with extreme itching all over my legs. Later, I am itchy pretty much everywhere. I never had any sign of a rash, or allergic reaction. Sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the night from scratching.( I have no known allergies )  First Steps:  Doctor: I first started by changing the detergent I was using. Then, I went to the doctor who ran blood tests, stool samples, urine tests, and everything came back normal. In the mean time, she suggested I take an anti-histamine for relief and sent me off to get an allergy test. I went to get a full comprehensive allergy test - everything came back normal. However, I hadn't stopped taking the anti-histamine as I was not advised to so I am unsure if it could have been a false test as a result. She then referred me to a dermatologist Dermatologist: I went to the dermatologist, and after describing my symptoms, he did not inspect my skin, but he advised that I do a scabies treatment. (Neither my partner nor I have any signs of scabies and we live together ) I went ahead and did the treatment regardless. Itching persisted. I went back for a follow up, and he suggested that I do it again - out of frustration I asked him, if it wasn't scabies what we would be trying next and he said we would start blood tests etc over. Needless to say I did not go back to him. Doctor: I went back to the doctor to explain my frustrations, and hope for an alternative solution to my problem. She prescribed me steroid creams to try, but it was difficult as the itching was not localized. She advised that this could be something environmental that I never find out - which wasn't something I was willing to accept. This condition has been making me extremely irritable and has begun to affect my professional and personal life. Naturopath: At this point, I've turned to a naturopath. Over the last 6 months, I feel like we have tried almost everything. She reviewed my blood work, and did a new stool sample to rule out parisites. My symptoms now include: itching everywhere, including the bottoms of my feet until they peel and get hot. Itching my legs until they scab. Dry stinging chest, itchy eyes. Painful sweating and itching in areas where there is pressure from clothing ie; waistband, bra straps. Clamy hot skin waist band, bra, underwear lines. More comfortable in loose fitting clothes. Sensitive skin to the point where any fabric ( sheets on my bed included ) touches me, and its almost a painful sensation, prickly burning.

She was feeling really tired for the past couple of weeks and dropped out of College saying she has no more energy left. We started our relationship a month ago and things were all good. She was happy, really caring and loving except for she gets super tired very easily. She also told me she was feeling stressed about dropping from college and being tired all the time.So we decided to take a break from our relationship so that she can relax and gain some energy. But now she says she don't want this relationship and she is not answering my calls or not meeting me. I think she is going through depression and I don't know how to help her when she is not letting me. She says she needs space and tells me that she is a bad person, and she doesn't love me anymore. When I talked to her over the phone, she says that she is stressed and don't have any energy. She gets angry and easily irritated. She also says she is a disappointment. She told me that she is a terrible person and she don't want to me to see that. She talks like a different person now and says she is not in love with me. I am confused now whether is it her illness making her talk all these and also, is she going through manic depression? I really want to help her but I don't know how!"

She didn't know who we were, where she was, couldn't talk and continued to scream, cry along with the strange movements.

This continued for approx. 1/2 hour. Finally she went into the bedroom alone and calmed down. She slowly came around but the whole ordeal was very disturbing.

We are close so I trust them enough, and they havent left me down yet. My family doesn't quite know, well I did tell my mother, but shes thinking im lying or saying how it could be worse. I honestly don't know how much longer I can take this, I already have anxiety and panic attacks every so often, and when I do feel ""Happy"" its lasts for only so long. I dont really get out much since...I really cant, I dont have any money and living in my situation money is kinda existent. I don't have a Diploma or GED, and I tried asking my ""Family"" but they always say they cant or they have their own things to pay off so I stopped trying there. My dream of going to art school, or even getting my dream job is just gone. I still have games, and my drawing, but really its all I can do; I want to leave this house, I want to live. I always fall back on my own hopes and dreams, I even try to get my name out there in a videogame...only to fail, and put a years worth of effort to shame. I dont see a future, I never did for years. All there is left is this void I try to fill no matter what, be it with my drawings hopes people would find unique, which only just makes me a shadow to most people that actually have the tools and experience. Spending a year in a game helping people as many ways as I can, which doesnt quite feel all to fulfilling but I cant leave them to suffer alone, atleast give them the support I never had. I try to be there for others but I fail to have my own back, I can never back myself up when i do good much less make an accomplishment. Im sorry if this is crazy but I cant be sure how much longer I can fake a smile, pretending to be bold and strong, keep my morals high; knowing deep down I am suffering, I am weak and fragile and my morals are slowly turning cold. All that is left is this ""Love"" for others, and this tiny flame of ""Hope"". But really I dont see anything outside these walls, im lonely...im lost and people just dont understand how it feelshaving no wayout or no where to go. Am I really destined to die this way...is my life all nothing more than a side character...What is life if I cant do anything or go places...why am I still here? am I being punished..."

Not sure what though. I was sitting at the table talking with friends when I felt a very hot feeling in the top of my head. As we are sitting there I feel this sensation slowly going down my head in a line. My friend looked over at me and said ""what is wrong? Your face is turning bright red and I am watching the line go down."". It felt like the worst sunburn I have ever had. I felt it go down my entire face and neck to my chest and stop. It felt like I had a terrible fever but only in my head, not my body. My friend told me to take benadryl quickly and drink water so I did. The hot/redness lasted about 1 hour and then lightened up. I went to bed and work up the next morning and my tongue was purple/grey and swollen, slightly. I am not allergic to any foods or medicines that I know of and have never had a reaction before in my 46 years. I did take a tiny sip of a friends grapefruit flavored sparkling cocktail called Swell from Costco about 5 minutes before this happened.  Thoughts or suggestions? This was pretty frightening."

You would think I would be a skinny person but I struggle to lose weight. I guess that's the hypothyroidism. I have been depressed at my current level for about 4-5 yrs.

I have had hives for a few days now and I believe that the source was from using a tanning bed (which I also won't be using anymore) The hives do not seem to be going away as well and I am taking antihistamines that were prescribed by my doctor.

Usually I just wash it off with no problem, but right afterwards, my skin started swelling and turned red/raw everywhere the fluid had touched, especially where it had gotten in my eye. It went down after 30+/- minutes after I had taken an ibuprofen for the swelling. I didn't worry about it much due to my already sensitive skin. Today, after we had sex again, I noticed I had hives in the places that he had kissed me (stomach, neck,shoulder). Neither of us have any STD's that I know of (I was tested a week/two ago) and i have no known food/other allergies. I have Hashimotos thyroiditis and anorexia and am taking Adderall and Synthroid.

My boyfriend and I adopted two short hair kittens when we first moved into our place. My allergies have been present ( I woke up every morning with mucus, but would feel better after I'd cough it out), but now my mother's 2 cats (fully grown and long hair) have had to come stay with us for a bit while she looks for a new place. I have been living in pure hell since then. The only thing that has been even remotely helping the extreme amount of mucus that chokes me is Mucinex D, but I've been becoming light headed and fatigued since I've been taking it regularly, but again, it's the only thing that helps. I've tried many different allergy meds but to no avail.  My second problem now seems to be my breathing. Every night when I go to bed I've been having to use my boyfriend's inhaler, which helps slightly, but my throat is still tight and I end up struggling to breathe still. I'm afraid of taking a prescription that isn't mine, and plus mixing it with Mucinex D, I don't want to hurt myself. My question is, has anyone else gone through this problem and found a medicine that helped? Do I need an inhaler? No one else can take my mother's cats, so simply not having 4 cats is not an option. Also, the two long hairs are in a spare room and my boyfriend is now the care taker of them in my place. So I no longer go in there. Thanks."

The word suicide has been mentioned from her at one time she was prescribed anti-depression pills from her doctor. They expired July this year almost a full bottle couple weeks ago I found them in the cabinet in the kitchen above her coffee pot right in the middle. I never seen her take them before with them out in the open like that and her drinking I threw them out that lead into an argument. She says she takes them for panic attacks (if that was the case she would have them in her purse).  Now this is all happening while we have a 6 year old son.

I also have a sleep problem where I always felt tired, sluggish, lacking concentration and disposition throughout the day while sleeping 7-10 hours every night and after recently moving to another house which didn't have a lot of dust for an moderate period of time these problems kinda vanished until I moved back to my old house where although I don’t live in absolute filth it has LOTS of dust around. So I began to question if these conditions were correlated in any way which lead me to this site, so to put it short: can my disposition and sleep problems be due to the fact that I'm living and sleeping in an house with a lot of dust?

Sunday  But to our surprise next day morning we found that it was hive- huge patches of skin and when touched I get to see original color of the skin (blanching) we rushed to doctor and they asked to give Benadryl, we went back to home and did the same. After two doses of that medication we have seen patches didn’t go and are swollen , that’s when we rushed to emergency. They looked at him and said it is some infection as he also had fever by that time they suggested Tylenol with Benadryl and sent us back to home they also said it can’t be amoxicillin as allergy wouldn’t take that much time to come out, they asked to follow-up with family doctor. They did a blood test and we found ERCS : 5.49 High (3.90-5.30), MCV 69.4 LOW (75 – 87) and MPV 8.3 LOW (9.0-13.0) these are only values which are not as per charts. Doctors said, he had iron deficiency and rest of things are quite normal.  Monday We went back home, and administered medication, next day morning we went to our family doctor, he looked at report and asked if anyone in family has thalassemia, which we aren’t sure, however during that visit my son wasn’t able to stand properly as his legs were swollen along with hands, upon asking doctor if we need to go to emergency he said to go and written a letter, we rushed to emergency and as we went there they did a urine test which was absolutely normal (fever was still on) but they gave a dose of steroid and hives came down thus we went home with course of steroid,  Tuesday  On Tuesday I have given my son Tylenol+bynardyl at first step and after some gap of 2 hours I gave him steroid, that’s when hives came back as well as lips were swollen, we called in help line to know if that’s serious. Helpline asked us to go to doctor in ER within 3 hours, that scared us and we went to ER, ER guys made us sit for some time and moved us into Acute care, there my son was administered epinephrine 0.1 ml + Benadryl , latter slowly hives were coming down, we were damn happy, after 2 hours hives completely went away, I thanked God for this moment. We were moved into normal observation ward and asked to wait,  Wednesday Early morning : I was sleepy and my son was on my shoulders sleeping silently, I noticed some uncomfortable moments in him, when I looked at him, he was all patchy on his face, his head was red and his tummy, back was full of hives, this time lot bigger then I have ever seen, I got scared and shouted out for nurse , they moved us back to acute care and gave another dose of epinephrine 0.1 ml + Benadryl, again same thing happened, but after 4 hours hives were coming back, that’s when staff in acute care called in pediatrician, he came after 2 hours, until then nurse kept wet towel on hives, once doc was in they grilled us down until his birth and they said my son is a tuff fellow, and gave him Advil + Benadryl, this brought down the hives, doc asked us to give steroids, (2 more doses) Advil once we go home that afternoon and give Claritin one dose a day until hives stop coming , after going home, we gave him Advil and with some gap gave steroid. After giving steroid, again hives came back with full power, and he looked like a patchy boy with half of his face full of patch, now I didn’t get panic, instead I took him to bathroom and gave a Luke warm water shower , to our surprise all the hives went way in minutes and he was my darling son again, he slept like a baby as he always did,  Thursday but again at 3:00 am he wakes up and cries out in pain, now, I took him into bathroom, and applied cold water on parts where he is complaining, he again slept off , I came to my work my wife stayed back home taking care of him , I called my wife she said, now patches are coming and going but aren’t that dark anymore. I beg god to bring my son out of this pain, he is just over 2 years.  In this whole, story, here are main points followed by my question.  Note : Goes to daycare from 18th month onwards.  1.	Amoxicillin given for ear infection  2.	Hives started Saturday afternoon  3.	first medication two doses of Benadryl (blood test done, ERCS : 5.49 High (3.90-5.30), MCV 69.4 LOW (75 – 87) and MPV 8.3 LOW (9.0-13.0) – doc said all is well ) 4.	all red, rushed to emergency, fever started – Benadryl +Tylenol given  5.	legs, hands and face swollen, went to family doc, he asked to go to emergency (throat tongue were not swollen and ears didn’t had infection)  6.

Monday We went back home, and administered medication, next day morning we went to our family doctor, he looked at report and asked if anyone in family has thalassemia, which we aren’t sure, however during that visit my son wasn’t able to stand properly as his legs were swollen along with hands, upon asking doctor if we need to go to emergency he said to go and written a letter, we rushed to emergency and as we went there they did a urine test which was absolutely normal (fever was still on) but they gave a dose of steroid and hives came down thus we went home with course of steroid,  Tuesday  On Tuesday I have given my son Tylenol+bynardyl at first step and after some gap of 2 hours I gave him steroid, that’s when hives came back as well as lips were swollen, we called in help line to know if that’s serious. Helpline asked us to go to doctor in ER within 3 hours, that scared us and we went to ER, ER guys made us sit for some time and moved us into Acute care, there my son was administered epinephrine 0.1 ml + Benadryl , latter slowly hives were coming down, we were damn happy, after 2 hours hives completely went away, I thanked God for this moment. We were moved into normal observation ward and asked to wait,  Wednesday Early morning : I was sleepy and my son was on my shoulders sleeping silently, I noticed some uncomfortable moments in him, when I looked at him, he was all patchy on his face, his head was red and his tummy, back was full of hives, this time lot bigger then I have ever seen, I got scared and shouted out for nurse , they moved us back to acute care and gave another dose of epinephrine 0.1 ml + Benadryl, again same thing happened, but after 4 hours hives were coming back, that’s when staff in acute care called in pediatrician, he came after 2 hours, until then nurse kept wet towel on hives, once doc was in they grilled us down until his birth and they said my son is a tuff fellow, and gave him Advil + Benadryl, this brought down the hives, doc asked us to give steroids, (2 more doses) Advil once we go home that afternoon and give Claritin one dose a day until hives stop coming , after going home, we gave him Advil and with some gap gave steroid. After giving steroid, again hives came back with full power, and he looked like a patchy boy with half of his face full of patch, now I didn’t get panic, instead I took him to bathroom and gave a Luke warm water shower , to our surprise all the hives went way in minutes and he was my darling son again, he slept like a baby as he always did,  Thursday but again at 3:00 am he wakes up and cries out in pain, now, I took him into bathroom, and applied cold water on parts where he is complaining, he again slept off , I came to my work my wife stayed back home taking care of him , I called my wife she said, now patches are coming and going but aren’t that dark anymore. I beg god to bring my son out of this pain, he is just over 2 years.  In this whole, story, here are main points followed by my question.  Note : Goes to daycare from 18th month onwards.  1.	Amoxicillin given for ear infection  2.	Hives started Saturday afternoon  3.	first medication two doses of Benadryl (blood test done, ERCS : 5.49 High (3.90-5.30), MCV 69.4 LOW (75 – 87) and MPV 8.3 LOW (9.0-13.0) – doc said all is well ) 4.	all red, rushed to emergency, fever started – Benadryl +Tylenol given  5.	legs, hands and face swollen, went to family doc, he asked to go to emergency (throat tongue were not swollen and ears didn’t had infection)  6.

Sunday  But to our surprise next day morning we found that it was hive- huge patches of skin and when touched I get to see original color of the skin (blanching) we rushed to doctor and they asked to give Benadryl, we went back to home and did the same. After two doses of that medication we have seen patches didn’t go and are swollen , that’s when we rushed to emergency. They looked at him and said it is some infection as he also had fever by that time they suggested Tylenol with Benadryl and sent us back to home they also said it can’t be amoxicillin as allergy wouldn’t take that much time to come out, they asked to follow-up with family doctor. They did a blood test and we found ERCS : 5.49 High (3.90-5.30), MCV 69.4 LOW (75 – 87) and MPV 8.3 LOW (9.0-13.0) these are only values which are not as per charts. Doctors said, he had iron deficiency and rest of things are quite normal.  Monday We went back home, and administered medication, next day morning we went to our family doctor, he looked at report and asked if anyone in family has thalassemia, which we aren’t sure, however during that visit my son wasn’t able to stand properly as his legs were swollen along with hands, upon asking doctor if we need to go to emergency he said to go and written a letter, we rushed to emergency and as we went there they did a urine test which was absolutely normal (fever was still on) but they gave a dose of steroid and hives came down thus we went home with course of steroid,  Tuesday  On Tuesday I have given my son Tylenol+bynardyl at first step and after some gap of 2 hours I gave him steroid, that’s when hives came back as well as lips were swollen, we called in help line to know if that’s serious. Helpline asked us to go to doctor in ER within 3 hours, that scared us and we went to ER, ER guys made us sit for some time and moved us into Acute care, there my son was administered epinephrine 0.1 ml + Benadryl , latter slowly hives were coming down, we were damn happy, after 2 hours hives completely went away, I thanked God for this moment. We were moved into normal observation ward and asked to wait,  Wednesday Early morning : I was sleepy and my son was on my shoulders sleeping silently, I noticed some uncomfortable moments in him, when I looked at him, he was all patchy on his face, his head was red and his tummy, back was full of hives, this time lot bigger then I have ever seen, I got scared and shouted out for nurse , they moved us back to acute care and gave another dose of epinephrine 0.1 ml + Benadryl, again same thing happened, but after 4 hours hives were coming back, that’s when staff in acute care called in pediatrician, he came after 2 hours, until then nurse kept wet towel on hives, once doc was in they grilled us down until his birth and they said my son is a tuff fellow, and gave him Advil + Benadryl, this brought down the hives, doc asked us to give steroids, (2 more doses) Advil once we go home that afternoon and give Claritin one dose a day until hives stop coming , after going home, we gave him Advil and with some gap gave steroid. After giving steroid, again hives came back with full power, and he looked like a patchy boy with half of his face full of patch, now I didn’t get panic, instead I took him to bathroom and gave a Luke warm water shower , to our surprise all the hives went way in minutes and he was my darling son again, he slept like a baby as he always did,  Thursday but again at 3:00 am he wakes up and cries out in pain, now, I took him into bathroom, and applied cold water on parts where he is complaining, he again slept off , I came to my work my wife stayed back home taking care of him , I called my wife she said, now patches are coming and going but aren’t that dark anymore.

My other disorders are under controll. I had a Doctor that treated for years with Klonipin and I did wonderful. I never felt adicted to the klonipin at all. Well my Doctor retired and I was handed over to a young female psychiatrist. She would not perscribe the amount my last doctor was giving me. Plus she started taking me off some the meds he had put me on. Well those doctors had been with the local mental health center, so I decided to try someone in private practice. I thought I was seeing a psychiatrist when I was actually seeing the PA. He started from the beginning taking me off my sleeping medicine, then he started taking me off of the drug that my adivan fell under ( he had tried that) and tried puttiing me on type of drugs that trazodone falls under. These did not work because sideseffect. Now we have been dealing with this for months. the last time I saw him I told him something had to be done. My anxiety is out of control. I can''t go to church because the crowds. Some times I cant even listed to the tv or radio. And the worst of it is self harm. I chew on the upper inside of my lip where there is a very bad sore. I told that I have neve had an adictive personality. That is what he is worried about. Then he had the never to tell me that he think what is happing is I am having Mood swings. He said alot of times this is what people are having and they think it anxiety. Well I am sorry. I have been dealing with this since 1992 and I know what a mood swing is and what anxiety is. My anxiety is BAD. I don't know what else to do. I am miserable. And hurting. Any advice anyone could give would be greatly appreated."

Whenever even the most minute issue arises, I assume the worst and become paralyzed by fear, unable to focus on anything else but what ""might"" be wrong (and most of the time the ""might"" corresponds to something with astronomical odds). Two days ago, I was walking my dog outside and coming in through my back door. When I bent down to take her leash off (still on the back porch), I felt something sting me on the underside of my left arm. The pain was on my upper arm on the side nearest my chest. The pain lasted for about a minute or so, was very sharp, and the spot tingled some. Upon closer examination, I couldn't find a bug, but found two tiny pricks in my skin.  My back porch is near a swamp and is a sanctuary for bugs of all varieties, so it could have been anything. There's no swelling at the bite site, no real blood, and I haven't had any other symptoms. The source of my anxiety is that two years ago I saw a bat hanging from my porch. Frankly, I don't see how I could have been bitten by a bat without knowing it. Additionally, the bite is on the inside of my arm, so the bat would have had to come up from underneath me somehow (yes, I know this is crazy). I didn't feel anything bump into me. I haven't seen a bat on my porch in two years.  Things I have seen on my porch recently include: spiders (so many spiders -- I pulled one out of my hair today!), gnats, flies, giant mosquitoes, ladybugs, and another bug I can't identify. It's also possible that one or both of the marks could be from my puppy, who play bites me constantly. I thought about going to the doctor today, but realized how crazy this sounds. I took pictures of the marks and sent them to my mom. She thinks the likely cause is a spider. Should I go to the doctor?

Whenever even the most minute issue arises, I assume the worst and become paralyzed by fear, unable to focus on anything else but what ""might"" be wrong (and most of the time the ""might"" corresponds to something with astronomical odds). Two days ago, I was walking my dog outside and coming in through my back door. When I bent down to take her leash off (still on the back porch), I felt something sting me on the underside of my left arm. The pain was on my upper arm on the side nearest my chest. The pain lasted for about a minute or so, was very sharp, and the spot tingled some. Upon closer examination, I couldn't find a bug, but found two tiny pricks in my skin.  My back porch is near a swamp and is a sanctuary for bugs of all varieties, so it could have been anything. There's no swelling at the bite site, no real blood, and I haven't had any other symptoms. The source of my anxiety is that two years ago I saw a bat hanging from my porch. Frankly, I don't see how I could have been bitten by a bat without knowing it. Additionally, the bite is on the inside of my arm, so the bat would have had to come up from underneath me somehow (yes, I know this is crazy). I didn't feel anything bump into me. I haven't seen a bat on my porch in two years.  Things I have seen on my porch recently include: spiders (so many spiders -- I pulled one out of my hair today!), gnats, flies, giant mosquitoes, ladybugs, and another bug I can't identify. It's also possible that one or both of the marks could be from my puppy, who play bites me constantly. I thought about going to the doctor today, but realized how crazy this sounds. I took pictures of the marks and sent them to my mom. She thinks the likely cause is a spider. Should I go to the doctor? Rabies is always in the back of my (catastrophizing) mind, but I realize there isn't any doctor who would give me a rabies vaccine based only on this. How do I control my fear?

After a few days I started having some pain. I went back to the dentist and he prescribed Amoxicillin for the infection that I now had. After a week the pain was horrendous. They prescribed me Tylenol with Codeine 325mg & Ibuprofen 800mg. After I began taking the pain meds (day one of pain meds & day two of Amoxicillin) I noticed that I was getting a skin rash and it was very itchy. Also, my upper lip began to swell. I made an appt with the dentist again but I continued to take all the meds because I was in too much pain & I didn't want to stop the antibiotic that was supposed to be helping the infection. My mom was worried so I stopped the Amoxicillin two nights before my appt. I went in to see the dentist and told him about the rash & that I was still in pain. I hadn't actually been taking the Tylenol too much because it didn't actually help with the pain. He prescribed me a new antibiotic assuming the allergy was from that. (Note: I've never had a reaction to a medication before). He gave me Clindamycin 150mg & told me to take 50mg of Benadryl for the reaction & OTC ibuprofen for pain (I was out of the prescription). It has been three days since I saw him & I am still pretty itchy and it seems as though every time I wake up my upper lip is even more swollen than the day before! I am trying not to take anymore ibuprofen just in case that is the culprit but my lip is in some pain. It feels like the connecting bit (called frenum? apparently) is tearing or something because it's so swollen. Anyway I'm just trying to figure out if I should wait it out & keep taking Benadryl or if there is something that a doctor could do? I don't know I'm just very annoyed having a swollen lip 24/7 for the past like 5 days."

My first apt was the 7th of this month and it was a long appointment lol But w/o going into all the details, what he decided to do (at least Plan A) is to at the same time, wean off Nardil and add Marplan. I started this last week, and the way he is having me do this is that first, I reduced to 30mg (I was on 45mg) and stay on that for 1 week. Then add 10mg Marplan (which I did yesterday) but keep on 30mg Nardil. Then next week, reduce to 15mg Nardil and add 10mg Marplan, then following week, completely off Nardil, then up to 30mg Marplan and possibly going up 10 more mg after that. What doing that appears to be doing is ""tricking"" my body so that I can go off Nardil without getting sick. (I know, not medical explanation lol). He's hoping that will be the case until completely off one and on the other. He said that he didn't think that Marplan would have the same adrenaline issue as Nardil and he hopes it will be better re anti-depressant. But, if I don't do well on Marplan, at least I will be off Nardil and it shouldn't be too hard on my system to wean off Marplan, and then he would try non-MAOI meds. I've been very impressed with him and like him and he even convinced the financial assistance dept to approve my ap, saying that I wouldn't be with him long term, but to get me stabilized on meds.  Anyway, I am very hopeful and so far, so good! I see him again next Wed for follow up and make sure everything is good. I just wanted to share this with you since I've bugged you about the whole thing off and on for years. lol Debbie"

Can you be allergic to sweat? When I sweat really bad like if I run a couple miles in the heat or work outside for a long time I start to get these itchy red welts. The best way I can describe them is they look like hives. They are pink to red in color and kinda puffy. I mostly get them on my upper thighs and on the inside of my thighs but sometimes I get them on my stomach or arms. Once I cool down they fade and are gone by the end of the day. Growing up my mom always said it was heat rash, but I've looked up pictures of that and these seem more like hives in the way they look. My rash doesn't look like pimples the way heat rash does.

While I cannot confirm when my depression started I know I most defiantly have it now. All I remember is as a child I never smiled and never hung out with friends, and was constantly bullied. I never once sought help for this, and nobody even bothered to notice. not family or the ""friends"" I had at school. In recent years my depression has gotten worse. I am finding myself struggling to even take care of myself now. I constantly lock myself in my room, only forcing myself to get up and eat, bathe, and use the restroom. I barely hang out or talk to my family. I dropped out of collage because I felt I was being Judged and that my depression was getting bad. I would constantly look over my shoulder and always made sure to avoid eye contact for longer than a few seconds with anybody. I hate talking about my feeling with my family even thought my mom and sister constantly give me the option. I know if I tell them they would blame themselves for not realizing how bad I was feeling. I don't know what to do anymore. I have always dreamed of owning and running my own animal rescue, however I know as of now I can't even begin to achieve my dream. How can I take care of animals If I can't even take care of myself. I don't know what to do anymore. While I am no-longer harming myself and thinking of suicide, all I want to do now is sleep, my dreams are the only way I can escape reality. There are some days I think of picking up my blade again, but I choose not to. I fear one day I will once again. I think It's time I find help, but because I'm Antisocial and reclusive I cant bring myself to meet people or talk to a therapist."

Docs put me on two rounds of different antibiotics and finally felt better. They also told me to start using Flonase as well. So shortly after caught another cold and then started developing really bad ear pain.  That went on for 3 week's. Went on Augmentin after 2 1/2 weeks of dealing with the pain. It helped a little. Went on for another week. I saw an ENT who said hearing is good, pressure is good, and no fluids in the ear's. So two weeks passed caught another cold. Then week later ear pain. 2 weeks in dealing with the pain. I stopped taking Flonase think that somehow correlates with the tube issue's. Fluid sensation is gone. Now it's just a throbbing pain. Also a sensation that my tube in my ear feels like it's throbbing. Tried Sudafed and Advil first 2 days helped a little. Then just Advil and last 2 days just Asprin. Asprin does seem to help. Also now not on Sudafed I am sneezing more that relieves some pressure as well. However, pain is still there and causing tooth pain. As well as similiar symptoms are starting to appear in my right ear. On top of that feeling tired more than normal, ear's are itchy, lot more wax being produced, and ear's are red at times. Debating to go to the walk in clinic tomorrow. Now a day's Doc's are strict on giving out biotics. I know when I was a kid there was one year for 4 to 6 months my mom mention had really bad allergies and colds. That led to ear issues and the Doc prescribed me a low dose of Augmentin over the course of those few months. I feel if on another 5 days with the previous Augmentin think it would of cleared up the issue. My biggest concern is will the Augmentin still even work now. Any feedback or advice appreciate."

Went on for another week. I saw an ENT who said hearing is good, pressure is good, and no fluids in the ear's. So two weeks passed caught another cold. Then week later ear pain. 2 weeks in dealing with the pain. I stopped taking Flonase think that somehow correlates with the tube issue's. Fluid sensation is gone. Now it's just a throbbing pain. Also a sensation that my tube in my ear feels like it's throbbing. Tried Sudafed and Advil first 2 days helped a little. Then just Advil and last 2 days just Asprin. Asprin does seem to help. Also now not on Sudafed I am sneezing more that relieves some pressure as well. However, pain is still there and causing tooth pain. As well as similiar symptoms are starting to appear in my right ear. On top of that feeling tired more than normal, ear's are itchy, lot more wax being produced, and ear's are red at times. Debating to go to the walk in clinic tomorrow. Now a day's Doc's are strict on giving out biotics. I know when I was a kid there was one year for 4 to 6 months my mom mention had really bad allergies and colds. That led to ear issues and the Doc prescribed me a low dose of Augmentin over the course of those few months. I feel if on another 5 days with the previous Augmentin think it would of cleared up the issue. My biggest concern is will the Augmentin still even work now. Any feedback or advice appreciate."

About a week ago, I went to my first carnival and on the first and only ride I went on I had what I guessed was a anxiety attack. The funny thing is, a few months ago I went to Disney World and went on almost every ride, but no problems. It was extremely fun. My mom told me that it might be because I had no control over that ride and that triggered anxiety. I'm not sure though. Ever since then, I wake up at night gasping for air and sometimes when I'm laying down, my hands start to randomly shake. I'm also easily startled now and my breaths become shallow. I have always been an anxious worrisome person, fearing the worst. I am a 13 year-old girl. Like it has gotten worse. Sometimes at night I think someone is going to come and murder my family or steal us and I always make sure to check every door and windows and double check everything. I feel like I may have anxiety. I'm terrified of car crashes, death, kidnap and anything bad that could go wrong that I always cant stop myself from thinking about. I'm always fearing the worst. Any little noise scares me also. Can someone tell me what it is?"

As soon as something containing a tree nut enters my mouth, I immediately go into anaphylaxis. I don't even have to swallow it.  My first time having an allergic reaction wasn't horrible. I ate one of those round chocolates with the walnut at the center. It felt as though I had suddenly gotten the flu. My throat got itchy, my tongue swelled a little, I felt overheated, I got sweaty, and looked really pale. It wasn't that bad.  My second one was awful. I was 4 (I think) and was at a friend's house. Her mom had baked cookies (with some sort of nut, obviously) and I asked if I could have one. She gave me a cookie and as soon as I bit into it, I felt my throat closing and spat out the piece that I had bitten off. I didn't even swallow it. I started struggling to breathe, coughing, wheezing, got very lightheaded, and my face was pale as a ghost. Luckily, my mom was still there and she took me to the hospital. They were able to get me feeling better and diagnosed me with a nut allergy and prescribed an epi-pen in case this were to happen again.  I was extremely careful with what I ate after that and I've never used the epi-pen. Didn't even cook anything with nuts (I really enjoy baking and I'm pretty good at it. By the way, I can touch and be around nuts with no issues. I just can't eat them. I do get itchy when I use shampoo and skin creams with nuts, but it's no big deal). However, there were a few occasions when I've had a reaction.  The third time I had a reaction was when I was 15 and ate a cookie that had been accidentally contaminated. It didn't usually contain nuts, it was just a manufacturing error (so I guess those ""made in a factory that also produces___"" warnings do matter. Who knew, right? Haha). My throat got itchy, I felt feverish, and I started feeling my airway constricting. I didn't have my epi-pen on me, so I drank a ton of water and I started feeling better. I didn't die, I didn't stop breathing. It was weird, but I was happy that I figured out how to stop it from escalating. I thought that maybe it was just because it wasn't contaminated enough to kill me. Either way, I was lucky.  I was even more careful after that and never had another problem involving nuts (I did develop an allergy to shellfish, dog saliva, and latex though). Earlier this evening, my dad offered me a piece of chocolate (orange flavored chocolate). I ate all of it. He read the label afterwards because I commented that it looked like there were pieces orange peel in it because there were light colored bits (like maybe that's what gave it the orangey flavor. Wasn't orange peel). It turns out that those were actually thinly sliced almonds. There were a lot in my piece, so I knew that the chocolate I ate had almonds. I had no symptoms, no reaction at all. That was several hours ago and I still feel perfectly fine. Well, as fine as someone with flu can be (I've had it for 2 days so far). What I meant was, I feel the same as I did before eating it.  So do I not have the allergy anymore? Did I outgrow it? I'm currently 19 years old and like I said in the beginning, I got the allergy when I was very young and it seemed to be very severe. When I got the test done to see which nuts I'm allergic to, I tested positive to all of them except English walnuts and peanuts. The doctor said all those years ago that I would never outgrow it. Was he wrong? Do I not have the allergy now? I'm glad that I didn't have a reaction today, but I'm kinda confused now. I don't know what to think, really."

They were able to get me feeling better and diagnosed me with a nut allergy and prescribed an epi-pen in case this were to happen again.  I was extremely careful with what I ate after that and I've never used the epi-pen. Didn't even cook anything with nuts (I really enjoy baking and I'm pretty good at it. By the way, I can touch and be around nuts with no issues. I just can't eat them. I do get itchy when I use shampoo and skin creams with nuts, but it's no big deal). However, there were a few occasions when I've had a reaction.  The third time I had a reaction was when I was 15 and ate a cookie that had been accidentally contaminated. It didn't usually contain nuts, it was just a manufacturing error (so I guess those ""made in a factory that also produces___"" warnings do matter. Who knew, right? Haha). My throat got itchy, I felt feverish, and I started feeling my airway constricting. I didn't have my epi-pen on me, so I drank a ton of water and I started feeling better. I didn't die, I didn't stop breathing. It was weird, but I was happy that I figured out how to stop it from escalating. I thought that maybe it was just because it wasn't contaminated enough to kill me. Either way, I was lucky.  I was even more careful after that and never had another problem involving nuts (I did develop an allergy to shellfish, dog saliva, and latex though). Earlier this evening, my dad offered me a piece of chocolate (orange flavored chocolate). I ate all of it. He read the label afterwards because I commented that it looked like there were pieces orange peel in it because there were light colored bits (like maybe that's what gave it the orangey flavor. Wasn't orange peel). It turns out that those were actually thinly sliced almonds. There were a lot in my piece, so I knew that the chocolate I ate had almonds. I had no symptoms, no reaction at all. That was several hours ago and I still feel perfectly fine. Well, as fine as someone with flu can be (I've had it for 2 days so far). What I meant was, I feel the same as I did before eating it.  So do I not have the allergy anymore? Did I outgrow it? I'm currently 19 years old and like I said in the beginning, I got the allergy when I was very young and it seemed to be very severe. When I got the test done to see which nuts I'm allergic to, I tested positive to all of them except English walnuts and peanuts. The doctor said all those years ago that I would never outgrow it. Was he wrong? Do I not have the allergy now? I'm glad that I didn't have a reaction today, but I'm kinda confused now. I don't know what to think, really."

Loosing hope... :(,"Hi. My name is Megan Lofthouse, I'm 24 years old and I live in the UK.  So after crying for what felt like hours, I've decided to contact you guys. However I keep forgetting that it's on a website and that if I minimise this, I will loose everything I've written. It's annoying because I got really far with this message! So now I'm writing it on a blank email, so that; if I forget and minimise this, I won't loose everything I've just written.  So this isn't complete because now things have got so bad that my brain is now completely blank and I've lost so much strength that I can barely type. My hands and feet have gone completely numb, I can't feel pain; its just dulled pain. I can't feel emotions, yet with a flick off a switch, I'm either angry or crying. I have no idea where it comes from either... Anyway, I'm in The Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, UK and I'm desperate for your help.  I've been in the acute admissions unit for over 4 months and I'm progressively just getting worse.  It's hard for me to type now as I don't have the strength and my fingers hurt, but I'm desperate. I have my phone rested on the bottom bar of my bed, very close to me. This is because I don't have the strength to even hold my phone.  So, until today, I was pretty sure that I had autoimmune encephalitis. However today, I found out that my mri scan came out normal.  However today (11th of January 2020) I've just realised that, Susanah (the writer and survivor, who wrote the true book brain on fire) had all normal test results too. So there is still a possibility that I have it.  They've sent off 4 test tubes of blood off to test for antibodies that'd indicate that I have encephalitis. However, I'm told that these blood tests won't come back for weeks. Also blood tests aren't always that reliable either. They've sent a urin sample off too.  A neorologist saw me on the 8th of January 2020.he did several reflex tests and during it. My right leg started shaking out of control. He thinks that my reflexes are over working and that the link between my brain and my legs aren't working properly. He also moved my toes up and down and asked if I knew which way my toe was pointing. It felt weird and I could tell but not fully. (if that makes sense)  Right now they are questioning if it's mitochondrial, however I'm not convinced. I already have a rare chromosome deletion called 2q37.3; why would I have another DNA problem..? Plus it doesn't solve why I'm having auditory and visual hallucinations.  I'm also told they are due to do more scans.  Someone told me that I should request a ct scan (cat scan) would that show anything when mri doesn't..?  I feel so low and I feel like a freak, a freak that no one knows what's wrong with..  So right now my symptoms are: Worsening headaches that spread too my neck Joint pain Back pain Eye pain (can't open my eyes very well) Weakness that suddenly came on (can't sit up or even hold my head up) Seeing/ hear in things (I can ""hear"" people talk about me, that sound very real; but they aren't. I have too wait for my parents too go to bed before I go to bed, because otherwise I will ""hear"" them talking about, causing me to cry. Even if I do though, it doesn't really help. I can't talk to someone and let them walk away without ""hearing"" them talk about me. I used too have to pretend to go to the toilet, so I could go past the living room; just to check they weren't talking about me. I thought that everyone was out to get me and that they were talking about me. And I didn't believe them when they say they don't; because I can hear it. Right now I'm hearing a high pitched noise that no one else can hear, tried recording the sound but even that didn't pick it up. It happens a lot at night.  I can't see properly, so when my dad got me to practice opening my eyes to look at a picture; every time I looked at it, the picture would change, I got it wrong every time. Plus apparently it was the same picture every time, but to me the picture kept changing. I looked at a picture, it was of my sisters on Christmas day one year; except I didn't recognise that it was of both of my sisters. Because to me, one had strands of blue hair. Later found that this was actually my sister wearing a blue Christmas cracker hat.  I'm in hospital right now, and I was convinced my room was a different shape and bigger than it actually is. This confused me so much. I could see windows that weren't there, doors that weren't there, a bookshelf that wasn't there. A purple settee and a brown arm chair that wasn't there. A clock and stairs? That weren't there.  I thought my bed was slanted or tilted, or thought I was high up. (my mum thought it was because I can't see)  I thought my bed was triangular and sometimes thought I had somehow got my body the opposite way round (so my head was where my feet was and my feet were where my head was.  Obviously this still confuses me, but yeah..  Lack off sleep (haven't slept properly in over a month and I take strong sleeping tablets) The only time I can sleep is when I cry for hours, like last night (the 10th of January 2020) I think this is because crying makes me exhausted.  Dramatic mood swings/ outbursts (change in behavior) Sudden impulsive outbursts. (had to be restrained by two/three people a few days ago. They said I was out of control)  Worsening mood and mental health (feel invisible!)  Increasing sickness (take two different types off anti sickness tablets. I used to take three but they thought that the third (metaclorfromide) caused my incontinence with number 2, back when I was in Southampton General Hospital. This wasn't the case!)  Dizziness  Mobility changes (went from walking too not even being able too sit up and its the third time! Every time it happens, it's always worse than the last!)  Short term memory thats just getting worse and worse (forgot my dad's phone number a few days ago and I've known that, even before I even memorised mine.  Last night (3.1.2020) I was talking too my friend online and I realised how much I couldn't remember. Its scary actually. So the last think I can remember talking too my friend; was actually two years ago. I don't remember any recent conversations, it's all blank. I know we had more conversations than that, because I looked at our conversation history. Also on the 9th of January 2020, my advocate from mind, was supposed too come and see me; but I forgot. I only remembered when he texted me to cancel due to car problems. On the 11th of January 2020, I completely forgot about the whole conversation with my friend online. I only remembered when I was scrolling through my phone and saw the messaging icon on my phone.)  Struggling too go for a wee and so I'm now having to force myself to go (not pleasant. And now I have a catheter, because I was retaining over 500)  I'm constipated and laxatives don't seem to work now.i think on the 7th of January 2020, I had to have an enema for the first time and it was so painful that I screamed. Starting from the 8th of January 2020 I became incontinent. This was just overflow and stopped after a few days, but then started again. Today, on the 11th of January 2020 I found out that I'm still being given a heavy lot of laxatives. I don't think this is the cause of my incontinence though, as; I think that I was given laxatives constantly, from before the 7th. I only had one day off them and that was on the 9th. This is strange because, normally one sachet of movicol turns me incontinent. Before I had the enema, I had been given: two sachets of movicol, docisate sodium and two lots of suppositories in one day. Nothing worked)  Antidepressants, antipsychotics and painkillers not working now.  I'm on paracetamol, oramorth (morphine sulthate) dihydrocodeine, ibuprofen, buscopan, amatriptaline, peppermint oil, deloxatine, quatiapine, omeprazole, cefalexine (my profalactic antibiotic), cyclazine, ondansatron, zopiclone, my anti histomeine, movicol, scenna, docisate sodium and suppositories.  And no, the strong painkillers are not the reason of why I was so constipated. I was on them for the whole of the time I've been here and I've been here for over three months now; throughout that time, I've been incontinent several times. I've never stopped taking the strong painkillers!) When I could walk; at night I found myself struggling too (thought this was my quatiapine, but now I'm not so sure)  Struggling too talk because I forget what I'm saying, so can't complete sentences. Sometimes I don't even make sense, forget what I've said and repeat myself; and come out with random stuff sometimes.    Taking longer than usual too read stuff because of my eyesight issues.  Troubles concentrating. (will read something and then forget what I'm reading. The same for listening too stuff.  Saying stuff then a few hours later, forgetting what I said Also I can't stop swearing and I get angry at anything and everything I've had a urin infection for over three months and it's reaccuring and the last one was an e coli infection.  (when I could walk) At night, when it's dark; I try too stand up but quickly loose my balance and fall into things  I climbed a mountain in the lake district once and I struggled. Once at the top, my legs could no longer hold my body weight. This caused me too repeatedly fall over. My dad had too help me down and it was so hard that I kept falling, getting up was also very hard.  I've fainted several times and I got a black eye by fainting once.  I don't really remember this but, before being admitted; apparently it looked like I passed out, my eyes were rolling too. All I can remember is feeling very low and just out off it.  I'm having massive identity crisis, where I'm questioning who I am now and even my own identity. (voices in my head told me that if I just woke up one day, I could just push everything about me away and sayim someone else. I was convinced this would help me. I was going too deny my identity and change how I look and who I was, change everything about me)  A horrible sore throat (some people thought it was oral thrush as I have a white tongue)  Increasing pain and sickness (my pain is just unbearable right now and it's just getting worse every hour and every day; as that gets worse, so does my sickness)  Freaking out about stuff (so on my first night in AAU; I had these horrible nightmare dreams, where I was just floating (very complicated) then suddenly I had a reality shock of where I was, but when I woke up, it felt like I had just come back too life. Gasping as I woke up. I didn't even realise I had gone to sleep, so I screamed. It honestly felt like i had just been resuscitated back from the dead. This obviously scared me.  However then I thought I heard myself scream over and over again, like they were watching a recording off me. I thought the room had like an upper office with like a huge glass window, so that they could see us. I thought I heard them say ""the doctors gonna want to see this""  Then later ""why would you test on her, it's just her first night""  I then thought they had put something down my tube and done a test on me, too make me have the nightmare dream and have that reaction and feeling of being resuscitated back too life.  Then later on I thought I heard ""liar, liar, its all in your head""  The next evening/night, I thought they were having a secret meeting about me in the next room. My dad said no one was talking about me, but I could ""hear"" them. It's like I could hear it and my dad couldn't.  So I heard t Also I don't know if this is relivent or not but I have got this internal itching down below that is a mystery too my doctors  So I've got various different diagnosises and my symptoms are a mystery too my doctors. I have been diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, anorexia, BPD (supposedly) autism, a rare chromosome deletion called 2Q37.3 and ehlers danlos syndrome. However I think I have encephalitis and that is the cause off my mystery symptoms and illnesses. I also have an ng tube due too NY anorexia and have been sectioned since the 12th of July 2018. I haven't eaten anything solid since September 2017 and I lost my hunger very very quickly! I also haven't drank anything for over a year and a half now and my first disappeared quickly too! So my immune system has always been low and I catch infections really badly and they are always very hard too get rid off. Around the age of 17 I overdosed and was told that if I had taken just one more tablet, I would have died. I was told that I was in the CCU for a while but i don't remember anything other than be in in a strange ward with a cardiac machine. Quite freaky really! Growing up I remembered struggling too balance and walk, this caused bullying. Would say more but I can't. They have sent special blood tests to London but yeah..  Any ideas?"

However I keep forgetting that it's on a website and that if I minimise this, I will loose everything I've written. It's annoying because I got really far with this message! So now I'm writing it on a blank email, so that; if I forget and minimise this, I won't loose everything I've just written.  So this isn't complete because now things have got so bad that my brain is now completely blank and I've lost so much strength that I can barely type. My hands and feet have gone completely numb, I can't feel pain; its just dulled pain. I can't feel emotions, yet with a flick off a switch, I'm either angry or crying. I have no idea where it comes from either... Anyway, I'm in The Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, UK and I'm desperate for your help.  I've been in the acute admissions unit for over 4 months and I'm progressively just getting worse.  It's hard for me to type now as I don't have the strength and my fingers hurt, but I'm desperate. I have my phone rested on the bottom bar of my bed, very close to me. This is because I don't have the strength to even hold my phone.  So, until today, I was pretty sure that I had autoimmune encephalitis. However today, I found out that my mri scan came out normal.  However today (11th of January 2020) I've just realised that, Susanah (the writer and survivor, who wrote the true book brain on fire) had all normal test results too. So there is still a possibility that I have it.  They've sent off 4 test tubes of blood off to test for antibodies that'd indicate that I have encephalitis. However, I'm told that these blood tests won't come back for weeks. Also blood tests aren't always that reliable either. They've sent a urin sample off too.  A neorologist saw me on the 8th of January 2020.he did several reflex tests and during it. My right leg started shaking out of control. He thinks that my reflexes are over working and that the link between my brain and my legs aren't working properly. He also moved my toes up and down and asked if I knew which way my toe was pointing. It felt weird and I could tell but not fully. (if that makes sense)  Right now they are questioning if it's mitochondrial, however I'm not convinced. I already have a rare chromosome deletion called 2q37.3; why would I have another DNA problem..? Plus it doesn't solve why I'm having auditory and visual hallucinations.  I'm also told they are due to do more scans.  Someone told me that I should request a ct scan (cat scan) would that show anything when mri doesn't..?  I feel so low and I feel like a freak, a freak that no one knows what's wrong with..  So right now my symptoms are: Worsening headaches that spread too my neck Joint pain Back pain Eye pain (can't open my eyes very well) Weakness that suddenly came on (can't sit up or even hold my head up) Seeing/ hear in things (I can ""hear"" people talk about me, that sound very real; but they aren't. I have too wait for my parents too go to bed before I go to bed, because otherwise I will ""hear"" them talking about, causing me to cry. Even if I do though, it doesn't really help. I can't talk to someone and let them walk away without ""hearing"" them talk about me. I used too have to pretend to go to the toilet, so I could go past the living room; just to check they weren't talking about me. I thought that everyone was out to get me and that they were talking about me. And I didn't believe them when they say they don't; because I can hear it. Right now I'm hearing a high pitched noise that no one else can hear, tried recording the sound but even that didn't pick it up. It happens a lot at night.  I can't see properly, so when my dad got me to practice opening my eyes to look at a picture; every time I looked at it, the picture would change, I got it wrong every time. Plus apparently it was the same picture every time, but to me the picture kept changing. I looked at a picture, it was of my sisters on Christmas day one year; except I didn't recognise that it was of both of my sisters. Because to me, one had strands of blue hair. Later found that this was actually my sister wearing a blue Christmas cracker hat.  I'm in hospital right now, and I was convinced my room was a different shape and bigger than it actually is. This confused me so much. I could see windows that weren't there, doors that weren't there, a bookshelf that wasn't there. A purple settee and a brown arm chair that wasn't there. A clock and stairs? That weren't there.  I thought my bed was slanted or tilted, or thought I was high up. (my mum thought it was because I can't see)  I thought my bed was triangular and sometimes thought I had somehow got my body the opposite way round (so my head was where my feet was and my feet were where my head was.  Obviously this still confuses me, but yeah..  Lack off sleep (haven't slept properly in over a month and I take strong sleeping tablets) The only time I can sleep is when I cry for hours, like last night (the 10th of January 2020) I think this is because crying makes me exhausted.  Dramatic mood swings/ outbursts (change in behavior) Sudden impulsive outbursts. (had to be restrained by two/three people a few days ago. They said I was out of control)  Worsening mood and mental health (feel invisible!)  Increasing sickness (take two different types off anti sickness tablets. I used to take three but they thought that the third (metaclorfromide) caused my incontinence with number 2, back when I was in Southampton General Hospital. This wasn't the case!)  Dizziness  Mobility changes (went from walking too not even being able too sit up and its the third time! Every time it happens, it's always worse than the last!)  Short term memory thats just getting worse and worse (forgot my dad's phone number a few days ago and I've known that, even before I even memorised mine.  Last night (3.1.2020) I was talking too my friend online and I realised how much I couldn't remember. Its scary actually. So the last think I can remember talking too my friend; was actually two years ago. I don't remember any recent conversations, it's all blank. I know we had more conversations than that, because I looked at our conversation history. Also on the 9th of January 2020, my advocate from mind, was supposed too come and see me; but I forgot. I only remembered when he texted me to cancel due to car problems. On the 11th of January 2020, I completely forgot about the whole conversation with my friend online. I only remembered when I was scrolling through my phone and saw the messaging icon on my phone.)  Struggling too go for a wee and so I'm now having to force myself to go (not pleasant. And now I have a catheter, because I was retaining over 500)  I'm constipated and laxatives don't seem to work now.i think on the 7th of January 2020, I had to have an enema for the first time and it was so painful that I screamed. Starting from the 8th of January 2020 I became incontinent. This was just overflow and stopped after a few days, but then started again. Today, on the 11th of January 2020 I found out that I'm still being given a heavy lot of laxatives. I don't think this is the cause of my incontinence though, as; I think that I was given laxatives constantly, from before the 7th. I only had one day off them and that was on the 9th. This is strange because, normally one sachet of movicol turns me incontinent. Before I had the enema, I had been given: two sachets of movicol, docisate sodium and two lots of suppositories in one day. Nothing worked)  Antidepressants, antipsychotics and painkillers not working now.  I'm on paracetamol, oramorth (morphine sulthate) dihydrocodeine, ibuprofen, buscopan, amatriptaline, peppermint oil, deloxatine, quatiapine, omeprazole, cefalexine (my profalactic antibiotic), cyclazine, ondansatron, zopiclone, my anti histomeine, movicol, scenna, docisate sodium and suppositories.  And no, the strong painkillers are not the reason of why I was so constipated. I was on them for the whole of the time I've been here and I've been here for over three months now; throughout that time, I've been incontinent several times. I've never stopped taking the strong painkillers!) When I could walk; at night I found myself struggling too (thought this was my quatiapine, but now I'm not so sure)  Struggling too talk because I forget what I'm saying, so can't complete sentences. Sometimes I don't even make sense, forget what I've said and repeat myself; and come out with random stuff sometimes.    Taking longer than usual too read stuff because of my eyesight issues.  Troubles concentrating. (will read something and then forget what I'm reading. The same for listening too stuff.  Saying stuff then a few hours later, forgetting what I said Also I can't stop swearing and I get angry at anything and everything I've had a urin infection for over three months and it's reaccuring and the last one was an e coli infection.  (when I could walk) At night, when it's dark; I try too stand up but quickly loose my balance and fall into things  I climbed a mountain in the lake district once and I struggled. Once at the top, my legs could no longer hold my body weight. This caused me too repeatedly fall over. My dad had too help me down and it was so hard that I kept falling, getting up was also very hard.  I've fainted several times and I got a black eye by fainting once.  I don't really remember this but, before being admitted; apparently it looked like I passed out, my eyes were rolling too. All I can remember is feeling very low and just out off it.  I'm having massive identity crisis, where I'm questioning who I am now and even my own identity. (voices in my head told me that if I just woke up one day, I could just push everything about me away and sayim someone else. I was convinced this would help me. I was going too deny my identity and change how I look and who I was, change everything about me)  A horrible sore throat (some people thought it was oral thrush as I have a white tongue)  Increasing pain and sickness (my pain is just unbearable right now and it's just getting worse every hour and every day; as that gets worse, so does my sickness)  Freaking out about stuff (so on my first night in AAU; I had these horrible nightmare dreams, where I was just floating (very complicated) then suddenly I had a reality shock of where I was, but when I woke up, it felt like I had just come back too life. Gasping as I woke up. I didn't even realise I had gone to sleep, so I screamed. It honestly felt like i had just been resuscitated back from the dead. This obviously scared me.  However then I thought I heard myself scream over and over again, like they were watching a recording off me. I thought the room had like an upper office with like a huge glass window, so that they could see us. I thought I heard them say ""the doctors gonna want to see this""  Then later ""why would you test on her, it's just her first night""  I then thought they had put something down my tube and done a test on me, too make me have the nightmare dream and have that reaction and feeling of being resuscitated back too life.  Then later on I thought I heard ""liar, liar, its all in your head""  The next evening/night, I thought they were having a secret meeting about me in the next room. My dad said no one was talking about me, but I could ""hear"" them. It's like I could hear it and my dad couldn't.  So I heard t Also I don't know if this is relivent or not but I have got this internal itching down below that is a mystery too my doctors  So I've got various different diagnosises and my symptoms are a mystery too my doctors. I have been diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, anorexia, BPD (supposedly) autism, a rare chromosome deletion called 2Q37.3 and ehlers danlos syndrome. However I think I have encephalitis and that is the cause off my mystery symptoms and illnesses. I also have an ng tube due too NY anorexia and have been sectioned since the 12th of July 2018. I haven't eaten anything solid since September 2017 and I lost my hunger very very quickly! I also haven't drank anything for over a year and a half now and my first disappeared quickly too! So my immune system has always been low and I catch infections really badly and they are always very hard too get rid off. Around the age of 17 I overdosed and was told that if I had taken just one more tablet, I would have died. I was told that I was in the CCU for a while but i don't remember anything other than be in in a strange ward with a cardiac machine. Quite freaky really! Growing up I remembered struggling too balance and walk, this caused bullying. Would say more but I can't. They have sent special blood tests to London but yeah..  Any ideas?"

He thinks that my reflexes are over working and that the link between my brain and my legs aren't working properly. He also moved my toes up and down and asked if I knew which way my toe was pointing. It felt weird and I could tell but not fully. (if that makes sense)  Right now they are questioning if it's mitochondrial, however I'm not convinced. I already have a rare chromosome deletion called 2q37.3; why would I have another DNA problem..? Plus it doesn't solve why I'm having auditory and visual hallucinations.  I'm also told they are due to do more scans.  Someone told me that I should request a ct scan (cat scan) would that show anything when mri doesn't..?  I feel so low and I feel like a freak, a freak that no one knows what's wrong with..  So right now my symptoms are: Worsening headaches that spread too my neck Joint pain Back pain Eye pain (can't open my eyes very well) Weakness that suddenly came on (can't sit up or even hold my head up) Seeing/ hear in things (I can ""hear"" people talk about me, that sound very real; but they aren't. I have too wait for my parents too go to bed before I go to bed, because otherwise I will ""hear"" them talking about, causing me to cry. Even if I do though, it doesn't really help. I can't talk to someone and let them walk away without ""hearing"" them talk about me. I used too have to pretend to go to the toilet, so I could go past the living room; just to check they weren't talking about me. I thought that everyone was out to get me and that they were talking about me. And I didn't believe them when they say they don't; because I can hear it. Right now I'm hearing a high pitched noise that no one else can hear, tried recording the sound but even that didn't pick it up. It happens a lot at night.  I can't see properly, so when my dad got me to practice opening my eyes to look at a picture; every time I looked at it, the picture would change, I got it wrong every time. Plus apparently it was the same picture every time, but to me the picture kept changing. I looked at a picture, it was of my sisters on Christmas day one year; except I didn't recognise that it was of both of my sisters. Because to me, one had strands of blue hair. Later found that this was actually my sister wearing a blue Christmas cracker hat.  I'm in hospital right now, and I was convinced my room was a different shape and bigger than it actually is. This confused me so much. I could see windows that weren't there, doors that weren't there, a bookshelf that wasn't there. A purple settee and a brown arm chair that wasn't there. A clock and stairs? That weren't there.  I thought my bed was slanted or tilted, or thought I was high up. (my mum thought it was because I can't see)  I thought my bed was triangular and sometimes thought I had somehow got my body the opposite way round (so my head was where my feet was and my feet were where my head was.  Obviously this still confuses me, but yeah..  Lack off sleep (haven't slept properly in over a month and I take strong sleeping tablets) The only time I can sleep is when I cry for hours, like last night (the 10th of January 2020) I think this is because crying makes me exhausted.  Dramatic mood swings/ outbursts (change in behavior) Sudden impulsive outbursts. (had to be restrained by two/three people a few days ago. They said I was out of control)  Worsening mood and mental health (feel invisible!)  Increasing sickness (take two different types off anti sickness tablets. I used to take three but they thought that the third (metaclorfromide) caused my incontinence with number 2, back when I was in Southampton General Hospital. This wasn't the case!)  Dizziness  Mobility changes (went from walking too not even being able too sit up and its the third time! Every time it happens, it's always worse than the last!)  Short term memory thats just getting worse and worse (forgot my dad's phone number a few days ago and I've known that, even before I even memorised mine.  Last night (3.1.2020) I was talking too my friend online and I realised how much I couldn't remember. Its scary actually. So the last think I can remember talking too my friend; was actually two years ago. I don't remember any recent conversations, it's all blank. I know we had more conversations than that, because I looked at our conversation history. Also on the 9th of January 2020, my advocate from mind, was supposed too come and see me; but I forgot. I only remembered when he texted me to cancel due to car problems. On the 11th of January 2020, I completely forgot about the whole conversation with my friend online. I only remembered when I was scrolling through my phone and saw the messaging icon on my phone.)  Struggling too go for a wee and so I'm now having to force myself to go (not pleasant. And now I have a catheter, because I was retaining over 500)  I'm constipated and laxatives don't seem to work now.i think on the 7th of January 2020, I had to have an enema for the first time and it was so painful that I screamed. Starting from the 8th of January 2020 I became incontinent. This was just overflow and stopped after a few days, but then started again. Today, on the 11th of January 2020 I found out that I'm still being given a heavy lot of laxatives. I don't think this is the cause of my incontinence though, as; I think that I was given laxatives constantly, from before the 7th. I only had one day off them and that was on the 9th. This is strange because, normally one sachet of movicol turns me incontinent. Before I had the enema, I had been given: two sachets of movicol, docisate sodium and two lots of suppositories in one day. Nothing worked)  Antidepressants, antipsychotics and painkillers not working now.  I'm on paracetamol, oramorth (morphine sulthate) dihydrocodeine, ibuprofen, buscopan, amatriptaline, peppermint oil, deloxatine, quatiapine, omeprazole, cefalexine (my profalactic antibiotic), cyclazine, ondansatron, zopiclone, my anti histomeine, movicol, scenna, docisate sodium and suppositories.  And no, the strong painkillers are not the reason of why I was so constipated. I was on them for the whole of the time I've been here and I've been here for over three months now; throughout that time, I've been incontinent several times. I've never stopped taking the strong painkillers!) When I could walk; at night I found myself struggling too (thought this was my quatiapine, but now I'm not so sure)  Struggling too talk because I forget what I'm saying, so can't complete sentences. Sometimes I don't even make sense, forget what I've said and repeat myself; and come out with random stuff sometimes.    Taking longer than usual too read stuff because of my eyesight issues.  Troubles concentrating. (will read something and then forget what I'm reading. The same for listening too stuff.  Saying stuff then a few hours later, forgetting what I said Also I can't stop swearing and I get angry at anything and everything I've had a urin infection for over three months and it's reaccuring and the last one was an e coli infection.  (when I could walk) At night, when it's dark; I try too stand up but quickly loose my balance and fall into things  I climbed a mountain in the lake district once and I struggled. Once at the top, my legs could no longer hold my body weight. This caused me too repeatedly fall over. My dad had too help me down and it was so hard that I kept falling, getting up was also very hard.  I've fainted several times and I got a black eye by fainting once.  I don't really remember this but, before being admitted; apparently it looked like I passed out, my eyes were rolling too. All I can remember is feeling very low and just out off it.  I'm having massive identity crisis, where I'm questioning who I am now and even my own identity. (voices in my head told me that if I just woke up one day, I could just push everything about me away and sayim someone else. I was convinced this would help me. I was going too deny my identity and change how I look and who I was, change everything about me)  A horrible sore throat (some people thought it was oral thrush as I have a white tongue)  Increasing pain and sickness (my pain is just unbearable right now and it's just getting worse every hour and every day; as that gets worse, so does my sickness)  Freaking out about stuff (so on my first night in AAU; I had these horrible nightmare dreams, where I was just floating (very complicated) then suddenly I had a reality shock of where I was, but when I woke up, it felt like I had just come back too life. Gasping as I woke up. I didn't even realise I had gone to sleep, so I screamed. It honestly felt like i had just been resuscitated back from the dead. This obviously scared me.  However then I thought I heard myself scream over and over again, like they were watching a recording off me. I thought the room had like an upper office with like a huge glass window, so that they could see us. I thought I heard them say ""the doctors gonna want to see this""  Then later ""why would you test on her, it's just her first night""  I then thought they had put something down my tube and done a test on me, too make me have the nightmare dream and have that reaction and feeling of being resuscitated back too life.  Then later on I thought I heard ""liar, liar, its all in your head""  The next evening/night, I thought they were having a secret meeting about me in the next room. My dad said no one was talking about me, but I could ""hear"" them. It's like I could hear it and my dad couldn't.  So I heard t Also I don't know if this is relivent or not but I have got this internal itching down below that is a mystery too my doctors  So I've got various different diagnosises and my symptoms are a mystery too my doctors. I have been diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, anorexia, BPD (supposedly) autism, a rare chromosome deletion called 2Q37.3 and ehlers danlos syndrome. However I think I have encephalitis and that is the cause off my mystery symptoms and illnesses. I also have an ng tube due too NY anorexia and have been sectioned since the 12th of July 2018. I haven't eaten anything solid since September 2017 and I lost my hunger very very quickly! I also haven't drank anything for over a year and a half now and my first disappeared quickly too! So my immune system has always been low and I catch infections really badly and they are always very hard too get rid off. Around the age of 17 I overdosed and was told that if I had taken just one more tablet, I would have died. I was told that I was in the CCU for a while but i don't remember anything other than be in in a strange ward with a cardiac machine. Quite freaky really! Growing up I remembered struggling too balance and walk, this caused bullying. Would say more but I can't. They have sent special blood tests to London but yeah..  Any ideas?"

Loosing hope... :(,"Hi. My name is Megan Lofthouse, I'm 24 years old and I live in the UK.  So after crying for what felt like hours, I've decided to contact you guys. However I keep forgetting that it's on a website and that if I minimise this, I will loose everything I've written. It's annoying because I got really far with this message! So now I'm writing it on a blank email, so that; if I forget and minimise this, I won't loose everything I've just written.  So this isn't complete because now things have got so bad that my brain is now completely blank and I've lost so much strength that I can barely type. My hands and feet have gone completely numb, I can't feel pain; its just dulled pain. I can't feel emotions, yet with a flick off a switch, I'm either angry or crying. I have no idea where it comes from either... Anyway, I'm in The Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, UK and I'm desperate for your help.  I've been in the acute admissions unit for over 4 months and I'm progressively just getting worse.  It's hard for me to type now as I don't have the strength and my fingers hurt, but I'm desperate. I have my phone rested on the bottom bar of my bed, very close to me. This is because I don't have the strength to even hold my phone.  So, until today, I was pretty sure that I had autoimmune encephalitis. However today, I found out that my mri scan came out normal.  However today (11th of January 2020) I've just realised that, Susanah (the writer and survivor, who wrote the true book brain on fire) had all normal test results too. So there is still a possibility that I have it.  They've sent off 4 test tubes of blood off to test for antibodies that'd indicate that I have encephalitis.

Lack off sleep (haven't slept properly in over a month and I take strong sleeping tablets) The only time I can sleep is when I cry for hours, like last night (the 10th of January 2020) I think this is because crying makes me exhausted.  Dramatic mood swings/ outbursts (change in behavior) Sudden impulsive outbursts. (had to be restrained by two/three people a few days ago. They said I was out of control)  Worsening mood and mental health (feel invisible!)  Increasing sickness (take two different types off anti sickness tablets. I used to take three but they thought that the third (metaclorfromide) caused my incontinence with number 2, back when I was in Southampton General Hospital. This wasn't the case!)  Dizziness  Mobility changes (went from walking too not even being able too sit up and its the third time! Every time it happens, it's always worse than the last!)  Short term memory thats just getting worse and worse (forgot my dad's phone number a few days ago and I've known that, even before I even memorised mine.  Last night (3.1.2020) I was talking too my friend online and I realised how much I couldn't remember. Its scary actually. So the last think I can remember talking too my friend; was actually two years ago. I don't remember any recent conversations, it's all blank. I know we had more conversations than that, because I looked at our conversation history. Also on the 9th of January 2020, my advocate from mind, was supposed too come and see me; but I forgot. I only remembered when he texted me to cancel due to car problems. On the 11th of January 2020, I completely forgot about the whole conversation with my friend online. I only remembered when I was scrolling through my phone and saw the messaging icon on my phone.)  Struggling too go for a wee and so I'm now having to force myself to go (not pleasant. And now I have a catheter, because I was retaining over 500)  I'm constipated and laxatives don't seem to work now.i think on the 7th of January 2020, I had to have an enema for the first time and it was so painful that I screamed. Starting from the 8th of January 2020 I became incontinent. This was just overflow and stopped after a few days, but then started again. Today, on the 11th of January 2020 I found out that I'm still being given a heavy lot of laxatives. I don't think this is the cause of my incontinence though, as; I think that I was given laxatives constantly, from before the 7th. I only had one day off them and that was on the 9th. This is strange because, normally one sachet of movicol turns me incontinent. Before I had the enema, I had been given: two sachets of movicol, docisate sodium and two lots of suppositories in one day. Nothing worked)  Antidepressants, antipsychotics and painkillers not working now.  I'm on paracetamol, oramorth (morphine sulthate) dihydrocodeine, ibuprofen, buscopan, amatriptaline, peppermint oil, deloxatine, quatiapine, omeprazole, cefalexine (my profalactic antibiotic), cyclazine, ondansatron, zopiclone, my anti histomeine, movicol, scenna, docisate sodium and suppositories.  And no, the strong painkillers are not the reason of why I was so constipated. I was on them for the whole of the time I've been here and I've been here for over three months now; throughout that time, I've been incontinent several times. I've never stopped taking the strong painkillers!) When I could walk; at night I found myself struggling too (thought this was my quatiapine, but now I'm not so sure)  Struggling too talk because I forget what I'm saying, so can't complete sentences. Sometimes I don't even make sense, forget what I've said and repeat myself; and come out with random stuff sometimes.    Taking longer than usual too read stuff because of my eyesight issues.  Troubles concentrating. (will read something and then forget what I'm reading. The same for listening too stuff.  Saying stuff then a few hours later, forgetting what I said Also I can't stop swearing and I get angry at anything and everything I've had a urin infection for over three months and it's reaccuring and the last one was an e coli infection.  (when I could walk) At night, when it's dark; I try too stand up but quickly loose my balance and fall into things  I climbed a mountain in the lake district once and I struggled. Once at the top, my legs could no longer hold my body weight. This caused me too repeatedly fall over. My dad had too help me down and it was so hard that I kept falling, getting up was also very hard.  I've fainted several times and I got a black eye by fainting once.  I don't really remember this but, before being admitted; apparently it looked like I passed out, my eyes were rolling too. All I can remember is feeling very low and just out off it.  I'm having massive identity crisis, where I'm questioning who I am now and even my own identity. (voices in my head told me that if I just woke up one day, I could just push everything about me away and sayim someone else. I was convinced this would help me. I was going too deny my identity and change how I look and who I was, change everything about me)  A horrible sore throat (some people thought it was oral thrush as I have a white tongue)  Increasing pain and sickness (my pain is just unbearable right now and it's just getting worse every hour and every day; as that gets worse, so does my sickness)  Freaking out about stuff (so on my first night in AAU; I had these horrible nightmare dreams, where I was just floating (very complicated) then suddenly I had a reality shock of where I was, but when I woke up, it felt like I had just come back too life. Gasping as I woke up. I didn't even realise I had gone to sleep, so I screamed. It honestly felt like i had just been resuscitated back from the dead. This obviously scared me.  However then I thought I heard myself scream over and over again, like they were watching a recording off me. I thought the room had like an upper office with like a huge glass window, so that they could see us. I thought I heard them say ""the doctors gonna want to see this""  Then later ""why would you test on her, it's just her first night""  I then thought they had put something down my tube and done a test on me, too make me have the nightmare dream and have that reaction and feeling of being resuscitated back too life.  Then later on I thought I heard ""liar, liar, its all in your head""  The next evening/night, I thought they were having a secret meeting about me in the next room. My dad said no one was talking about me, but I could ""hear"" them. It's like I could hear it and my dad couldn't.  So I heard t Also I don't know if this is relivent or not but I have got this internal itching down below that is a mystery too my doctors  So I've got various different diagnosises and my symptoms are a mystery too my doctors. I have been diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, anorexia, BPD (supposedly) autism, a rare chromosome deletion called 2Q37.3 and ehlers danlos syndrome. However I think I have encephalitis and that is the cause off my mystery symptoms and illnesses. I also have an ng tube due too NY anorexia and have been sectioned since the 12th of July 2018. I haven't eaten anything solid since September 2017 and I lost my hunger very very quickly! I also haven't drank anything for over a year and a half now and my first disappeared quickly too! So my immune system has always been low and I catch infections really badly and they are always very hard too get rid off. Around the age of 17 I overdosed and was told that if I had taken just one more tablet, I would have died. I was told that I was in the CCU for a while but i don't remember anything other than be in in a strange ward with a cardiac machine. Quite freaky really! Growing up I remembered struggling too balance and walk, this caused bullying. Would say more but I can't. They have sent special blood tests to London but yeah..  Any ideas?"

Loosing hope... :(,"Hi. My name is Megan Lofthouse, I'm 24 years old and I live in the UK.  So after crying for what felt like hours, I've decided to contact you guys. However I keep forgetting that it's on a website and that if I minimise this, I will loose everything I've written. It's annoying because I got really far with this message! So now I'm writing it on a blank email, so that; if I forget and minimise this, I won't loose everything I've just written.  So this isn't complete because now things have got so bad that my brain is now completely blank and I've lost so much strength that I can barely type. My hands and feet have gone completely numb, I can't feel pain; its just dulled pain. I can't feel emotions, yet with a flick off a switch, I'm either angry or crying. I have no idea where it comes from either... Anyway, I'm in The Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, UK and I'm desperate for your help.  I've been in the acute admissions unit for over 4 months and I'm progressively just getting worse.  It's hard for me to type now as I don't have the strength and my fingers hurt, but I'm desperate. I have my phone rested on the bottom bar of my bed, very close to me. This is because I don't have the strength to even hold my phone.  So, until today, I was pretty sure that I had autoimmune encephalitis. However today, I found out that my mri scan came out normal.  However today (11th of January 2020) I've just realised that, Susanah (the writer and survivor, who wrote the true book brain on fire) had all normal test results too. So there is still a possibility that I have it.  They've sent off 4 test tubes of blood off to test for antibodies that'd indicate that I have encephalitis. However, I'm told that these blood tests won't come back for weeks. Also blood tests aren't always that reliable either. They've sent a urin sample off too.  A neorologist saw me on the 8th of January 2020.he did several reflex tests and during it. My right leg started shaking out of control. He thinks that my reflexes are over working and that the link between my brain and my legs aren't working properly. He also moved my toes up and down and asked if I knew which way my toe was pointing. It felt weird and I could tell but not fully. (if that makes sense)  Right now they are questioning if it's mitochondrial, however I'm not convinced. I already have a rare chromosome deletion called 2q37.3; why would I have another DNA problem..? Plus it doesn't solve why I'm having auditory and visual hallucinations.  I'm also told they are due to do more scans.  Someone told me that I should request a ct scan (cat scan) would that show anything when mri doesn't..?  I feel so low and I feel like a freak, a freak that no one knows what's wrong with..  So right now my symptoms are: Worsening headaches that spread too my neck Joint pain Back pain Eye pain (can't open my eyes very well) Weakness that suddenly came on (can't sit up or even hold my head up) Seeing/ hear in things (I can ""hear"" people talk about me, that sound very real; but they aren't. I have too wait for my parents too go to bed before I go to bed, because otherwise I will ""hear"" them talking about, causing me to cry. Even if I do though, it doesn't really help. I can't talk to someone and let them walk away without ""hearing"" them talk about me. I used too have to pretend to go to the toilet, so I could go past the living room; just to check they weren't talking about me. I thought that everyone was out to get me and that they were talking about me. And I didn't believe them when they say they don't; because I can hear it. Right now I'm hearing a high pitched noise that no one else can hear, tried recording the sound but even that didn't pick it up. It happens a lot at night.  I can't see properly, so when my dad got me to practice opening my eyes to look at a picture; every time I looked at it, the picture would change, I got it wrong every time. Plus apparently it was the same picture every time, but to me the picture kept changing. I looked at a picture, it was of my sisters on Christmas day one year; except I didn't recognise that it was of both of my sisters. Because to me, one had strands of blue hair. Later found that this was actually my sister wearing a blue Christmas cracker hat.  I'm in hospital right now, and I was convinced my room was a different shape and bigger than it actually is. This confused me so much. I could see windows that weren't there, doors that weren't there, a bookshelf that wasn't there. A purple settee and a brown arm chair that wasn't there. A clock and stairs? That weren't there.  I thought my bed was slanted or tilted, or thought I was high up. (my mum thought it was because I can't see)  I thought my bed was triangular and sometimes thought I had somehow got my body the opposite way round (so my head was where my feet was and my feet were where my head was.

And no, the strong painkillers are not the reason of why I was so constipated. I was on them for the whole of the time I've been here and I've been here for over three months now; throughout that time, I've been incontinent several times. I've never stopped taking the strong painkillers!) When I could walk; at night I found myself struggling too (thought this was my quatiapine, but now I'm not so sure)  Struggling too talk because I forget what I'm saying, so can't complete sentences. Sometimes I don't even make sense, forget what I've said and repeat myself; and come out with random stuff sometimes.    Taking longer than usual too read stuff because of my eyesight issues.  Troubles concentrating. (will read something and then forget what I'm reading. The same for listening too stuff.  Saying stuff then a few hours later, forgetting what I said Also I can't stop swearing and I get angry at anything and everything I've had a urin infection for over three months and it's reaccuring and the last one was an e coli infection.  (when I could walk) At night, when it's dark; I try too stand up but quickly loose my balance and fall into things  I climbed a mountain in the lake district once and I struggled. Once at the top, my legs could no longer hold my body weight. This caused me too repeatedly fall over. My dad had too help me down and it was so hard that I kept falling, getting up was also very hard.  I've fainted several times and I got a black eye by fainting once.  I don't really remember this but, before being admitted; apparently it looked like I passed out, my eyes were rolling too. All I can remember is feeling very low and just out off it.  I'm having massive identity crisis, where I'm questioning who I am now and even my own identity. (voices in my head told me that if I just woke up one day, I could just push everything about me away and sayim someone else. I was convinced this would help me. I was going too deny my identity and change how I look and who I was, change everything about me)  A horrible sore throat (some people thought it was oral thrush as I have a white tongue)  Increasing pain and sickness (my pain is just unbearable right now and it's just getting worse every hour and every day; as that gets worse, so does my sickness)  Freaking out about stuff (so on my first night in AAU; I had these horrible nightmare dreams, where I was just floating (very complicated) then suddenly I had a reality shock of where I was, but when I woke up, it felt like I had just come back too life. Gasping as I woke up. I didn't even realise I had gone to sleep, so I screamed. It honestly felt like i had just been resuscitated back from the dead. This obviously scared me.  However then I thought I heard myself scream over and over again, like they were watching a recording off me. I thought the room had like an upper office with like a huge glass window, so that they could see us. I thought I heard them say ""the doctors gonna want to see this""  Then later ""why would you test on her, it's just her first night""  I then thought they had put something down my tube and done a test on me, too make me have the nightmare dream and have that reaction and feeling of being resuscitated back too life.  Then later on I thought I heard ""liar, liar, its all in your head""  The next evening/night, I thought they were having a secret meeting about me in the next room. My dad said no one was talking about me, but I could ""hear"" them. It's like I could hear it and my dad couldn't.  So I heard t Also I don't know if this is relivent or not but I have got this internal itching down below that is a mystery too my doctors  So I've got various different diagnosises and my symptoms are a mystery too my doctors. I have been diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, anorexia, BPD (supposedly) autism, a rare chromosome deletion called 2Q37.3 and ehlers danlos syndrome. However I think I have encephalitis and that is the cause off my mystery symptoms and illnesses. I also have an ng tube due too NY anorexia and have been sectioned since the 12th of July 2018. I haven't eaten anything solid since September 2017 and I lost my hunger very very quickly! I also haven't drank anything for over a year and a half now and my first disappeared quickly too! So my immune system has always been low and I catch infections really badly and they are always very hard too get rid off. Around the age of 17 I overdosed and was told that if I had taken just one more tablet, I would have died. I was told that I was in the CCU for a while but i don't remember anything other than be in in a strange ward with a cardiac machine. Quite freaky really! Growing up I remembered struggling too balance and walk, this caused bullying. Would say more but I can't. They have sent special blood tests to London but yeah..  Any ideas?"

Loosing hope... :(,"Hi. My name is Megan Lofthouse, I'm 24 years old and I live in the UK.  So after crying for what felt like hours, I've decided to contact you guys. However I keep forgetting that it's on a website and that if I minimise this, I will loose everything I've written. It's annoying because I got really far with this message! So now I'm writing it on a blank email, so that; if I forget and minimise this, I won't loose everything I've just written.  So this isn't complete because now things have got so bad that my brain is now completely blank and I've lost so much strength that I can barely type. My hands and feet have gone completely numb, I can't feel pain; its just dulled pain. I can't feel emotions, yet with a flick off a switch, I'm either angry or crying. I have no idea where it comes from either... Anyway, I'm in The Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, UK and I'm desperate for your help.  I've been in the acute admissions unit for over 4 months and I'm progressively just getting worse.  It's hard for me to type now as I don't have the strength and my fingers hurt, but I'm desperate. I have my phone rested on the bottom bar of my bed, very close to me. This is because I don't have the strength to even hold my phone.  So, until today, I was pretty sure that I had autoimmune encephalitis. However today, I found out that my mri scan came out normal.  However today (11th of January 2020) I've just realised that, Susanah (the writer and survivor, who wrote the true book brain on fire) had all normal test results too. So there is still a possibility that I have it.  They've sent off 4 test tubes of blood off to test for antibodies that'd indicate that I have encephalitis. However, I'm told that these blood tests won't come back for weeks. Also blood tests aren't always that reliable either. They've sent a urin sample off too.  A neorologist saw me on the 8th of January 2020.he did several reflex tests and during it. My right leg started shaking out of control. He thinks that my reflexes are over working and that the link between my brain and my legs aren't working properly. He also moved my toes up and down and asked if I knew which way my toe was pointing. It felt weird and I could tell but not fully. (if that makes sense)  Right now they are questioning if it's mitochondrial, however I'm not convinced. I already have a rare chromosome deletion called 2q37.3; why would I have another DNA problem..? Plus it doesn't solve why I'm having auditory and visual hallucinations.  I'm also told they are due to do more scans.  Someone told me that I should request a ct scan (cat scan) would that show anything when mri doesn't..?  I feel so low and I feel like a freak, a freak that no one knows what's wrong with..  So right now my symptoms are: Worsening headaches that spread too my neck Joint pain Back pain Eye pain (can't open my eyes very well) Weakness that suddenly came on (can't sit up or even hold my head up) Seeing/ hear in things (I can ""hear"" people talk about me, that sound very real; but they aren't. I have too wait for my parents too go to bed before I go to bed, because otherwise I will ""hear"" them talking about, causing me to cry. Even if I do though, it doesn't really help. I can't talk to someone and let them walk away without ""hearing"" them talk about me. I used too have to pretend to go to the toilet, so I could go past the living room; just to check they weren't talking about me. I thought that everyone was out to get me and that they were talking about me. And I didn't believe them when they say they don't; because I can hear it. Right now I'm hearing a high pitched noise that no one else can hear, tried recording the sound but even that didn't pick it up. It happens a lot at night.  I can't see properly, so when my dad got me to practice opening my eyes to look at a picture; every time I looked at it, the picture would change, I got it wrong every time. Plus apparently it was the same picture every time, but to me the picture kept changing. I looked at a picture, it was of my sisters on Christmas day one year; except I didn't recognise that it was of both of my sisters. Because to me, one had strands of blue hair. Later found that this was actually my sister wearing a blue Christmas cracker hat.  I'm in hospital right now, and I was convinced my room was a different shape and bigger than it actually is. This confused me so much. I could see windows that weren't there, doors that weren't there, a bookshelf that wasn't there. A purple settee and a brown arm chair that wasn't there. A clock and stairs? That weren't there.  I thought my bed was slanted or tilted, or thought I was high up. (my mum thought it was because I can't see)  I thought my bed was triangular and sometimes thought I had somehow got my body the opposite way round (so my head was where my feet was and my feet were where my head was.  Obviously this still confuses me, but yeah..  Lack off sleep (haven't slept properly in over a month and I take strong sleeping tablets) The only time I can sleep is when I cry for hours, like last night (the 10th of January 2020) I think this is because crying makes me exhausted.  Dramatic mood swings/ outbursts (change in behavior) Sudden impulsive outbursts. (had to be restrained by two/three people a few days ago. They said I was out of control)  Worsening mood and mental health (feel invisible!)  Increasing sickness (take two different types off anti sickness tablets. I used to take three but they thought that the third (metaclorfromide) caused my incontinence with number 2, back when I was in Southampton General Hospital. This wasn't the case!)  Dizziness  Mobility changes (went from walking too not even being able too sit up and its the third time! Every time it happens, it's always worse than the last!)  Short term memory thats just getting worse and worse (forgot my dad's phone number a few days ago and I've known that, even before I even memorised mine.  Last night (3.1.2020) I was talking too my friend online and I realised how much I couldn't remember. Its scary actually. So the last think I can remember talking too my friend; was actually two years ago. I don't remember any recent conversations, it's all blank. I know we had more conversations than that, because I looked at our conversation history. Also on the 9th of January 2020, my advocate from mind, was supposed too come and see me; but I forgot. I only remembered when he texted me to cancel due to car problems. On the 11th of January 2020, I completely forgot about the whole conversation with my friend online. I only remembered when I was scrolling through my phone and saw the messaging icon on my phone.)  Struggling too go for a wee and so I'm now having to force myself to go (not pleasant. And now I have a catheter, because I was retaining over 500)  I'm constipated and laxatives don't seem to work now.i think on the 7th of January 2020, I had to have an enema for the first time and it was so painful that I screamed. Starting from the 8th of January 2020 I became incontinent. This was just overflow and stopped after a few days, but then started again. Today, on the 11th of January 2020 I found out that I'm still being given a heavy lot of laxatives. I don't think this is the cause of my incontinence though, as; I think that I was given laxatives constantly, from before the 7th. I only had one day off them and that was on the 9th. This is strange because, normally one sachet of movicol turns me incontinent. Before I had the enema, I had been given: two sachets of movicol, docisate sodium and two lots of suppositories in one day. Nothing worked)  Antidepressants, antipsychotics and painkillers not working now.  I'm on paracetamol, oramorth (morphine sulthate) dihydrocodeine, ibuprofen, buscopan, amatriptaline, peppermint oil, deloxatine, quatiapine, omeprazole, cefalexine (my profalactic antibiotic), cyclazine, ondansatron, zopiclone, my anti histomeine, movicol, scenna, docisate sodium and suppositories.

I thought I heard them say ""the doctors gonna want to see this""  Then later ""why would you test on her, it's just her first night""  I then thought they had put something down my tube and done a test on me, too make me have the nightmare dream and have that reaction and feeling of being resuscitated back too life.  Then later on I thought I heard ""liar, liar, its all in your head""  The next evening/night, I thought they were having a secret meeting about me in the next room. My dad said no one was talking about me, but I could ""hear"" them. It's like I could hear it and my dad couldn't.  So I heard t Also I don't know if this is relivent or not but I have got this internal itching down below that is a mystery too my doctors  So I've got various different diagnosises and my symptoms are a mystery too my doctors. I have been diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, anorexia, BPD (supposedly) autism, a rare chromosome deletion called 2Q37.3 and ehlers danlos syndrome. However I think I have encephalitis and that is the cause off my mystery symptoms and illnesses. I also have an ng tube due too NY anorexia and have been sectioned since the 12th of July 2018. I haven't eaten anything solid since September 2017 and I lost my hunger very very quickly! I also haven't drank anything for over a year and a half now and my first disappeared quickly too! So my immune system has always been low and I catch infections really badly and they are always very hard too get rid off. Around the age of 17 I overdosed and was told that if I had taken just one more tablet, I would have died. I was told that I was in the CCU for a while but i don't remember anything other than be in in a strange ward with a cardiac machine. Quite freaky really! Growing up I remembered struggling too balance and walk, this caused bullying. Would say more but I can't. They have sent special blood tests to London but yeah..  Any ideas?"

Loosing hope... :(,"Hi. My name is Megan Lofthouse, I'm 24 years old and I live in the UK.  So after crying for what felt like hours, I've decided to contact you guys. However I keep forgetting that it's on a website and that if I minimise this, I will loose everything I've written. It's annoying because I got really far with this message! So now I'm writing it on a blank email, so that; if I forget and minimise this, I won't loose everything I've just written.  So this isn't complete because now things have got so bad that my brain is now completely blank and I've lost so much strength that I can barely type. My hands and feet have gone completely numb, I can't feel pain; its just dulled pain. I can't feel emotions, yet with a flick off a switch, I'm either angry or crying. I have no idea where it comes from either... Anyway, I'm in The Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, UK and I'm desperate for your help.  I've been in the acute admissions unit for over 4 months and I'm progressively just getting worse.  It's hard for me to type now as I don't have the strength and my fingers hurt, but I'm desperate. I have my phone rested on the bottom bar of my bed, very close to me. This is because I don't have the strength to even hold my phone.  So, until today, I was pretty sure that I had autoimmune encephalitis. However today, I found out that my mri scan came out normal.  However today (11th of January 2020) I've just realised that, Susanah (the writer and survivor, who wrote the true book brain on fire) had all normal test results too. So there is still a possibility that I have it.  They've sent off 4 test tubes of blood off to test for antibodies that'd indicate that I have encephalitis. However, I'm told that these blood tests won't come back for weeks. Also blood tests aren't always that reliable either. They've sent a urin sample off too.  A neorologist saw me on the 8th of January 2020.he did several reflex tests and during it. My right leg started shaking out of control. He thinks that my reflexes are over working and that the link between my brain and my legs aren't working properly. He also moved my toes up and down and asked if I knew which way my toe was pointing. It felt weird and I could tell but not fully. (if that makes sense)  Right now they are questioning if it's mitochondrial, however I'm not convinced. I already have a rare chromosome deletion called 2q37.3; why would I have another DNA problem..? Plus it doesn't solve why I'm having auditory and visual hallucinations.  I'm also told they are due to do more scans.  Someone told me that I should request a ct scan (cat scan) would that show anything when mri doesn't..?  I feel so low and I feel like a freak, a freak that no one knows what's wrong with..  So right now my symptoms are: Worsening headaches that spread too my neck Joint pain Back pain Eye pain (can't open my eyes very well) Weakness that suddenly came on (can't sit up or even hold my head up) Seeing/ hear in things (I can ""hear"" people talk about me, that sound very real; but they aren't. I have too wait for my parents too go to bed before I go to bed, because otherwise I will ""hear"" them talking about, causing me to cry. Even if I do though, it doesn't really help. I can't talk to someone and let them walk away without ""hearing"" them talk about me. I used too have to pretend to go to the toilet, so I could go past the living room; just to check they weren't talking about me. I thought that everyone was out to get me and that they were talking about me. And I didn't believe them when they say they don't; because I can hear it. Right now I'm hearing a high pitched noise that no one else can hear, tried recording the sound but even that didn't pick it up. It happens a lot at night.  I can't see properly, so when my dad got me to practice opening my eyes to look at a picture; every time I looked at it, the picture would change, I got it wrong every time. Plus apparently it was the same picture every time, but to me the picture kept changing. I looked at a picture, it was of my sisters on Christmas day one year; except I didn't recognise that it was of both of my sisters. Because to me, one had strands of blue hair. Later found that this was actually my sister wearing a blue Christmas cracker hat.  I'm in hospital right now, and I was convinced my room was a different shape and bigger than it actually is. This confused me so much. I could see windows that weren't there, doors that weren't there, a bookshelf that wasn't there. A purple settee and a brown arm chair that wasn't there. A clock and stairs? That weren't there.  I thought my bed was slanted or tilted, or thought I was high up. (my mum thought it was because I can't see)  I thought my bed was triangular and sometimes thought I had somehow got my body the opposite way round (so my head was where my feet was and my feet were where my head was.  Obviously this still confuses me, but yeah..  Lack off sleep (haven't slept properly in over a month and I take strong sleeping tablets) The only time I can sleep is when I cry for hours, like last night (the 10th of January 2020) I think this is because crying makes me exhausted.  Dramatic mood swings/ outbursts (change in behavior) Sudden impulsive outbursts. (had to be restrained by two/three people a few days ago. They said I was out of control)  Worsening mood and mental health (feel invisible!)  Increasing sickness (take two different types off anti sickness tablets. I used to take three but they thought that the third (metaclorfromide) caused my incontinence with number 2, back when I was in Southampton General Hospital. This wasn't the case!)  Dizziness  Mobility changes (went from walking too not even being able too sit up and its the third time! Every time it happens, it's always worse than the last!)  Short term memory thats just getting worse and worse (forgot my dad's phone number a few days ago and I've known that, even before I even memorised mine.  Last night (3.1.2020) I was talking too my friend online and I realised how much I couldn't remember. Its scary actually. So the last think I can remember talking too my friend; was actually two years ago. I don't remember any recent conversations, it's all blank. I know we had more conversations than that, because I looked at our conversation history. Also on the 9th of January 2020, my advocate from mind, was supposed too come and see me; but I forgot. I only remembered when he texted me to cancel due to car problems. On the 11th of January 2020, I completely forgot about the whole conversation with my friend online. I only remembered when I was scrolling through my phone and saw the messaging icon on my phone.)  Struggling too go for a wee and so I'm now having to force myself to go (not pleasant. And now I have a catheter, because I was retaining over 500)  I'm constipated and laxatives don't seem to work now.i think on the 7th of January 2020, I had to have an enema for the first time and it was so painful that I screamed. Starting from the 8th of January 2020 I became incontinent. This was just overflow and stopped after a few days, but then started again. Today, on the 11th of January 2020 I found out that I'm still being given a heavy lot of laxatives. I don't think this is the cause of my incontinence though, as; I think that I was given laxatives constantly, from before the 7th. I only had one day off them and that was on the 9th. This is strange because, normally one sachet of movicol turns me incontinent. Before I had the enema, I had been given: two sachets of movicol, docisate sodium and two lots of suppositories in one day. Nothing worked)  Antidepressants, antipsychotics and painkillers not working now.  I'm on paracetamol, oramorth (morphine sulthate) dihydrocodeine, ibuprofen, buscopan, amatriptaline, peppermint oil, deloxatine, quatiapine, omeprazole, cefalexine (my profalactic antibiotic), cyclazine, ondansatron, zopiclone, my anti histomeine, movicol, scenna, docisate sodium and suppositories.  And no, the strong painkillers are not the reason of why I was so constipated. I was on them for the whole of the time I've been here and I've been here for over three months now; throughout that time, I've been incontinent several times. I've never stopped taking the strong painkillers!) When I could walk; at night I found myself struggling too (thought this was my quatiapine, but now I'm not so sure)  Struggling too talk because I forget what I'm saying, so can't complete sentences. Sometimes I don't even make sense, forget what I've said and repeat myself; and come out with random stuff sometimes.    Taking longer than usual too read stuff because of my eyesight issues.  Troubles concentrating. (will read something and then forget what I'm reading. The same for listening too stuff.  Saying stuff then a few hours later, forgetting what I said Also I can't stop swearing and I get angry at anything and everything I've had a urin infection for over three months and it's reaccuring and the last one was an e coli infection.  (when I could walk) At night, when it's dark; I try too stand up but quickly loose my balance and fall into things  I climbed a mountain in the lake district once and I struggled. Once at the top, my legs could no longer hold my body weight. This caused me too repeatedly fall over. My dad had too help me down and it was so hard that I kept falling, getting up was also very hard.  I've fainted several times and I got a black eye by fainting once.  I don't really remember this but, before being admitted; apparently it looked like I passed out, my eyes were rolling too. All I can remember is feeling very low and just out off it.  I'm having massive identity crisis, where I'm questioning who I am now and even my own identity. (voices in my head told me that if I just woke up one day, I could just push everything about me away and sayim someone else. I was convinced this would help me. I was going too deny my identity and change how I look and who I was, change everything about me)  A horrible sore throat (some people thought it was oral thrush as I have a white tongue)  Increasing pain and sickness (my pain is just unbearable right now and it's just getting worse every hour and every day; as that gets worse, so does my sickness)  Freaking out about stuff (so on my first night in AAU; I had these horrible nightmare dreams, where I was just floating (very complicated) then suddenly I had a reality shock of where I was, but when I woke up, it felt like I had just come back too life. Gasping as I woke up. I didn't even realise I had gone to sleep, so I screamed. It honestly felt like i had just been resuscitated back from the dead. This obviously scared me.  However then I thought I heard myself scream over and over again, like they were watching a recording off me.

Loosing hope... :(,"Hi. My name is Megan Lofthouse, I'm 24 years old and I live in the UK.  So after crying for what felt like hours, I've decided to contact you guys. However I keep forgetting that it's on a website and that if I minimise this, I will loose everything I've written. It's annoying because I got really far with this message! So now I'm writing it on a blank email, so that; if I forget and minimise this, I won't loose everything I've just written.  So this isn't complete because now things have got so bad that my brain is now completely blank and I've lost so much strength that I can barely type. My hands and feet have gone completely numb, I can't feel pain; its just dulled pain. I can't feel emotions, yet with a flick off a switch, I'm either angry or crying. I have no idea where it comes from either... Anyway, I'm in The Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, UK and I'm desperate for your help.  I've been in the acute admissions unit for over 4 months and I'm progressively just getting worse.  It's hard for me to type now as I don't have the strength and my fingers hurt, but I'm desperate. I have my phone rested on the bottom bar of my bed, very close to me. This is because I don't have the strength to even hold my phone.  So, until today, I was pretty sure that I had autoimmune encephalitis. However today, I found out that my mri scan came out normal.  However today (11th of January 2020) I've just realised that, Susanah (the writer and survivor, who wrote the true book brain on fire) had all normal test results too. So there is still a possibility that I have it.  They've sent off 4 test tubes of blood off to test for antibodies that'd indicate that I have encephalitis. However, I'm told that these blood tests won't come back for weeks. Also blood tests aren't always that reliable either. They've sent a urin sample off too.  A neorologist saw me on the 8th of January 2020.he did several reflex tests and during it. My right leg started shaking out of control. He thinks that my reflexes are over working and that the link between my brain and my legs aren't working properly. He also moved my toes up and down and asked if I knew which way my toe was pointing. It felt weird and I could tell but not fully. (if that makes sense)  Right now they are questioning if it's mitochondrial, however I'm not convinced. I already have a rare chromosome deletion called 2q37.3; why would I have another DNA problem..? Plus it doesn't solve why I'm having auditory and visual hallucinations.  I'm also told they are due to do more scans.  Someone told me that I should request a ct scan (cat scan) would that show anything when mri doesn't..?  I feel so low and I feel like a freak, a freak that no one knows what's wrong with..  So right now my symptoms are: Worsening headaches that spread too my neck Joint pain Back pain Eye pain (can't open my eyes very well) Weakness that suddenly came on (can't sit up or even hold my head up) Seeing/ hear in things (I can ""hear"" people talk about me, that sound very real; but they aren't. I have too wait for my parents too go to bed before I go to bed, because otherwise I will ""hear"" them talking about, causing me to cry. Even if I do though, it doesn't really help. I can't talk to someone and let them walk away without ""hearing"" them talk about me. I used too have to pretend to go to the toilet, so I could go past the living room; just to check they weren't talking about me. I thought that everyone was out to get me and that they were talking about me. And I didn't believe them when they say they don't; because I can hear it. Right now I'm hearing a high pitched noise that no one else can hear, tried recording the sound but even that didn't pick it up. It happens a lot at night.  I can't see properly, so when my dad got me to practice opening my eyes to look at a picture; every time I looked at it, the picture would change, I got it wrong every time. Plus apparently it was the same picture every time, but to me the picture kept changing. I looked at a picture, it was of my sisters on Christmas day one year; except I didn't recognise that it was of both of my sisters. Because to me, one had strands of blue hair. Later found that this was actually my sister wearing a blue Christmas cracker hat.  I'm in hospital right now, and I was convinced my room was a different shape and bigger than it actually is. This confused me so much. I could see windows that weren't there, doors that weren't there, a bookshelf that wasn't there. A purple settee and a brown arm chair that wasn't there. A clock and stairs? That weren't there.  I thought my bed was slanted or tilted, or thought I was high up. (my mum thought it was because I can't see)  I thought my bed was triangular and sometimes thought I had somehow got my body the opposite way round (so my head was where my feet was and my feet were where my head was.  Obviously this still confuses me, but yeah..  Lack off sleep (haven't slept properly in over a month and I take strong sleeping tablets) The only time I can sleep is when I cry for hours, like last night (the 10th of January 2020) I think this is because crying makes me exhausted.  Dramatic mood swings/ outbursts (change in behavior) Sudden impulsive outbursts. (had to be restrained by two/three people a few days ago. They said I was out of control)  Worsening mood and mental health (feel invisible!)  Increasing sickness (take two different types off anti sickness tablets. I used to take three but they thought that the third (metaclorfromide) caused my incontinence with number 2, back when I was in Southampton General Hospital. This wasn't the case!)  Dizziness  Mobility changes (went from walking too not even being able too sit up and its the third time! Every time it happens, it's always worse than the last!)  Short term memory thats just getting worse and worse (forgot my dad's phone number a few days ago and I've known that, even before I even memorised mine.  Last night (3.1.2020) I was talking too my friend online and I realised how much I couldn't remember. Its scary actually. So the last think I can remember talking too my friend; was actually two years ago. I don't remember any recent conversations, it's all blank. I know we had more conversations than that, because I looked at our conversation history. Also on the 9th of January 2020, my advocate from mind, was supposed too come and see me; but I forgot. I only remembered when he texted me to cancel due to car problems. On the 11th of January 2020, I completely forgot about the whole conversation with my friend online. I only remembered when I was scrolling through my phone and saw the messaging icon on my phone.)  Struggling too go for a wee and so I'm now having to force myself to go (not pleasant. And now I have a catheter, because I was retaining over 500)  I'm constipated and laxatives don't seem to work now.i think on the 7th of January 2020, I had to have an enema for the first time and it was so painful that I screamed. Starting from the 8th of January 2020 I became incontinent. This was just overflow and stopped after a few days, but then started again. Today, on the 11th of January 2020 I found out that I'm still being given a heavy lot of laxatives. I don't think this is the cause of my incontinence though, as; I think that I was given laxatives constantly, from before the 7th. I only had one day off them and that was on the 9th. This is strange because, normally one sachet of movicol turns me incontinent. Before I had the enema, I had been given: two sachets of movicol, docisate sodium and two lots of suppositories in one day. Nothing worked)  Antidepressants, antipsychotics and painkillers not working now.  I'm on paracetamol, oramorth (morphine sulthate) dihydrocodeine, ibuprofen, buscopan, amatriptaline, peppermint oil, deloxatine, quatiapine, omeprazole, cefalexine (my profalactic antibiotic), cyclazine, ondansatron, zopiclone, my anti histomeine, movicol, scenna, docisate sodium and suppositories.  And no, the strong painkillers are not the reason of why I was so constipated. I was on them for the whole of the time I've been here and I've been here for over three months now; throughout that time, I've been incontinent several times. I've never stopped taking the strong painkillers!) When I could walk; at night I found myself struggling too (thought this was my quatiapine, but now I'm not so sure)  Struggling too talk because I forget what I'm saying, so can't complete sentences. Sometimes I don't even make sense, forget what I've said and repeat myself; and come out with random stuff sometimes.    Taking longer than usual too read stuff because of my eyesight issues.  Troubles concentrating. (will read something and then forget what I'm reading. The same for listening too stuff.  Saying stuff then a few hours later, forgetting what I said Also I can't stop swearing and I get angry at anything and everything I've had a urin infection for over three months and it's reaccuring and the last one was an e coli infection.  (when I could walk) At night, when it's dark; I try too stand up but quickly loose my balance and fall into things  I climbed a mountain in the lake district once and I struggled. Once at the top, my legs could no longer hold my body weight. This caused me too repeatedly fall over. My dad had too help me down and it was so hard that I kept falling, getting up was also very hard.  I've fainted several times and I got a black eye by fainting once.  I don't really remember this but, before being admitted; apparently it looked like I passed out, my eyes were rolling too. All I can remember is feeling very low and just out off it.  I'm having massive identity crisis, where I'm questioning who I am now and even my own identity. (voices in my head told me that if I just woke up one day, I could just push everything about me away and sayim someone else. I was convinced this would help me. I was going too deny my identity and change how I look and who I was, change everything about me)  A horrible sore throat (some people thought it was oral thrush as I have a white tongue)  Increasing pain and sickness (my pain is just unbearable right now and it's just getting worse every hour and every day; as that gets worse, so does my sickness)  Freaking out about stuff (so on my first night in AAU; I had these horrible nightmare dreams, where I was just floating (very complicated) then suddenly I had a reality shock of where I was, but when I woke up, it felt like I had just come back too life. Gasping as I woke up. I didn't even realise I had gone to sleep, so I screamed. It honestly felt like i had just been resuscitated back from the dead. This obviously scared me.  However then I thought I heard myself scream over and over again, like they were watching a recording off me. I thought the room had like an upper office with like a huge glass window, so that they could see us. I thought I heard them say ""the doctors gonna want to see this""  Then later ""why would you test on her, it's just her first night""  I then thought they had put something down my tube and done a test on me, too make me have the nightmare dream and have that reaction and feeling of being resuscitated back too life.  Then later on I thought I heard ""liar, liar, its all in your head""  The next evening/night, I thought they were having a secret meeting about me in the next room. My dad said no one was talking about me, but I could ""hear"" them. It's like I could hear it and my dad couldn't.  So I heard t Also I don't know if this is relivent or not but I have got this internal itching down below that is a mystery too my doctors  So I've got various different diagnosises and my symptoms are a mystery too my doctors. I have been diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, anorexia, BPD (supposedly) autism, a rare chromosome deletion called 2Q37.3 and ehlers danlos syndrome. However I think I have encephalitis and that is the cause off my mystery symptoms and illnesses. I also have an ng tube due too NY anorexia and have been sectioned since the 12th of July 2018. I haven't eaten anything solid since September 2017 and I lost my hunger very very quickly! I also haven't drank anything for over a year and a half now and my first disappeared quickly too! So my immune system has always been low and I catch infections really badly and they are always very hard too get rid off. Around the age of 17 I overdosed and was told that if I had taken just one more tablet, I would have died. I was told that I was in the CCU for a while but i don't remember anything other than be in in a strange ward with a cardiac machine. Quite freaky really! Growing up I remembered struggling too balance and walk, this caused bullying. Would say more but I can't. They have sent special blood tests to London but yeah..  Any ideas?"

However, a consultant at the Barberry centre has diagnosed him with functional movement disorder. He has attended support groups for this but when seeing other patients with FMD, he feels misdiagnosed and I agree with him. A lot of patients were in wheelchairs and had ME and other restricting conditions.  One day in 2009 whilst at work, my husband just dropped down and collapsed. He wakes straight up once he has hit the floor, but he cant always feel when a black out is coming on. His boss saw it happening and sent him off sick, unfortunately with no diagnoses for the blackouts or treatment , he is left unable to drive or work...11 years later we are still in the same boat.  His tics were bought on one night after he had vomited, he started having tics mainly in the neck, head and neck jerking. Sometimes in his leg. However, they've got more prominent and new tics have recently occurred in recent years, including whistling, clicking the tongue, slapping, tapping a pattern, head jerking, head shoots up to look at the ceiling and wont come down, sniffing, facial expressions, jigging the legs when stood up.... of course this shouts tourettes to me, as it probably does to you but the consultant (before retirement) was adamant it wasnt. I also researched epilepsy and found 'absent seizures' which is identically to what he experiences before, during and after a black out but the standard epilepsy test ruled it out. Due to his journey and lack of understanding, it has resulted in anxiety, which he is managing for the first time in years without medication as he didnt feel it made a difference. It's also worth noticing, we are unsure of hereditary issues as his dad was adopted and does not know anything of his biological background.

I am 13, but I know more about ADHD than most people twice my age. 13 is young, that does not mean I am immature. People on here post about newly diagnosed or they think they have ADHD. And to those people (and most other adhd people) a 13 year old telling them about it seems crazy. But age does not take away the fact that I have ADHD. It affects me the most too. Now skip through this because you have adhd.  I will talk about various things and I hope that you realize that I am 13. I will talk about a lot, and it revolves around the drugs and effects but also how adhd medicated or not really has an affect on people no matter the age. I hope I do not forget anything. I keep going back up here because I want to put the most important info closer to the beginning because I know this is one of the things that adhd people hate, reading crap thats first of all long and that is not required. I hope people will see this and want to read it and ask me questions. I really want to see parents asking, kids should not be asking. I will begin with outreach and how important it is to teach people and most importantly the people most affected by adhd including adhd children.  I would love to see a place where people with adhd can talk and where people with questions about it can ask. This is the closest one I can find. Barely anyone is active and it is a ghost town. Replies are never answered and sometimes people say that they ""procrastinate"" often and say that they sometimes go to sleep late. Then they say that they have adhd, BUT are not diagnosed. Come on now, you will understand what sleep problems are when the harder you try to sleep the longer you stay up. I some times stay up all night because either my mind is going crazy or the meds.  I am going to talk about the medications and also how adhd and the meds affect everything you do. There are three different categories of adhd CNS Stimulants (Central Nervous System) I will call them stims. First Amphetamine/Dextroamphetamine. Example: Adderall (XR). Second Dexmethylphenidate. Example Focalin (XR). Last Methylphenidate. Example: Ritalin (Concerta). XR mean extended release 6-12 hours depending on medication. Also Concerta is the name of the XR version of Ritalin. Even me seeing Amphetamine or Meth while talking about drugs is a red flag. Most parents see it as heroin and cocaine. This will come up later. I have been on Concerta for 4 or 5 years, before that Focalin. When I was around 10 I searched up what Concerta was and found out it was for adhd. At the time I did not think much of that, mostly because I knew that it meant I wouldn't concentrate as well. Now I know that it is a hole, a hole that many adhd people notice later in their ""treatment"".  What I mean by the quotes is that to most people treatment is working to cure. It is not. Right now it is only a word that gives hope.  What I will talk about right now will lead to the hole I just mentioned. I said that the names of the type stims are a red flag to anyone that has watched Breaking Bad or any crime show. Drug in my mind I think of weed or crack, things like that. That is what adults want us to know that whenever you hear the word drug you run.  These drugs have warning. People have abused and gotten addicted to these stims. But you dont know you are because you think that the things you feel when you are not taking them are just the side effects.  These drugs suck. Say bye to your sleeping pattern, appetite, and a lot of other things. You can say hi to headaches, feeling like you do not have feelings I also like to call it being a zombie or robot.  Going back to the hole I will call it. Doctors say that taking your meds as directed leave a very small window for drug abuse / addiction. So that is saying if I take the same amount of cocaine I have a small chance of addiction? Some people say it is impossible to get addicted to adhd meds. I do not believe that.  Also I have seen TED Talks or youtube videos where they say that adhd can be used as almost a super power and that we have an advantage because the drugs, or even that we can choose what we want to focus on. This makes people see that they do not want to do homework sometimes, or that they fall asleep sometimes then go and say they had adhd. It sucks when people say that.  From a study in 2017 only 20% of children outgrew adhd. Every-time I stop to look for a source I think to my self ""Who is going to read this stupid story by a 13 year old that is 10000000 words"" No one with adhd.  Next videos on youtube. I search adhd on youtube and I see a channel come up a lot. This woman has adhd and has had it for a while. But what I do not see is someone explaining the hell that can come along with adhd. I feel as if writing this no one will ever see this and it is a waste of time.  If you read this through congratz. Ask any questions."

I am a 42 year old male of relative decent shape. Throughout my life, I thought I was having anxiety attacks as early as 15 years old which seemed relatively minor, very few occurred, and I told no one until I was about age 31 or 32 when I stared to notice gaps in time. I would have the familiar feeling that I was about to faint. I sought out medical attention, but due to my employment situation and lack of insurance, I was unable to seek out proper care. These attacks seemed to reduce in frequency until I was around the age of 38. This time the attacks were more often and more intense. I lived alone for the majority of my life and wasn’t fully aware of what was occurring during these blackouts. My girlfriend witnessed a seizure and informed me of what happened. After keeping a journal, and a frequency chart, I have been unable to see a reoccurring pattern. The seizures occur about twice a month, but one could happen in one month, then I could have five the next. I was prescribed keppra first, and more seizures occurred. Then I was prescribed lamictal, again, more problems than help. The medical bills started to pile with the addition of two ER visit.   Ok. Do you think it would be a good decision to start self physical therapy and begin workouts which such seizures occurring? My concern is; Is increasing my core and muscular strength going to result it more physical trauma when the seizures occur? I can only compare it to being in a car wreck, a physical altercation, or taking a relatively brutal fall. Thank you for reading my long post."

I was on Ritalin as a child/adolescent and hated it, never took it regularly. I resisted any ADHD medication until my 30’s and have been on 90-120 mgs of Adderall Immediate release for the past 10 years. What I find is that the IR works but I want to take more than I’m supposed to and I have a love-hate relationship with it. I didn’t care for the XR at all. I’m tired of It controlling my life but the unfortunate side is I have to have some sort of ADD medication to function and hold a job.  My doctor has given me a 14 day trial of 70 mg of Vyvanse, which I’m finding to be much more pleasant as far as constantly thinking about taking more. However, It’s definitely not strong enough considering I have a huge tolerance after years of taking Stimulants.  Just wondering if anybody takes 100 mg of Vyvanse And if that’s even something that my doctor might possibly prescribe? Or, possibly takes 70 mg of by Vance with 30 mg of Adderall a day or something along those lines? I do not want to go back to the Adderall battle and really want to stick with the Vyvanse but obviously it’s got to work for me and the 70 mg just is not quite enough. I appreciate any feedback!"

And even while working in that office I suffered an early miscarriage - to be fair, I don't have a clue if mold had anything to do with that but I definitely do wonder because the doctor couldn't tell me what caused it.  I've been out of that environment since the middle of May 2017 but still experiencing symptoms (brain fog, memory loss, other cognitive issues, digestive problems, random dizziness, severe fatigue, passing out multiple times, etc.) and for the past several months I've had pretty strange menstrual irregularities, such as being late (like a week late) every month for several months, periods only lasting 2 days, bleeding between periods, etc. I'm not pregnant so that isn't the cause and just last week I was told that I have several ovarian cysts on both of my ovaries. Does anyone know if prolonged exposure to both of those molds could have caused these menstrual irregularities and the cysts? Aside from migraines with aura I get once a year, I was completely healthy before I worked in that office, never had issues with my reproductive system, memory, fatigue, nothing! And at most I got sick once or twice a year but while I was there I was sick like every 2 or 3 weeks!! Also, before working there I never had allergies before in my life but while I was in that office I developed horrible allergy issues. Thankfully those have pretty much gone away since leaving that office. Anyway, if anyone knows if prolonged toxic mold exposure can cause reproductive issues like I'm experiencing or knows a direction to point me in please let me know. Thank you!"

And even while working in that office I suffered an early miscarriage - to be fair, I don't have a clue if mold had anything to do with that but I definitely do wonder because the doctor couldn't tell me what caused it.  I've been out of that environment since the middle of May 2017 but still experiencing symptoms (brain fog, memory loss, other cognitive issues, digestive problems, random dizziness, severe fatigue, passing out multiple times, etc.) and for the past several months I've had pretty strange menstrual irregularities, such as being late (like a week late) every month for several months, periods only lasting 2 days, bleeding between periods, etc. I'm not pregnant so that isn't the cause and just last week I was told that I have several ovarian cysts on both of my ovaries. Does anyone know if prolonged exposure to both of those molds could have caused these menstrual irregularities and the cysts? Aside from migraines with aura I get once a year, I was completely healthy before I worked in that office, never had issues with my reproductive system, memory, fatigue, nothing! And at most I got sick once or twice a year but while I was there I was sick like every 2 or 3 weeks!! Also, before working there I never had allergies before in my life but while I was in that office I developed horrible allergy issues. Thankfully those have pretty much gone away since leaving that office. Anyway, if anyone knows if prolonged toxic mold exposure can cause reproductive issues like I'm experiencing or knows a direction to point me in please let me know. Thank you!"

Possibly Addison’s disease","Hi everyone! I am new here and have read every single thing that’s out there regarding Addison’s disease and I am hoping someone can help interpret my ACTH 60 min stimulation test. Everything I read doesn’t compare my abnormal result and can’t find much on my type of results... which may be abnormal??? The stress of waiting to find out if I have Addison’s is making me feel even worse. I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia about 2 years ago but am not convinced that is what’s wrong with me- and have every rare disorder and diagnosis possible- I see an endocrinologist because I have a small cyst on my pituitary. I also was diagnosed with PCOS from him and I have whacky hormone levels such as testosterone, prolactin and estrogen etc. I have very low blood pressure that gets even lower after I eat. I suffer every single day to get up off the couch or out of bed. I am always extremely fatigued- blamed on my fibromyalgia by my PCP. My blood pressure is symptomatic and is around 90/50 on a regular average lately. It’s usually more like 105/69 on average - which is still low. I have never been treated for my low BO and my PCP keeps telling me it’s fine- IT’S NOT FINE! On top of my fatigue, low blood pressure and overall feeling of being unwell for almost two years, I have many other symptoms. But what I would like to know is if these ACTH test results mean I have Addison’s or anything that could answer why I am so sick. I’ve had abdominal and lower back pain accompanied by Naseau, lightheaded and dizziness for months. Here are my ACTH test results: please can anyone interpret them... my cortisol levels do rise a little bit but didn’t reach the post stimulation standard of atleast 18..  cortisol baseline: 6.4 30 min: 11.7 60 min: 14.3 Prior to this I did a simple cortisol am blood test that was borderline and result was 5.2.. so that’s why we did the ACTH test. I also did an MRI of my pituitary (routine to follow its growth) and my endocrinologist said it was fine and that it didn’t cause any of my symptoms. He didn’t want to give me the ACTH but I demanded answers or more tests because I was so sickly feeling and I know somethings wrong with me. He told me he didn’t expect to have adrenal insufficiency but he ordered the test I think to *** me up! I think my results prove that I was right and he was wrong.. I may be wrong here but please someone tell me the answer to these results. I can’t find anyone that had a cortisol level under 18 after peak/post stimulation while at the same time they still doubled their level from base to end like mine. Thank you so much!"

I have no motivation... It's worse than ever. I normally tan and that helps me almost keep the urge to hibernate away but I stopped because it's so bad for me and this is the worst it's been n YEARS. And my husband actually thinks it's me choosing not to change. When try to read the major symptoms and how they relate to me he says those things are all him too but he chooses to change them which then make some feel like a complete loser because I cannot. How do I get people to understand that I've dealt with this my whole life. I only feel comfortable at work n home I don't want to be social I'm so Insecure I am tired of not being able to make a decision. It's exhausting.

I'm writing on behalf of my mother, who last September had to undergo an emergency operation involving the removal of a macroadenoma of the pituitary gland. While the operation was successful, it left her with a hemiparesis on the LEFT side. She was also in a coma for about two days after the intervention. The nasty bugger was apparently massive and had left to a hemmorhage which had done some major damage to the pituitary gland and reached the hypothalamus. The epicrisis mentioned about 90% of the tumor having been removed. Post-operation, we've done several MRI scans since then, showing no residual mass in the location with no new signs of a tumor reappearing. We're constantly doing rehabilitation, so she is now able to walk (with our support, still losing balance when in open spaces) and perform various exercises with her hand! :) (still can't preform daily activities - long road ahead there!)  For medication - she is prescribed Dehydrocortison (5mg tablets, 1 in the morning and 1/2 before bed) and Nootropil (1200mg, twice a day - contains Piracetam). For the first few months, she was also prescribed Citicoline, but has now stopped taking it. I'm not mentioning other minor minerals, vitamins and eating supplements, but can do if need be. However, there are a few things worrying us as far as her current state goes, so I'd like to tell you about them here in the hope of some suggestions and opinions, in case there is something we should be worrying about... 1) Vision: The RIGHT (not left!) side of her face remains somewhat numb, and her right eye can barely move in all four directions. Opening and closing of the eyelid is fine. She says she feels her ride side as if being ""extruded outwards"". This leads to a weird vision resulting in difficulty of spacial awareness, especially in open spaces outside - leading to a lack of perfect balance. One night I tested her trigeminal nerve sensitivity (temple, cheek and lower edge of the mouth) - all three locations had low sensation, lowest towards the mouth. Maybe some nerves are still constricted? She was prescribed some glasses in accordance to her state, but are there any additional things we can do? We've been told to ""wait"" and that things will slowly get better... 2) Eating is very difficult. She went from eating pureed foods to regular, firmer foods, but she can't really chew properly - cheek, lips and tongue on the RIGHT side are still mostly numb, so managing food with her tongue inside her mouth is tricky. She only eats on the left side, but food tends to drip sometimes and after a few bites her entire mouth goes stiff. We were recommended injections of botulinum toxin in specific parts of the right side, because she has a hyperactive muscle which apparently needs to be relaxed. We had an ""expert"" perform the manipulation three months ago - there were no improvements... Currently, we are looking to contact another specialist in Slovenia for a second attempt, this time with different injection locations. Apart from botox, is there anything else that might relax her face and allow for easier eating? Medication suggestions are welcome, or even special types of exercises. 3) Walking has progressed a lot, but she still has a major issue when it comes to gait and stance due to her left ankle twisting. Very often, the ankle goes stiff and slowly twists inwards, not allowing her to step with her entire foot on the ground. We were told her gastrocnemius muscle is hyperactive and constrictions are leading to this unwanted twist of the ankle. Some days stepping is fine, others it's a nightmare and her entire gait/walking is outright wrong. We noticed that shock occasions, such as a car passing by close or having to cross a street immediately twist her ankle. We are performing electric stimulations, in addition to lots of massages, stretches and exercises. She is now squatting and has proper strength in the leg, but due to this ankle problem walking is very difficult... Are there any other methods we might apply to improve this? Apart from the gastrocnemius muscle bit, it seems her brain is still heavily susceptible to stress and the commands she is getting are forcing this constriction... Lastly, I should mention that multiple blood tests in recent months showed increased levels of calcium and B12 in her bloodstream. We have an upcoming SPECT scan of here parathyroid glands in a few days, to see if a tumor might be causing this. We were told she should drink lots of water...  So, that's that. Sorry for the wall of text! I can provide additional information if needed, like more detailed breakdown of medication regimes, MRI scan reports and so on. Any suggestions are welcome - mainly for the mouth, as eating difficulties are currently the main factor for depression and whatnot... Thanks in advance! :)"

It first started in 2016 when I got a headache that felt like it was cracking my head open, just after the headache started I battled to look at any lights. This got increasingly worse and I started getting a fever. I was exhausted and could not stay awake. About 3 hours later I went to the doctor. They admitted me into hospital straight away suspecting meningitis. I was put on meds and given a cortisone injection. The symptoms were better but the headache did not go away for a couple of days. The doctors did a Lumbar Puncture and the results showed a high white blood cell count but it was just below what was required for meningitis. After 2 weeks I was pretty much back to normal and didn't think about it again. In 2017 I then started getting tonsilitis once a month for about a year and eventually they removed my tonsils. (I'm not sure if this in anyway related). After the tonsil removal I have felt constantly tired and this has not stopped. In September 2018 I got a severe headache again as well as a sensitivity to light (The sensitivity was not as severe this time but the headache was just as bad). The headache stayed for 3 days and then I started getting fever sweats and chills alternatively. I went to the doctor and tick bite fever was suspected, I was put on antibiotics and seemed to be a bit better but still had fatigue. A couple of days later my pinky and ring finger on my right hand started tingling and this worsened so I went back to the doctor and they said I had tennis elbow so put me on anti-inflammatories. A week or so later the tinglign worsened and moved to both my hands (all fingers) and my feet (all toes). I also started shaking severly throughout my entire body. A couple of days later, one side of my face went numb and I could not raise my one eyebrow or move my mouth on that side. The face paralysis only lasted 3 days. I also had very stiff muscles. I went to the doctor and they referred me to the physio. The physio refused treatment and sent me to the neurologist. The neurologist did a full blood count, lumbar puncture, MRI, a nerve conduction stud and an EEG. The only results outside of normal ranges were the inflammation markers in the blood tests, the white blood cell count was only slightly above normal and the nerve conduction study picked up an irregularity between my elbow and hand on my right hand. The neurologists suspects Multiple Sclerosis and is going to retest in a years time. In December 2018 I then went to a homeopath who put me on a high dosage of magnesium as well as a variety of other vitamins. This subtantially helped all the symptons. The numbness and shaking is almost completely gone now and only comes back very occassionally. I have not been taking any tablets for a couple of months now and feel ok. The only thing that I still battle with is the muscle stiffness and the fatigue. I have also noticed a significant increase in visability of my veins since December 2018 and this is worsening over time (not sure if this is relevant).

It first started in 2016 when I got a headache that felt like it was cracking my head open, just after the headache started I battled to look at any lights. This got increasingly worse and I started getting a fever. I was exhausted and could not stay awake. About 3 hours later I went to the doctor. They admitted me into hospital straight away suspecting meningitis. I was put on meds and given a cortisone injection. The symptoms were better but the headache did not go away for a couple of days. The doctors did a Lumbar Puncture and the results showed a high white blood cell count but it was just below what was required for meningitis. After 2 weeks I was pretty much back to normal and didn't think about it again. In 2017 I then started getting tonsilitis once a month for about a year and eventually they removed my tonsils. (I'm not sure if this in anyway related). After the tonsil removal I have felt constantly tired and this has not stopped. In September 2018 I got a severe headache again as well as a sensitivity to light (The sensitivity was not as severe this time but the headache was just as bad). The headache stayed for 3 days and then I started getting fever sweats and chills alternatively. I went to the doctor and tick bite fever was suspected, I was put on antibiotics and seemed to be a bit better but still had fatigue. A couple of days later my pinky and ring finger on my right hand started tingling and this worsened so I went back to the doctor and they said I had tennis elbow so put me on anti-inflammatories. A week or so later the tinglign worsened and moved to both my hands (all fingers) and my feet (all toes). I also started shaking severly throughout my entire body. A couple of days later, one side of my face went numb and I could not raise my one eyebrow or move my mouth on that side. The face paralysis only lasted 3 days. I also had very stiff muscles. I went to the doctor and they referred me to the physio. The physio refused treatment and sent me to the neurologist. The neurologist did a full blood count, lumbar puncture, MRI, a nerve conduction stud and an EEG. The only results outside of normal ranges were the inflammation markers in the blood tests, the white blood cell count was only slightly above normal and the nerve conduction study picked up an irregularity between my elbow and hand on my right hand. The neurologists suspects Multiple Sclerosis and is going to retest in a years time. In December 2018 I then went to a homeopath who put me on a high dosage of magnesium as well as a variety of other vitamins. This subtantially helped all the symptons. The numbness and shaking is almost completely gone now and only comes back very occassionally. I have not been taking any tablets for a couple of months now and feel ok.

I teach this boy. He has decided to speak out about what it is like living with ADHD and extreme anxiety. Please should you wish to share so together we can break down stereotypes and misconceptions. (Link at the bottom).   This is because he wants to show people in particular the so called educators what life behind the label and judgement is REALLY like. However, most importantly  ""if I can help anyone relate, or stop them ending up like me then I want them to know they are not alone. Somewhere out there are a lot of people like me but are too scared to open up. So I want to help them begin this process"". (His words).     ""A face of no emotion. But you see a Painted Clown"". I am emptiness. I am distant. Everyone appears blurred, I’m not ignoring you some days I can’t get out of my own head I just need time. I know there are people that love but you can’t see that. You’re alone. You see me laugh make or hear me comment everyone laughs everyone can make a comment but that’s a mask you think you see me but that's my painted face. That face you say is a painted clown. Many say I waffle, I can’t get to the point. Those who are brave enough to see the real me say this too but they look back now my words bring them clarity.   Didn’t you get any sleep? It feels like this, but only feels like not physically. When there's sleep there is knowledge. when you are awake you are aware of certain things. When I am awake I feel oppressed constrained into a box by my own mind and by educations stereotyped ADHD box. As day passes, more knocks, more scowls more judgement. How I feel I can’t trust; the more awake the stronger it feels.  I’m dissociated. I am paused. I am inattentive ADHD. Every second going down a road lost in a lost thought. We all do this I just do it more than you. I don’t realise when I go. I rarely know how I get here I don’t recognise where I go.  I am distanced. I am white noise. ‘Simple things are not so simple’ so when you ask me take out my why are you wearing that pass me this pull out your work. Multiple demands = multiple speeds.”In a minute”. Then I’m ordered do it now then it often ends up in a fight. To just stop what I’m literally doing or what I’m thinking to do something else is extremely stressful no matter how “petty” it may sound.  I am fight. I am anger. I am switched. When I am angry I feel numb, I don’t feel. Yet, breathing makes my lungs hurt, my head pulses, my heart hurts. My ears scream. So how can I not feel as I punch, as I outburst as I grab something sharp pierce a pillow pierce my skin. My red mist pierces with words. But mainly I’m not angry at you. You just caught me at the wrong time. My outbursts are because my mind is flooded. Anger gives me adrenaline. The adrenaline alights. This is my fuel.   A lot of people think they see me but they are blind. So they make more demands, find another volume switch. When I lose it they are just words its not personal. Punishment at this point adds petrol to my fuel so I just fight back harder they harder you cry the harder I fight.  Fight or flight. Fight an instinct we all have but my fight is my attempt to flight. In school I cant literally fight so I have to flight. I need to leave, find a new room but I’m trapped. Rapidly pushed into that oppressive box. Please I need to flight this train track takes an automatic turn. Please I’m afraid now my mind is in fight. Flight for survival. Flight from fear.  My conscious streams; everyone is different in their conscious mind everyone is specified to their own my but made to conform to others but they should be allowed to appear as their own unique mind would it be weird to be just real My stream of consciousness.  Ends. ""Judgements, Stereotyped limited views on ADHD and anxiety stop you from opening up. Staying shut being what others want leads to anxiety. Anxiety leads to depression. Depression leads to suicide.  I know. I am you.  Talk to your parents now before its too late"".   ;id=1579897625"

I’m wondering if anyone else has been prescribed 54 mg of Concerta X 2 per day. I realize this is a high dose but I’m told I metabolize medications very quickly (this goes for all my meds not just the ADHA prescriptions). I’ve been on ADHD meds for over 4 years and have generally been very happy with its effects on my scatterbrained and distracted self, lol. I take my first 54 mg at 6am and the second 54 mg at 2pm. I get between 5-6 hours of sleep daily which is twice as much as I was getting for most of my adult life. Prior to the ADHD diagnosis, my life was plagued by feelings of worry and stress over my poor performance in the adulting arena which led to insomnia, overeating, depression and anxiety. To be honest I’ve been an insomniac since childhood, I’ve never been able to lay down and fall asleep without tossing and turning for at least an hour while worrying about the state of the world. Oh to have been diagnosed with ADHD as a child, I may have actually enjoyed school and completed a degree. I was always told I was just dumb and lazy.  I won’t dump all my questions at once but would be interested in knowing why taking 2 x 27 mg rather than 1 x 54 mg appears to be more effective. I ran out of the 54 mg and wanted to use up the extras I had before refilling my Rx. Could I be imagining this difference? My pharmacist shrugged his shoulders and told me there is no difference so rather than ignore my gut, I’m reaching out to those who actually take this med for their insight.  Thank you, Fisher"

For the last several years I have had leg weakness, which has increased recently. My legs feel like they will not hold me up on occasions and they feel very week sometimes. I get a similar feeling in my right arm, and I am right handed. My right hand feels tingly and seems to go numb, and the EMG came out normal for my hand too. I have been getting increased random pain in my legs arms an feet. I have recently got TMJ and restless legs. I am taking Gabapenten for the restless legs. In the past several years my hands have turned blue on numerous occasions. I get cramps in my calves and feet often. I had an MRI for my brain and lower back and they came back normal. I have had X-rays that say nothing is pinched. There are times when I have extreme exhaustion.

Neuropathy is considered an disorder that can affect the cranial, peripheral or the autonomic. Cranial nerves are attached to the back of the head, that can stem to the neck. - Symptoms headaches, light irritation, dizziness and other problems dealing with the brain. Peripheral nerves are attached to the brain and the spinal cord - Symptoms numbness, stiffness, muscles spasm, migraine headaches and other problems dealing with the brain and the spinal cord. Autonomic nerves are attached to the bladder, stomach and other internal organs. - Symptoms urinary tract infection, acid reflux, bloating, and gastrointestinal complications. As a naturopathic student who graduated with high degrees, I value the body and mind remedies personally. Those of you who are experiences pain, cayenne spice is good, it is considered a natural pain killer; next to prescriptive opioid. Mix together or buy organic power juice, that consist of green vegetables(broccoli, kale/mustard/celery) sprinkle one half teaspoon of cayenne spice, and one half teaspoon of sage spice. What this power juice does, is to stimulate your endorphins(brain cells) and to assist in relaxing nerves that is causing pain and anxiety.

Cannabis is a universal medicine that can treat a wide range of symptoms and now it has been reported that ALS patients are finding more success using this medicine. It has given control back to patients that once were dependent on caregivers. Speaking from personal experience my uncle has been diagnosed with ALS and we have been treating him with full extract cannabis oil that comes inn a syringe. The quality of the medicine has been outstanding and once again we have control in our hands so we measure exactly how much he is ingesting. I share this in the hopes to reach someone who is currently researching the medical benefits of cannabis oil."

Read this.","I felt compelled to write this a year and a half after first experiencing neurological issues because #1, it seems that a lot of folks who have similar undiagnosed conditions simply ""disappear"" online (hopefully that means they've gotten better), and #2, I am still alive after a year and a half, so my goal is to give hope to anyone who is experiencing similar symptoms and have not had any luck with a diagnosis.  First things first. If you have not seen any neurologists, stop reading now and don't do any more research until that appointment. Otherwise, you will go through torturous anxiety and sleepless nights as you try to self-diagnose and likely settle on the worst-case scenario. My post is for those who have had all of the tests done and seen multiple doctors and still have no diagnosis.  My two biggest, longest lasting symptoms were (and occasionally still are) numbness and muscle twitching. It started off as numbness in my left toe, slowly progressing to my left foot, left leg, left arm, left side of the face and even the entire head at times (rarely all at once though). I started getting it in the right side of my body occasionally, but there it typically stayed in my right fingertips. The twitching also appeared in various parts of the body, but really chose to settle in my right arm between my triceps and elbow. It twitched nearly nonstop, 24/7 for 4-5 months straight. While these were the longest lasting symptoms, I encountered a TON of other symptoms. While concerning, these didn’t last months like the numbness and twitching. I will include that list below my signature.  During about a year’s time, I had 2 MRIs on my brain and neck, two different EMGs on both sides of the body, strength tests, probably a dozen or so various blood tests, and an EKG. Everything came back clean. I saw 2 different neurologists and 2 different general doctors. None of them could piece anything together. One of my neurologists wouldn't even look at my twitching arm. “If you can do a push up, sit up, and squat, you don't have ALS,” he assured me. So while every doctor failed to come up with what was going on, none of them seemed overly concerned. In a way, it is a relief to know your doctors aren’t concerned. On the other hand, if they don’t know what it is, then how do they know it’s not fatal?! Before I move on to what finally “cured” me, I need to pause and say… trust your doctors, esp. if they are all saying the same thing. Spending a few hours or even a few days researching WebMD, message boards, etc., does not put us on the same standing as neurologists who have spent YEARS studying these conditions. You have to trust them and have a little faith, esp. if they are saying you are OK. I also know that none of what I’m saying is truly going to convince you that you might not have a terrible disease - I wasn't able to be convinced at first either. They only thing you can truly do is wait it out.  OK, the good stuff. By a fluke chance, I shared my issues and concerns with a co-worker, who suggested that I see a particular doctor in Houston who has a knack for diagnosing things that other doctors can’t. I didn’t get my hopes up but decided to go see him anyway. He took a look at all of my test results over the past year, sent me for a couple more random blood tests, which came back clean, and then told me that he has seen what I have before. It doesn’t even have a name yet! It is a virus and has a transient nature, which explains why the symptoms manifest in different ways and in different places. Furthermore, it is going to take a couple of more years to fully get it out of my system. Annoying? Yes! But at least he gave me hope, which is something I couldn’t get anywhere else. He told me that it’s hard to do, but if I could find a way to laugh with the twitching, to do so (I know, that is impossible), because while with some diseases, twitching is a bad thing, in this case, it is a good thing and is my body’s way of rewiring itself so to speak. So, I’m still not filling confident at this point, but he said he wants to start me on prescription grade magnesium (Mag Oxide, 400 mg), and that if that doesn’t help with the twitching, that he had a less conventional idea. Well, to my surprise, one or two days after taking the magnesium, the twitching stopped almost completely! Mind you, none of my previous tests showed any sort of magnesium deficiency. As a side note, I will still get random twitches every now and then, but they are usually short-lived and nothing more than just a few seconds. But the nonstop twitching has been gone for probably 8 months or so. (I still wonder what his other idea would have been if the magnesium wouldn’t have worked!) So anyway, if you are in the same boat as I am/was, not finding any results and all of your tests coming back clean, ask your doctor if he can try you on a high dosage of magnesium. You certainly don’t have anything to lose.  I want to end this with some self-reflection that has come out of this ordeal with me. This was an extremely scary season for me and forced me to ask some tough questions about life and what really matters. What I learned was whether I have a neurological disease now or not, the fact remains that at some point, I AM going to die. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter if that happens while I am young, middle-aged, or old... the same fate awaits us all. Depressing, yes, but true nonetheless. If you are battling an unknown condition and have extreme anxiety and fear, my advice is to take this time and current health scare to settle the score now. Are you religious? Find out what you truly believe and hopefully this strengthens your faith in the end. Religious or not, try to find beauty in the day to day and focus each day on what truly matters. If and when you come out of this ordeal, be it a year or longer, come back and share your story with others to give them hope. And please don't forget those who truly are suffering with serious diseases such as ALS. Pray for them, encourage them, donate to ALS research, volunteer your time, etc. All the vows you made and said you'd do if only you didn't have the fatal disease? Do them. With whatever time you have left, love God and love others and leave the world a better place. Good luck! DC Other symptoms besides numbness and muscle twitching: Long lasting: High blood pressure; rash in left armpit that lasted months but eventually went away; Left leg tingly, almost like an internal vibration; Psychological issues (Anxiety, Stress, Detached feeling, Overwhelmed, Fear)   Shorter lived: Sensation of lump in my throat, slow swallowing, sometimes with a dull pain that came and went; Muscle and joint pain (shoulders, calves, right arm, muscle near thumb on right hand, finger joints); Waking up with right little and ring fingers completely numb; Electric jolt-like feeling in right side of neck; Loss of appetite and weight loss; Insomnia; Fatigue; Palpitations; Light headed; Stammering for words; Neck pain; Chest pains"

So anyway, if you are in the same boat as I am/was, not finding any results and all of your tests coming back clean, ask your doctor if he can try you on a high dosage of magnesium. You certainly don’t have anything to lose.  I want to end this with some self-reflection that has come out of this ordeal with me. This was an extremely scary season for me and forced me to ask some tough questions about life and what really matters.

If you are battling an unknown condition and have extreme anxiety and fear, my advice is to take this time and current health scare to settle the score now. Are you religious? Find out what you truly believe and hopefully this strengthens your faith in the end. Religious or not, try to find beauty in the day to day and focus each day on what truly matters. If and when you come out of this ordeal, be it a year or longer, come back and share your story with others to give them hope. And please don't forget those who truly are suffering with serious diseases such as ALS. Pray for them, encourage them, donate to ALS research, volunteer your time, etc. All the vows you made and said you'd do if only you didn't have the fatal disease? Do them. With whatever time you have left, love God and love others and leave the world a better place. Good luck!

Read this.","I felt compelled to write this a year and a half after first experiencing neurological issues because #1, it seems that a lot of folks who have similar undiagnosed conditions simply ""disappear"" online (hopefully that means they've gotten better), and #2, I am still alive after a year and a half, so my goal is to give hope to anyone who is experiencing similar symptoms and have not had any luck with a diagnosis.  First things first. If you have not seen any neurologists, stop reading now and don't do any more research until that appointment. Otherwise, you will go through torturous anxiety and sleepless nights as you try to self-diagnose and likely settle on the worst-case scenario. My post is for those who have had all of the tests done and seen multiple doctors and still have no diagnosis.  My two biggest, longest lasting symptoms were (and occasionally still are) numbness and muscle twitching. It started off as numbness in my left toe, slowly progressing to my left foot, left leg, left arm, left side of the face and even the entire head at times (rarely all at once though). I started getting it in the right side of my body occasionally, but there it typically stayed in my right fingertips. The twitching also appeared in various parts of the body, but really chose to settle in my right arm between my triceps and elbow. It twitched nearly nonstop, 24/7 for 4-5 months straight. While these were the longest lasting symptoms, I encountered a TON of other symptoms. While concerning, these didn’t last months like the numbness and twitching. I will include that list below my signature.  During about a year’s time, I had 2 MRIs on my brain and neck, two different EMGs on both sides of the body, strength tests, probably a dozen or so various blood tests, and an EKG. Everything came back clean. I saw 2 different neurologists and 2 different general doctors. None of them could piece anything together. One of my neurologists wouldn't even look at my twitching arm. “If you can do a push up, sit up, and squat, you don't have ALS,” he assured me. So while every doctor failed to come up with what was going on, none of them seemed overly concerned. In a way, it is a relief to know your doctors aren’t concerned. On the other hand, if they don’t know what it is, then how do they know it’s not fatal?! Before I move on to what finally “cured” me, I need to pause and say… trust your doctors, esp. if they are all saying the same thing. Spending a few hours or even a few days researching WebMD, message boards, etc., does not put us on the same standing as neurologists who have spent YEARS studying these conditions. You have to trust them and have a little faith, esp. if they are saying you are OK. I also know that none of what I’m saying is truly going to convince you that you might not have a terrible disease - I wasn't able to be convinced at first either. They only thing you can truly do is wait it out.  OK, the good stuff. By a fluke chance, I shared my issues and concerns with a co-worker, who suggested that I see a particular doctor in Houston who has a knack for diagnosing things that other doctors can’t. I didn’t get my hopes up but decided to go see him anyway. He took a look at all of my test results over the past year, sent me for a couple more random blood tests, which came back clean, and then told me that he has seen what I have before. It doesn’t even have a name yet! It is a virus and has a transient nature, which explains why the symptoms manifest in different ways and in different places. Furthermore, it is going to take a couple of more years to fully get it out of my system. Annoying? Yes! But at least he gave me hope, which is something I couldn’t get anywhere else. He told me that it’s hard to do, but if I could find a way to laugh with the twitching, to do so (I know, that is impossible), because while with some diseases, twitching is a bad thing, in this case, it is a good thing and is my body’s way of rewiring itself so to speak. So, I’m still not filling confident at this point, but he said he wants to start me on prescription grade magnesium (Mag Oxide, 400 mg), and that if that doesn’t help with the twitching, that he had a less conventional idea. Well, to my surprise, one or two days after taking the magnesium, the twitching stopped almost completely! Mind you, none of my previous tests showed any sort of magnesium deficiency. As a side note, I will still get random twitches every now and then, but they are usually short-lived and nothing more than just a few seconds.

BEFORE SHARING A RECOMMENDATION FOR THIS, LET ME SHARE WITH YOU AS TRUE STORY. About a month ago, my adopted son's wife who has ADHD, jump out of a moving car. Thank God the car was not going that fast, or she would had did some serious harm to herself. ADHD is not a joke, some people don't realize the seriousness of the illness, and it's effect on family. Attention deficit disorder, is a neurological dysfunction, so let's see if we can put something together to calm/sedate the brain cells. GREEN TEA - with these supplements - gingko biloba, valerian roots, Siberian Ginseng, one tablespoon of sage. In the evening Chamomile Tea with the same supplements. Make two pitchers - one in the morning with blended supplements and one in the evening with the same - Chamomile. What I prescribed are food nourishment and a sedative for the brain. What it does is, control/restrain impulsive nerve cells; that can become hyperactive. If it works you guys, let us know. God Bless Sha Naturopathic specialist"

I woke up still shaking a bit with my jaw clenched tight but had no idea where I was for about 10 seconds. I was stressed out and my blood pressure dropped to 40/80. My friend in the room told me it looked like a seizure. I didn’t think much of it until last night when I was playing games with friends and drinking. My eyesight blurred for a bit, I later get up and walk to the kitchen to grab another beer. I experience a huge head rush and I start blacking out. I drop the game controller out of my hand and start slowly falling to the ground, my arms and jaw convulsing. I hit my head softly on the counter and snap out of it.

I've always had migraines growing up but now that I'm 27 I don't get them as often as I did in my earlier years as a child and teen. I start to sweat really hard to the point it looks like I've just got done running. I get the feeling of defecation either throwing up or from rear end. My body goes limp so I either fall or try and sit down but I always end up crashing really hard. I can't keep my head up so I'm always just laid out on the floor. I soon fall into a wierd state of unconsciousness either I blank out and I'm in a day dream or I'm wide awake but it's like I'm standing over myself looking at me with my eyes wide open. In both states I'm not able to move at all except my eyes when I'm aware. When I come to I never know how long I was out of it. I end up throwing up or crapping( I always go in a bathroom when I know episodes gonna happen). And it takes about 30 mins to regain myself or to feel normal. Can someone please help me!!

I decided to post this to see if anyone has any experience with this odd medical situation I’ve been having for the last week.  Before I go into further detail I just want to preface by saying that I do have a doctors appointment set up next week because I know most of the responses below are probably going to consist of recommendations to make a doctors appointment to get a proper diagnosis, which is completely understandable.  So about a couple weekends ago a buddy of mine gave me a homemade cannabis edible. It was just a gross tasting little glob about the size of a tic tac. I’m not really into taking any sort of illegal drugs but didn’t see any harm in taking it at the time. Where I believe I may have gone wrong, or at least amplified the problem, was the fact that I had already had a few drinks that night. Anyway, to make a long story short, after about an hour or so of feeling some slight euphoria, things started to take a turn for the worse. I started feeling very weak and my motor movements seemed to really be affected. My movements all seemed to be very ridged and not smooth. I also started noticing that my muscles were shaking when I would engage them. For example, touching my thumb to my index finger would cause those fingers to shake noticeably. When laying down in bed and relaxing my muscles, they wouldn’t shake but after laying down for a minute I noticed my whole body start to have this rhythmic rocking to it. Like someone sitting in a rocking chair, just to a much lesser extent. I really just felt awful and I wish I had never taken that thing and couldn’t wait for it to all be over.  Anyway, fast forward to the next day and thankfully I don’t feel like death anymore but I notice that I still have these symptoms, just to a lesser degree. I still felt weak and just not quite like myself. I can still feel my muscles vibrate and shake when doing certain actions. I figured I probably need more time in order to recover from whatever it is that’s causing these symptoms.  Fast forward another couple weeks to today, and I still don’t feel back to normal. I still feel slightly week. And the muscle shaking, although much better than that night, is still there. When I touch my thumb to my index finger at certain times and positions, I can get them to still lightly shake. If I lift my leg up, it’s a smooth motion, when I lower it back down I can feel my core shake slightly. Same goes for lifting my arm and lowering my arm as well. I have noticed that drinking caffeine (which I have always done) does amplify the effects I just described. I have also noticed that adrenaline does amplify the effects as well, such as being in a confrontation.  I am a very active person. I weight train along with run 4-5 days a week. I’ve also noticed the more noticeable shaking while l weight train, and after a hard workout or a long run when I normally feel weak, the symptoms are worse then too. I’m racking my brain to try to think of things I might be doing currently that could either be contributing to this or possibly preventing me from fully recovering. Am I running too much? Am I not eating enough calories? Am I stressing too much? Should I change my diet? Should I stop my medication? (Zoloft). Am I vitamin deficient? I have no idea, especially since this all seemed to just appear out of nowhere after that incident I described. As I mentioned above, I have seen a number of posts from people that describe similar things to what I’m describing without really seeing what their outcome is. I remember back maybe 12 years ago, I had similar symptoms that seemed to come out of nowhere. I went to the doctors. They did blood tests. Numerological tests, ect. All came back normal and the doctors pretty much shrugged their shoulders and had no idea. And I believe the symptoms just completely disappeared maybe a few weeks later and have felt completely normal.  I appreciate the time to read over my post and if anyone has any sort of suggestions or questions about what might be going on if anyone has had similar symptoms and what they’ve done about it. I’m going to see my doctor this Saturday and I can provide an update once I do but I’m thinking it’s just going to be another waste of time and shoulder shrugging.  Thanks!!"

I am not bipolar! I've read a lot about bipolar and I have some symptoms, but mine present differently. I don't have mania and my lows are not that low. I just know I am not bipolar, and these psychiatrists keep insisting that I am. The last one I saw, which was a few days ago, listened to me talk for less than 5 minutes and said, oh yeah, you're bipolar, then proceeded to charge me 300.00 for the visit. I said no, I am adhd. He said he agreed, but we would deal with that way down the road. How??? For that kind of money, I should've spent the day there with electrodes hooked up to me, trying to figure out what's wrong with my brain. How can you tell what's wrong with anyone after talking to them for five minutes? When I was a child, I stepped in a smoldering fire, not realizing that it was still burning underneath. I had 3rd degree burns on my feet, but I was holding my hands, so my Mom thought it was my hands that were burned, so she was holding my hands under the water. That's what I feel like is going one with damned doctors. They are treating a part of my brain that's not on fire. It's the same story every time! I keep going to these psychiatrists with high hopes that someone is going to help me, but they don't. They just put me on these ridiculous meds that do nothing for me. The only med that has ever helped me, was Vyvanse, but the person I was seeing, took me off of it. I am so fed up with psychiatrists. I have been going to them my entire life, and they have never helped me. I am still just as screwed up as I have every been. This last guy actually told me that I might have a personality disorder, in which case there was nothing he could do for me. This is after talking to me for 5 minutes. I had another psychiatrist tell me there was nothing they could do for me, and that my condition is untreatable. My last great experience was with a woman who would get angry with me for questioning her diagnosis, then she kept me waiting for almost two hours for my last appointment. I had to pick up my four year old son, and had to leave. I had just paid a 50.00 co pay and asked for it back because I couldn't stay. The psychiatrist came out of her office and said, ""I am not on his schedule, tell him not to come back here."" She said this in front of her staff and the entire waiting room. This was after 3 years of going to this... person. This wasn't urgent care, this was a doctor who deals with people with mental issues, and she chooses to embarrass me because I couldn't wait 3 hours for my appointment. I am not someone who uses my issues as an excuse. I work really hard in spite of them. I have learned, by myself, some amazing coping techniques, but they aren't working like they used to. I am a successful college professor, and I have to be incredibly organized and on top of things. I'm having a more difficult time hiding my issues from the people I work with. I really just want to find someone who will spend some time with me, and help me."

I was recently diagnosed with Epilepsy and was curious, when you experience a trigger or something you thought could be, would you experience the seizure right then and there? Or would it lay dormant for however long until it just comes up? I have experienced all of my seizures when I'm asleep. My doctor says I've experienced triggers sometime in the day and they all lay in my head until they come out and that's when I get my seizures. To me this seems all a bit hard to believe as I've read that people experience seizures from triggers right away or a couple minutes after. Thank you."

Initially, the only way I knew how to categorise the weirdness is ""epileptic"" but... I've been looking into seizure types and I don't quite fit the definitions. I am not currently diagnosed with anything more than asthma. When I was born, I was premature and had jaundice. No other complications known. I show symptoms of a dissociative disorder, AD(H)D and/or autism, and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/ME). I have undocumented CPTSD and only have panic responses (no OCD or habits gained). I am underweight. Here's what weirdness I get: - Random 'neck bounces': I'll just start bouncing my neck up and down (like those videos of birds bouncing to dace to music), quite rapidly but only small movements. It rarely disrupts my ability to think and I'm always conscious. Usually only when I'm seated, but does happen when I'm stood up too. Never when I'm laying down - Limb bouncing: usually my arms, with the ""bounce"" originating at my wrists, or my legs with the bounce originating at my knees/thighs/hips. This sensation feels like my brain says to my body ""need to stretch legs"", but my body bounces instead of just stretching. I'm able to ""interrupt"" it, but I usually still have the ""need"" to stretch. Usually happens while sat down, sometimes while laying, rarely while standing. - 'Body lockup': my whole entire body just stops. I feel my eyes go vacant. Sometimes my head will drop forwards a little (only by an inch or so) and will sometimes also either tilt to the left, OR my face will drop so I'm facing left. I can still move my eyes, and when my head drops, I will continue looking at the ""normal"" eyeline, meaning I end up looking annoyed as sometimes my brow furrows slightly. My arms relax. My hands ""reset to a default position"", sometimes they feel like I have rigid gloves on, making them unable to move until I recover. Sometimes my wrists will curl in, towards my torso. I cannot move much until I forcefully regain control by remaining calm and thinking about moving. It presents like a complex partial seizure but I am completely fully aware. It feels like I'm trapped in my own body. Often afterwards I am tried or grouchy. Sometimes I get fuzzy on what happened about 5-10 minutes after the episode. Rarely, it feels like what happened before the episode was ""a day ago"", that everything that happened after is ""today"", and I forget almost everything that I was previously aware of. I think this has only happened when I've been seated. I can sometimes feel it coming on, especially if I'm stood up, but I don't really recognise it until after. When it ""comes on"" while I'm standing, I can brute-force my way out of having an episode by just maintaining action (eg: thinking about moving, the same strategy I use to break out of it). If I'm walking and its particularly bad, I will come to a stop, but this is actually jarring enough for my brain to ""snap out of it"". - Arms randomly curling up. I hate to be that person, but you know how some people with disorders like cerebral palsy have their arms contorted weirdly, often curled up on their chest? Sometimes I do that. I just bring my arms up and in, and my hands do the sort of hand position you make when giving someone a piece of paper (thumb angled in slightly, fingers curled around it and the base of it...) while touching the backs of my hands together.

Initially, the only way I knew how to categorise the weirdness is ""epileptic"" but... I've been looking into seizure types and I don't quite fit the definitions.

I am underweight.

Never when I'm laying down - Limb bouncing: usually my arms, with the ""bounce"" originating at my wrists, or my legs with the bounce originating at my knees/thighs/hips. This sensation feels like my brain says to my body ""need to stretch legs"", but my body bounces instead of just stretching. I'm able to ""interrupt"" it, but I usually still have the ""need"" to stretch. Usually happens while sat down, sometimes while laying, rarely while standing. - 'Body lockup': my whole entire body just stops. I feel my eyes go vacant. Sometimes my head will drop forwards a little (only by an inch or so) and will sometimes also either tilt to the left, OR my face will drop so I'm facing left. I can still move my eyes, and when my head drops, I will continue looking at the ""normal"" eyeline, meaning I end up looking annoyed as sometimes my brow furrows slightly. My arms relax.

It’s horrible. I had kidney problems, muscle cramping, tremors, seizures, decrease in ability to focus, altered mental status. I was on Cymbalta(at Double the normal dose) ,Wellbutrin, and Adderall. It began shortly after Wellbutrin started and it took 4 months for any doctor to figure it out. Actually THEY didn’t. I did ! They hospitalized me for kidney infection, fever, and rhablomylosis with Extrapyramidal side effects. Had to give me over 11 mg Ativan in less than 24 hours. But it didn’t help. They also loaded with with so much fluid that I gained 20 lbs in those 4 days. No joke. I stopped the Cymbalta after my like 10th seizure (they kept saying I was on drugs and alcohol, which I wasn’t) Symptoms went away and haven’t returned in last 2 months.

First of all, I'm glad that Mexican scam surgeon didn't have a chance at amputating your foot/feet! Amputating my feet as a solution to my problem has been a family joke for some time. However, I would never consider it seriously, though my pain must not be as bad as yours. As a matter of fact, it's usually mild to moderate. It's the constant motion of my toes that's driving me and my family crazy! My symptoms started in January or February of this year, but I didn't see a neurologist for it until May. I was put on Lyrica and Gabapentin for a month each without any improvement, so I was referred to Mayo Clinic in Rochester, where I have been seen by Dr. Anhar Hassan, who turned out the top specialist in the world, from what I have seen: she is the co-author of the largest-case study on PLMT: ""Painful Legs and Moving Toes Syndrome. A 76-Patient Case Series,"" published in August 2012 at ""Arch Neurol/vol. 69 (nr. 8).  Since my main complaint is toe movement, and I think that if that is stopped, the pain will go away, Dr. Hassan is starting me on Ropinirole (Requip) 1 mg a day, gradually increasing the dose. If, after 9 weeks of treatment, I haven't felt any improvement, she'll try another medication. This is a very rare condition indeed: Mayo Clinic had only seen 76 cases in 28 years (their study covered 1983 to 2011), and they see an average of 4 cases of PLMT per year. So we are basically guinea pigs, a rare breed. However, I am hopeful that they will find a successful treatment, if not to cure it, at least to lessen the movement and the pain. If you haven't been to Mayo Clinic, I would strongly recommend it to you. I hope you two are doing better. I'm glad we ""met"". Please give me an update, if it's not too much trouble."

I'm new to this and could really use some advice. My 15 year old son has been diagnosed as ADD since he was in the third grade. His meds have been changed a few times which is normal but he's been on Adderall for almost a year. Well, a couple of times he's gone into a somewhat manic state. He grabs his hair and says every sound, feeling, or even seeing things frustrate him so bad he'll get in his bed and cover his head. Then, after about 30 min he's hyper focused on an activity. During the episode he read almost an entire book in 2 hours. Later on he was back to normal. The next couple of days he's happy, talkative and in such a good mood. It kind of looks like bipolar disorder symptoms. I've made him an appt with his doctor but would really like to know if anyone else has gone through this. Sorry for the long post!"

I had memory issues, falling and sometimes speech problems. In 2014 was diagnosed with elevated ammonia levels, seizures and post encephalitis. I have been falling very frequently. In fact l just fell in my doctors office 2 1/2 weeks ago and l was recovering from a fractured leg which is not the first time. My first neurologist after my first TBI said l had partial seizures, the next carpal tunnel and Parkinson's disease. And my last one non epileptic seizures and conversion disorder. Now l.have fallen so many times it unreal and lots of places. My hands trembling, slurred speech, balance issues. Sometimes have one of my family member to help me go to the restroom. I finally got tired of my doctors because you are trying to tell them something is wrong and they come back with psychotic, bipolar and schizophrenia. And l been to rehab constantly in patient and outpatient. Matter fact l am going now. I had so many surgeries from falling it should tell the doctors something. I have autoimmune disease. One is encephalopathy because of my liver. And l was told before after my biopsy l didn't have cirrhosis and after this last hospital admission on my records it say l do but the doctor said everything was okay. So when l did my research l have the same symptoms of autoimmune encephalitis, when l went to the mayo clinic they said possible because l wasn't showing signs at that time. But their only 2 doctors there that specializes in it. But l definitely have autoimmune encephalopathy. I take lactulose for that. Then my neurologist that l stop seeing since l went to the hospital he works in when l was admitted l had to see him because he was the last one l saw. Now when l fell in the doctors office l hit my mouth and it was bleeding. And l thought it might have been my ammonia levels since it's been high for the last 3months and it was high 3 days before l fell. Now l had to have help for 2 days to get out vfc the bed to go to the bathroom. I remember one evening the nurse said she was giving me my keppra by lV. As soon as she gave it to me l felt a burning but l thought it was running to fast but it wou lm d be okay. Well it wasn't so.l tried to ring the call light to get help and l drop the hand control because my hands were temor so l tried to hit the call light on the bed but l couldn't. Then l felt my head shaking. The nurse came in and l didn't even know how she knew l was having a problem. Then l just blanked out. Now after all this was over l felt fine. I don't know how long this was going on. The next night it happened again l was told  I don't know if it was meds or a seizure. Then when it was over l tried to text my daughter to bring me something for breakfast but when she saw the text l couldn't understand and she told me she couldn't either. So l called my husband since l couldn't text and that was hard too. I had problems touching the numbers on my cellphone but l didn't give up. When he talked to me he couldn't understand me because he said my speech was slurred and this happens quite often. I don't know it but other people tell me that. So  I was always asking the nurse about my ammonia levels and they were checked only twice. When l was in er and when l was discharged. Then the neurologist comes in to discharge me and he said everything came back okay. He's crazy he needs to go back to medical school because if you have autoimmune encephalitis they said everything can come back okay even your EEG. I got that from the UK and also the autoimmune encephalitis alliance that's the mayo clinic site and a women wrote a book on it she went through the same thing. They are now taking about it and trying to educate doctors because a lot of people have been diagnosed with mental illness which they said could have possibly had or have it. Now when l was discharged l didn't sign any discharged papers and the nurse gave me no instructions. I showed my text and she told me yes that's one of the symptoms of autoimmune encephalitis. So now get my discharged papers and they have on hepatic encephalopathy with cirrhosis, hepatitis C, TIA, fronta lm dengentive disease which was ruled out at the mayo clinic, conversion disorder, non eplipetic seizures, depression and other things but everything was normal. My daughter called the mayo clinic and she told me liver doctor there what was going on. He told her to ask the doctor there to run a test since one of my liber shunts is slightly open snd blood was wasnt flowing. Then he said they might not do it because you have gotten a second opinion and they found something. He was definitely correct on that one. Oh forgot to say twice they gave me aspirin and l been allergic to it since 2005 and it's on all my records and so l got bruises on my legs. So today l am going to see my gp and then in October l go back to the mayo clinic because the doctors here are so blinded about diagnoses at least the ones l have gone to except 3 since 1997- 2018. I have been given meds from the doctors and pharmacy that were recalled. Thank God for wisdom. And l can say for 19yrs with memory problems and lots of prayer l can remember a lot and l am writing my first book about what l went through."

Then when it was over l tried to text my daughter to bring me something for breakfast but when she saw the text l couldn't understand and she told me she couldn't either. So l called my husband since l couldn't text and that was hard too. I had problems touching the numbers on my cellphone but l didn't give up. When he talked to me he couldn't understand me because he said my speech was slurred and this happens quite often. I don't know it but other people tell me that. So  I was always asking the nurse about my ammonia levels and they were checked only twice. When l was in er and when l was discharged. Then the neurologist comes in to discharge me and he said everything came back okay. He's crazy he needs to go back to medical school because if you have autoimmune encephalitis they said everything can come back okay even your EEG. I got that from the UK and also the autoimmune encephalitis alliance that's the mayo clinic site and a women wrote a book on it she went through the same thing. They are now taking about it and trying to educate doctors because a lot of people have been diagnosed with mental illness which they said could have possibly had or have it. Now when l was discharged l didn't sign any discharged papers and the nurse gave me no instructions. I showed my text and she told me yes that's one of the symptoms of autoimmune encephalitis. So now get my discharged papers and they have on hepatic encephalopathy with cirrhosis, hepatitis C, TIA, fronta lm dengentive disease which was ruled out at the mayo clinic, conversion disorder, non eplipetic seizures, depression and other things but everything was normal. My daughter called the mayo clinic and she told me liver doctor there what was going on. He told her to ask the doctor there to run a test since one of my liber shunts is slightly open snd blood was wasnt flowing. Then he said they might not do it because you have gotten a second opinion and they found something. He was definitely correct on that one. Oh forgot to say twice they gave me aspirin and l been allergic to it since 2005 and it's on all my records and so l got bruises on my legs. So today l am going to see my gp and then in October l go back to the mayo clinic because the doctors here are so blinded about diagnoses at least the ones l have gone to except 3 since 1997- 2018. I have been given meds from the doctors and pharmacy that were recalled. Thank God for wisdom. And l can say for 19yrs with memory problems and lots of prayer l can remember a lot and l am writing my first book about what l went through."

I had memory issues, falling and sometimes speech problems. In 2014 was diagnosed with elevated ammonia levels, seizures and post encephalitis. I have been falling very frequently. In fact l just fell in my doctors office 2 1/2 weeks ago and l was recovering from a fractured leg which is not the first time. My first neurologist after my first TBI said l had partial seizures, the next carpal tunnel and Parkinson's disease. And my last one non epileptic seizures and conversion disorder. Now l.have fallen so many times it unreal and lots of places. My hands trembling, slurred speech, balance issues. Sometimes have one of my family member to help me go to the restroom. I finally got tired of my doctors because you are trying to tell them something is wrong and they come back with psychotic, bipolar and schizophrenia. And l been to rehab constantly in patient and outpatient. Matter fact l am going now. I had so many surgeries from falling it should tell the doctors something. I have autoimmune disease. One is encephalopathy because of my liver. And l was told before after my biopsy l didn't have cirrhosis and after this last hospital admission on my records it say l do but the doctor said everything was okay. So when l did my research l have the same symptoms of autoimmune encephalitis, when l went to the mayo clinic they said possible because l wasn't showing signs at that time. But their only 2 doctors there that specializes in it. But l definitely have autoimmune encephalopathy. I take lactulose for that. Then my neurologist that l stop seeing since l went to the hospital he works in when l was admitted l had to see him because he was the last one l saw. Now when l fell in the doctors office l hit my mouth and it was bleeding. And l thought it might have been my ammonia levels since it's been high for the last 3months and it was high 3 days before l fell. Now l had to have help for 2 days to get out vfc the bed to go to the bathroom. I remember one evening the nurse said she was giving me my keppra by lV. As soon as she gave it to me l felt a burning but l thought it was running to fast but it wou lm d be okay. Well it wasn't so.l tried to ring the call light to get help and l drop the hand control because my hands were temor so l tried to hit the call light on the bed but l couldn't.

But their only 2 doctors there that specializes in it. But l definitely have autoimmune encephalopathy. I take lactulose for that. Then my neurologist that l stop seeing since l went to the hospital he works in when l was admitted l had to see him because he was the last one l saw. Now when l fell in the doctors office l hit my mouth and it was bleeding. And l thought it might have been my ammonia levels since it's been high for the last 3months and it was high 3 days before l fell. Now l had to have help for 2 days to get out vfc the bed to go to the bathroom. I remember one evening the nurse said she was giving me my keppra by lV. As soon as she gave it to me l felt a burning but l thought it was running to fast but it wou lm d be okay. Well it wasn't so.l tried to ring the call light to get help and l drop the hand control because my hands were temor so l tried to hit the call light on the bed but l couldn't. Then l felt my head shaking. The nurse came in and l didn't even know how she knew l was having a problem. Then l just blanked out. Now after all this was over l felt fine. I don't know how long this was going on. The next night it happened again l was told  I don't know if it was meds or a seizure. Then when it was over l tried to text my daughter to bring me something for breakfast but when she saw the text l couldn't understand and she told me she couldn't either. So l called my husband since l couldn't text and that was hard too. I had problems touching the numbers on my cellphone but l didn't give up. When he talked to me he couldn't understand me because he said my speech was slurred and this happens quite often. I don't know it but other people tell me that. So  I was always asking the nurse about my ammonia levels and they were checked only twice. When l was in er and when l was discharged. Then the neurologist comes in to discharge me and he said everything came back okay. He's crazy he needs to go back to medical school because if you have autoimmune encephalitis they said everything can come back okay even your EEG. I got that from the UK and also the autoimmune encephalitis alliance that's the mayo clinic site and a women wrote a book on it she went through the same thing. They are now taking about it and trying to educate doctors because a lot of people have been diagnosed with mental illness which they said could have possibly had or have it. Now when l was discharged l didn't sign any discharged papers and the nurse gave me no instructions. I showed my text and she told me yes that's one of the symptoms of autoimmune encephalitis. So now get my discharged papers and they have on hepatic encephalopathy with cirrhosis, hepatitis C, TIA, fronta lm dengentive disease which was ruled out at the mayo clinic, conversion disorder, non eplipetic seizures, depression and other things but everything was normal. My daughter called the mayo clinic and she told me liver doctor there what was going on. He told her to ask the doctor there to run a test since one of my liber shunts is slightly open snd blood was wasnt flowing. Then he said they might not do it because you have gotten a second opinion and they found something. He was definitely correct on that one. Oh forgot to say twice they gave me aspirin and l been allergic to it since 2005 and it's on all my records and so l got bruises on my legs. So today l am going to see my gp and then in October l go back to the mayo clinic because the doctors here are so blinded about diagnoses at least the ones l have gone to except 3 since 1997- 2018. I have been given meds from the doctors and pharmacy that were recalled. Thank God for wisdom. And l can say for 19yrs with memory problems and lots of prayer l can remember a lot and l am writing my first book about what l went through."

Recently if was found that it was only 40% effective. So guess what? I got shingles. But it wasn't in the ""usual"" place on the chest and side. I got shingles in the worst place a man could get it. I got a large patch on my left thigh, running up the inside of my leg to the groin area, and, you guessed it, I got shingles on my scrotum and penis. I don't have to ell you how painful that was. I was put on an anti-viral med and it was mostly cleared up in a little over a week. My concern is that I have had some ED problems over the past few years, (I'm 66), and now it seems much worse. Can shingles in that area make ED problems worse? I recently had a testosterone level done, and it's normal."

All symptoms - yes, but reading - wild horses couldn't drag me away. Does it correspond to ADHD. Living in Russia, in my 30, today i discovered what ADHD mean and discovered it's the thing that terrorises me all my life. But i had period of my life when i was living in quagmire of friendly but dull and dysfunctional relantionships, unpaid bills and relatively boring (for me) work, not to mention most of the time i hardly managed to do it properly. Can ADHD live that all-non-active life? And i was relatively calm that days. But slowly drifted to nothing.  I will be extremely grateful for your thoughts, because in Russia we doesn't have any doctor for adult disease. No one, literally. It seems this illness just doesn't exist there."

To give some background (I have no idea if this has anything to do with my current condition) I have had bad stomach tension in the middle right area of my stomach and pain for the past few years along with nausea. about a year and a half ago, I had my gall bladder taken out due to it not working properly and I thought that my problems were solved. A few months ago, the problem came back with more tension and less nausea. This has already been quite uncomfortable, causing so much tension that my neck and back end up extremely sore and difficult to move. 8 days ago, I started to feel extremely dizzy and lightheaded at work. I got sent home and the problem got worse. I started monitoring my blood pressure and it is fluctuating every minute or so pretty rapidly. The top number goes form 110-180 extremely quickly without any reason and the bottom number usually stays around 80, but yesterday it went to 120 multiple times. I am now always slightly dizzy and lightheaded and I cannot even do something like take the dog for a walk without losing all my color and falling. I have passed out twice after attempting to push myself. I have also gone to the ER twice, urgent care once and attempted to figure out the problem with my new primary care doctor. The ER did an EKG and bloodwork which were fine, though I I was experiencing syncopy, with my pulse at 46-49. My blood pressure was still all over the place, but they said they couldn't do anything unless it was a life threatening emergency and sent me home both times with a prescription for meclizine. The meclizine has not helped. The Urgent care doctor actually was able to have me almost pass out into her arms by having me sit down and stand up rapidly and recommended a CAT scan along with more monitoring how simple actions affect my blood pressure. They sent me to the ER that once again did nothing and did not even monitor my blood pressure on the second visit (Besides taking it once and seeing that it was 160/80) My primary care doctor was my last hope, but because of the fact that I was prescribed xanax over 6 years ago, he refuses to believe anything other than xanax withdrawal is the cause.I was also running a fever of 100.4 yesterday that ibuprofen took down and I have lost 6 pounds in the last week and a half despite eating normally. If anyone has an idea for some relief or a possible solution to this issue, please let me know. this last week has been an absolute nightmare and I don't know what I can possibly do. I have not been able to work and simple tasks are very difficult. I know there are so many random symptoms, but if anyone has any clue or similar experience, i would greatly appreciate the help"

Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly: • school - i seek out conversation for help, but then i can’t listen to anything that the other person is saying. ex 1: my friend sawyer has tried to help me with aleks a lot in the past, and even though i would personally ask him how to do something, i would stare right through him while he would explain. then i’d be too embarrassed to tell him i wasn’t listening, so i’d have to pretend i understood what he meant.  • social - i’ll be talking to a friend and they’ll need to tell me either 1) an important piece of information or 2) a story. ex 1: my friend kelsey was telling me about what she was going to do for her summer and even though i was trying so hard to listen and make direct eye contact, i only picked up that she was going back to texas. ex 2: i was helping my best friend, kameron, clean her room out because it was a huge mess. i would ask her where to put certain stuff that she wanted to keep, and she’d tell me, i’d respond “okay cool”, and then almost immediately forget. it felt like i was hearing her but i wasn’t listening if that makes sense.  makes me feel like a hypocrite because i hate when people don’t listen to me when i tell them something important + sets me back academically because i can never progress when given assistance  Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork or workplace duties:  • school - i’ll be told to do homework or to take notes but then i never do even if i really need to for my own success. ex 1: within the first couple months of bio, we were learning about the basics of life like biochemistry. i wasn’t exactly engaged in the class, so people like me were expected to go home and take notes off of the online content provided. i would never do that for the biochem unit, or frankly any of the other following units, and i didn’t do great in the class overall. i got a 68 on the biochem test that dragged my grade to a point of no return. ex 2: my math teacher had to get onto me several times about being behind on aleks even after she would tell me to go home and do a bit of extra work to be on track.  • home - i’ll be told to get something or to do a chore countless times but i won’t do it until the person asking gets irritated with me not doing what they ask. ex 1: my mom told me to get our camera ready for our trip to kenya for several days before i took two minutes to plug in the battery and put the camera body downstairs. the thing is, it wasn’t intentional. i wasn’t trying to annoy my mom or anything; i just completely forgot to do it over and over again until she got mad and a sense of “oh *** yeah i was supposed to do that” came over me.  i feel lazy and annoying because i bother others and set myself back from never doing what’s expected and asked of me  Often has difficulty organising tasks and activities: • school - when i’m given an assignment that i estimate will take me longer than 30 or 45 minutes, i don’t know how to even start them. usually i’ll just try to start with the easiest stuff or in the middle of it (if possible) just so i feel like i’m getting stuff done. in addition, i’ll do idle stuff like change fonts and type sizes or flip through my notebook. ex 1: when writing dbqs for ap world, i would look at the prompt, glance over the documents, and then immediately start writing. i wouldn’t plan anything; i would just do it as i went so i wouldn’t have to think about the organization that much. my teacher got onto me a LOT about it. i conferenced with her about one of my essays once and she criticized my lack of planning saying that i should know how to do it because we’ve practiced it so much, and just started crying. ex 2: i had to do an infographic for bio about cells in the beginning of tenth grade. it was supposed easy and straightforward, but my teacher complicated it a lot so i didn’t really know what i was doing and i realized it was going to take me awhile to finish. at this point, i put it off for a long time, but when i got around to it i tried to start on the easier parts that were close to the end. this only just made it harder in the long run, because i had to reorganize the page to fit everything due to the lack of foresight that i had with the layout.  i’ve seen that poor time management is also a part of this symptom so in the case that it is, ex 3: i’ve always loved science but in seventh grade, it was a mess. i had a really intense teacher that wouldn’t hold back consequences for anyone, and i sometimes walked into his class shaking because i hadn’t finished work that he had assigned. towards the end of the second semester, our year long science project was due and i hadn’t even started. i had an idea and i had turned in portions of the project before, but i hadn’t done any part of the actual experiment i was conducting or any of the presentation board. i had to do the whole thing in one night and although i wasn’t stressed (i had hit a breaking point with stress where i didn’t even feel stress anymore because his class was too much for me) i was freaking out the whole time.  • home - more on the time management of my life, ex 4: usually i’ll wake up with around 20 or 30 minutes to get ready for school. however i’ll go really slowly to get up and get ready for the day. i pretty much always end up running out of the house to my bus with only about a minute to spare.  • social - i rarely show up to friend events on time and it annoys nearly everyone. ex 5: i was supposed to go to a birthday party of a friend who lives in my compound, but i somehow arrived an hour late because i didn’t think about the timing.  this makes me feel incredibly frustrated with myself because my lack of time management and organizational patterns for work and my own life wastes a lot of my time. in addition, it disrespects the people that i try to spend time with and i don’t ever want that to happen.  Often avoids, dislikes or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort: • school - like i said earlier, i won’t do things until the last minute unless they won’t take much of my time or effort. when i do mentally exert myself, such as by writing this entire summary, i pretty much feel brain dead. ex 1: for ap world, i had to do those notes over eid break. i had avoided doing them for almost two weeks already because i knew it would be so much work, but after i finished them i was absolutely exhausted. i wasn’t proud of my work even though i tried to work really hard, and my brain just hurt from all the effort that i put into them. ex 2: for math this year, we were given several days that we could take the same test and i would choose the latter date more often than not because i just didn’t want to take the test. even if i was prepared, which in most cases i was, i just desperately didn’t want to put in the work of taking a test when i could just tell my teacher i “need more time to prepare”.  this makes me feel like i’m way too lazy considering that i’m going into the hardest year of high school next year. it makes me kind of anxious because i feel like i’m going to drown in my harder classes next year just from putting things off.  Is easily distracted by extraneous stimuli: • every context - if there’s something that seems more interesting than what i’m doing, i’ll choose to focus on that rather than suffer through something comparatively boring. ex 1: we have school issued laptops that have very few game websites blocked, so if i’m in a class that’s not holding my attention i’ll just play games instead. ex 2: in choir we have music stands and lots of breaks between the times that we sing, so on most days i’m on my phone in that class when i shouldn’t be just checking my email or instagram. ex 3: when i’m at home supposed to be doing homework, i’ll usually watch netflix instead because i’m able to. ex 4: if im having a boring conversation with a teacher or acquaintance, i’ll try to look at their face or behind them to find something that’s a little more interesting.  this makes me feel super rude and disrespectful to the people that are trying to hold my attention because i don’t pay attention to them.  Is often forgetful in daily activities: • school/ social - i’ll often forget what i’m talking about halfway through a sentence if i’m slightly interrupted. ex 1 (school): during socratic seminars where you’re expected to make articulate arguments out loud, i forget what i’m saying halfway through a point and i have to scramble to try to finish what i’m saying and have it connect to whatever i was saying last. in ninth grade we were doing a seminar about romeo and juliet and i was talking about who knows what up until i lost my train of thought and couldn’t get it back. ex 2 (social): more times than not, i’ll be talking with a friend and forget what i’m saying in the middle of the sentence and not be able to return to what i was saying without help.  it makes me feel so slow and stupid. i don’t know anyone else that forgets everything midway through a conversation, so i always get kind of frustrated with how dumb i look.  hyperactive/impulsive Often talks excessively: • social - if im really interested in a topic, i won’t stop talking about it. ex 1: i get really excited by psycho-analyzing people with my friends and i’ll talk over them for long periods of time saying what i think and why i think that.  i feel rude because i don’t let other people talk when we’re in a two way conversation.  Often blurts out answers before a question has been completed: • social - a lot of the time i’ll try to guess what people are saying so they finish they’re question quicker. i mostly do this with people around my age that are more forgiving, but it sometimes happens with teachers and i always feel really bad afterwards because i feel like i disrespected them. ex 1: i was at a park with two acquaintances and my best friend, but one of the acquaintances said he wanted to talk to me in private so we sat on a bench while the others walked away. he basically went on to tell me how he fell in love with my personality like never before and how he wanted a relationship with me. i wasn’t really surprised so it wasn’t like i was anxious about it or anything but i was still trying to finish all of his sentences and answer his questions about a relationship before he finished asking. i wasn’t helping his nerves at all, and i knew that, but i still did it for the entire conversation.  this just makes me feel rude because i can never just let people talk. i always have to come in at random to try to get the conversation to go quicker.  Often interrupts or intrudes on others: • social - i’ll hear people talking about something that i know about and i’ll butt right in uninvited. in addition, i’ll be talking with a friend and they’ll say something that reminds me of another thing that’s usually unrelated to the conversation so i always say “sorry to interrupt you but [the thing the conversation reminded me of]”. ex 1: maya and hassan we’re talking about how this girl that they both used to hate while i was sitting nearby, and instead of mind my own business like i tried to do, i asked them if they still hated her or not.  this makes me feel really bad and like i don’t have proper social skills. i just want to fit in but i feel like i never can.  other notes: • pretty sure it’s not a depression thing because it’s always been like this. i lack motivation to work now because of the formative/ summative system, but i still procrastinate just as much. the only difference over time is that in texas i was fueled by the anxiety that something bad was going to happen to me if i didn’t finish all of my work, but in qatar i have nothing to worry about because tests and projects are the only things that are due.  if it were depression, i wouldn’t have had any motivation while i was living in texas because i was so constantly depressed that i always felt like killing myself. also im medicated for depression and i have been for a while, so i don’t know if that has any weight.  • i had about three concussions when i was a kid and i don’t know if that means anything.  • i love routine. i like to have everything generally in order and i like to have things stay the same (as an example of how bad it can be: i didn’t leave my abusive boyfriend because i needed the consistency of him being in my life). however, it’s really hard for me to start making something routine a lot of the time. for example, it’s really hard for me to remember to shower every other day even though i know i need to. it’s also really hard for me to remember to wash my face twice a day, so i just generally do it once or less.  • i’ll tell people the same story more than once ALL THE TIME because i forget that i told them. • when a teacher gives instructions and someone next to me asks what to do after the teacher finishes, i can never tell them because i’ve already forgotten and i was going to just go with the flow."

Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly: • school - i seek out conversation for help, but then i can’t listen to anything that the other person is saying. ex 1: my friend sawyer has tried to help me with aleks a lot in the past, and even though i would personally ask him how to do something, i would stare right through him while he would explain. then i’d be too embarrassed to tell him i wasn’t listening, so i’d have to pretend i understood what he meant.  • social - i’ll be talking to a friend and they’ll need to tell me either 1) an important piece of information or 2) a story. ex 1: my friend kelsey was telling me about what she was going to do for her summer and even though i was trying so hard to listen and make direct eye contact, i only picked up that she was going back to texas. ex 2: i was helping my best friend, kameron, clean her room out because it was a huge mess. i would ask her where to put certain stuff that she wanted to keep, and she’d tell me, i’d respond “okay cool”, and then almost immediately forget. it felt like i was hearing her but i wasn’t listening if that makes sense.  makes me feel like a hypocrite because i hate when people don’t listen to me when i tell them something important + sets me back academically because i can never progress when given assistance  Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork or workplace duties:  • school - i’ll be told to do homework or to take notes but then i never do even if i really need to for my own success. ex 1: within the first couple months of bio, we were learning about the basics of life like biochemistry. i wasn’t exactly engaged in the class, so people like me were expected to go home and take notes off of the online content provided. i would never do that for the biochem unit, or frankly any of the other following units, and i didn’t do great in the class overall. i got a 68 on the biochem test that dragged my grade to a point of no return. ex 2: my math teacher had to get onto me several times about being behind on aleks even after she would tell me to go home and do a bit of extra work to be on track.  • home - i’ll be told to get something or to do a chore countless times but i won’t do it until the person asking gets irritated with me not doing what they ask. ex 1: my mom told me to get our camera ready for our trip to kenya for several days before i took two minutes to plug in the battery and put the camera body downstairs. the thing is, it wasn’t intentional. i wasn’t trying to annoy my mom or anything; i just completely forgot to do it over and over again until she got mad and a sense of “oh *** yeah i was supposed to do that” came over me.  i feel lazy and annoying because i bother others and set myself back from never doing what’s expected and asked of me  Often has difficulty organising tasks and activities: • school - when i’m given an assignment that i estimate will take me longer than 30 or 45 minutes, i don’t know how to even start them. usually i’ll just try to start with the easiest stuff or in the middle of it (if possible) just so i feel like i’m getting stuff done. in addition, i’ll do idle stuff like change fonts and type sizes or flip through my notebook. ex 1: when writing dbqs for ap world, i would look at the prompt, glance over the documents, and then immediately start writing. i wouldn’t plan anything; i would just do it as i went so i wouldn’t have to think about the organization that much. my teacher got onto me a LOT about it. i conferenced with her about one of my essays once and she criticized my lack of planning saying that i should know how to do it because we’ve practiced it so much, and just started crying. ex 2: i had to do an infographic for bio about cells in the beginning of tenth grade. it was supposed easy and straightforward, but my teacher complicated it a lot so i didn’t really know what i was doing and i realized it was going to take me awhile to finish. at this point, i put it off for a long time, but when i got around to it i tried to start on the easier parts that were close to the end. this only just made it harder in the long run, because i had to reorganize the page to fit everything due to the lack of foresight that i had with the layout.  i’ve seen that poor time management is also a part of this symptom so in the case that it is, ex 3: i’ve always loved science but in seventh grade, it was a mess. i had a really intense teacher that wouldn’t hold back consequences for anyone, and i sometimes walked into his class shaking because i hadn’t finished work that he had assigned. towards the end of the second semester, our year long science project was due and i hadn’t even started. i had an idea and i had turned in portions of the project before, but i hadn’t done any part of the actual experiment i was conducting or any of the presentation board. i had to do the whole thing in one night and although i wasn’t stressed (i had hit a breaking point with stress where i didn’t even feel stress anymore because his class was too much for me) i was freaking out the whole time.  • home - more on the time management of my life, ex 4: usually i’ll wake up with around 20 or 30 minutes to get ready for school. however i’ll go really slowly to get up and get ready for the day. i pretty much always end up running out of the house to my bus with only about a minute to spare.  • social - i rarely show up to friend events on time and it annoys nearly everyone. ex 5: i was supposed to go to a birthday party of a friend who lives in my compound, but i somehow arrived an hour late because i didn’t think about the timing.  this makes me feel incredibly frustrated with myself because my lack of time management and organizational patterns for work and my own life wastes a lot of my time. in addition, it disrespects the people that i try to spend time with and i don’t ever want that to happen.  Often avoids, dislikes or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort: • school - like i said earlier, i won’t do things until the last minute unless they won’t take much of my time or effort. when i do mentally exert myself, such as by writing this entire summary, i pretty much feel brain dead. ex 1: for ap world, i had to do those notes over eid break. i had avoided doing them for almost two weeks already because i knew it would be so much work, but after i finished them i was absolutely exhausted. i wasn’t proud of my work even though i tried to work really hard, and my brain just hurt from all the effort that i put into them. ex 2: for math this year, we were given several days that we could take the same test and i would choose the latter date more often than not because i just didn’t want to take the test. even if i was prepared, which in most cases i was, i just desperately didn’t want to put in the work of taking a test when i could just tell my teacher i “need more time to prepare”.  this makes me feel like i’m way too lazy considering that i’m going into the hardest year of high school next year. it makes me kind of anxious because i feel like i’m going to drown in my harder classes next year just from putting things off.  Is easily distracted by extraneous stimuli: • every context - if there’s something that seems more interesting than what i’m doing, i’ll choose to focus on that rather than suffer through something comparatively boring. ex 1: we have school issued laptops that have very few game websites blocked, so if i’m in a class that’s not holding my attention i’ll just play games instead. ex 2: in choir we have music stands and lots of breaks between the times that we sing, so on most days i’m on my phone in that class when i shouldn’t be just checking my email or instagram. ex 3: when i’m at home supposed to be doing homework, i’ll usually watch netflix instead because i’m able to. ex 4: if im having a boring conversation with a teacher or acquaintance, i’ll try to look at their face or behind them to find something that’s a little more interesting.  this makes me feel super rude and disrespectful to the people that are trying to hold my attention because i don’t pay attention to them.  Is often forgetful in daily activities: • school/ social - i’ll often forget what i’m talking about halfway through a sentence if i’m slightly interrupted. ex 1 (school): during socratic seminars where you’re expected to make articulate arguments out loud, i forget what i’m saying halfway through a point and i have to scramble to try to finish what i’m saying and have it connect to whatever i was saying last. in ninth grade we were doing a seminar about romeo and juliet and i was talking about who knows what up until i lost my train of thought and couldn’t get it back. ex 2 (social): more times than not, i’ll be talking with a friend and forget what i’m saying in the middle of the sentence and not be able to return to what i was saying without help.  it makes me feel so slow and stupid. i don’t know anyone else that forgets everything midway through a conversation, so i always get kind of frustrated with how dumb i look.  hyperactive/impulsive Often talks excessively: • social - if im really interested in a topic, i won’t stop talking about it. ex 1: i get really excited by psycho-analyzing people with my friends and i’ll talk over them for long periods of time saying what i think and why i think that.  i feel rude because i don’t let other people talk when we’re in a two way conversation.

Often interrupts or intrudes on others: • social - i’ll hear people talking about something that i know about and i’ll butt right in uninvited. in addition, i’ll be talking with a friend and they’ll say something that reminds me of another thing that’s usually unrelated to the conversation so i always say “sorry to interrupt you but [the thing the conversation reminded me of]”. ex 1: maya and hassan we’re talking about how this girl that they both used to hate while i was sitting nearby, and instead of mind my own business like i tried to do, i asked them if they still hated her or not.  this makes me feel really bad and like i don’t have proper social skills. i just want to fit in but i feel like i never can.  other notes: • pretty sure it’s not a depression thing because it’s always been like this. i lack motivation to work now because of the formative/ summative system, but i still procrastinate just as much. the only difference over time is that in texas i was fueled by the anxiety that something bad was going to happen to me if i didn’t finish all of my work, but in qatar i have nothing to worry about because tests and projects are the only things that are due.  if it were depression, i wouldn’t have had any motivation while i was living in texas because i was so constantly depressed that i always felt like killing myself. also im medicated for depression and i have been for a while, so i don’t know if that has any weight.  • i had about three concussions when i was a kid and i don’t know if that means anything.  • i love routine. i like to have everything generally in order and i like to have things stay the same (as an example of how bad it can be: i didn’t leave my abusive boyfriend because i needed the consistency of him being in my life). however, it’s really hard for me to start making something routine a lot of the time. for example, it’s really hard for me to remember to shower every other day even though i know i need to. it’s also really hard for me to remember to wash my face twice a day, so i just generally do it once or less.  • i’ll tell people the same story more than once ALL THE TIME because i forget that i told them. • when a teacher gives instructions and someone next to me asks what to do after the teacher finishes, i can never tell them because i’ve already forgotten and i was going to just go with the flow."

Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly: • school - i seek out conversation for help, but then i can’t listen to anything that the other person is saying. ex 1: my friend sawyer has tried to help me with aleks a lot in the past, and even though i would personally ask him how to do something, i would stare right through him while he would explain. then i’d be too embarrassed to tell him i wasn’t listening, so i’d have to pretend i understood what he meant.  • social - i’ll be talking to a friend and they’ll need to tell me either 1) an important piece of information or 2) a story. ex 1: my friend kelsey was telling me about what she was going to do for her summer and even though i was trying so hard to listen and make direct eye contact, i only picked up that she was going back to texas. ex 2: i was helping my best friend, kameron, clean her room out because it was a huge mess. i would ask her where to put certain stuff that she wanted to keep, and she’d tell me, i’d respond “okay cool”, and then almost immediately forget. it felt like i was hearing her but i wasn’t listening if that makes sense.  makes me feel like a hypocrite because i hate when people don’t listen to me when i tell them something important + sets me back academically because i can never progress when given assistance  Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork or workplace duties:  • school - i’ll be told to do homework or to take notes but then i never do even if i really need to for my own success. ex 1: within the first couple months of bio, we were learning about the basics of life like biochemistry. i wasn’t exactly engaged in the class, so people like me were expected to go home and take notes off of the online content provided. i would never do that for the biochem unit, or frankly any of the other following units, and i didn’t do great in the class overall. i got a 68 on the biochem test that dragged my grade to a point of no return. ex 2: my math teacher had to get onto me several times about being behind on aleks even after she would tell me to go home and do a bit of extra work to be on track.  • home - i’ll be told to get something or to do a chore countless times but i won’t do it until the person asking gets irritated with me not doing what they ask. ex 1: my mom told me to get our camera ready for our trip to kenya for several days before i took two minutes to plug in the battery and put the camera body downstairs. the thing is, it wasn’t intentional. i wasn’t trying to annoy my mom or anything; i just completely forgot to do it over and over again until she got mad and a sense of “oh *** yeah i was supposed to do that” came over me.  i feel lazy and annoying because i bother others and set myself back from never doing what’s expected and asked of me  Often has difficulty organising tasks and activities: • school - when i’m given an assignment that i estimate will take me longer than 30 or 45 minutes, i don’t know how to even start them. usually i’ll just try to start with the easiest stuff or in the middle of it (if possible) just so i feel like i’m getting stuff done. in addition, i’ll do idle stuff like change fonts and type sizes or flip through my notebook. ex 1: when writing dbqs for ap world, i would look at the prompt, glance over the documents, and then immediately start writing. i wouldn’t plan anything; i would just do it as i went so i wouldn’t have to think about the organization that much. my teacher got onto me a LOT about it. i conferenced with her about one of my essays once and she criticized my lack of planning saying that i should know how to do it because we’ve practiced it so much, and just started crying. ex 2: i had to do an infographic for bio about cells in the beginning of tenth grade. it was supposed easy and straightforward, but my teacher complicated it a lot so i didn’t really know what i was doing and i realized it was going to take me awhile to finish. at this point, i put it off for a long time, but when i got around to it i tried to start on the easier parts that were close to the end. this only just made it harder in the long run, because i had to reorganize the page to fit everything due to the lack of foresight that i had with the layout.  i’ve seen that poor time management is also a part of this symptom so in the case that it is, ex 3: i’ve always loved science but in seventh grade, it was a mess. i had a really intense teacher that wouldn’t hold back consequences for anyone, and i sometimes walked into his class shaking because i hadn’t finished work that he had assigned. towards the end of the second semester, our year long science project was due and i hadn’t even started. i had an idea and i had turned in portions of the project before, but i hadn’t done any part of the actual experiment i was conducting or any of the presentation board. i had to do the whole thing in one night and although i wasn’t stressed (i had hit a breaking point with stress where i didn’t even feel stress anymore because his class was too much for me) i was freaking out the whole time.  • home - more on the time management of my life, ex 4: usually i’ll wake up with around 20 or 30 minutes to get ready for school. however i’ll go really slowly to get up and get ready for the day. i pretty much always end up running out of the house to my bus with only about a minute to spare.  • social - i rarely show up to friend events on time and it annoys nearly everyone. ex 5: i was supposed to go to a birthday party of a friend who lives in my compound, but i somehow arrived an hour late because i didn’t think about the timing.  this makes me feel incredibly frustrated with myself because my lack of time management and organizational patterns for work and my own life wastes a lot of my time. in addition, it disrespects the people that i try to spend time with and i don’t ever want that to happen.  Often avoids, dislikes or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort: • school - like i said earlier, i won’t do things until the last minute unless they won’t take much of my time or effort. when i do mentally exert myself, such as by writing this entire summary, i pretty much feel brain dead. ex 1: for ap world, i had to do those notes over eid break. i had avoided doing them for almost two weeks already because i knew it would be so much work, but after i finished them i was absolutely exhausted. i wasn’t proud of my work even though i tried to work really hard, and my brain just hurt from all the effort that i put into them. ex 2: for math this year, we were given several days that we could take the same test and i would choose the latter date more often than not because i just didn’t want to take the test. even if i was prepared, which in most cases i was, i just desperately didn’t want to put in the work of taking a test when i could just tell my teacher i “need more time to prepare”.  this makes me feel like i’m way too lazy considering that i’m going into the hardest year of high school next year. it makes me kind of anxious because i feel like i’m going to drown in my harder classes next year just from putting things off.  Is easily distracted by extraneous stimuli: • every context - if there’s something that seems more interesting than what i’m doing, i’ll choose to focus on that rather than suffer through something comparatively boring. ex 1: we have school issued laptops that have very few game websites blocked, so if i’m in a class that’s not holding my attention i’ll just play games instead. ex 2: in choir we have music stands and lots of breaks between the times that we sing, so on most days i’m on my phone in that class when i shouldn’t be just checking my email or instagram. ex 3: when i’m at home supposed to be doing homework, i’ll usually watch netflix instead because i’m able to. ex 4: if im having a boring conversation with a teacher or acquaintance, i’ll try to look at their face or behind them to find something that’s a little more interesting.  this makes me feel super rude and disrespectful to the people that are trying to hold my attention because i don’t pay attention to them.

Often blurts out answers before a question has been completed: • social - a lot of the time i’ll try to guess what people are saying so they finish they’re question quicker. i mostly do this with people around my age that are more forgiving, but it sometimes happens with teachers and i always feel really bad afterwards because i feel like i disrespected them. ex 1: i was at a park with two acquaintances and my best friend, but one of the acquaintances said he wanted to talk to me in private so we sat on a bench while the others walked away. he basically went on to tell me how he fell in love with my personality like never before and how he wanted a relationship with me. i wasn’t really surprised so it wasn’t like i was anxious about it or anything but i was still trying to finish all of his sentences and answer his questions about a relationship before he finished asking. i wasn’t helping his nerves at all, and i knew that, but i still did it for the entire conversation.  this just makes me feel rude because i can never just let people talk. i always have to come in at random to try to get the conversation to go quicker.  Often interrupts or intrudes on others: • social - i’ll hear people talking about something that i know about and i’ll butt right in uninvited. in addition, i’ll be talking with a friend and they’ll say something that reminds me of another thing that’s usually unrelated to the conversation so i always say “sorry to interrupt you but [the thing the conversation reminded me of]”. ex 1: maya and hassan we’re talking about how this girl that they both used to hate while i was sitting nearby, and instead of mind my own business like i tried to do, i asked them if they still hated her or not.  this makes me feel really bad and like i don’t have proper social skills. i just want to fit in but i feel like i never can.  other notes: • pretty sure it’s not a depression thing because it’s always been like this. i lack motivation to work now because of the formative/ summative system, but i still procrastinate just as much. the only difference over time is that in texas i was fueled by the anxiety that something bad was going to happen to me if i didn’t finish all of my work, but in qatar i have nothing to worry about because tests and projects are the only things that are due.  if it were depression, i wouldn’t have had any motivation while i was living in texas because i was so constantly depressed that i always felt like killing myself. also im medicated for depression and i have been for a while, so i don’t know if that has any weight.  • i had about three concussions when i was a kid and i don’t know if that means anything.  • i love routine. i like to have everything generally in order and i like to have things stay the same (as an example of how bad it can be: i didn’t leave my abusive boyfriend because i needed the consistency of him being in my life). however, it’s really hard for me to start making something routine a lot of the time. for example, it’s really hard for me to remember to shower every other day even though i know i need to. it’s also really hard for me to remember to wash my face twice a day, so i just generally do it once or less.  • i’ll tell people the same story more than once ALL THE TIME because i forget that i told them. • when a teacher gives instructions and someone next to me asks what to do after the teacher finishes, i can never tell them because i’ve already forgotten and i was going to just go with the flow."

Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly: • school - i seek out conversation for help, but then i can’t listen to anything that the other person is saying. ex 1: my friend sawyer has tried to help me with aleks a lot in the past, and even though i would personally ask him how to do something, i would stare right through him while he would explain. then i’d be too embarrassed to tell him i wasn’t listening, so i’d have to pretend i understood what he meant.  • social - i’ll be talking to a friend and they’ll need to tell me either 1) an important piece of information or 2) a story. ex 1: my friend kelsey was telling me about what she was going to do for her summer and even though i was trying so hard to listen and make direct eye contact, i only picked up that she was going back to texas. ex 2: i was helping my best friend, kameron, clean her room out because it was a huge mess. i would ask her where to put certain stuff that she wanted to keep, and she’d tell me, i’d respond “okay cool”, and then almost immediately forget. it felt like i was hearing her but i wasn’t listening if that makes sense.  makes me feel like a hypocrite because i hate when people don’t listen to me when i tell them something important + sets me back academically because i can never progress when given assistance  Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork or workplace duties:  • school - i’ll be told to do homework or to take notes but then i never do even if i really need to for my own success. ex 1: within the first couple months of bio, we were learning about the basics of life like biochemistry. i wasn’t exactly engaged in the class, so people like me were expected to go home and take notes off of the online content provided. i would never do that for the biochem unit, or frankly any of the other following units, and i didn’t do great in the class overall. i got a 68 on the biochem test that dragged my grade to a point of no return. ex 2: my math teacher had to get onto me several times about being behind on aleks even after she would tell me to go home and do a bit of extra work to be on track.  • home - i’ll be told to get something or to do a chore countless times but i won’t do it until the person asking gets irritated with me not doing what they ask. ex 1: my mom told me to get our camera ready for our trip to kenya for several days before i took two minutes to plug in the battery and put the camera body downstairs. the thing is, it wasn’t intentional. i wasn’t trying to annoy my mom or anything; i just completely forgot to do it over and over again until she got mad and a sense of “oh *** yeah i was supposed to do that” came over me.  i feel lazy and annoying because i bother others and set myself back from never doing what’s expected and asked of me  Often has difficulty organising tasks and activities: • school - when i’m given an assignment that i estimate will take me longer than 30 or 45 minutes, i don’t know how to even start them. usually i’ll just try to start with the easiest stuff or in the middle of it (if possible) just so i feel like i’m getting stuff done. in addition, i’ll do idle stuff like change fonts and type sizes or flip through my notebook. ex 1: when writing dbqs for ap world, i would look at the prompt, glance over the documents, and then immediately start writing. i wouldn’t plan anything; i would just do it as i went so i wouldn’t have to think about the organization that much. my teacher got onto me a LOT about it. i conferenced with her about one of my essays once and she criticized my lack of planning saying that i should know how to do it because we’ve practiced it so much, and just started crying. ex 2: i had to do an infographic for bio about cells in the beginning of tenth grade. it was supposed easy and straightforward, but my teacher complicated it a lot so i didn’t really know what i was doing and i realized it was going to take me awhile to finish. at this point, i put it off for a long time, but when i got around to it i tried to start on the easier parts that were close to the end. this only just made it harder in the long run, because i had to reorganize the page to fit everything due to the lack of foresight that i had with the layout.  i’ve seen that poor time management is also a part of this symptom so in the case that it is, ex 3: i’ve always loved science but in seventh grade, it was a mess. i had a really intense teacher that wouldn’t hold back consequences for anyone, and i sometimes walked into his class shaking because i hadn’t finished work that he had assigned. towards the end of the second semester, our year long science project was due and i hadn’t even started. i had an idea and i had turned in portions of the project before, but i hadn’t done any part of the actual experiment i was conducting or any of the presentation board. i had to do the whole thing in one night and although i wasn’t stressed (i had hit a breaking point with stress where i didn’t even feel stress anymore because his class was too much for me) i was freaking out the whole time.  • home - more on the time management of my life, ex 4: usually i’ll wake up with around 20 or 30 minutes to get ready for school. however i’ll go really slowly to get up and get ready for the day. i pretty much always end up running out of the house to my bus with only about a minute to spare.  • social - i rarely show up to friend events on time and it annoys nearly everyone. ex 5: i was supposed to go to a birthday party of a friend who lives in my compound, but i somehow arrived an hour late because i didn’t think about the timing.  this makes me feel incredibly frustrated with myself because my lack of time management and organizational patterns for work and my own life wastes a lot of my time. in addition, it disrespects the people that i try to spend time with and i don’t ever want that to happen.  Often avoids, dislikes or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort: • school - like i said earlier, i won’t do things until the last minute unless they won’t take much of my time or effort. when i do mentally exert myself, such as by writing this entire summary, i pretty much feel brain dead. ex 1: for ap world, i had to do those notes over eid break. i had avoided doing them for almost two weeks already because i knew it would be so much work, but after i finished them i was absolutely exhausted. i wasn’t proud of my work even though i tried to work really hard, and my brain just hurt from all the effort that i put into them. ex 2: for math this year, we were given several days that we could take the same test and i would choose the latter date more often than not because i just didn’t want to take the test. even if i was prepared, which in most cases i was, i just desperately didn’t want to put in the work of taking a test when i could just tell my teacher i “need more time to prepare”.  this makes me feel like i’m way too lazy considering that i’m going into the hardest year of high school next year. it makes me kind of anxious because i feel like i’m going to drown in my harder classes next year just from putting things off.

Is often forgetful in daily activities: • school/ social - i’ll often forget what i’m talking about halfway through a sentence if i’m slightly interrupted. ex 1 (school): during socratic seminars where you’re expected to make articulate arguments out loud, i forget what i’m saying halfway through a point and i have to scramble to try to finish what i’m saying and have it connect to whatever i was saying last. in ninth grade we were doing a seminar about romeo and juliet and i was talking about who knows what up until i lost my train of thought and couldn’t get it back. ex 2 (social): more times than not, i’ll be talking with a friend and forget what i’m saying in the middle of the sentence and not be able to return to what i was saying without help.  it makes me feel so slow and stupid. i don’t know anyone else that forgets everything midway through a conversation, so i always get kind of frustrated with how dumb i look.  hyperactive/impulsive Often talks excessively: • social - if im really interested in a topic, i won’t stop talking about it. ex 1: i get really excited by psycho-analyzing people with my friends and i’ll talk over them for long periods of time saying what i think and why i think that.  i feel rude because i don’t let other people talk when we’re in a two way conversation.  Often blurts out answers before a question has been completed: • social - a lot of the time i’ll try to guess what people are saying so they finish they’re question quicker. i mostly do this with people around my age that are more forgiving, but it sometimes happens with teachers and i always feel really bad afterwards because i feel like i disrespected them. ex 1: i was at a park with two acquaintances and my best friend, but one of the acquaintances said he wanted to talk to me in private so we sat on a bench while the others walked away. he basically went on to tell me how he fell in love with my personality like never before and how he wanted a relationship with me. i wasn’t really surprised so it wasn’t like i was anxious about it or anything but i was still trying to finish all of his sentences and answer his questions about a relationship before he finished asking. i wasn’t helping his nerves at all, and i knew that, but i still did it for the entire conversation.  this just makes me feel rude because i can never just let people talk. i always have to come in at random to try to get the conversation to go quicker.  Often interrupts or intrudes on others: • social - i’ll hear people talking about something that i know about and i’ll butt right in uninvited. in addition, i’ll be talking with a friend and they’ll say something that reminds me of another thing that’s usually unrelated to the conversation so i always say “sorry to interrupt you but [the thing the conversation reminded me of]”. ex 1: maya and hassan we’re talking about how this girl that they both used to hate while i was sitting nearby, and instead of mind my own business like i tried to do, i asked them if they still hated her or not.  this makes me feel really bad and like i don’t have proper social skills. i just want to fit in but i feel like i never can.  other notes: • pretty sure it’s not a depression thing because it’s always been like this. i lack motivation to work now because of the formative/ summative system, but i still procrastinate just as much. the only difference over time is that in texas i was fueled by the anxiety that something bad was going to happen to me if i didn’t finish all of my work, but in qatar i have nothing to worry about because tests and projects are the only things that are due.  if it were depression, i wouldn’t have had any motivation while i was living in texas because i was so constantly depressed that i always felt like killing myself. also im medicated for depression and i have been for a while, so i don’t know if that has any weight.  • i had about three concussions when i was a kid and i don’t know if that means anything.  • i love routine. i like to have everything generally in order and i like to have things stay the same (as an example of how bad it can be: i didn’t leave my abusive boyfriend because i needed the consistency of him being in my life). however, it’s really hard for me to start making something routine a lot of the time. for example, it’s really hard for me to remember to shower every other day even though i know i need to. it’s also really hard for me to remember to wash my face twice a day, so i just generally do it once or less.  • i’ll tell people the same story more than once ALL THE TIME because i forget that i told them. • when a teacher gives instructions and someone next to me asks what to do after the teacher finishes, i can never tell them because i’ve already forgotten and i was going to just go with the flow."

When I finally got a response from him at noon, he was very confused and disoriented. He was unable to walk steadily. He shuffled his feet when walking. I had to help him back to his chair. He kept dosing off. I called EMS and they transported him to the hospital. We found bruising on his right knee and right shoulder. After xrays they determined that he had pulled the ligaments in his right shoulder and may have a slight fracture on his right patella. It was determined that he must have fallen sometime during the night. No concussion. He is unable to remember yesterday and the events. He has been experiencing problems with his memory but nothing to this extent. Would Parkinsons and Lewy Body cause this? He is still feeling tired and has slept off and on most of next day."

There were separate results for ADD and sleep apnea, but none for a relationship between the two. That's why I shared my story on Facebook, at    Short version: 20 years after my diagnosis with ADD (at age 49), I was diagnosed with sleep apnea. One month after using a CPAP machine, I no longer needed any medicine. The medication helped the symptoms, but cured nothing. The CPAP machine was a CURE.  ADD/ADHD has no single known cause, and (as such) has no ""cure."" Its presence is established only by its collection of symptoms. (There are many drugs that ease thew symptoms, all with side effects.) The symptoms of sleep apnea are virtually identical to those of ADD, and IT HAS a cure. My strongest recommendation: if you suspect you have, or are diagnosed with, ADD or ADHD, Get Tested For Sleep Apnea. If that's what you have, skip the expense and side effects of all those drugs. (As a veteran, I get the machine and all supplies for it for free.) Sleep Apnea is not just about snoring (although a CPAP machine puts a stop to snoring). It's about cumulative physical and mental damage. When your airway is obstructed by excessive tissue in the throat, a cycle repeats of 1)cessation of breathing, 2) buildup of CO2 in the lungs, 3) an autonomic response of a release of adrenaline, which wakes you up enough to get you to roll on one side, allowing breathing to resume, but not enough to bring you to full consciousness. This cycle typically repeats a hundred times a night. Your mind suffers from lowered oxygen levels and low-quality, non-restorative sleep. Not only do you wake up tired, your mental functions suffer all day.  In addition, those 100 shots of adrenaline every night have cumulative negative effects on both body and mind. Questions I can't answer: do ALL people ""who have ADD/ADHD"" actually suffer from undiagnosed sleep apnea instead? Does ADD, as some claim, not exist? Have there been any studies connecting ""ADD"" and sleep apnea? (I have found nothing hitting this target. If you have, please respond.) Questions I CAN answer: are medical professionals aware of the overlap of symptoms? (In my experience, no.) is Big Pharma motivated to find cures, rather than medicines to mask symptoms? (NO.) Will most people in authority avoid addressing this issue? (Yes.) Are healthcare and other professionals in contact with the affected population surprised when informed of the overlap in symptoms between ADD and sleep apnea? Always.  Can I make a difference? Maybe. Likely not through official channels, but directly to the public. Most of us are affected, directly or indirectly, by this pandemic. I'm trying to arrange a TED talk on the subject."

I actually know exactly when I had the first one – I was on holidays and departing the hotel and I got this head rush that was very sharp and lasted only a few seconds.

These “rushes” only last a few seconds and don’t interfere with my balance / motor skills nor do I have any cognitive break etc.… they are just very annoying and generate a bit of anxiety. The rushes are not painful and no noise heard. After that first one, I was experiencing them 4 or 5 times every hour for the next month. For that first month, they generally only occurred when I was in situations that had a bit of anxiety involved – good or bad: i.e. playing a video game and monster jumps out, watching TV and phone rings… initially the sensation was almost pleasurable – almost like a release of sorts. Again, they only last a few seconds and once over, I do get an anxious feeling. Initially, in-between these episodes I felt fine. For the first month I just wrote these off as I must have picked up a bug while on vacation (I was in New York). Few items about me – I have never had any issues with depression or anxiety in the past and take no drugs and am a very moderate drinker.  I began to get worried the second month as the head rushes started to occur every 10 minutes of so regardless of what I was doing – no anxiety needed. These new head rushes are similar to the more anxiety generated rushes just a bit milder. They also last just a few seconds. In the second and third month of this issue, I got as many as 80 of the milder rushes a day. As of right now (four months in), I get the milder rushes up to 160 a day. I swear I can feel a build up to each rush in the minute before they occur. I still get the “sharper” and more anxiety driven rushes as well but 3 or 4 an hour. These rushes also occur at night and the sharper ones will wake me up. I’m off work at the moment and have very little stress in my life.  In addition to the head rushes, in month 3 and 4 I started experiencing general fatigue and am now sleeping 12 hour a day. I usually run on my treadmill for an hour and now can only manage 20 minutes before I am exhausted and drenched in sweat. One of the worse problems I am now having related to this is I have no sex drive – never had that issue before. I am also putting on weight.  After the first month I went to see my Doctor about this – he tested my thyroid and I was a bit low so am now on 50 mg of synthroid. My vitamin B was a bit low as well so am on a B supplement. As my symptoms are so strange and persistent, I had an MRI on my head done to ensure no tumor etc.… The MRI was clean. Doc also suspected Cushing Disease so have done 2 X 24 hour urine cortisol test. In both tests my cortisol was above average. Doc had MRI on my adrenal glands to see if there was a tumor – MRI was clean. Running out of ideas, my GP has now referred me to an Endocrinologist. The Endocrinologist had me do a blood cortisol test – it came up as abnormal but too low cortisol not too high? Endocrinologist now doesn’t think it is cushing or even endocrine issue?  I have searched high and low on the Net for folks with my similar symptoms – closest I can find are for folks with antidepressant withdrawal (SSRI) however, I have never been on antidepressants and am not on any drugs.  Anyways – saw this forum with folks who had similar symptoms and thought I would post in hopes of finding someone in a similar situation looking for answers."

After the first month I went to see my Doctor about this – he tested my thyroid and I was a bit low so am now on 50 mg of synthroid. My vitamin B was a bit low as well so am on a B supplement. As my symptoms are so strange and persistent, I had an MRI on my head done to ensure no tumor etc.… The MRI was clean. Doc also suspected Cushing Disease so have done 2 X 24 hour urine cortisol test. In both tests my cortisol was above average. Doc had MRI on my adrenal glands to see if there was a tumor – MRI was clean. Running out of ideas, my GP has now referred me to an Endocrinologist. The Endocrinologist had me do a blood cortisol test – it came up as abnormal but too low cortisol not too high? Endocrinologist now doesn’t think it is cushing or even endocrine issue?  I have searched high and low on the Net for folks with my similar symptoms – closest I can find are for folks with antidepressant withdrawal (SSRI) however, I have never been on antidepressants and am not on any drugs.  Anyways – saw this forum with folks who had similar symptoms and thought I would post in hopes of finding someone in a similar situation looking for answers."

Please Help,"Hi, My nephew is 2 yrs 6 months. And he had a very tough birth experience. Doctors gave too much oxygen when he was born. and after few months he started to suddenly have seizures . We consulted alot of doctors in our country unfortunately no one is able to identify properly.  Mostly came to conclusion of EPILEPSY. However, they dont tell us what should we do, or how can we make it better. Most common answer we heard is that it is common in first 5 years for special cases. so dont worry about it. however we are really worried about him as this is getting worst, fits sometimes goes upto approx 30min until he reaches hospital. Its coming usually after 1 or 2 months randomly.  Furthermore, now recently he can not even walk properly, his balance while walking is getting strange. He can not run. His eyesight got very weak. I am afraid that if we keep on ignoring like this it will get worse. If you need reports , I am happy to provide it you. please let me know what can we do. Any help will be appreciated. Now our final thought is to get him checked from some other country having good neuro drs. I am looking forward to your kind replies.  Kind regards"

Last week I suddenly began experiencing what I believe falls into the category of distal peripheral neuropathy. I am primarily experiencing constant dull pains that appear and vanish sporadically in my feet and hands - not necessarily the joints but more the muscles and areas away from joints. The pain will appear in one spot, last for 30 seconds, then move to a completely different location. Sometimes it appears in 2 to 3 locations at the same time. Pain varies in intensity but probably avgs a 5 out of 10. Occassionally it feels like getting stuck by a pin - ive more than once thought I was getting bit on the feet by fire ants only to discover nothing there. Additionally, the pain is sometimes accompanied by mild burning sensations in the same general locations. I am also experiencing dull, achey pain in my knee joints, upper back, and thighs.  I do not have a fever, but I'm not feeling fantastic either. I've been feeling pretty tired over the last few days and sometimes I vaugeley feel as if I'm fighting a virus. Question is - should I seek medical attention for this? Is this type of sudden neuropathy indicative of a serious illness/infection or could I simply be fighting off a normal virus of some type. Never experienced symptoms like this before. What kind of doctor would be best qualified to review my case? Thanks"
