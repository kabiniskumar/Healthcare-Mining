I was at a strip club and Recived oral sex from a stripper in the VIP room. I'm married, and i'm scared i may have brought something home.  We used a condom, I think she held it to the base with her hand and i don't think her mouth actually touched my skin. But i was drunk so i can't confrim this. The whole act lasted less then 3mins. I removed the condom myself with a baby wipe. 48 hours later I have dizziness and a headache that's persisted for 5or more hours. I guess the main thing i'm afraid of is herpes, because it can't be cured. My wife and I have been monogous for well over 15 years so I don't think anything from the past can flare up. I know I messed up badly and I have to live with that. Can you give me any advice or realistic risks that i should be worried about in the described encounter? Thanks Mike"

She is having a tough time recovering and after some family trauma was shocked several times within a week. She has seen her doctor and has not had another shock in 2 weeks. My question is this.. she is sleeping 11-14 hrs a day. Is this a symptom of her heart disease or should we be concerned?

I live in a colder climate and have had this pain in the left side of my chest that tends to creep up more when i’m outside. it comes and goes, but lately, it’s been more frequent (20+ times a day). it usually only lasts a few seconds and then i’m fine. but my hands are constantly a purple color and very cold. i’ve tried using hand warmers for a solid hour with no change. any ideas as to what this might be and how could i get rid of it? thinking maybe something cardiovascular wise? i also had a blood pressure of 80/40 if this helps."

I got my Paragard IUD in the middle of June while I had my period. The days before I got my next period pos-insertion my discharge was yellowish and kinda thick and then turned light brown to then dark brown and finally my period came. I am now due for my next period at the end of next week and I notice that I am having a thick discharge, thats clear, white and yellow- and almost reminds me of mucus or thick nasal discharge. I know that with Paragard increases and changes in discharge can be normal, but does mine seem ok? It does not have a foul odor and I really do not have any itching. Thanks in advance!"

The past year and a half (after my second child) I have been battling mood swings, lack of conviction to get things done, tired all the time, heavy periods, and can not lose weight at all. For years before that, I have no (and I mean none) sex drive and when my husband and I are together it hurts badly (even after lubes) Two OBs have told me that it's just post-partem and then I recently found out that I have very low testosterone. My dr said normal levels for women are between 8 and 60 and that I am below 7, but she said that testosterone replacement isn't the healthiest for my heart and liver and she can't seem to find anything detrimental to my health because of the low levels. I can deal with my moodiness, periods, and even my weight, but my husband is understandable not thrilled that my libido may never increase so that we can have any semblance of a sex life. Can I be pre-menopausal or is it only my testosterone....and if it is only that, why would it happen? My OBs have never even mentioned pre-menopause, but researching it on here, it seems to fit (as well as the low testosterone levels). Is there anything I can do about my symptoms? At least the sex thing? I keep hitting dead ends and unconcerned doctors so I figured I'd take a shot on here because this is frustrating! :-("

Right after he tested positive for syhpilis (less than two weeks after I gave him oral sex), he let me know so I would get treated. I went to the STI clinic and they gave me a shot of penicilin. The nurse and I both think that it's likely that I did not get infected, as I was not in direct contact with my friend's chancre (I never even touched his butt, just his penis). Furthermore, my friend got flu-like symptoms under an hour after his penicilin shot because it was killing all the bacteria. It's been over three hours since I was injected and I don't have any side effects so far. My first question is: is it unsafe to have been injected with penicilin if I wasn't even infected? We may never know if I was or not, but it sounds like a pretty strong medicine, so that's why I'm wondering. My second question: my friend was told not to have sex for 7 days after he got injected. My nurse didn't tell me that but I will abstain anyway. Just wondering if I can masturbate, or should I abstain from that as well? Thank you!"

My blood pressure was a little higher than usual, but my doctor did not see it as a problem (I am in the average range for vitamin/blood levels; overall, very healthy). He told me if the majority of the symptoms didnt show any improvement within 4 days, that I should come back for more blood work. He didn't seem worried about how my hand veins were appearing smaller during parts of the day, also. Luckily, the tonsils/throat/fever all improved within the next week and I am feeling much better now. But, throughout the day, I notice my hands and feet get cold, and I notice the veins that are usually big on my hands, shrink; this is sometimes accompanied with red cheeks. With the higher than normal blood pressure and shrinking of visible veins in mind, I am weary of it being from something else like a blood clot or heart condition.(?) I do not show any other symptoms of blood clots (no fatigue, redness, numbness, etc) but I just wanted to ask somebody. If I do have CMV, I read that it can stay in your system for weeks and even months. If I did have it, could these symptoms I'm experiencing stay with me until the Virus subsides? The shrinking veins/cold hands/feet have not gotten any worse, it just comes and goes throughout the day and is somewhat annoying. Thanks."

I recently had anal sex with my boyfriend and it didn't really hurt in the moment, but he didn't use any lube. The next day or so after my butt was bleeding not excessively, but more than a little, if that makes sense. It definitely stopped by the end of the 2nd day and hasn't again and its the 5th day now.. Basically I was just wondering if y'all think I should go to the DR and get checked out or if this is something thats kind of normal or not as big of deal since it stopped and doesn't really hurt anymore (besides slight tenderness around the sphincter when pooping)? Thanks!!!"

This what I call episode lasts anywhere from 5 minutes to several hours. Happening several days a week. Along with this I have pitting edema in my legs mainly the right leg. This started over a year ago very subtly. Increasingly gotten worse over the last few months. so I went to a Cardiologist last week. Had blood work done showing that I have anemia. Kidneys and liver operating well. My echo was normal my stress test was great I was a 13.5. I wore a 24-hour monitor in which I turned in two days ago I don't feel I had an episode during that time but I won't know for sure for another week after it is returned results. When I have these episodes it feels like my heart is trying to get back into Rhythm almost like I need a pacemaker! I have no family history of this. I'm very active. 41 years old exercise regularly have a BMI of 20. I have a pretty stress-free life. No anxiety. It's terrifying when this happens. And when it happens in the evening I have trouble sleeping. Any suggestions?

My testicles have become small, soft and sensitive to touch. I have little to no desire for sex and I don't really get erections except occasionally, mostly in the morning. I feel numb down there most of the time especially when I'm not at home and might occasionally feel sexually aroused but it's not really all that intense and dies out soon. I'm currently studying at a university and I really don't have much motivation to study on time and to generally do things I should do on time, on time. I keep stalling and delaying what I should do simply because of a severe lack of motivation and a feeling of apprehension. I feel fatigued and lazy all the time. I also have a lack of self confidence about certain things which makes me on edge when someone points out something negative about me.   I pretend to be interested in girls when I'm with my friends even though I don't really feel much. Even my family doesn't know about it. I come from a culture where you don't really talk about having a girlfriend or boyfriend publicly even if you do, and if you do most of them refrain from engaging in sex for religious reasons. As such it's not really seen as all that unusual that I don't have a girlfriend. My friends just think I don't really make an effort to get to know a girl because I'm just too scared to approach one but the reality is very different. My family just thinks I'm being a ""good boy"".  I was pretty into girls and thinking about sex when I was 13-16. Something happened when I was 16 and I lost interest and then from that point onward my testicles became smaller and softer and now I'm 21... I really need some advice here on what I should do at this point. I'm really confused and worried. I've taken 5 years because the thought of bringing up something like to someone even to family especially in my country would be horribly embarrassing. My family really loves me and I love them but this is too much... I was hoping it would get better in the future but it hasn't now I really don't know what I should do... Thanks."

My chest, mid and left side continue to feel tight and like there's a boulder on my chest. My neck and between my shoulder blades and in my jaw on both sides have hurt pretty bad all day. Last night when I was at the gym the left side of my face had goosebumps and I was literally pouring sweat. I've been stretching and trying to get the pain to go away but nothing not even Tylenol works. I'm in a lot of pain and every time the EMT's come get me due to high blood pressure which causes me to have horrible migraines, I get to the hospital they check for clots and then I'm given medicine to make my migraine go away but they're not treating me or admitting me for the cause of the migraine which is high blood pressure. I 'd hate to go back to the ER just for them to do go through the whole process that I continue to go through and my GP is out today and I'm yet to find a cardiologist.. Please, help me!"

My chest, mid and left side continue to feel tight and like there's a boulder on my chest. My neck and between my shoulder blades and in my jaw on both sides have hurt pretty bad all day. Last night when I was at the gym the left side of my face had goosebumps and I was literally pouring sweat. I've been stretching and trying to get the pain to go away but nothing not even Tylenol works. I'm in a lot of pain and every time the EMT's come get me due to high blood pressure which causes me to have horrible migraines, I get to the hospital they check for clots and then I'm given medicine to make my migraine go away but they're not treating me or admitting me for the cause of the migraine which is high blood pressure. I 'd hate to go back to the ER just for them to do go through the whole process that I continue to go through and my GP is out today and I'm yet to find a cardiologist.. Please, help me!"

It only lasted about 2 days and the pain went away until last week. The same exact type of pain came back. It would basically hurt only when I would move. If I am sitting still...it would not hurt. The pain went away again a couple days ago and I'm fine. But I had a really difficult time getting an erection Friday....I was finally able to get one and achieve orgasm...but its normally not that difficult for me. My libido is a tad bit down too.

It only happens when I eat hard to digest foods, normally several hours pass or even 1 day, and they enter my intestinal system. Irregular heartbeat can last for just a few seconds or up to numerous hours. A cardiologist in Chester SC told me I have tachacardia and put me on diltiazem and amiodarone. Being as how this only happens after eating hard to digest foods even with the medications, I am beginning to wonder if its an intestinal problem versus heart problem. Dr said heartbeat was hitting a nerve in my heart and bouncing back. Sinus rythm will be 60/90 beats per minute, out of sinus has been over 200 beats per minute. Need some help with answers here please. I dont want to have needless surgery doing a burning of a nerve in my heart if thats not the initial problem. Thank you for allowing me this post.

I'm confused because I can't read anywhere that this pain would be related to rectal chlamydia and as my urine and throat were clear, is it still likely I would have testicle pain and mild abdominal pain in lower right Tummy? i get treatment Monday but as it's the weekend I'm just extremely nervous it might be serious and incurable if it's been there a while. the rectal and testicle link explanation would be really useful as there's nothing online about it!

As it did not pain later that night I decided to mastrubate by inserting my penis in a sandwich bag by applying lotion for lubrication. Although it did bleed a little while mastrubate it didn't pain much. The next day when I woke up I noticed that the place where the small cut on the frenulum, the same place had swollen up a little and was now white. I have left it like that ever since.

Basically when her mother was pregnant with her and was really sick, her mother had a cold sore and as a result, her mother was forced to give birth to her very prematurely.

Before you answer, please read and consider this in order to give me a very accurate answer:  We will NOT be having any oral sex of any kind. Strictly vaginal. She does not have genital herpes. So there will be no spread from her mouth to my penis. But even though she does not have herpes in or near her genitals, is there still a chance I can contract HSV-1 from her? I am aware of safe sex practices, but I would like to have vaginal sex without a condom if at all possible. Is this possible? I have researched and googled HSV-1/herpes, but no material at all covers whether or not you can safely have vaginal sex if a woman only has HSV-1/cold sore and when there will be no oral sex at all. Thank you for any answers."

It was prescribed to me when I unknowingly became toxic with digoxin (serious vision loss and darkening, dangerous weight loss, chronic diarhhea etc). It seems many are being prescribed doses at different strengths for 2 times per day or every 12 hours. Propofenone is excreted from the body in 8-10 hours which means patients are vulnerable to afib occurrences in the interim and sets them up for worsening of symptoms. I was in serious persistent afib and it immediately converted to normal rhythm with 3 doses every 8 hours. If you are only on twice a day, check it out with your physician and please look it up for yourself. Every 8 hours will work at the right dosage."

A few days ago I had my first panic attack, called the ambulance and went to the hospitals. All the tests showed my heart was okay and this was a panic attack. After I went to the hospital, I had 4 more panic attacks in a row in 1 hour. They were scary! I was not convinced though, because how would panic disorder create this strange feeling in my heart? I've done some research and found out that A LOT of people with panic disorders have the exact same feeling in their heart. And it was caused by excessive amount of adrenalin in the blood, causing the heart to work harder and in the end, tiring it. And, I've done lots of research about heart failure and I know that it's caused by an over-working heart. So... As a result of this adrenalin - over-working heart muscles, can I expect heart failure in the future if I don't cure my panic disorder? Everyone says panic disorder is harmless. But what about my heart? If my heart works harder every minute, doesn't that mean that I'll have heart failure in the future? Thanks in advance."

Bad circumcision?,"Hello all,  I'm a 47 yr old male. I've had big problems with sex from my earliest experiences with it. I recently read a description of the possible bad side effects of circumcision and they mirrored my experience very well.  - I get erections very easily.  - The sensation of rubbing the shaft feels very good, but doesn't really stimulate the build up to orgasm.  - The head and the frenulum can feel good, but often begin to get painful or numb quickly.  - The ridge behind the head of the penis is very sensitive and rubbing it is how I get to orgasm (if I can.) But there are points on my penis that get very painful from this stimulation even if I use a lot of lube and rub very gently.  - There is a strange ""inversion"" feeling that happens often. I'll get closer and closer to orgasm and it inverts. It goes away. The build up kind of shoots into my gonads or gut without release and feels really uncomfortable. The penis is really sensitive at this point and usually painful. If I carefully rub the areas that don't hurt too much I can usually get to orgasm. But sometimes this 'inversion' will happen 2, 3, or 4 times. The effect is to really, really want to have an orgasm, but more and more discomfort, pain, and acidlike burning to get there.  - Orgasms don't feel good. They are painful, they often burn or I feel nothing at all. Many times I could not tell if I had and orgasm or not.  - It often takes a long time to get to orgasm. In my younger days I'd masturbate for hours sometimes, just trying to get to the release.  - If I compare the sensitivity of the anus to the sensitivity of the head of my penis, I'd say the penis has about 20% of the sensitivity.  - The biggest problem I have is, the more aroused I get, the harder it seems to have an orgasm and the worse it feels. So, being really attracted to someone has the effect of essentially giving me really bad blue balls. To be honest, the lack of enjoyment has left me feeling like I've had blue balls for 35 years. I've gone as long as 12 years between sexual partners, because of the confusion this has caused. It's not that I don't want to have sex. I do, the drive is there. Spring time is here and I'll be seeing women out on the street in less clothing. I have desire, but the sex is so uncomfortable and I get no satisfaction out of it, that most of the time it's better to pretend sex doesn't exist rather than feel the discomfort. I've had few partners. And the ones I've had get discouraged because I never come. Like 7 month relationships without an orgasm. Certainly brings up questions of ""Are you really attracted to me?"", for both of us.  Thanks"

I was sexually abused as a child/adolescent by the person who was my pediatrician as well as other individuals. *Warning: semi graphic information ahead* My sophomore year in high school, I had symptoms which when you look at the whole constellation of them could lead you to believe I was pregnant. Because of who one of my abusers was it was not uncommon for things to happen to me that very well could have resulted in a termination of a pregnancy without my being involved or knowing.  Only one memory exists which might have some bearing on that. I would have been only 15 and immature for my age so understand that I am only able to describe this through a child's perception. I was held down or restrained in some way. It was in his ""office"" which was in a private house and I never knew nurse's worked in places other than the school until I was way older than a normal kid because he didn't have one. My legs were being held spread wide open and I remember my hips hurt. He had a whole bunch of what I remember as metal sticks of all different sizes on a towel. He kept sticking them in me and there was terrible pain and my stomach hurt. I vomited at one point because it hurt so much and I was crying so hard. I don't remember much after that because I think I either passed out or dissociated. This would have been 1987.  I do not know what this episode was. If it was just more of the sadistic abuse which had in the past involved foreign objects. It is the most painful physically episode I remember. It is one of the last times he touched me. I escaped to college in just 2 years, early. But, I do not want to allow a false memory to be given to me just because something seems like it might be. So, my question is . . . Can my obgyn somehow during my exam tell if I was pregnant in the past? If not, do you think if I were to describe all my symptoms from back then to her along with the episode I desciped here - could I trust her opinion on what happened? I need to resolve this and I can't take the suspicion of a therapist with no medical knowledge. To be able to let it go or to face it, I need to hear the opinion from someone with better background to make that call. Especially since I have some medical training myself. Btw: my obgyn is an amazing person. She knows I have a difficult history. She sees me regularly just to check in. She is a big support. So, I know I can trust whatever she says."

Right after my shower, I looked at it again and it became bigger and very white (as if it had never scabbed) it was not flat and ""pearly"" but more raised, bumpy and uneven. The reason i am so confused is that over the past two days i have been constantly looking at the bump, and every time it looks different. It looks the same as described above after i shower, then it'll look scabby, then it'll be more of a tiny dot of white, then back to the bigger white bump after a shower, etc. I have not had any sexual interactions for about 45 days, but have been quite sexually active in the past. I am not able to see a doctor until a week from now, so any opinions on what this may be would be really appreciated til then because I am very worried."

I don't use tampons because I've had a bad run-in with them in the past; at 13.5 I tried using one and only got it up halfway (also very painfully), then couldn't get it out, and ended up going to the hospital where they just pulled it out and wrote down I had a cribriform hymen. Now since then I think my vaginal opening has grown a little so I tried again today. Only using a hand mirror I can SEE the hole is too small, but I still tried. I succeeded in getting it slightly in but I just COULDNT press the smaller tube, and at a certain point I started crying from the pain and my vagina just shot the tampon out. Now half an hour later I can still feel a light pain, and it gets painful whenever I excerize my pelvic muscles even slightly. Help? Please?"

My best freind of 37 years passed away just over a week ago and as you can imagine it has been rough. I do have a good support system and many freinds I can talk to. Many of the feelings of greif are also symptoms of Bradycardia. I have had some dizzyness and have a constant high pitched rining in my ears. Also I havve had panic attacks durin one I felt like I was going to pass out but did not. I have not passed out and my breathing, except for the few anxiety attacks I have had is fine and I have not notied any chest pains except those associatted with greving the loss of a close freind. My main concern is the dizziness and the rining in my ears. I also get the brightness in my vision. I also have the confusion and the memory lapses wich are also associated with both also the complete exahustion after work wich again are associated with both. I have a doctor appointment tomorrow morning to get in to greif counselling. I was wondering as many of the symptoms of Bradycardia and gong through grief are so similare, how do you tell the difference. I plan to discuuss all of this with my doctor tomorrow morning but was wanting to know what others have done to help manege the stress of greiving when you have Bradycardia. The rining is a very high pitched whining sound that seems to get worse at night. I also work third shift which as you can imagine makes work interesting.

A few days later it started burning when I urinated and the tip of my penis looked red and irritated. I went to my Dr. and he did an urinalysis that following Wednesday. It came back clean. I then went in the next day Thursday and they took my blood to run all the STD tests there are out there. It came back negative. There is now a small red bump about the size of the end of a writing pen. Does not hurt burn or anything. I went back and he did a swab of the area and sent it to the lab. I'm waiting on the results. Has anyone out there had a similar situation? Does anyone have any idea what this might be? Thank you for the help.

We have sex for literally speaking hours, and I make her orgasm, but I can't.   Its not as if I don't enjoy the sex, I truly do, the physical feelings as well as the emotional. So why cant I orgasm? She feels bad that she cannot make me feel the way I make her feel and it brings some aggravation to her that she can't cause me to have one.

Ive been 6'5"" since 7th or 8th grade and presently could weigh from 220 to 230 lbs any given week. As a teen I was athletic and into my early 20's I stayed active. Basketball kid, I didnt hit 200 lbs till around 23ish. And im saying this because to me all of it would almost certainly mean there was no stunting of my growth. Around the age of 5 or so, i suffered an injury that THANKFULLY i have no actual memory of, just the story told to me by family members and the scar to collaborate it. I was standing on the toilet, leaning towards the sink, trying to see myself in the mirror, as i brushed my teeth. No one saw how or why i slipped or fell off the toilet, but with one screem my dad said he knew he was running towards something bad. And as he ran into the bathroom he could see me suspended, upside down, off the floor, between the toilet and sink with blood and tears streaming down my belly, to my face and then the floor. I had caught myself on the toilet paper rack (a metal hook in those days apparently) by my torn open testicles. And to this day let him tell the story, we arrived at the e.r. and he had me in one arm, and my, ""balls in his other hand."" Litteraly. He swares he'll never forget they were the most beautiful shade of dark blue hes still ever seen. Ive got the scar, and matching stories from dozens of family members so i know it happened. But ive always wondered if dad may have been a little bit scared and understandably, a little hollywood about my testicles actually being completely severed and at least for a few hours not attached to me. If he wasnt exaggerating then it means a surgeon in phx, az around 1985 was able to reattach my jewels (cuz they are in their) and since ive got a beautiful 9 year old daughter, reattach them 'right.' i cant imagine thatd be a common fix, right? Or is it? And lastly what if any effect would/could such an injury have on the full development of my testicles and penis? Because, though ive never had any confidence issues, its not exactley all proportional with the rest of my body. And the scar size in the shape of an L or a 7, depending on POV, was definitely a pull it tight and hope it holds job. My scrodem seldom hangs, and 90% of the time is really tightly snug with my body like when its cold, or accidently caught it while zipping up ur pants too fast, if you know what i mean? Does that, this, make any sense as ive told it? Because its the story ive been told for 30 years."

Just a few days ago, it was beating intensely, which resulted in a pain in my chest that has persisted since then, which seems to intensify with stress. Also, my head has been aching, and my left arm occasionally feels like it is falling asleep. At this moment, it does not feel particularly bad, although the duration and circumstance of this feeling has me worried. I am 22 years old, in good shape, get a decent amount of exercise, and have not experienced any other heart issues in the past. How serious is what I'm experiencing? Is there something that I should do about this? And is this only a temporary condition that I'm going through?"

I'm a 40-year-old woman. I've been a vegetarian (on average - ranging from vegan to pescetarian, like now - i.e. I eat fish). I used to be overweight, but the highest my total cholesterol ever tested was 134.  For the past year and a half I've been on a huge fitness/lifestyle change. I've lost 70 lbs and am no longer overweight. I run 5 miles 3x/wk and exercise a lot besides that. I eat healthy and have generally been living very healthy for about 18 months, and I plan to make this a permanent change. I got my cholesterol tested today and my levels are: TC 114, HDL 54, LDL 46.  Now, I've worked hard to get my HDL up from the 40s, and my last Dr even said mine might just genetically stay low and not to worry. So I'm thrilled with 54. But this is the fist time my TC has been under 120, and it sounds like that could be an issue, from what little I can find online that isn't scholarly literature I don't understand. Except what little I've found about it presumes HDL is also very low along with it, and mine isn't.  Not to sound bitter (I know I do; I've battled for years), but my experience with doctors is they look at obvious things (either: I was fat, therefore that was my problem, the end; or: your #'s are good, there's nothing wrong with you, go home). If something is unusual, it's an anomaly in the data and we ignore it. Despite the numbers I'm happy with, I've had some (diagnosed) health problems. If low cholesterol could be related, I'd like to know if it's worth the fight that is getting someone to listen in the health system I'm stuck in, or if it truly is nothing to be concerned about. Does anyone know anything about this? Or where I could find out more?"

She did a stress test today, and after 11 minutes on a treadmill started feeling faint. She had a high heart rate, but low blood pressure. She has been suffering from extreme anxiety and panic disorders for the last 5-6 weeks, so we've been trying to eliminate all physiological possibilities of this., e.g. neurology, blood tests, and now heart health. Can anxiety cause high heart rate with low blood pressure? Can this this related to anxiety, or is it something possible in the nervous system? Her heart is very healthy, so they're thinking it might be the nervous system, but could it also be anxiety? She is at baseline an anxious person, and has dealt with family tragedy the last year which has compounded that. We're going to pursue more tests of course, but the combination of high heart rate and low blood pressure seemed atypical to me, but I am just a layman.

I underwent cryo therapy and imiquimod. My reaction to imiquimod was pretty severe and I had to stop mid way through my first round. After a few weeks, I tried again with the same results but I stuck with it. Once I was cleared of the wart, I noticed that I tear in the same spot each time when attempting anal sex.

I don't know what it is but it's not healing. I have been doing some research trying to figure out if this a chancre (first stage of syphilis) or just bump. I recall having a bump filled with pus last month. I busted the bump and the pus came out with blood. I don't know if that has anything to do with it or could it be syphilis. (Picture attached). It is possible for chancre to appear in the pubic area?

I stopped the dance, and went to the bathroom to clean up, then promptly when home and showered. This was about 4 days ago. I did not penetrate her in any way, and I don't think there was much contact with her vagina, since she was wearing a thong, and since she was more using here butt/legs.

As I was falling, I happened to land on one of the top ends to the backrest right on my anus. It bled like crazy, my parents checked it out, but for whatever reason they didn't think it was bad enough to take me to a Doctor. I assume they expected it to heal on its own. It didn't...I should have gotten stitches. The end result is an open tear RIGHT next to my anus which connects to my anal canal. So bowel movements come out of both, but as you can imagine, the Sphincter muscle doesn't really work for the tear as it does for the anus so bowel movements aren't always as clean as it should be.  Over 25 years later, I'm finally asking the question if this is something I can have repaired and if so, would it be considered a Cosmetic or Medical procedure for Insurance purposes?? Aside from wishing I could have normal bowel movements, I've always been extremely self conscious about it with partners. Never any bright lights on during intimate moments to avoid them seeing it. Obviously I know I should go to a Doctor, but I'm just curious what opinions and advice I can get before hand. Thanks!"

A walk from my car, up 16 stairs, and through the door of my apartment should not leave me unable to breathe properly for SEVERAL MINUTES, while I literally feel like I am DYING.

Back when I was a university student I once became so angry with my roommate that I got heart palpitations for a few seconds. This scary feeling has been with me all my adult life, I am 54 now.

Additionally -an probably because of thyroid problem- I also have low Free Testosterone (not a lot but under the range) and I read that testosterone can cause heart issues as well.

I do not suffer from High Blood Pressure, in fact my BP tends to be relatively low 110/70, 102/79, 121/80, etc. Having said that, in the past months I have come to another period where these palpitations have become more often. It can happen several times during the day (a few times at night) and can feel like a few beats, irregular beat, a thump, etc. the feeling varies I would say. Usually it is just an event that last only a beat or two and that is it. In the past few months I had a couple of occasions when it actually lasted like 3 or 4 seconds. During the events I NEVER felt dizzy, nor fainted, nor became disoriented, nor tired, at most I feel a bit breathless because of the anxiety this terrible feeling causes. I have also NEVER felt chest or shoulder pain. Although I am not a regular exerciser, I used to cycle every day, my work is more sitting at the computer. I do make the effort to walk 1.5 kilometers one or more times in a week, sometimes I go for a 4 km walk and quite frankly I do it happily and without feeling tired before, during or after the long walks at relatively higher pace (5.5 km/h) than most people walk, I just can't stand to walk slowly.

I have been to so many doctors and hospitals in the last 8 years. I have scoured the internet. I can't find an answer to my problems. I have fought tooth and nail for my health, but lately, the fight is going out of me because doctor after doctor just shrug and send me elsewhere. It is hard to find hope when no one knows how to fix you.  I am a thirty one year old male. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure in 2009. I was in college at the time commuting to campus and I would suddenly keep getting very dizzy on the interstate. I wouldn't be able to get a good breath, my heart would start pounding, and I'd have to pull over. For all I know now medically at this point in time, I'd have said it was anxiety, but there was no real context for anxiety, and things only got crazier from there.  High blood pressure was the diagnosis they came up with at the time, and they slapped me with some prescriptions and sent me out the door. Unfortunately, after a couple of different medications, I began getting palpitations and low pulse. Eventually, they put me in the hospital for three days. While there, they ran a few tests. My blood pressure kept climbing and they kept giving me nitro sending it plummeting. It got very dangerously low at one point and the male nurse was scared to death. He said he thought he was going to lose me. He took the time to pray with me that night before he left his shift. All the nurses would run in everytime I got up to pee. They said my pulse would spike from a resting rate in the 70s to 140 or so just from standing up and walking to the restroom. I had a stress test and echo done, but everything seemed fine. They eventually sent me out with a 24 hour halter monitor.  Fast forward a few months and I am constantly in and out of the hospital with chest pain and palpitations. I had my blood pressure medicine changed several times. Had more tests ran on my heart. All the focus was entirely on it, although I still struggled greatly with dizziness and breathing difficulties. I went to one heart doctor who told me I needed a pace maker. That scared me. There didn't seem to be a real basis for such an extreme thing that I could understand but he had a really thick accent that I couldn't quite follow all of the time. I ended up going to a different heart doctor who put me on a 30 day event monitor and said the other guy must've been crazy because I was fine. I dealt with these symptoms on a daily repeat from 2009 to 2013... dizziness while driving, difficulty breathing, constantly fatigued, waking from sleep not breathing, chest pains that came on and had all the symptoms of a heart attack, dangerously high blood pressure, ridiculously low pulse, palpitations, even some strange situations with my eyes twitching and blurring and having black spots obstruct my vision. I went to sleep so many times at night wondering if I would see the next day. I was literally too scared to function, afraid to die.  I don't know what I did different if anything at all, but I had a healthy spell from late 2013 maybe (I can't be too sure when it stopped) all the way through February 2016. Oddly enough, some of those times there were the most stressful times of my life (lost our house in a storm while my wife was pregnant, had a law suit try to tear me down, got laid off by my company, etc.) but my health held up. I took it for granted barely even noticing as I'd just gotten used to it being such an occurrence. I wish I would've celebrated and held on to that feeling longer, because in February of last year, it came back stronger than ever before. I had what I thought was a heart attack at work. Came out of nowhere. I got really weak and dizzy, began to shake, my chest clenched up , I lost all breath, and my arms went numb. I blacked out in the floor for a couple of seconds before being rushed to the hospital. I've not had an easy day since then. My chest stays hurting. I've had so many doctors look at me and tests done. I can't breath well (had an 81 on a spirometry test at the ashthma doc). I wake up nightly feeling like I stopped breathing and/or having my heart jump with a feeling of electrical shock. My pulse has been very weak sometimes dropping to the mid 30's and when it gets to that, I feel I'm for sure going to die. I'm not on any beta blockers, but I am on Losartan Potassium and Amlodopine Besylate as well as a number of other things. They tried me on anxiety medicine, it never worked for me, only made things worse. This time, a slew of things have been found... I have Alpha One Antitrypsin Deficiency. I have ulcers in my stomach. I have low breathing function. Just found out I have sleep apnea. I have an extra rhythym in my heart on occassion and mild mitral valve prolapse. I have a complex benign cyst in my kidney. Most of all concerning to me, I have 5 times the maximum suggested amount of renin in my body. I have also been having my face get dry and red (apparently a case of Seborrheic Dermatitis). I've noticed this tends to precede the worst cases of my symptoms.  Still, I suffer daily and no one claims to know what exactly is going on. My blood pressure continues to stay high with the Diastolic number often being in the low 100's. My pulse continues to plummet at night. My eyes will twitch and blur. My heart will skip beats. I will get dizzy driving or playing a game or watching a movie in the theater. My arms and legs will get numb and tingly at times. I belch way too often. I wake up from mid sleep with shocks and gasps. I will bear a constant pressure and pain in my chest day in and day out. Every doctor I have just refers me to another specialist or prescribes something new. I've been left to research this mostly on my own, because I am losing hope. Here are my theories. Snoring is a tell-tell sign of sleep apnea, yet I never snore, therefore this makes me think it may be Central Sleep Apnea caused by my brain not telling my lungs to pull in air. Seborrheic Dermatitis is also sometimes caused by diseases of the Central Nervous System. Perhaps something is going on with my nerves that are causing my body to have all kinds of issues? Could it be MS? Maybe some other CNS Disease? My other theory is that there has to be a reason for my renin to be at 262.5 when the maximum is supposed to be 50 at the highest. I feel that it has to do with the complex cyst they found in my kidney, but I can’t get a doctor to actually agree to talk about removal. Renin is generally produced by the kidneys when blood pressure is low… but mine is never low. Why is there so much Renin? Could Renin be causing my blood pressure to stay skyrocketed? Could that in turn be causing other parts of my body to not function as well? I need a way through this. I’m without hope, afraid, and depressed. I have been ravaged by medical debt and my marriage is full of tension and disappointment. I can’t play with my doctor, can’t go for a walk, can’t go on a date, can’t even have sex without tons of pain and hurt. My wife wants another child, but I don’t know if I’d survive any of it. This has halted my life drastically. I can’t even get surprised or excited without having tons of pain follow suit. It’s like I get very flushed and dizzy and weak and then my heart and blood pressure go crazy. If anyone has any answers, any suggestions, anything at all… please help me. I am desperate."

I have been to so many doctors and hospitals in the last 8 years. I have scoured the internet. I can't find an answer to my problems. I have fought tooth and nail for my health, but lately, the fight is going out of me because doctor after doctor just shrug and send me elsewhere. It is hard to find hope when no one knows how to fix you.  I am a thirty one year old male. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure in 2009. I was in college at the time commuting to campus and I would suddenly keep getting very dizzy on the interstate. I wouldn't be able to get a good breath, my heart would start pounding, and I'd have to pull over. For all I know now medically at this point in time, I'd have said it was anxiety, but there was no real context for anxiety, and things only got crazier from there.  High blood pressure was the diagnosis they came up with at the time, and they slapped me with some prescriptions and sent me out the door. Unfortunately, after a couple of different medications, I began getting palpitations and low pulse. Eventually, they put me in the hospital for three days. While there, they ran a few tests. My blood pressure kept climbing and they kept giving me nitro sending it plummeting. It got very dangerously low at one point and the male nurse was scared to death. He said he thought he was going to lose me. He took the time to pray with me that night before he left his shift. All the nurses would run in everytime I got up to pee. They said my pulse would spike from a resting rate in the 70s to 140 or so just from standing up and walking to the restroom. I had a stress test and echo done, but everything seemed fine. They eventually sent me out with a 24 hour halter monitor.  Fast forward a few months and I am constantly in and out of the hospital with chest pain and palpitations. I had my blood pressure medicine changed several times. Had more tests ran on my heart. All the focus was entirely on it, although I still struggled greatly with dizziness and breathing difficulties. I went to one heart doctor who told me I needed a pace maker. That scared me. There didn't seem to be a real basis for such an extreme thing that I could understand but he had a really thick accent that I couldn't quite follow all of the time. I ended up going to a different heart doctor who put me on a 30 day event monitor and said the other guy must've been crazy because I was fine. I dealt with these symptoms on a daily repeat from 2009 to 2013... dizziness while driving, difficulty breathing, constantly fatigued, waking from sleep not breathing, chest pains that came on and had all the symptoms of a heart attack, dangerously high blood pressure, ridiculously low pulse, palpitations, even some strange situations with my eyes twitching and blurring and having black spots obstruct my vision. I went to sleep so many times at night wondering if I would see the next day. I was literally too scared to function, afraid to die.  I don't know what I did different if anything at all, but I had a healthy spell from late 2013 maybe (I can't be too sure when it stopped) all the way through February 2016. Oddly enough, some of those times there were the most stressful times of my life (lost our house in a storm while my wife was pregnant, had a law suit try to tear me down, got laid off by my company, etc.) but my health held up. I took it for granted barely even noticing as I'd just gotten used to it being such an occurrence. I wish I would've celebrated and held on to that feeling longer, because in February of last year, it came back stronger than ever before. I had what I thought was a heart attack at work. Came out of nowhere. I got really weak and dizzy, began to shake, my chest clenched up , I lost all breath, and my arms went numb. I blacked out in the floor for a couple of seconds before being rushed to the hospital. I've not had an easy day since then. My chest stays hurting. I've had so many doctors look at me and tests done. I can't breath well (had an 81 on a spirometry test at the ashthma doc). I wake up nightly feeling like I stopped breathing and/or having my heart jump with a feeling of electrical shock. My pulse has been very weak sometimes dropping to the mid 30's and when it gets to that, I feel I'm for sure going to die.

I've had so many doctors look at me and tests done. I can't breath well (had an 81 on a spirometry test at the ashthma doc). I wake up nightly feeling like I stopped breathing and/or having my heart jump with a feeling of electrical shock. My pulse has been very weak sometimes dropping to the mid 30's and when it gets to that, I feel I'm for sure going to die. I'm not on any beta blockers, but I am on Losartan Potassium and Amlodopine Besylate as well as a number of other things. They tried me on anxiety medicine, it never worked for me, only made things worse. This time, a slew of things have been found... I have Alpha One Antitrypsin Deficiency. I have ulcers in my stomach. I have low breathing function. Just found out I have sleep apnea. I have an extra rhythym in my heart on occassion and mild mitral valve prolapse. I have a complex benign cyst in my kidney. Most of all concerning to me, I have 5 times the maximum suggested amount of renin in my body. I have also been having my face get dry and red (apparently a case of Seborrheic Dermatitis). I've noticed this tends to precede the worst cases of my symptoms.  Still, I suffer daily and no one claims to know what exactly is going on. My blood pressure continues to stay high with the Diastolic number often being in the low 100's. My pulse continues to plummet at night. My eyes will twitch and blur. My heart will skip beats. I will get dizzy driving or playing a game or watching a movie in the theater. My arms and legs will get numb and tingly at times. I belch way too often. I wake up from mid sleep with shocks and gasps. I will bear a constant pressure and pain in my chest day in and day out. Every doctor I have just refers me to another specialist or prescribes something new. I've been left to research this mostly on my own, because I am losing hope. Here are my theories. Snoring is a tell-tell sign of sleep apnea, yet I never snore, therefore this makes me think it may be Central Sleep Apnea caused by my brain not telling my lungs to pull in air. Seborrheic Dermatitis is also sometimes caused by diseases of the Central Nervous System. Perhaps something is going on with my nerves that are causing my body to have all kinds of issues? Could it be MS? Maybe some other CNS Disease? My other theory is that there has to be a reason for my renin to be at 262.5 when the maximum is supposed to be 50 at the highest. I feel that it has to do with the complex cyst they found in my kidney, but I can’t get a doctor to actually agree to talk about removal. Renin is generally produced by the kidneys when blood pressure is low… but mine is never low. Why is there so much Renin? Could Renin be causing my blood pressure to stay skyrocketed? Could that in turn be causing other parts of my body to not function as well? I need a way through this. I’m without hope, afraid, and depressed. I have been ravaged by medical debt and my marriage is full of tension and disappointment. I can’t play with my doctor, can’t go for a walk, can’t go on a date, can’t even have sex without tons of pain and hurt. My wife wants another child, but I don’t know if I’d survive any of it. This has halted my life drastically. I can’t even get surprised or excited without having tons of pain follow suit. It’s like I get very flushed and dizzy and weak and then my heart and blood pressure go crazy. If anyone has any answers, any suggestions, anything at all… please help me. I am desperate."

I have been to so many doctors and hospitals in the last 8 years. I have scoured the internet. I can't find an answer to my problems. I have fought tooth and nail for my health, but lately, the fight is going out of me because doctor after doctor just shrug and send me elsewhere. It is hard to find hope when no one knows how to fix you.  I am a thirty one year old male. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure in 2009. I was in college at the time commuting to campus and I would suddenly keep getting very dizzy on the interstate. I wouldn't be able to get a good breath, my heart would start pounding, and I'd have to pull over. For all I know now medically at this point in time, I'd have said it was anxiety, but there was no real context for anxiety, and things only got crazier from there.  High blood pressure was the diagnosis they came up with at the time, and they slapped me with some prescriptions and sent me out the door. Unfortunately, after a couple of different medications, I began getting palpitations and low pulse. Eventually, they put me in the hospital for three days. While there, they ran a few tests. My blood pressure kept climbing and they kept giving me nitro sending it plummeting. It got very dangerously low at one point and the male nurse was scared to death. He said he thought he was going to lose me. He took the time to pray with me that night before he left his shift. All the nurses would run in everytime I got up to pee. They said my pulse would spike from a resting rate in the 70s to 140 or so just from standing up and walking to the restroom. I had a stress test and echo done, but everything seemed fine. They eventually sent me out with a 24 hour halter monitor.  Fast forward a few months and I am constantly in and out of the hospital with chest pain and palpitations. I had my blood pressure medicine changed several times. Had more tests ran on my heart. All the focus was entirely on it, although I still struggled greatly with dizziness and breathing difficulties. I went to one heart doctor who told me I needed a pace maker. That scared me. There didn't seem to be a real basis for such an extreme thing that I could understand but he had a really thick accent that I couldn't quite follow all of the time. I ended up going to a different heart doctor who put me on a 30 day event monitor and said the other guy must've been crazy because I was fine. I dealt with these symptoms on a daily repeat from 2009 to 2013... dizziness while driving, difficulty breathing, constantly fatigued, waking from sleep not breathing, chest pains that came on and had all the symptoms of a heart attack, dangerously high blood pressure, ridiculously low pulse, palpitations, even some strange situations with my eyes twitching and blurring and having black spots obstruct my vision. I went to sleep so many times at night wondering if I would see the next day. I was literally too scared to function, afraid to die.  I don't know what I did different if anything at all, but I had a healthy spell from late 2013 maybe (I can't be too sure when it stopped) all the way through February 2016. Oddly enough, some of those times there were the most stressful times of my life (lost our house in a storm while my wife was pregnant, had a law suit try to tear me down, got laid off by my company, etc.) but my health held up. I took it for granted barely even noticing as I'd just gotten used to it being such an occurrence. I wish I would've celebrated and held on to that feeling longer, because in February of last year, it came back stronger than ever before. I had what I thought was a heart attack at work.

Oddly enough, some of those times there were the most stressful times of my life (lost our house in a storm while my wife was pregnant, had a law suit try to tear me down, got laid off by my company, etc.) but my health held up. I took it for granted barely even noticing as I'd just gotten used to it being such an occurrence. I wish I would've celebrated and held on to that feeling longer, because in February of last year, it came back stronger than ever before. I had what I thought was a heart attack at work. Came out of nowhere. I got really weak and dizzy, began to shake, my chest clenched up , I lost all breath, and my arms went numb. I blacked out in the floor for a couple of seconds before being rushed to the hospital. I've not had an easy day since then. My chest stays hurting. I've had so many doctors look at me and tests done. I can't breath well (had an 81 on a spirometry test at the ashthma doc). I wake up nightly feeling like I stopped breathing and/or having my heart jump with a feeling of electrical shock. My pulse has been very weak sometimes dropping to the mid 30's and when it gets to that, I feel I'm for sure going to die. I'm not on any beta blockers, but I am on Losartan Potassium and Amlodopine Besylate as well as a number of other things. They tried me on anxiety medicine, it never worked for me, only made things worse. This time, a slew of things have been found... I have Alpha One Antitrypsin Deficiency. I have ulcers in my stomach. I have low breathing function. Just found out I have sleep apnea. I have an extra rhythym in my heart on occassion and mild mitral valve prolapse. I have a complex benign cyst in my kidney. Most of all concerning to me, I have 5 times the maximum suggested amount of renin in my body. I have also been having my face get dry and red (apparently a case of Seborrheic Dermatitis). I've noticed this tends to precede the worst cases of my symptoms.  Still, I suffer daily and no one claims to know what exactly is going on. My blood pressure continues to stay high with the Diastolic number often being in the low 100's. My pulse continues to plummet at night. My eyes will twitch and blur. My heart will skip beats. I will get dizzy driving or playing a game or watching a movie in the theater. My arms and legs will get numb and tingly at times. I belch way too often. I wake up from mid sleep with shocks and gasps. I will bear a constant pressure and pain in my chest day in and day out. Every doctor I have just refers me to another specialist or prescribes something new. I've been left to research this mostly on my own, because I am losing hope. Here are my theories. Snoring is a tell-tell sign of sleep apnea, yet I never snore, therefore this makes me think it may be Central Sleep Apnea caused by my brain not telling my lungs to pull in air. Seborrheic Dermatitis is also sometimes caused by diseases of the Central Nervous System. Perhaps something is going on with my nerves that are causing my body to have all kinds of issues? Could it be MS? Maybe some other CNS Disease? My other theory is that there has to be a reason for my renin to be at 262.5 when the maximum is supposed to be 50 at the highest. I feel that it has to do with the complex cyst they found in my kidney, but I can’t get a doctor to actually agree to talk about removal. Renin is generally produced by the kidneys when blood pressure is low… but mine is never low. Why is there so much Renin? Could Renin be causing my blood pressure to stay skyrocketed? Could that in turn be causing other parts of my body to not function as well? I need a way through this. I’m without hope, afraid, and depressed. I have been ravaged by medical debt and my marriage is full of tension and disappointment. I can’t play with my doctor, can’t go for a walk, can’t go on a date, can’t even have sex without tons of pain and hurt. My wife wants another child, but I don’t know if I’d survive any of it. This has halted my life drastically. I can’t even get surprised or excited without having tons of pain follow suit. It’s like I get very flushed and dizzy and weak and then my heart and blood pressure go crazy. If anyone has any answers, any suggestions, anything at all… please help me. I am desperate."

I went to a urologist and he said that it's still there but now it's inside me. He couldn't give me a answer if it will ever reappear. It's been some time now and still nothing.

To start with, I'm a 23-year-old male, standing around 5 feet and 3 inches tall, and I am slightly overweight - weighing about 12.9 stones (Or 180 pounds)  Around 2.5 years ago I had a severe case of Epididymitis in my left testicle which, by the time it was diagnosed had already caused damage to that testicle, and subsequently lead to testicular atrophy in the left side, and has left me with poor blood flow to the bottom half of my left testicle according to my Urologists who have done endless blood tests, blood flow scans, Ultrasounds etc...7  Shortly after this problem began to get better, I started getting pain in my right testicle, and despite the fact that every single scan and test has come back completely clear for the right side, my testicle on the right appears smaller and lighter than it used to be.  The 4 Urologists I've seen about this, including one whom carries the name of Professor have all said that the right testicle looks fine both inside and out, and it is around the wright size for my age, height and weight, however I know for a fact that this is not the case, as I remember it used to be bigger and a lot heavier than it is now.  Throughout my life I have been taking a medication called Atomoxetine for the treatment of ADHD. One of the side effects of this medication was that it would always cause my penis and scrotum to retract as if they were extremely cold all the time throughout the day - causing me to have to take hot or warm baths to temporarily solve this. It actually made it quite uncomfortable, and the surface temperature of the skin on my penis and testicles was quite cool as if not enough blood flow was getting to them. Stopping the meds has obviously solved this.  From time to time I get a tingling feeling in my scrotum, and my testicles quickly retract for a while, and only seem to go back to their ""loose"" formation when I'm very warm such as when in the Sauna or a hot bath. They then go back to normal.  My sex drive has not been affected as of yet and I can still have sex perfectly fine. I'm not so worried now about fertility since my fiance is now pregnant with our first child, but the size of things down there is really starting to bug me.  I have also gone to the extent of purchasing an Orchidometer, which doctors use to determine the size of testicles, and my right one does measure almost exactly the top size, which is 25ml and according to this, this is the normal size for an adult testicle, but things still feel a lot lighter and smaller than they used to be. My issue is that things used to be larger than they are, and there seems to be no evidence of any issue which could have caused the right side to get smaller, and yet I notice it quite a lot and notice that its not only smaller, but also a lot lighter than it used to be.  I've discussed the use of Clomiphene to my Urologists, which is a hormone used in women mainly, but can reverse testicular atrophy, but none of the 4 Urologists seem to think this is necessary.  So far I've had several ultrasounds by several different Urologists, physical examinations, blood flow scans and also had blood tests to see if I have the right amount of testosterone and growth hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, Luteinizing hormone etc... - all of which show normal results.

To start with, I'm a 23-year-old male, standing around 5 feet and 3 inches tall, and I am slightly overweight - weighing about 12.9 stones (Or 180 pounds)  Around 2.5 years ago I had a severe case of Epididymitis in my left testicle which, by the time it was diagnosed had already caused damage to that testicle, and subsequently lead to testicular atrophy in the left side, and has left me with poor blood flow to the bottom half of my left testicle according to my Urologists who have done endless blood tests, blood flow scans, Ultrasounds etc...7  Shortly after this problem began to get better, I started getting pain in my right testicle, and despite the fact that every single scan and test has come back completely clear for the right side, my testicle on the right appears smaller and lighter than it used to be.  The 4 Urologists I've seen about this, including one whom carries the name of Professor have all said that the right testicle looks fine both inside and out, and it is around the wright size for my age, height and weight, however I know for a fact that this is not the case, as I remember it used to be bigger and a lot heavier than it is now.  Throughout my life I have been taking a medication called Atomoxetine for the treatment of ADHD. One of the side effects of this medication was that it would always cause my penis and scrotum to retract as if they were extremely cold all the time throughout the day - causing me to have to take hot or warm baths to temporarily solve this. It actually made it quite uncomfortable, and the surface temperature of the skin on my penis and testicles was quite cool as if not enough blood flow was getting to them. Stopping the meds has obviously solved this.  From time to time I get a tingling feeling in my scrotum, and my testicles quickly retract for a while, and only seem to go back to their ""loose"" formation when I'm very warm such as when in the Sauna or a hot bath. They then go back to normal.  My sex drive has not been affected as of yet and I can still have sex perfectly fine. I'm not so worried now about fertility since my fiance is now pregnant with our first child, but the size of things down there is really starting to bug me.  I have also gone to the extent of purchasing an Orchidometer, which doctors use to determine the size of testicles, and my right one does measure almost exactly the top size, which is 25ml and according to this, this is the normal size for an adult testicle, but things still feel a lot lighter and smaller than they used to be. My issue is that things used to be larger than they are, and there seems to be no evidence of any issue which could have caused the right side to get smaller, and yet I notice it quite a lot and notice that its not only smaller, but also a lot lighter than it used to be.  I've discussed the use of Clomiphene to my Urologists, which is a hormone used in women mainly, but can reverse testicular atrophy, but none of the 4 Urologists seem to think this is necessary.  So far I've had several ultrasounds by several different Urologists, physical examinations, blood flow scans and also had blood tests to see if I have the right amount of testosterone and growth hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, Luteinizing hormone etc... - all of which show normal results.  What on earth could this be? What can I do to reverse the atrophy (if anything) and what on earth could be causing it?  Thanks in advance!"

Yesterday I saw a tiny painless whitehead on the top of my vulva above my clitoris. I've gotten cultured done but I don't think for herpes. I'm terrified that I might have it. The doctors at the er prescribed me metronidazole and doxycycline monohydrate a week ago niether of them seem to do anything. However I did develop some snotty looking discharge. Is my life over?

I've been told that these tests are super accurate, but I can't help thinking that if I have an infection in one area, it must be in the other. Is it possible that this is just true and I'm infected in the rectum but not the vagina? Is this seen a lot?"

I've been getting them ever since about age 3, and have developed ways to prevent them. However, I would like to learn more about them and why they happen. So far doctors have not been able to figure out exactly what it is. Maybe someone on here can help? Here's how they go down: I'll get a stomach ache or headache. It won't go away or get better no matter what I do. Eventually, I sort of zone out for a few seconds and come back realizing something is wrong. Everything becomes blurry like my life is running at 3 frames per second, and my thinking isn't very clear. At this point I know I'm about to have a seizure (it's my aura I guess you could say). This happens for about 10-30 seconds, then I faint. I wake up and it's like in a movie, I hear people saying my name (in echoes), there's ringing in my ears, vision is blurry, and my eyes are sensitive to light. Then, I just throw up. Repeatedly. There hasn't been any magic fix, just time and sleep. Usually it takes about a week to fully recover from these episodes. Sometimes I get multiple episodes in a day (Max I've had is 3-4 in a few hours). I don't shake or anything, and I wasn't sure it was a seizure until it happened once in front of some doctors. They said it was definitely a seizure. In the ambulance once, just from throwing up (no episode) they said my heart skipped 3-4 beats. That can't be good. So far what I've found out causes this is food dyes, (Red 40, Blue 30, etc), and stress (bleeding and stuff). Maybe it's just an anxiety reaction? Possibly the food dyes make me sick and I panic. I haven't had one in a while, now that I've avoided some of these causes. Still, sometimes I stay home because I have a certain type of stomach or headache, and it is a bit of a burden in life.  Sorry for the wall of text. Could anyone specifically diagnose this/find solutions to avoiding this entirely? I appreciate it."

I am a 22 year old female. Over the past year or so, I've been experiencing an extremely rapid heart rate any time I exercise. When I say exercise, I don't mean heavy exercise at the gym, I simply mean when I'm outside running around with the kids, swimming, even going for a walk. It comes on very suddenly, it's not a gradual increase. My heart will go from what feels like normal to feeling like its pumping out of my chest. I can feel the heavy pulse in my neck as well. I've never felt anything like it. I have to stop what I'm doing and either bend over or inhale like I'm making myself burp (if that makes sense lol). This doesn't make it go away but it makes it more bareable. It lasts anywhere from 30 seconds to around 10 minutes. When it stops, it's a sudden stop and switch back to normal. I've tried cutting out coffee, that didn't do anything. I'm a nanny, and even the other day when I was rushing around and loading the kids into car seats, this happened and lasted more than 10 minutes. It ONLY happens when I'm exerting myself. It's never occurred when I'm just sitting or relaxing. I've avoided going to a doctor because they seem to link everything to anxiety, which I KNOW is not the problem here. Anyone have any ideas on what this could be?"

I'm fairly new to the area and I don't have a Primary Care Physician so when I thought I needed the STD panel I went to a walk-in clinic. When the results came back positive I told my wife, who is (and was at the time of the affair) pregnant, to get tested and she told her boyfriend. She went to her OB/GYN to get the test and I know nothing about his but both of them came back negative. I have only had the one partner in the past 20 years so how I have syphilis and neither her nor her partner tested positive is bothering me.  My first question is do I actually have it? I received the results over the phone and was told to come in the next day for treatment. When the doctor came in the room she said my panel was all clear. I told her I was told I had syphilis the night before and she glanced at the chart and said ""oh yeah, you do"". She then had the admins come in to take my credit card so they could administer the two penicillin shots. The results paperwork they gave me shows Reactive for both the RPR and FTA-ABS tests with a 1:2 for my RPR Titer. Am I the victim of a Walk-in clinic scam? I've searched the internet for RPR Titers and found my score should fall after treatment. I also read that it fluctuates up or down a level, which is normal, but given my RPR titer is about as low as it can go, a single fluctuation would show my levels increasing and the treatment is not working. If I do have syphilis, how will I know the treatment is working? With my low RPR Titer, is it possible this is a sign of something else? I read about Lupis showing as a false positive but only in pregnant women. I also read about a couple skin diseases from South America and Africa. I was in both places for the military but not for the past 10 years. I've had a number of doctors since leaving the military 10 years ago but I'm not sure if I ever got an STD test during any of those visits. Being married for so long I never asked nor paid attention to STD tests but I was always told my bloodwork came back good. I appreciate any answers you can provide."

The lamisil got rid of 95% of it and it can't really be seen unless you know where to look and look very closely. Still shows under a black light but was told that may be there for a while. Today, 11 weeks and 3 days after my only exposure, on my lower inner groin on the opposite leg (left) have a few small red bumps. They don't itch or hurt, but they are raised. There's some hair there. It appears under a black light I may have similar bumps on my other leg in the same spot, but that area doesn't seem as red or bumpy. Is there any way I could be having an initial herpes outbreak 11+ weeks after exposure? I feel fine for the most part, and have never had any type of herpes outbreak, cold sore, or anything.  Also, I took an HIV test 6.5 weeks after exposure and was negative. I've had very, very mild throat tenderness (I hesitate to call it sore) the last 5 weeks. Is there any way I have HIV and should I test again? Manic here, please help. My exposure was a single one, and a mistake. I pray it hasn't been compounded."

But, she has diabetes and once they did the PET Scan, it came back showing cancer in the pancreas, liver and adrenal glands. I know false positives can come from this situation. Because of risk factors, they are choosing not do do a biopsy. They also say the TAVR is off the table. I want the TAVR and think it will contribute to her quality of life. I think a second opinion on the cancer could show that cancer may not be there. Either way, I think the TAVR should be done.  I need an opinion !!!"

Although I had no previous arrhythmia problems, I went into Vfib after doctors were forced to use the defibrillator. I had a 100% LAD blockage, 90% circumflex blockage, and around 50-60% RCA blockage. I underwent a quadruple bypass and recovery went better than expected. I also have severe ADHD. After being back to work for about a month, my PCP decided that he was no longer comfortable writing a prescription for Vyvanse (30 mg) any longer although there were no related problems. Talking to other doctors, it seems that I'm at very little risk for arrhythmia (although there is some increased risk). However, that seems to have started a chain reaction and now no one wants to actually write the prescription. The cardiologist states that he won't sign off on it because of the FDA warning so I went to a psychiatrist who won't write it without cardiologist approval (although he initially agreed there is little risk). I seriously cannot function without this medication and may not have a job for long without it. I am a few pounds overweight (BMI under 30), work a sedentary job, and could eat a little better, but I was generally healthy prior to this. I have no history of alcohol or drug abuse.

I waited in hopes, that this was just a pulled muscle, but I knew the symptoms. At the time we just moved into our new home, and had no phone yet. The nearest home was my parents, a mile away. I had my wife rush me there where we called 911.  From there, the pain felt like they say, a elephant sitting on your chest  That 15 minute wait for a ambulance seemed like a lifetime. Now the pain has increased even more and my breathing is very shallow ,diaphoretic and scared. It was a half hour trip to the nearest hospital where they found out a half hour after that, that I was actually having another heart attack. I don't remember much after that because they had me so drugged up and was rushed into open heart surgery where they were able to save my life. I'm 54 years old now, I quit smoking and I'm controlling my diabetes the best I can. I am not overweight, but my health is slowly deteriorating that I could tell.

My symptoms include severe sharp, stabbing, burning chest pain that can be best described as being stabbed in the back of the heart with a red-hot icepick, constricting chest pressure, lightheadedness/dizziness, and sometimes loss of consciousness. I was forced to take disability retirement, as I have been advised to not drive, climb ladders, etc., due to the chance of passing out. I have applied for SSDI and was declined, I believe due to the lack of knowledge generally available for this ailment, and am awaiting an appeal hearing. My doctors have tried multiple medications in varying dosages with little to no positive results. My current cardiologist is not optimistic that the spasms will stop. Is there anyone else going through similar issues? Are there any support groups for this condition? My wife is usually supportive, but when we discuss financial issues, she gets angry because I am bringing in with retirement less than half what I used to. This is starting to cause stress and a bit of depression. In short, I am looking for a good source of help, advice, and support."

I figured I had a UTI so went down to CVS and got a testing kit and tested positive for leukocytes. I then went to my university health center to get a prescription for antibiotics but while I was there I gave a urine sample that was sent to a lab and basically forced into taking a medicine for chlamydia.

However, I recently had to go in for a ridiculously high fever, which turned out to be the flu, but while I was there the doctor who saw me that time discussed my case with the doctor I saw for the UTI and she then told me that she doesn't believe I have the flu, she thinks I have HIV.

I am 30 years old and have had high blood pressure since my early 20's. I stopped smoking because of my hypertension but decided i wanted to smoke again. when i did i don't know if it was an anxiety attack that i got or if my blood pressure just went up too high but i felt like i had to take deep breaths and felt discomfort in my chest. it lasted for a few minutes and then went away on its own. I am wondering if marijuana makes my blood pressure go up or if it keeps it down. i have read many different answers from different places i have researched. obviously i don't want to keep smoking if it makes my blood pressure go up. i am currently taking lisinopril for my blood pressure. i have heard that smoking marijuana does make blood pressure go up for a bit after smoking it but after an hour or so it actually lowers blood pressure. marijuana use is not something i proud of but something i enjoy doing on certain occasions. not every day all day. haven't talked to my doctor about it either. i am due to see a cardiologist in a few weeks and i will ask him/ her but in the mean time i wanted some feed back from other people that perhaps have hypertension and smoke marijuana.

I am unaware of the exact time but not too long after i experienced soreness on the right side of my vulva which only lasted a few days. Shortly after, i experienced slight pain in this same general area, but after this, it never came back. Throughout the entire two months i have had irregular, inconsistent pains in my vaginal opening that range from a feeling of pressure, to stabbing, and very slight burning (never any problems when urinating at all). Recently, i noticed a small red bump, that kind of looked like a cut on the inside of my vaginal lip (the right side) which only hurt for about a few hours, and is seeming to go away and does not hurt anymore. Two days ago i woke up and noticed a red area close/beside my vaginal opening which caused some discomfort and pain - i assumed this was from the pad i had been wearing the night before (maybe chafing) which HAD been bothering me, i was just too lazy to change it. Now today the area is still red, but now what seems like dry skin has formed over it, but the pain has gone away. I am so confused because i am unable to compare these to any symptoms i read about anywhere. I went to the sti clinic when i noticed the first symptoms but they said it didn't seem like anything. I still get the weird inconsistent pains almost every day, but there are some days where i feel basically nothing. I am going back to the sti clinic when it reopens in a few days but in the mean time i was wondering if any one could possibly know what this could be. I am SO worried. Please, please help."

If it can help she was like i said wearing a skirt and lace panties. Also another way that has me worried is that later that day I picked her up and my hand was right against her... uh back end and possibly genitalia, I'm freaked out about this because although I don't remember touching the spot I did brush hair out of my face which touched it. I can say more certainly that this time wasn't immediatly but i am still concerned.

I'm a little concerned about this vaginal discharge and am wondering if I have signs of a yeast infection or vaginal infection. I don't have pain when I pee, don't have abdomen pain or anything. I cannot tell whether I should be concerned about the color of my pee because I do not drink water often and always have kidney issues because I don't drink water often so i'm not sure if the yellow color is something to take into account with this. However I had a lot of water the other day and my pee was clear. I simply have itching from time to time (usually when I use my body wash) and when it does itch and I put itch creme it feels less irritated and stops itching. However for 2 days I have been more ""wet"" than usual and have noticed more discharge. There isn't much itchiness right now being that I stopped using my body wash and there no abnormal smell. However again extreme discharge. Please help and tell me what I can do."

He used his penis as an injection site and one time when he did this something went wrong and he was immediately in terrible pain. After this incident he was unable to have sex for years due to the extreme pain and his erections ever since have been half the size. Can anyone please tell me what exactly may have happened and if his erections will ever return to their normal size? He is now able to have sex but he's very insecure about the size of his erections and you can tell that they are not are hard or as large as they could be.

There doesn't appear to be any unusual discharge and there is no smell. Is this a normal occurrence that will go away on its own or a sign of something more serious?"

(cardiac arrest or pulmonary embolism),"My mother-in-law died next last week. She was 68 and sitting next to me in the backseat of the car, on the way to a special dinner with the whole family. She was laughing and talking, and had been active with no mention of pain or symptoms just moments before. She obviously started to notice that something was wrong, asked that the car be pulled over, and asked for some water. She said 'my heart', tried to take a sip of water, couldn't and then said 'my heart' again before she collapsed. We were already pulled over and started calling 911 immediately. Within 5-6 minutes two doctors had arrived (one who someone had run to get from a nearby clinic and one who happened to be driving by). She was unconscious but making a snoring sound at first. My sister-in-law had cleared her mouth immediately and supported her head. Because of a mix-up with 911 we got put on hold, had to call back, and the ambulance didn't arrive until at least 15 minutes later. They proceeded to try to reanimate her for almost half an hour, certainly beyond the point of any reasonable hope. There was no autopsy, but they said it was almost certainly either a cardiac arrest or a pulmonary embolism. I didn't belive she was dead, because the ECG (?) showed movement, but apparently it wasn't in all of her ventricles/not circulating? My father-in-law remembered later that he had an epi-pen in the car, but was too in shock to even think about it at the time. What are the chances that, if he had thought to give the epi-pen to one of the doctors, or try to use it himself before they got there, or if there had not been a mixup with 911 and the ambulance had arrived within 15 minutes, that she could have been saved? We are all playing this over and over again in our heads, and some kind of ratio or statistics would just help. I know it won't change anything, and we don't want to just be reassured. If the answer is painful we need to just know that too. We just feel like no one is telling us the simple truth. Sorry for the (over)long post."

I checked myself in to the ER a few days later and followed up with a cardiologist the following week and again 2 months later for a stress test.

No pain during urination and just called to let me know that there is also a slight clear discharge coming from the urethra. We have only been with each other for the past 5 years, no known std's , except for the fact he had been diagnosed with gonorrhea about 7 years ago and was treated. I asked him if he thought it could be from masturbation ( loation/soap) but there has been nothing out of the ordinary. The only other thing is that on and off for the past few years, when we have sex, he will have a burning sensation from me ( I have been tested multiple times for everything under the sun and everything has come up negative, believe it is my PH balance at times that will cause this issue. There are no rashes or anything afterwards and it will go away after cleansing) . Any thoughts?"

I have gotten cold sores dating all the way back since elementary school but last year after spring break I got hit HARD with cold sores like one every two or three weeks but It has died down very heavily since then. three days ago before I noticed we were making out and she touched the spot that the cold sore was forming and because... ahem... moist she ended up putting her hands on her genitalia to hide it, now normally I wouldn't be too worried but as a very rare and unlucky occurance she not only wore a skirt and lace panties that were too small (pretty sure only in th back though) and she pushed it down and her hands again were right against her genitalia. Now if this matters again going back to my bad time last year with cold sores she had no qualms about kissing me when i had a obvious cold sore and even once or twice while it was oozing (becuase lets be honest no matter how okay you are with it that is disgusting) so she likely already got it from me before June or whenever summer break starts but as far as I know she has never had out breaks and has never touched my cold sore then immediatly touched her genitals/ directly touched herself (she always wears jeans and from what I read it wouldn't pass through those) although now that I think about it she might've but if I get an answer for the first question i'll likely get this one answered as well but if you want to answer this one directly as well please do. So back to my more recent question, if she touched a cold sore that wasn't even formed yet and touched her vag? And if it matters I only noticed the tingling/ on and off warm feeling after wards and I put abreva on twice when I got home that day and the warm feverish feeling was on and off like I said and same with the tingling (i think) and its been doing that for three days now and I put abreva on once yesterday. Another question of a similar stature but this happened this morning, The spot was still deciding whether or not it was going to be a cold sore or not but I did notice some bump on my lip in the area but it has been there for months and the general area was more smooth probably which is why i noticed it (just in case its a bump that looks like blood has clogged it, its probably a scar) and white marks under the skin one meh sized one above the bump and one a little bit more the right. I don't know if they were there is the morning but if they have they really haven't changed at all. But the problem her is I accidently said something that made her wet... like garden hose leaking wet apparently and she touched the spot again and did touch her crouch but I am pretty sure her jeans would have prevented it to pass and if she was basically masturbating (yeah I know... in a public place to...) but a little time passed and she went to class and immediatly asked to use the restroom which was two halls away I should add. But i fear her hand may have had some of her ""stuff"" on it and since its warm an moist would have kept the virus alive on both her hand and possibly her pants and that when she cleaned her self up she could have infected herself and while I am here typing I fear it could have happened when she cleaned herself up on the skirt day. So here is my question in a nutshell: could any of the ways of cold sore (erupted or not) to hand to genitals/ cold sore to moist hand/pants to genitals infect her? If she was already infected by me without any symptoms (I mean she does have two or three white bumps on her lip but theyve been there for months now and have not oozed fluid so if you can tell me what it is please do) would she have devolped anti bodies to HSV-1 by now? or would she have to wait until her first outbreak? Now I am sorry for all the questions and that that is so long and all over the place but I wanted to be descriptive. I belive the person who moniters these questions is Grace and I would like an answer from her since she seems to be very knowledgeable but I am open for anyone who can give answers and reasons for that answer.

But i fear her hand may have had some of her ""stuff"" on it and since its warm an moist would have kept the virus alive on both her hand and possibly her pants and that when she cleaned her self up she could have infected herself and while I am here typing I fear it could have happened when she cleaned herself up on the skirt day. So here is my question in a nutshell: could any of the ways of cold sore (erupted or not) to hand to genitals/ cold sore to moist hand/pants to genitals infect her? If she was already infected by me without any symptoms (I mean she does have two or three white bumps on her lip but theyve been there for months now and have not oozed fluid so if you can tell me what it is please do) would she have devolped anti bodies to HSV-1 by now? or would she have to wait until her first outbreak? Now I am sorry for all the questions and that that is so long and all over the place but I wanted to be descriptive. I belive the person who moniters these questions is Grace and I would like an answer from her since she seems to be very knowledgeable but I am open for anyone who can give answers and reasons for that answer.

Now if this matters again going back to my bad time last year with cold sores she had no qualms about kissing me when i had a obvious cold sore and even once or twice while it was oozing (becuase lets be honest no matter how okay you are with it that is disgusting) so she likely already got it from me before June or whenever summer break starts but as far as I know she has never had out breaks and has never touched my cold sore then immediatly touched her genitals/ directly touched herself (she always wears jeans and from what I read it wouldn't pass through those) although now that I think about it she might've but if I get an answer for the first question i'll likely get this one answered as well but if you want to answer this one directly as well please do.

Her blood pressure was 160/98. They gave her a GI cocktail and hours later sent her home. The next day we were back in the ER, same scenario. 3 days later we went to the family doctor who gave us a BP log and told us to log it for a week and come back. We didn't make it but 2 days. Within that 2 days she passed out in the hall at school and when someone got her to the office her BP was at 155/108. I picked her up. Her symptoms were pale, shakey, & blurred vision. I took her immediately to her Dr who prescribed her Cozzar 50mg with a .01 Clonidine for emergency's only. That worked for 3 weeks. After the 3 weeks we were back in the ER from school where she passed out again and they admitted her into the hospital for evaluation for 3 days. After the 3 days they still had no idea why she was having the issues and sent her home again and still no answers. Finally we got into a pediatric cardiologist and he wondered why we were there, like he just didn't understand the problem, like it was just normal or something, no big deal, so he sent us to a pediatric neurologist who is treating her for migraines which by the way she doesn't even have. The headaches are real but they are only a problem when the BP is a problem. So we drive an hour away 2 times a week for nothing and another 2 times a week to be treated for migraines. No one is addressing the BP at all. Now all the sudden, the blood pressure is low all the time, like most of the time. Yesterday the school called and I had to pick her up with a BP of 80/62 and she was pale and shakey and couldn't barely stand up. She slept all evening. Then today, they called me and I had to go get her with a BP of 155/111... It doesn't make sense to me. How does a 16 year old girl have hypo and hypertension and how do you treat that? There has to be a cause. That can't be normal. It has to be causing damage to her somewhere down the line. It can't be healthy. No one is doing anything to figure out what the problem is and I know there has to be a reason. I live in Louisiana and there aren't a lot of options here. I've thought of out of state help but idk if our insurance with cover out of state. I know medicaid won't but idk about TriCare. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm stressed and worried. Scared for what's gonna happen to her and no one is helping us. Anything you can tell me would be great. I need some ideas of what to do. Am I freaking out for nothing? Any ideas are appreciated! I will go anywhere I need to go , climb any mountain, cross any ocean, call anyone I need to or drive any amount of miles needed to get her the care she needs.

I've also had more EKG's sense then, and they always come back normal. My blood pressure and cholesterol are fine. I am able to exercise and live a normal life.

They do not change in size, cause any irritation, or go away. I also sometimes experience a weird pain in my vaginal opening - some days it doesn't happen at all. Could this be hpv? I am very confused since i have already been to the clinic."

At that time my Aorta was just over 9cm and for that reason the valve and aortic arch was removed and replaced with a saint jude valve and an artificial conduit. I now have a new aneurysm just below the artificial piece and will be undergoing another open heart. No reason ever given for the weakness in the aortic tissue. I have been pushing it lately with backpacking the Grand Canyon lengthways and a portion of the AT. Yes, may be the reason the new aneurysm has formed but not known for sure. I am just looking for anyone to talk to that may have experienced similair surgeries. Not looking forward to the extensive one coming my way. Also looking for any options pertaining to blood thinners."

It mainly was messing w/ my sinuses more then anything. I stayed at home and rested for a week while taking DayQuil and NyQuil along with propolis occasionally. Then on the 10th (Friday) I started to notice a pressure in my chest (my left side). I thought maybe it was mucus build up in my lungs or something bad. I drank lots of hot tea and started to take mucinex. It helped, or at least I thought? On Saturday I was under a lot of stress and started to feel the pressure again. My mother was with me and asked where it was I felt the pressure. I showed her the region it was coming from and she got all worried because she said it was my heart. The pressure would come and go. Nothing super sharp or painful. Just this unexplainable pressure I guess? It continued on through out Sunday. But when I was out w/ friends that night having a good time it wasn't there? On Monday though I ended up going to urgent care because it was still going on and I began to get worried myself. They ran an ekg and didn't find anything wrong and sent me home? But the pressure is still there from time to time. My mother is worried because she feels I'm not active enough and I'm beginning to wonder if she has a point especially since I've been sick I have mainly been resting. What could be the case though? Is there anything I can do? I'm 20, female, and tall/thin if that matters any?"

But now I've been getting SVTs rarely that happen like once every month an a half at the same time every time. They last like 10 min and a remaining hour I just feel off like I can't get a full breathe and a weird feeling in my chest. Basically just very annoying I have a healthy heart and everything. Was just wondering can these just go away considering I have them somewhat rarely? I really don't want to get on a beta blocker cause of side effects.. If there is one that really helps you guys with SVTs let me know cause I might say screw it and get on one. I'm sposed to be going to Florida in about a month and I'm just scared of getting one of these episodes outside my comfort zone. Honestly when I'm having an episode my hearts beating fast but nothing insane it's gets around like 150-165 bbm and I get that really dizzy feeling right before it triggers. Any help would be great I just want to stop worrying and get back to my normal life. Thank you!

Fast forward to about a month after having my daughter. Pregnancy went good no problems so did the first month. Then I started having post partume depression I couldn't get out of bed didn't want to do anything and didn't feel good at all. Started feeling chest pressure and shortness of breath let it go for awhile and then finally went to the er one night because I was feeling really bad. They did an EKG and a few blood tests and sent me home. Then I called my doctor and set up an appointment and told her I was having bad headaches and chest pain with shortness of breath and the headaches were causing me to talk slower and forget things.

I am a 23 year old male who just recently lost his virginity and is currently in a relationship. However I had received oral sex about 1 year ago.  I noticed a few days ago some bumps on my foreskin. They are small and reddish white and there are about 6 of them. Not really clustered up in any way though. There is no irritation except for a minor itch that comes and goes. However when looking up information about it I have come to realize that my foreskin is supposed to retract behind the head of my penis. I had never known that or done it. During sex it never retracted though i felt some pain when it was pulled back. I thought that was abnormal and so i stopped it.  I was a bit worried about possible STD from the 1 year ago encounter but this has only popped up after losing my virginity and I have had an STD test about a month ago and everything was clear. I believe she is clear as she has only had one partner before me. Last night I pulled back my foreskin (painfully) for the first time in my life and didn't notice any abnormalities on the head of my penis. It then got stuck but I was eventually able to pull it back over.  Id like to add that growing up i did have pimples sometimes on my penis and some irritation from time to time. Having been a virgin and never knowing about retracting my penis I assumed it was normal. But it was never 6 different ones at once. Usally 1 maybe 2. So with all of that said I was wondering: 1. If anyone had any idea what the small bumps are. I am worried they might be HPV genital warts but I think it could also be balanitis. I do not think they are herpes. 2.

I am a 23 year old male who just recently lost his virginity and is currently in a relationship. However I had received oral sex about 1 year ago.  I noticed a few days ago some bumps on my foreskin. They are small and reddish white and there are about 6 of them. Not really clustered up in any way though. There is no irritation except for a minor itch that comes and goes. However when looking up information about it I have come to realize that my foreskin is supposed to retract behind the head of my penis. I had never known that or done it. During sex it never retracted though i felt some pain when it was pulled back. I thought that was abnormal and so i stopped it.  I was a bit worried about possible STD from the 1 year ago encounter but this has only popped up after losing my virginity and I have had an STD test about a month ago and everything was clear. I believe she is clear as she has only had one partner before me. Last night I pulled back my foreskin (painfully) for the first time in my life and didn't notice any abnormalities on the head of my penis. It then got stuck but I was eventually able to pull it back over.  Id like to add that growing up i did have pimples sometimes on my penis and some irritation from time to time. Having been a virgin and never knowing about retracting my penis I assumed it was normal. But it was never 6 different ones at once. Usally 1 maybe 2. So with all of that said I was wondering: 1. If anyone had any idea what the small bumps are. I am worried they might be HPV genital warts but I think it could also be balanitis. I do not think they are herpes. 2. Could I have gotten genital warts from receiving Oral Sex. I highly doubt it would have come from my partner but nothing popped up until this week? 3. What do I do about retracting my foreskin. I did it once yesterday but I am very fearful of doing it again.  I do plan on seeing a Doctor very soon but until then some answers would put my mind at ease.

For the past 2 years I've been with the same guy. & ever since we've been together I've been having problems with my vagina. Every time we have sex, I get a cut/tear right at the opening to my vagina and it goes up about an inch in length. There's a swollen ball looking thing where the cut starts at (still right at the opening of my vagina. If I'm laying on my back, it'd be at the top.) and (this is weird I know) it looks like it has little tentacles coming off of it. The pain is almost unbearable. I have no sex drive really. When we have sex, the initial penetration hurts so bad I could cry (the little ball looking thing is what hurts so bad. Then I get the cut.) But then after a minute it stops hurting. Then it hurts again after we get done until like the next day. Now, I got pregnant this time last year with our twin baby girls. And the entire time I was pregnant I had no issues. No pain, no cuts, nothing. But when we got the okay to have sex again after they were born it started back. They're almost 5 months old now. And it's worse now than it was before I got pregnant. I don't have health insurance so if I go see a doctor I NEED a diagnosis bc I'll be paying *** loads of money. But I figured I'd give this a shot first. I also have vaginal dryness. And when he fingers me, or we use toys, it doesn't hurts. Idk if his penis is just too big () but I need some relief. I want to enjoy sex again :( someone please help. Oh and also the skin inside my lips burns sometimes. But no burning when peeing, no discharge. Nothing abnormal besides what I posted about."

When she was only 3 days old, we took her to a hospital for jaundice. In the baby care room, a lady who saw me struggling to wake up the baby to breastfeed helped me. She said she had four kids and seemed quite experienced and helpful. Exhausted and sleep-deprived, I did not react. She held the baby and told me I should remove some of her clothing to help wake her up, and she removed her pants, she saw her diaper said that it was not put on properly, she opened and readjusted the diaper before I could stop her. She then showed me how to swaddle. At that moment I looked up at her face and saw that she had a cold sore. I was shocked. I told her. She said she had washed her hands as she had also breastfeed her own child. But I cannot stop obsessing since that day.  Sorry that it has been a long story, but I am extremely worried that my baby may have caught genital HSV1 from that woman. What if she touched her cold sore without me or her realizing and then her face or worse-her genital area while adjusting the diaper? I have read that it is possible to give a baby genital HSV1 from a cold sore during a diaper change. I also read that the droplets in saliva could also cause transmission. I have had cold sores before so I think I may have passed some oral HSV1 antibodies to my baby, but I don't know if this would protect her against genital HSV1. So far, she hasn't shown any symptoms, but I read that there may be no symptoms for years. I suffer from OCD and am extremely worried. I cannot enjoy my days with my beautiful days due to this uncertainty. What if my baby has caught a lifetime genital STD because of my momentary lapse of judgment. I cannot live with the guilt and the unknown.  To sum up, is it possible for a baby to catch HSV1 orally or genitally in the way I desribed. How likely is it? Thank you very much and my apologies for the lenght of this post."

On 2-20-17 was given a stress test. Completed the stress test and dr said i had an ""abnormal"" stress test. At completion of stress test i was breathing very hard due to the elevation and tension on the treadmill. As i walked on the treadmill near the end of the test the nurse asked me if i ever exercised. I replied that i walked 2 1/2 mi every day. She asked if i walked slowly and i said no, at a normal pace. I am supposed to find out the results of the stress test tomorrow. I still feel great, no pain. Is my cad advancing? I'm trying to prepare for what the diagnosis is ??? Any thoughts??"

One is almost under the nail bed and the other is next to it on the side of my finger. They did/do not really itch at all but were/are tender and swollen. For the first two days they were both just swollen and red but you could not really see anything. Now I can see two whitish yellowish patches in the center of each lump, though they are faint, and the outlines are red. Both are still swollen but not nearly as much as they were the previous days. At first I thought it was a mosquito or maybe a spider bite so I searched but I also came across ""whitlow finger"" and read all about it is caused by the herpes virus and now I'm worried. Does anyone know what this could be or have/had anything like this? Please answer asap if you do, it'd be greatly appreciated. (I also have photos of my finger if more info is needed) Thank You!"

Beware!,"My urologist prescribed Cipro for what he thought was a prostate bacteriological issue. 2 Urologists later, it turned out to be something totally different and not bacteriological at all but that's another story. 3-4 days into taking Cipro I noticed growing headaches and called the Dr. He said ""just take Advil"". When asked if Cipro may cause high Blood pressure, Dr. assured me this isn't the case.  Several days later, the Headaches became unbearable. FYI I never get headaches. I went to check my blood pressure and it was very high.  I suspended Cipro and am in the process of detoxifying now. No doubt, I'm one of many folks who suffered from dangerous blood pressure spike from Cipro. When you search online you will find that I'm not the only one. Notice, there are frequent complaints of Cipro causing severe headaches. I think most of those people don't bother to measure their blood pressure to realize that it may be caused by high BP, and just pop Advil to conceal the serious side effect.

I woke up it felt fine penis did not look any different but when I took it off it was a little numb. I still had some feeling but kinda numb. So I took a shower was able to get another erection bout 15 to 30 minutes later. So I felt I was fine me and my girlfriend actually had sex twice after that once that night then the next morning. i read all these horror about u leave it on what could happen. I don't know if it's mental now it has been two days I feel a little sore. I haven't had random erections today. Should I see a doctor. I have feeling I'm not at full potential flaccid though but I just chalked it up to being oversexed we have had sex 2 to 3 times a day the past two weeks she has been on vac. It kinda feels weird like I want to have an erection but it doesn't.

I'm an 18-year-old girl and I'm a virgin; so it confuses me when all of a sudden my vagina started to itch and I get daily discharge, too. Sometimes, they're clear; sometimes, they're a little bit greenish. It began in November 2016, and a few days after I started to feel the itch, my genital started to feel sore and it was just so itchy I couldn't sleep and was basically just trying to hold myself from throwing a tantrum. I got myself checked and the doctor gave me meds that didn't really work; because I can't say that I got myself REALLY checked. The gynecologist was supposed to check me down there and do a swab test, but since I'm a virgin and I was scared to have something inside me, so instead of getting it fully inside me, she didn't. The results say I don't have yeast infection, so idk what I have. I'm really scared and paranoid because this has been going on for almost 3 months now. I went to the doctor last week and she gave me 2 strong meds that sadly didn't work. (I had my period when I went to her clinic so she didn't check me down there.) I've also noticed that before my period starts, I get bloody discharge. (December and this month only, though). I'm going back to the doctor again this Monday, Jan.30/2017, and she'll check me out. I'll also have a transrectal which is scaring me as hell. I'm so scared, guys. My family has a history of cancer, and I've also Googled about my situation and I'm petrified over the fact that I might have vulva cancer.

Sometimes, the sensation makes me want to massage it or even masturbate more. Do you think that would relieve it? Could I be allergic to latex? Could this be a UTI? For the record, I am not sexually active and the only symptom of a UTI that I have experienced is cloudy urine and that only occurred on a few different occasions. No blood, no redness on the penis shaft, no puss, no discharge or anything of that nature just discomfort/irritation that comes and goes. The last time that I experienced this sensation from masturbating without a condom, I went to the doctor and tested negative for a UTI and the sensation went away in about a month or so.

I'm 32 years old and have been experiencing a certain specific type of chest pain sporadically since around 13 years old. It is a sudden sharp pinch inside the left part of my chest, (about halfway between the center of my chest and my left nipple), and I am unable to breathe normally without severe pinching/stabbing pain for around 20-40 minutes. Each time I breathe I have to inhale at about 30% of a normal full breath, if I breathe any deeper than that it pinches or pulls or whatever is going on and its extremely painful. One time I tried to lay down but couldn't because I found the stabbing pain would happen when I leaned over or to the side.

I'm 32 years old and have been experiencing a certain specific type of chest pain sporadically since around 13 years old. It is a sudden sharp pinch inside the left part of my chest, (about halfway between the center of my chest and my left nipple), and I am unable to breathe normally without severe pinching/stabbing pain for around 20-40 minutes. Each time I breathe I have to inhale at about 30% of a normal full breath, if I breathe any deeper than that it pinches or pulls or whatever is going on and its extremely painful. One time I tried to lay down but couldn't because I found the stabbing pain would happen when I leaned over or to the side.

I'm a 21 year old male, I was recently tested positive for clhamydia. Now I've never gotten an STD before. Before I knew this, here's how it started. For about a few weeks, I started to develop this small burning sensation when I peed. Another thing I noticed was the tip of my penis, whenever touched like by my clothes (inside my pants) or even a slight touch of my finger it would hurt. So I figured it would go away but it didn't. So on December 22 I went to my local urgent care and they did the urine test. Come Christmas Eve they told me I was positive for clhamydia. I was prescribed 2 pills 500 Mg of azithromycin one dosage to take at once. They said it would take about a week for symptoms to go away. It's odd though because I've been drinking a lot of water and it soothes the burning, but once in awhile it will still burn. Also the touching of the tip still happens. Now it's been a week and I still have both of these symptoms. I called the nurse from the urgent care and just told me to call to come in again during the week. Now my question is, when will these symptoms go away? I still have the burning and weird touching feeling still. Is possible I have something else and not clhamydia? What should I do? Just can't really call or go in due to the holidays. I've never had this before and just want the symptoms to go away. Thank you!"

I went to see my PCP the next day and started Flagyl and Cipro. That night, I was very restless and had a jaw pain in my lower jaw and a tense feeling in my upper chest. The symptoms returned, but much more severe the next day and I went to the ER. My bloodwork showed 'significant' elevation of troponin and the cardiologist insisted on doing a cardiac catheterization right then. It showed no blockages and I was released.  I have since had two more episodes with the lower jaw pain and some upper chest tension/tightness. My fever and headaches are gone, still some diarrhea but quite a bit better.

Three days after returning, I developed diarrhea and a fever of around 100 F. The following day, I also added a stiff neck and headaches, especially if I moved my head too quickly. I went to see my PCP the next day and started Flagyl and Cipro. That night, I was very restless and had a jaw pain in my lower jaw and a tense feeling in my upper chest. The symptoms returned, but much more severe the next day and I went to the ER. My bloodwork showed 'significant' elevation of troponin and the cardiologist insisted on doing a cardiac catheterization right then. It showed no blockages and I was released.  I have since had two more episodes with the lower jaw pain and some upper chest tension/tightness. My fever and headaches are gone, still some diarrhea but quite a bit better.

They arent painful, idk how long they have been there, and they arent noticable when i am not errect.

Our sex life was good before that, then it quickly died down from several times a week, to once a month, every other month, twice a year, once a year and finally nothing. She seems to think that since she is older, she should stop living life to its fullest. I have tried to get her to talk to her doctor about it but that must be taboo in her book.

I am a 30 year old Asian male. I'm about 165cm and I weigh about 49.8 kg. I have been a professional copywriter for the past 7 years and for more than a year now, I've been experiencing spells of breathing problems, palpitations and chest pains. There have also been several occasions wherein I felt as though my back would heat up whenever I lie down to sleep. Vices: I don't drink but I do smoke. And because of my work, I foolishly got into the habit of smoking a lot because it helped me concentrate. I would consider myself a heavy smoker for the past 7 years. I used to smoke about 25 sticks per day but now I'm down to 15. And towards the end of 2015, I was also drinking a lot of coffee. My health problems started on November 2015, a couple of months after I started working from home. I woke up feeling as though I'm not breathing right. I wouldn't necessarily say that I'm not getting enough air. I do have a pulse oximeter and my measurements are normally at somewhere between 95 to 99. But on that day, it almost felt like my lungs were struggling, like there was a thin layer covering the insides of my lungs (if that makes any sense.) No phlegm though. Towards the end of the day, I started palpitating so I went to the doctor and have my self checked. I underwent ECG and the only thing the doctor could find was a right bundle branch block. So, she insisted that I go for a pulmonary function test and a chest x-ray. Both of which showed nothing. Meanwhile, my condition continued to worsen due to sporadic chest pains. The pain would often affect random parts of my chest and upper back and they'd normally feel like they're coming from a bone or the spaces between bones (or at least that's what they felt like.) So, my doctor suggested that I go for a 2d echo exam. That too yielded no results so my doctor suggested that my issue might be psychological. I'd love to think that it is. I want to agree with her but after a couple of months of my condition failing to improve, I decided to see another doctor. This one deemed the same thing though he did perscribe me to start taking Coralan for my palpitations. He gave me the smallest dosage available and ordered me to take it twice a day so long as my heart rate isn't anywhere below 60 per minute. Eventually, he reduced it to only once a day. However, my condition remains vastly unchanged. I also took a blood exam but the only problem they found was that my uric acid was too high. I took meds for that already. These days, I really feel as though I'm out of breath. I'd feel out of breath whenever I walk my dog or whenever I climb up the stairs. There was also this one frightening occasion wherein I tried to jog and after a while, my sternum started hurting whenever I took deep breaths. But that only happened once. Could I simply be out of shape? I work from home now so I no longer have to walk 20 minutes a day for work. I try to walk every now and then but it hasn't been a regular habit. Could this simply be a side effect of my smoking? I smoke a lot less now but I still do because I find it extremely hard to concentrate while working. Or could this simply be--as my doctors said--all in my head? I'm writing this not expecting for a solid answer but I do hope you guys could point me toward the right direction. Thank you so much."

I am a 24-year old male and about a week after Thanksgiving, I started to get this pain behind my left breast and in the rib cage area underneath the breast itself. Anyways, I really started to notice the pain especially when I breathed in or either put my arm up, raised it above my head, or put my arms in front of my body. The pain would really hurt around the left breast when I made those movements. In addition, I started to develop stomach symptoms such as burning in the stomach, cramping, diarrhea, and pain in the side of the abdomen as well as in the kidney area. After trying out a round of antibiotics, the pain was still there which caused my doctor to prescribe me with two new antibiotics (Ciproflaxcin and Flagyl) which helped to ease the stomach and chest pain for about 10 days.  However, the stomach pain is still there sometimes when I eat certain foods and my doctor recently put me on Zantac and Omeprazole to see if those would work. Besides my Primary Care doctor, I also received a referral to a Gastro doctor who I visited yesterday. The Gastro doctor doesn't believe it is anything serious besides possibly GERD, but I have to stop taking the meds for two weeks in preperation for a H. pylori test. Besides that, the Gastro doctor also wants to conduct a Barium swallow test to ensure that it is nothing major.  While we wait for that, I continue to deal with the chest and rib pain especially behind the left breast extending up into the collarbone and below both breasts in the rib area. Lately, I have noticed that the pain does come and go, but usually is pretty persistent in nature. Ibuprofen seems to help as does hot showers, but it eventually ends up coming back and hurts.  I do have a Subaortic Stenosis heart murmur, which the cardiologist is not concerned about and said to just monitor, and had both an Echocardiogram and EKG done last month. Both of those tests came back normal as did the chest x-ray which came back with no evidence of COPD. I am hoping that this is something muscular related or even Costochondritis and not a major cardiovascular disease or an issue related to my heart murmur.

So I stopped taking the active birth control pills. On the following Sunday, I started a new pack as I would after my ""normal"" period time. I then had unprotected sex (stupid I know) with my partner on Wednesday. He did pull out, but I know that isn't a thing. My question is whether or not I should be concerned about getting pregnant. Would be taking the morning after pill be wise?"

The tip of my penis feels sensitive and is really red just at the opening. I do not have discharge and it does not burn when I pee. I performed oral sex on another male 2 months ago could this be goneriea or another std - would it take 2 months to show up and would it not infect the throat instead of the penis if it did? 1 day later no blood now

Its difficult to think, feels like my IQ has dropped 30 points, difficult to remember things, difficult to talk as clearly as I usually do. After 2 nights sleep the problem starts clearing up and gets better as time elapses. I have gone to a number of neurologists and none of them have been able to identify the issue.

This fluttering is happening every few minutes and at first it only lasted a few seconds with no pain. Now it lasts about 30 seconds, still every few minutes, with pain. This was only going on in my chest (over my heart) but as of last night it has started to put my left shoulder into a small spasm. I have googled all of this and I am coming up with some things stating that because of my heart murmur, which is causing my heart to stop, there is a part of the heart that when it stops it sends an electric shock to restart the heart and that is why i am feeling the fluttering....I do not believe that. Can anyone tell me what is going on with me? Why is this happening? Thank you in advance for all your help and comments!!!"

About a week ago, I had unprotected sex with a girl. Everything was fine at first, however, a few days later (approximately 3 days after), I noticed a discomfort/mild pain developed in my right testicle. I really notice it when sitting in certain positions or sometimes when I am moving around. The pain is localized mostly at the top of the right testicle, slightly posterior and slightly to the right. Upon self-examination, I noticed that no swelling was present in my testicle or epididymis, but I did find it to be tender and painful in what felt like the tube connecting to the right testicle at the top. The pain is more prevalent on some days as compared to others, so sometimes it feels normal and other times it feels more tender and slightly more painful. A week ago, when I first started noticing this, I went to see a doctor and he examined my scrotum/testicles and did not feel anything wrong as well. He took a urine sample, which I have not yet been contacted about in terms of results, and it has been a week already. The clinic I went to says if they do not call you, then that means nothing is wrong with the urine sample. This slight pain/discomfort has been present for about a week now. It does not hurt to ejaculate or pee, and my semen looks quite normal in terms of colour. I have had chlamydia before where my testicle swelled up and I had epididymitis (which I have been treated for already) but this does not seem to be the case here nor the same kind of pain/discomfort. What could this be? I need to figure it out soon so that I could get the proper treatment (if necessary) so if anyone could possibly help me in any way, that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

I have continuously gained weight in the past three years. I have Graves disease. I am on 20mg Lisinipril and have taken Hydrochlorathiazide (HCTZ )12.5mg in the past. My doctor has not commented on not taking the HCTZ.  My exercise level could be classified as more sedentary than active. I blame this on where I live in relation to the closest city. (I am in Egypt, lol) However I am a member of a gym that is 40+ minutes away and also registered for two aqua aerobics classes, aqua zumba and aqua jog. Which I have not attended as of today. The last couple of days, I have been awakened with a moderate sharp pain in my upper right, lateral chest area. It may drift, though rarely, to my left lateral chest area as well. I find it necessary to take some deep breaths and a low dose aspirin to help alleviate the pain. Though tired, I sit up and it fades away.  The last couple of months I have been experiencing lack of sleep without the use of addictive sleep aids.  The sharp pain, is this something I should pay attention to? Should I contact the cardiologist within my Internal Medicine physicians office.  (Just an added note, I am not impressed with my internal medicine doctor a DO. It appears all he does is orders lab work to acquire a diagnosis.)  I consider myself as a binge eater. Blaming it on being mildly depressed due to lack of self esteem from being unsuccessful in many facets of my life. However, I have not sought after medical assistance for this due to health insurance policies and procedures.  I do want to do something that I can be proud of for me as well as others. Please advise. Thank you in advance."

I am now taking blood pressure, cholesterol lowering and stomach acid reduction med’s, but I am still symptomatic. I believe the key features of this syndrome are (1) chest pain during very intense exercise, (2) immediate relief of the pain when I moderate the intensity of the exercise and (3) the occurrence of similar symptoms climbing a flight of stairs with a full stomach. Thanks for reading this - Any ideas or any others with similar issues?"

Not the skin from friction, but more inside towards the base of the shaft and sometimes the middle. He's pretty big and and long and when we have sex I can feel him going as far as he can possibly go. This only happens when I'm on top. I use more of a rocking motion as opposed to thrusting, so I wonder if it's just sore from me pressing on him. Any suggestions?  We've both been single for some time after divorce so the sex is more than we're both used to. Any advice?"

Now what do you do?  I remember when my mother was first diagnosed with congestive heart failure. There was a lot of misinformation about what she needed to do to keep her heart failure in check. She learned over time as her condition worsened that not exercising, gaining weight, and stressing out are all detrimental to her condition and quality of life.  That's why I think it’s really important that all people who are living with heart failure check out these tips ( ) on how to keep your failure in check. Living a happy and healthy life with heart failure is possible -you just need to work closely with your doctors and make smart health decisions. Do you have any other tips for those living with heart failure?"

I had noticed a black spot there a couple of days and initially thought it was plain dirt. But later I realized it was more than just dirt accumulated there. When I squeezed it out a mucus(grayish dark) colored thick block of substance came out. The substance was more like a heavily used cotton ball. When I tried to stretch it, it broke just like cotton ( with small strings) . It did not smell at all neither did it pain altogether when I pushed it out. There is no pus or infection either. Now I see an orifice/hole/pore with bright white edgeus. Can you please share what it could be? It's just one opening. I am sexually inactive with partners but do masturbate which can be seen as excessive."

There is no bruising at all, but i'm obviously scared of a penile fracture. Also, I have urinated several times and have had no blood. Should I be worried? If so what is the best way to find a doctor for this sort of thing and what's the fastest way to get in to see a doctor for it on the weekend."

I had protected condom sex with a female escort on 2nd February 2017 and was tested for Chlamydia and Gonnoraeha on 10th February 2017. The tests were both negative. I'm worried that I tested too soon and I am still at risk. We had also engaged in unprotected oral both ways. I have a slight heat sensation around the penis head and very subtle heat when urinating - not even really a pain. My questions please are: Did I test too soon and should I test again Is there another explanation for the symptoms Should I take more tests for additional STI's and if so which and when?

It's difficult to know exactly when I contracted it, but my guess is almost two years ago. I had a few instances of mild symptoms consisting of a single itchy lesion which was diagnosed as felicitous on at least 3 different occasions. Finally, the fourth doctor I saw about it said lets do a herpes test just in case... sure enough, the swab test pointed to HSV-2. I was pretty surprised, as every time in the past I had this issue I was given antibiotics and the condition cleared up almost immediately, pointing to a non-viral cause.  Anyway, since my diagnosis I started taking 500mg of valacyclovir once in the morning and once in the evening. I was still experiencing mildish symptoms, so my doctor advised me to take 1500mg/day. Symptoms got a little better, but still there, so I've been taking 1g in the morning and 1g at night (4 500mg pills a day) for about two weeks now. I haven't had any obvious lesions, but I experience tingling/itching throughout the day- sometimes more sometimes less. It's hard to tell if there are lesions present or not- I might think I see a tiny bump at the epicentre of an itchy spot but then I think maybe it's just in my head.  I've done a lot of research about the condition and the way diet can effect it, specifically the relationship between outbreaks and Arginine/Lysine level in the diet. I've been extremely vigilant about trying to eliminate high Arginine food while increasing high Lysine food in my diet, as well as trying to focus on alkalising my body with lemon/baking soda/apple cider vinegar drinks and lots of leafy greens.  However, despite my valacyclovir regiment and healthy diet, I'm still experiencing persistent, though mild, symptoms and naturally it's become extremely frustrating.  I've suffered from cold sores since I was a child, though I haven't had one in over a year, and I understand this is something I will have to deal with for the rest of my life... It would just be nice if it would go away for at least some period of time and I could feel normal for a moment. I could deal with the occasional outbreak, but am I going to have to think about this every day? Thanks for reading- any information/suggestions would be greatly appreciated."

They used to be the worst pain I could've ever imagined, sometimes immobilizing me during really bad attacks. I'd sob and yell and feel so sick, and I can remember the women in the office telling me to ""suck it up"" because I'd be dealing with periods for a long time. At the time, I knew they weren't understanding that I wasn't being a baby. I was in serious distress with unbearable nausea, back-aches, and cramps, and it happened every month like clockwork. I'd been checked for ovarian cysts, but the doctors came up empty handed every time. Every month, I had another week of being told to just deal with it. Now, I'm twenty, almost twenty-one, and now, I know that this was absolutely not ""normal,"" and I was most certainly not being a baby. For about four years, my periods began to calm down. They became much more irregular, but I no longer had the extreme symptoms I'd had early on. Last year, I had the perfect periods. Still a little unpredictable, but only by a couple days at most, manageable pain levels, and significantly less nausea. And then in December of 2015, I began having extreme abdominal pain in my lower right quadrant. After some tests in the ER, they found I had a large cyst on my right ovary, wrote me a prescription for pain medicine, and told me to make a follow up appointment with a gynecologist soon to get it monitored. I asked about surgery and the Nurse Practitioner I had told me I wasn't a candidate. The next day, I went to the gyno and he told me it was too large to go away on it's own and, in fact, would require immediate surgery. The next day, I was in an operating room, having a panic attack as they put me under. After my periods normalized again, I became extremely irregular again. Now, I'm nearly regular, but dealing with the same extreme pain I used to feel as a young teenager, with the difference being it's always isolated to my ovaries. No cramps, just ovarian pain. I spend nights during this pain curled up crying and days wishing it would just be over. During my last period, I went to the doctor and they'd found a ruptured cyst on my left ovary. They told me to get onto birth control to control the cysts. But I've always been wary of hormonal birth control because of side effects. I've had a lot of issues with mental health and do not want to risk the mood effects and weight gain that typically comes with it.

I noticed mine 2yrs ago when I started having palpitations that made me cough. They were not very frequent at that time. I went to see a cardiologist & he had me take a stress test. Everything was fine. Over the next few years the palpitations got more frequent & stronger. I started having chest pressure, frequent heart palpitations (when relaxed they occur about every 3 minutes or so), headaches & chest pain. I went back for another stress test on Tuesday & was told my thoracic aorta was enlarged. The Cardiologist said he would schedule a CTA & a calcium test for me. So far that has not been done. I have been waiting for 3 days now. Should I be concerned? BTW, I don't have high blood pressure. Last time it was taken it was 118/72"

I have however read articles regarding Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder.

Although, she does admit that she constantly preoccupies her thoughts and imagination with the thought of vaginal intercourse and has a hard time thinking about anything else due to a self-described ""addiction"" to this multi-orgasm phenomenon brought on by vaginal coitus. Look, I have researched all over the place trying to look for answers for what she is experiencing besides the idea of just going to therapy for sex addiction.

I just want to know what the F is going on.

After the cooling, rewarming, and sedation wore off, my Mom never woke up. An EEG picked up seizures but was otherwise unresponsive. She was taken off life support and moved to hospice. She died 3 days later. If my Mom was considerably brain dead, what was keeping her alive those last 3 days without a ventilator, etc? Also, a few days before the cardiac arrest she'd had excessive nausea which we both attributed to her colon cancer surgery (she'd had a colon resection 9 months prior) and frequently suffered from chronic pain and nausea. Her lab reports from her stay in CCU last week tell me she was critically low on potassium and magnesium and critically high on calcium, AND tested positive for E. Coli in her urine. She was suffering with pain the last few months of her life (using a walker, too) but had never mentioned chest pains to me. Anytime in the past few years she'd had her heart tested, everything came back healthy. She sometimes had anxiety attacks. I just don't know how this could have happened.

I will continue to read more when I have the time. Most of what I found seemed to show that traditional treatments on their own do not work as well, and present a high probability for reoccurence. I see that the use of vitamin C, as outlined specifically in the first study (try to follow it as they had done in the trials with subjects for an effective outcome) works well, cutting the reoccurence of an outbreak in half. I've outlined the details for instruction of use.  Additionally, the use of traditional medical therapy to treat BV, specifically Metronidazole and Clindamycin, AS WELL AS with alternative therapies seems to show a lot of promise. I've outlined the alternative therapies and everything else in detail.  I really hope this helps! I've been trying to find as many evidence-based studies as I can. Specifically ones that focus on isolating the specific bacteria that's at the source BV, and the biofilm that is the TRUE reason for recurrent outbreaks. I feel very thankful that scientists are actively working to find effective treatment for this problem that supposedly doesn't have a cure. Hope is on the horizon! Proposed BV Treatment options [[My personal notes are in double brackets]] Study name: Efficacy of Vitamin C Vaginal Tablets as Prophylaxis for Recurrent Bacterial Vaginosis: A Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial; Vladislav N. Krasnopolskya, Vera N. Prilepskayab, Franco Polattic, Nina V. Zarochentsevaa, Guldana R. Bayramovab, Maurizio Caserinid, Renata Palmierid, e -Treatment overview during trials: Within 24 hours of cure from a recent episode of BV by metronidazole or clindamycin, implement vitamin C for six consecutive monthly cycles. Each cycle consists of inserting one vaginal tablet for 6 consecutive days during each month following menses [[Use with tampon to keep the vitamin C inside]]. -Tablets are 250mg ascorbic acid [[though many women on various forums have claimed to use 500 mg with success]] in a silicone carrier that ensures prolonged action [[find one without added sugars, such as Twinlab C-500 Caps, Crystalline Vitamin C capsules]]. -[[No statistical significance was noted within the 3-month period, only becoming apparent during month 5. Conclusion was that the regular use of the tablets for the suggested duration following the success of metronidazole treatment reduces the reoccurrence rate from 32.4% to 16.2%.]] “A therapeutic approach in the treatment of BV relapse is to re-establish and maintain the physiological acidity of the vagina, as the growth of anaerobes and other faecal bacteria is inhibited by low pH. Attempts to achieve this via re-colonisation with exogenous lactobacilli have not been successful. Another, more accepted approach is to reduce vaginal pH, in order to create a negative environment for pathogen growth and to achieve long-lasting normalisation of vaginal flora using intravaginal ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The use of antibiotics may induce resistance in the pool of bacteria recognised to cause BV and, conversely, could affect the normal flora of lactobacilli [9], favouring recurrence within a few weeks in over 70% of women taking antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [18]. Ascorbic acid [[250 mg, in a silicone carrier that ensures prolonged action]] plays a vital role in maintaining low vaginal pH values and enhances healing processes in the vaginal ecosystem - recolonisation with lactic acid bacteria. The mechanism of action is simple: through the lowering of vaginal pH to the physiological level of 3.8 - 4.5, anaerobic overgrowth is inhibited and the conditions for the re-growth of physiological lactobacilli flora are re-established. “ “The results of the present study show that 250 mg ascorbic acid vaginal tablets taken 6 days per month safely halves the risk of BV recurrence from 32.4% to 16.2% during a 6-month prophylactic treatment. The O.R. confirms that subjects treated with placebo had a doubled risk of BV recurrence compared with the group of subjects treated with vitamin C. Considering the time to the first BV relapse, treatment of at least five cycles is necessary in order to reduce, at a significant level, the risk of BV recurrence. As this was a prophylaxis study, in women who at the screening visit were healthy and who terminated the study in case of relapse, a between-treatment difference in clinical parameters was not expected. At the same time, differences in pH were not expected but conversely, a reduction in pH was noted for 3-month and 6-month treatment. “ In conclusion, regular use of silicon-coated vitamin C (250 mg) tablets, after the standard antibiotic treatment for BV, protects women by reducing the risk of recurrence probably by re-establishing the normal lactobacilli flora that is able to maintain vaginal pH.” Study name: Bacterial Vaginosis Biofilms: Challenges to Current Therapies and Emerging Solutions; Daniela Machado1, Joana Castro1,2, Ana Palmeira-de-Oliveira3,4, José Martinez-de-Oliveira3,5 and Nuno Cerca1* “Being polymicrobial in nature, BV etiology remains unclear. However, it is certain that BV involves the presence of a thick vaginal multi-species biofilm, where G. vaginalis is the predominant species. Similar to what happens in many other biofilm-related infections, standard antibiotics, like metronidazole, are unable to fully eradicate the vaginal biofilm, which can explain the high recurrence rates of BV. Furthermore, antibiotic therapy can also cause a negative impact on the healthy vaginal microflora. These issues sparked the interest in developing alternative therapeutic strategies. This review provides a quick synopsis of the currently approved and available antibiotics for BV treatment while presenting an overview of novel strategies that are being explored for the treatment of this disorder, with special focus on natural compounds that are able to overcome biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance.” Current available treatments: Metronidazole and clindamycin are shown to be effective against anaerobic microorganisms, though tinidazole was the most recently approved antimicrobial agent for BV treatment, and is considered an alternative antimicrobial agent, particularly whenever metronidazole and clindamycin are unavailable or not tolerated. Being a second generation nitroimidazole with a longer half-life than metronidazole, it requires lower dosages, to be taken less frequently than metronidazole. Although antibiotics are effective against anaerobic microorganisms, the have an inability to completely eradicate the densely-structured polymicrobial BV biofilms-associated bacteria G. Vaginalis. Alternative solutions: Probiotics have been shown to modulate vaginal microbiota”: “In the human vagina, certain Lactobacillus strains can act as probiotics, preventing the growth of BV-associated bacteria through two main mechanisms: the inhibition of pathogens adhesion to vaginal epithelium (Machado et al., 2013); and the production of antimicrobial compounds like hydrogen peroxide (Mastromarino et al., 2002), lactic acid (Boskey et al., 2001) and bacteriocins (Aroutcheva et al., 2001b). Diverse pharmaceutical formulations containing probiotic lactobacilli strains have reduced BV symptoms, improved the vaginal microflora profile, being usually well-tolerated (Rossi et al., 2010;Hantoushzadeh et al., 2012; Facchinetti et al., 2013; Vujic et al., 2013; Vicariotto et al., 2014). “ “In contrast, despite their therapeutic potential, some clinical trials have not detected a significant improvement in BV management (Falagas et al., 2007). Alternatively, probiotics have been proposed as adjuvants to antibiotic therapy [[meaning, using probiotics following the use of antibiotics]]. Several combinations of metronidazole, clindamycin or tinidazole with lactobacilli probiotic preparations have displayed promising results in BV treatment since they have been associated with high cure rates, low recurrence or quick re-establishment of an healthy vaginal microflora (Marcone et al., 2010; Bodean et al., 2013; Recine et al., 2016).” “Probiotics have also been used in an attempt to specifically deal with BV biofilms. Remarkably, in 2007, Saunders and colleagues showed that L. reuteri RC-14 was able to disruptin vitro G. vaginalis biofilms (Saunders et al., 2007). Later, McMillan and colleagues demonstrated that probiotic L. reuteri RC-14 and L. rhamnosus GR-1 were able to incorporate themselves into BV-biofilm, composed by G. vaginalis and A. vaginae, causing both the disruption of the biofilm structure and bacterial cell death (McMillan et al., 2011).

Attempts to achieve this via re-colonisation with exogenous lactobacilli have not been successful. Another, more accepted approach is to reduce vaginal pH, in order to create a negative environment for pathogen growth and to achieve long-lasting normalisation of vaginal flora using intravaginal ascorbic acid (vitamin C).

The O.R. confirms that subjects treated with placebo had a doubled risk of BV recurrence compared with the group of subjects treated with vitamin C. Considering the time to the first BV relapse, treatment of at least five cycles is necessary in order to reduce, at a significant level, the risk of BV recurrence.

At the same time, differences in pH were not expected but conversely, a reduction in pH was noted for 3-month and 6-month treatment. “ In conclusion, regular use of silicon-coated vitamin C (250 mg) tablets, after the standard antibiotic treatment for BV, protects women by reducing the risk of recurrence probably by re-establishing the normal lactobacilli flora that is able to maintain vaginal pH.” Study name: Bacterial Vaginosis Biofilms: Challenges to Current Therapies and Emerging Solutions; Daniela Machado1, Joana Castro1,2, Ana Palmeira-de-Oliveira3,4, José Martinez-de-Oliveira3,5 and Nuno Cerca1* “Being polymicrobial in nature, BV etiology remains unclear. However, it is certain that BV involves the presence of a thick vaginal multi-species biofilm, where G. vaginalis is the predominant species. Similar to what happens in many other biofilm-related infections, standard antibiotics, like metronidazole, are unable to fully eradicate the vaginal biofilm, which can explain the high recurrence rates of BV. Furthermore, antibiotic therapy can also cause a negative impact on the healthy vaginal microflora. These issues sparked the interest in developing alternative therapeutic strategies. This review provides a quick synopsis of the currently approved and available antibiotics for BV treatment while presenting an overview of novel strategies that are being explored for the treatment of this disorder, with special focus on natural compounds that are able to overcome biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance.” Current available treatments: Metronidazole and clindamycin are shown to be effective against anaerobic microorganisms, though tinidazole was the most recently approved antimicrobial agent for BV treatment, and is considered an alternative antimicrobial agent, particularly whenever metronidazole and clindamycin are unavailable or not tolerated. Being a second generation nitroimidazole with a longer half-life than metronidazole, it requires lower dosages, to be taken less frequently than metronidazole. Although antibiotics are effective against anaerobic microorganisms, the have an inability to completely eradicate the densely-structured polymicrobial BV biofilms-associated bacteria G. Vaginalis. Alternative solutions: Probiotics have been shown to modulate vaginal microbiota”: “In the human vagina, certain Lactobacillus strains can act as probiotics, preventing the growth of BV-associated bacteria through two main mechanisms: the inhibition of pathogens adhesion to vaginal epithelium (Machado et al., 2013); and the production of antimicrobial compounds like hydrogen peroxide (Mastromarino et al., 2002), lactic acid (Boskey et al., 2001) and bacteriocins (Aroutcheva et al., 2001b). Diverse pharmaceutical formulations containing probiotic lactobacilli strains have reduced BV symptoms, improved the vaginal microflora profile, being usually well-tolerated (Rossi et al., 2010;Hantoushzadeh et al., 2012; Facchinetti et al., 2013; Vujic et al., 2013; Vicariotto et al., 2014). “ “In contrast, despite their therapeutic potential, some clinical trials have not detected a significant improvement in BV management (Falagas et al., 2007). Alternatively, probiotics have been proposed as adjuvants to antibiotic therapy [[meaning, using probiotics following the use of antibiotics]]. Several combinations of metronidazole, clindamycin or tinidazole with lactobacilli probiotic preparations have displayed promising results in BV treatment since they have been associated with high cure rates, low recurrence or quick re-establishment of an healthy vaginal microflora (Marcone et al., 2010; Bodean et al., 2013; Recine et al., 2016).” “Probiotics have also been used in an attempt to specifically deal with BV biofilms.

At the same time, differences in pH were not expected but conversely, a reduction in pH was noted for 3-month and 6-month treatment. “ In conclusion, regular use of silicon-coated vitamin C (250 mg) tablets, after the standard antibiotic treatment for BV, protects women by reducing the risk of recurrence probably by re-establishing the normal lactobacilli flora that is able to maintain vaginal pH.” Study name: Bacterial Vaginosis Biofilms: Challenges to Current Therapies and Emerging Solutions; Daniela Machado1, Joana Castro1,2, Ana Palmeira-de-Oliveira3,4, José Martinez-de-Oliveira3,5 and Nuno Cerca1* “Being polymicrobial in nature, BV etiology remains unclear. However, it is certain that BV involves the presence of a thick vaginal multi-species biofilm, where G. vaginalis is the predominant species. Similar to what happens in many other biofilm-related infections, standard antibiotics, like metronidazole, are unable to fully eradicate the vaginal biofilm, which can explain the high recurrence rates of BV. Furthermore, antibiotic therapy can also cause a negative impact on the healthy vaginal microflora. These issues sparked the interest in developing alternative therapeutic strategies. This review provides a quick synopsis of the currently approved and available antibiotics for BV treatment while presenting an overview of novel strategies that are being explored for the treatment of this disorder, with special focus on natural compounds that are able to overcome biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance.” Current available treatments: Metronidazole and clindamycin are shown to be effective against anaerobic microorganisms, though tinidazole was the most recently approved antimicrobial agent for BV treatment, and is considered an alternative antimicrobial agent, particularly whenever metronidazole and clindamycin are unavailable or not tolerated. Being a second generation nitroimidazole with a longer half-life than metronidazole, it requires lower dosages, to be taken less frequently than metronidazole. Although antibiotics are effective against anaerobic microorganisms, the have an inability to completely eradicate the densely-structured polymicrobial BV biofilms-associated bacteria G. Vaginalis. Alternative solutions: Probiotics have been shown to modulate vaginal microbiota”: “In the human vagina, certain Lactobacillus strains can act as probiotics, preventing the growth of BV-associated bacteria through two main mechanisms: the inhibition of pathogens adhesion to vaginal epithelium (Machado et al., 2013); and the production of antimicrobial compounds like hydrogen peroxide (Mastromarino et al., 2002), lactic acid (Boskey et al., 2001) and bacteriocins (Aroutcheva et al., 2001b). Diverse pharmaceutical formulations containing probiotic lactobacilli strains have reduced BV symptoms, improved the vaginal microflora profile, being usually well-tolerated (Rossi et al., 2010;Hantoushzadeh et al., 2012; Facchinetti et al., 2013; Vujic et al., 2013; Vicariotto et al., 2014). “ “In contrast, despite their therapeutic potential, some clinical trials have not detected a significant improvement in BV management (Falagas et al., 2007). Alternatively, probiotics have been proposed as adjuvants to antibiotic therapy [[meaning, using probiotics following the use of antibiotics]]. Several combinations of metronidazole, clindamycin or tinidazole with lactobacilli probiotic preparations have displayed promising results in BV treatment since they have been associated with high cure rates, low recurrence or quick re-establishment of an healthy vaginal microflora (Marcone et al., 2010; Bodean et al., 2013; Recine et al., 2016).” “Probiotics have also been used in an attempt to specifically deal with BV biofilms. Remarkably, in 2007, Saunders and colleagues showed that L. reuteri RC-14 was able to disruptin vitro G. vaginalis biofilms (Saunders et al., 2007). Later, McMillan and colleagues demonstrated that probiotic L. reuteri RC-14 and L. rhamnosus GR-1 were able to incorporate themselves into BV-biofilm, composed by G. vaginalis and A. vaginae, causing both the disruption of the biofilm structure and bacterial cell death (McMillan et al., 2011). These findings provide some evidence of how lactobacilli probiotics might interfere with an abnormal vaginal microflora, reinforcing the hypothesis that probiotics could eradicate vaginal pathogenic biofilms and restore the normal microflora in in vivo situations.” “It has also been proposed that prebiotics [[such as the product Multigyn FloraPlus]], nutritional substances that stimulate the growth of probiotics, could be used as alternative to treat BV (Roberfroid, 2007). Interestingly, Rousseau and colleagues demonstrated that prebiotic preparations containing oligosaccharides were able to promote the growth of beneficial lactobacilli strains but not of the pathogenic microorganisms often found in urogenital infections including G. vaginalis (Rousseau et al., 2005). “ “Later, Zeng and colleagues compared the efficacy of a prebiotic gel containing sucrose with 0.75% metronidazole vaginal gel to treat BV (Zeng et al., 2010). In that study, the prebiotic gel displayed a similar therapeutic cure rate to metronidazole, having a major advantage of quicker restoration of the normal vaginal microflora. Recently, Coste and colleagues evaluated the efficacy and safety of another prebiotic gel, applied as adjuvant therapy [[combined with antibiotic treatment]], in women treated for BV and showed an improved recovery of the normal vaginal flora, reducing the risk of recurrences (Coste et al., 2012). Plant-derived compounds: “Surprisingly, up to now only one study evaluated the capability of plant-derived compound to eradicate BV biofilms. Interestingly, Braga and colleagues showed that thymol, a molecule present in thyme essential oil, had an inhibitory effect upon both newly formed and mature G. vaginalis biofilms, which supports the importance of exploring essential oils and their main constituents as therapeutic alternative to treat BV (Braga et al., 2010). Furthermore, the expectations on essential oils as effective agents against BV-biofilms can be inferred from studies in other related vaginal biofilms (Palmeira-de-Oliveira et al., 2012; Bogavac et al., 2015).” [[The suggested delivery was through douche]]. Acidifying/buffering agents: -“Recently, Bahamondes and colleagues verified that a soap containing lactic acid and lactoserum could be used for external intimate hygiene, reducing BV recurrence after treatment with oral metronidazole (Bahamondes et al., 2011). “ -“Interestingly, vitamin C, when coated with silicon, allowed the constant release of the active agent, resulting in a long-lasting vaginal low pH and prevention of vaginal irritation (Polatti et al., 2006). Other studies reported an effective and safe use of vaginal vitamin C tablets in BV treatment (Petersen et al., 2011), contributing to improve abnormal vaginal pH and microflora, especially in pregnant women (Zodzika et al., 2013). Additionally, the regular use of vitamin C during 6 days per month, for 6 months after successful BV treatment, was shown to decrease the risk of BV recurrence (Krasnopolsky et al., 2013).  -“Another alternative comes in the form of buffering agents. Polycarbophil [[like the product Replens]] is a weak poly-acid that it is able to adhere to vaginal epithelial cells, acting as a buffer in the vaginal secretions (Milani et al., 2000). “ -“Another agent that has been long used in the treatment of vaginal infections is boric acid (Van Slyke et al., 1981) [[This could be the 600 mg tablets from brands pH-D, BoriCap, Bona Dea, or Boric Balance as of a recent Google search]]. Recently, Reichman and colleagues reported that the use of boric acid in combination with a nitroimidazole reduce the BV recurrence (Reichman et al., 2009), suggesting a potential impact on BV biofilms. However, this need to be further studied and in vitro biofilm experiments will elucidate the role of boric acid in BV prevention.” Conclusions and future directions: BV current approved therapies are not sufficient to deal with this multi-species biofilm-related vaginal disorder. Future, research should address biofilm communities with a particular emphasis on multi-species biofilms, a topic that only recently emerged (Castro and Cerca, 2015). By properly addressing the complex interactions established in multi-species biofilms, novel strategies will hopefully overcome the high recurrence and relapse rates associated with BV."

Bayramovab, Maurizio Caserinid, Renata Palmierid, e -Treatment overview during trials: Within 24 hours of cure from a recent episode of BV by metronidazole or clindamycin, implement vitamin C for six consecutive monthly cycles. Each cycle consists of inserting one vaginal tablet for 6 consecutive days during each month following menses [[Use with tampon to keep the vitamin C inside]]. -Tablets are 250mg ascorbic acid [[though many women on various forums have claimed to use 500 mg with success]] in a silicone carrier that ensures prolonged action [[find one without added sugars, such as Twinlab C-500 Caps, Crystalline Vitamin C capsules]]. -[[No statistical significance was noted within the 3-month period, only becoming apparent during month 5. Conclusion was that the regular use of the tablets for the suggested duration following the success of metronidazole treatment reduces the reoccurrence rate from 32.4% to 16.2%.]] “A therapeutic approach in the treatment of BV relapse is to re-establish and maintain the physiological acidity of the vagina, as the growth of anaerobes and other faecal bacteria is inhibited by low pH. Attempts to achieve this via re-colonisation with exogenous lactobacilli have not been successful. Another, more accepted approach is to reduce vaginal pH, in order to create a negative environment for pathogen growth and to achieve long-lasting normalisation of vaginal flora using intravaginal ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The use of antibiotics may induce resistance in the pool of bacteria recognised to cause BV and, conversely, could affect the normal flora of lactobacilli [9], favouring recurrence within a few weeks in over 70% of women taking antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [18]. Ascorbic acid [[250 mg, in a silicone carrier that ensures prolonged action]] plays a vital role in maintaining low vaginal pH values and enhances healing processes in the vaginal ecosystem - recolonisation with lactic acid bacteria. The mechanism of action is simple: through the lowering of vaginal pH to the physiological level of 3.8 - 4.5, anaerobic overgrowth is inhibited and the conditions for the re-growth of physiological lactobacilli flora are re-established. “ “The results of the present study show that 250 mg ascorbic acid vaginal tablets taken 6 days per month safely halves the risk of BV recurrence from 32.4% to 16.2% during a 6-month prophylactic treatment. The O.R. confirms that subjects treated with placebo had a doubled risk of BV recurrence compared with the group of subjects treated with vitamin C.

Proposed BV Treatment options [[My personal notes are in double brackets]] Study name: Efficacy of Vitamin C Vaginal Tablets as Prophylaxis for Recurrent Bacterial Vaginosis: A Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial; Vladislav N. Krasnopolskya, Vera N. Prilepskayab, Franco Polattic, Nina V. Zarochentsevaa, Guldana R. Bayramovab, Maurizio Caserinid, Renata Palmierid, e -Treatment overview during trials: Within 24 hours of cure from a recent episode of BV by metronidazole or clindamycin, implement vitamin C for six consecutive monthly cycles. Each cycle consists of inserting one vaginal tablet for 6 consecutive days during each month following menses [[Use with tampon to keep the vitamin C inside]]. -Tablets are 250mg ascorbic acid [[though many women on various forums have claimed to use 500 mg with success]] in a silicone carrier that ensures prolonged action [[find one without added sugars, such as Twinlab C-500 Caps, Crystalline Vitamin C capsules]]. -[[No statistical significance was noted within the 3-month period, only becoming apparent during month 5. Conclusion was that the regular use of the tablets for the suggested duration following the success of metronidazole treatment reduces the reoccurrence rate from 32.4% to 16.2%.]] “A therapeutic approach in the treatment of BV relapse is to re-establish and maintain the physiological acidity of the vagina, as the growth of anaerobes and other faecal bacteria is inhibited by low pH. Attempts to achieve this via re-colonisation with exogenous lactobacilli have not been successful. Another, more accepted approach is to reduce vaginal pH, in order to create a negative environment for pathogen growth and to achieve long-lasting normalisation of vaginal flora using intravaginal ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The use of antibiotics may induce resistance in the pool of bacteria recognised to cause BV and, conversely, could affect the normal flora of lactobacilli [9], favouring recurrence within a few weeks in over 70% of women taking antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [18]. Ascorbic acid [[250 mg, in a silicone carrier that ensures prolonged action]] plays a vital role in maintaining low vaginal pH values and enhances healing processes in the vaginal ecosystem - recolonisation with lactic acid bacteria. The mechanism of action is simple: through the lowering of vaginal pH to the physiological level of 3.8 - 4.5, anaerobic overgrowth is inhibited and the conditions for the re-growth of physiological lactobacilli flora are re-established. “ “The results of the present study show that 250 mg ascorbic acid vaginal tablets taken 6 days per month safely halves the risk of BV recurrence from 32.4% to 16.2% during a 6-month prophylactic treatment. The O.R. confirms that subjects treated with placebo had a doubled risk of BV recurrence compared with the group of subjects treated with vitamin C. Considering the time to the first BV relapse, treatment of at least five cycles is necessary in order to reduce, at a significant level, the risk of BV recurrence. As this was a prophylaxis study, in women who at the screening visit were healthy and who terminated the study in case of relapse, a between-treatment difference in clinical parameters was not expected. At the same time, differences in pH were not expected but conversely, a reduction in pH was noted for 3-month and 6-month treatment. “ In conclusion, regular use of silicon-coated vitamin C (250 mg) tablets, after the standard antibiotic treatment for BV, protects women by reducing the risk of recurrence probably by re-establishing the normal lactobacilli flora that is able to maintain vaginal pH.” Study name: Bacterial Vaginosis Biofilms: Challenges to Current Therapies and Emerging Solutions; Daniela Machado1, Joana Castro1,2, Ana Palmeira-de-Oliveira3,4, José Martinez-de-Oliveira3,5 and Nuno Cerca1* “Being polymicrobial in nature, BV etiology remains unclear. However, it is certain that BV involves the presence of a thick vaginal multi-species biofilm, where G. vaginalis is the predominant species. Similar to what happens in many other biofilm-related infections, standard antibiotics, like metronidazole, are unable to fully eradicate the vaginal biofilm, which can explain the high recurrence rates of BV. Furthermore, antibiotic therapy can also cause a negative impact on the healthy vaginal microflora. These issues sparked the interest in developing alternative therapeutic strategies. This review provides a quick synopsis of the currently approved and available antibiotics for BV treatment while presenting an overview of novel strategies that are being explored for the treatment of this disorder, with special focus on natural compounds that are able to overcome biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance.” Current available treatments: Metronidazole and clindamycin are shown to be effective against anaerobic microorganisms, though tinidazole was the most recently approved antimicrobial agent for BV treatment, and is considered an alternative antimicrobial agent, particularly whenever metronidazole and clindamycin are unavailable or not tolerated. Being a second generation nitroimidazole with a longer half-life than metronidazole, it requires lower dosages, to be taken less frequently than metronidazole. Although antibiotics are effective against anaerobic microorganisms, the have an inability to completely eradicate the densely-structured polymicrobial BV biofilms-associated bacteria G. Vaginalis. Alternative solutions: Probiotics have been shown to modulate vaginal microbiota”: “In the human vagina, certain Lactobacillus strains can act as probiotics, preventing the growth of BV-associated bacteria through two main mechanisms: the inhibition of pathogens adhesion to vaginal epithelium (Machado et al., 2013); and the production of antimicrobial compounds like hydrogen peroxide (Mastromarino et al., 2002), lactic acid (Boskey et al., 2001) and bacteriocins (Aroutcheva et al., 2001b). Diverse pharmaceutical formulations containing probiotic lactobacilli strains have reduced BV symptoms, improved the vaginal microflora profile, being usually well-tolerated (Rossi et al., 2010;Hantoushzadeh et al., 2012; Facchinetti et al., 2013; Vujic et al., 2013; Vicariotto et al., 2014). “ “In contrast, despite their therapeutic potential, some clinical trials have not detected a significant improvement in BV management (Falagas et al., 2007). Alternatively, probiotics have been proposed as adjuvants to antibiotic therapy [[meaning, using probiotics following the use of antibiotics]]. Several combinations of metronidazole, clindamycin or tinidazole with lactobacilli probiotic preparations have displayed promising results in BV treatment since they have been associated with high cure rates, low recurrence or quick re-establishment of an healthy vaginal microflora (Marcone et al., 2010; Bodean et al., 2013; Recine et al., 2016).” “Probiotics have also been used in an attempt to specifically deal with BV biofilms. Remarkably, in 2007, Saunders and colleagues showed that L. reuteri RC-14 was able to disruptin vitro G. vaginalis biofilms (Saunders et al., 2007). Later, McMillan and colleagues demonstrated that probiotic L. reuteri RC-14 and L. rhamnosus GR-1 were able to incorporate themselves into BV-biofilm, composed by G. vaginalis and A. vaginae, causing both the disruption of the biofilm structure and bacterial cell death (McMillan et al., 2011). These findings provide some evidence of how lactobacilli probiotics might interfere with an abnormal vaginal microflora, reinforcing the hypothesis that probiotics could eradicate vaginal pathogenic biofilms and restore the normal microflora in in vivo situations.” “It has also been proposed that prebiotics [[such as the product Multigyn FloraPlus]], nutritional substances that stimulate the growth of probiotics, could be used as alternative to treat BV (Roberfroid, 2007). Interestingly, Rousseau and colleagues demonstrated that prebiotic preparations containing oligosaccharides were able to promote the growth of beneficial lactobacilli strains but not of the pathogenic microorganisms often found in urogenital infections including G. vaginalis (Rousseau et al., 2005). “ “Later, Zeng and colleagues compared the efficacy of a prebiotic gel containing sucrose with 0.75% metronidazole vaginal gel to treat BV (Zeng et al., 2010). In that study, the prebiotic gel displayed a similar therapeutic cure rate to metronidazole, having a major advantage of quicker restoration of the normal vaginal microflora. Recently, Coste and colleagues evaluated the efficacy and safety of another prebiotic gel, applied as adjuvant therapy [[combined with antibiotic treatment]], in women treated for BV and showed an improved recovery of the normal vaginal flora, reducing the risk of recurrences (Coste et al., 2012). Plant-derived compounds: “Surprisingly, up to now only one study evaluated the capability of plant-derived compound to eradicate BV biofilms. Interestingly, Braga and colleagues showed that thymol, a molecule present in thyme essential oil, had an inhibitory effect upon both newly formed and mature G. vaginalis biofilms, which supports the importance of exploring essential oils and their main constituents as therapeutic alternative to treat BV (Braga et al., 2010). Furthermore, the expectations on essential oils as effective agents against BV-biofilms can be inferred from studies in other related vaginal biofilms (Palmeira-de-Oliveira et al., 2012; Bogavac et al., 2015).” [[The suggested delivery was through douche]]. Acidifying/buffering agents: -“Recently, Bahamondes and colleagues verified that a soap containing lactic acid and lactoserum could be used for external intimate hygiene, reducing BV recurrence after treatment with oral metronidazole (Bahamondes et al., 2011). “ -“Interestingly, vitamin C, when coated with silicon, allowed the constant release of the active agent, resulting in a long-lasting vaginal low pH and prevention of vaginal irritation (Polatti et al., 2006). Other studies reported an effective and safe use of vaginal vitamin C tablets in BV treatment (Petersen et al., 2011), contributing to improve abnormal vaginal pH and microflora, especially in pregnant women (Zodzika et al., 2013). Additionally, the regular use of vitamin C during 6 days per month, for 6 months after successful BV treatment, was shown to decrease the risk of BV recurrence (Krasnopolsky et al., 2013).  -“Another alternative comes in the form of buffering agents. Polycarbophil [[like the product Replens]] is a weak poly-acid that it is able to adhere to vaginal epithelial cells, acting as a buffer in the vaginal secretions (Milani et al., 2000). “ -“Another agent that has been long used in the treatment of vaginal infections is boric acid (Van Slyke et al., 1981) [[This could be the 600 mg tablets from brands pH-D, BoriCap, Bona Dea, or Boric Balance as of a recent Google search]]. Recently, Reichman and colleagues reported that the use of boric acid in combination with a nitroimidazole reduce the BV recurrence (Reichman et al., 2009), suggesting a potential impact on BV biofilms. However, this need to be further studied and in vitro biofilm experiments will elucidate the role of boric acid in BV prevention.” Conclusions and future directions: BV current approved therapies are not sufficient to deal with this multi-species biofilm-related vaginal disorder. Future, research should address biofilm communities with a particular emphasis on multi-species biofilms, a topic that only recently emerged (Castro and Cerca, 2015). By properly addressing the complex interactions established in multi-species biofilms, novel strategies will hopefully overcome the high recurrence and relapse rates associated with BV."

Interestingly, Braga and colleagues showed that thymol, a molecule present in thyme essential oil, had an inhibitory effect upon both newly formed and mature G. vaginalis biofilms, which supports the importance of exploring essential oils and their main constituents as therapeutic alternative to treat BV (Braga et al., 2010). Furthermore, the expectations on essential oils as effective agents against BV-biofilms can be inferred from studies in other related vaginal biofilms (Palmeira-de-Oliveira et al., 2012; Bogavac et al., 2015).” [[The suggested delivery was through douche]]. Acidifying/buffering agents: -“Recently, Bahamondes and colleagues verified that a soap containing lactic acid and lactoserum could be used for external intimate hygiene, reducing BV recurrence after treatment with oral metronidazole (Bahamondes et al., 2011). “ -“Interestingly, vitamin C, when coated with silicon, allowed the constant release of the active agent, resulting in a long-lasting vaginal low pH and prevention of vaginal irritation (Polatti et al., 2006). Other studies reported an effective and safe use of vaginal vitamin C tablets in BV treatment (Petersen et al., 2011), contributing to improve abnormal vaginal pH and microflora, especially in pregnant women (Zodzika et al., 2013). Additionally, the regular use of vitamin C during 6 days per month, for 6 months after successful BV treatment, was shown to decrease the risk of BV recurrence (Krasnopolsky et al., 2013).  -“Another alternative comes in the form of buffering agents. Polycarbophil [[like the product Replens]] is a weak poly-acid that it is able to adhere to vaginal epithelial cells, acting as a buffer in the vaginal secretions (Milani et al., 2000). “ -“Another agent that has been long used in the treatment of vaginal infections is boric acid (Van Slyke et al., 1981) [[This could be the 600 mg tablets from brands pH-D, BoriCap, Bona Dea, or Boric Balance as of a recent Google search]]. Recently, Reichman and colleagues reported that the use of boric acid in combination with a nitroimidazole reduce the BV recurrence (Reichman et al., 2009), suggesting a potential impact on BV biofilms. However, this need to be further studied and in vitro biofilm experiments will elucidate the role of boric acid in BV prevention.” Conclusions and future directions: BV current approved therapies are not sufficient to deal with this multi-species biofilm-related vaginal disorder. Future, research should address biofilm communities with a particular emphasis on multi-species biofilms, a topic that only recently emerged (Castro and Cerca, 2015). By properly addressing the complex interactions established in multi-species biofilms, novel strategies will hopefully overcome the high recurrence and relapse rates associated with BV."

I will continue to read more when I have the time. Most of what I found seemed to show that traditional treatments on their own do not work as well, and present a high probability for reoccurence. I see that the use of vitamin C, as outlined specifically in the first study (try to follow it as they had done in the trials with subjects for an effective outcome) works well, cutting the reoccurence of an outbreak in half. I've outlined the details for instruction of use.  Additionally, the use of traditional medical therapy to treat BV, specifically Metronidazole and Clindamycin, AS WELL AS with alternative therapies seems to show a lot of promise. I've outlined the alternative therapies and everything else in detail.  I really hope this helps! I've been trying to find as many evidence-based studies as I can. Specifically ones that focus on isolating the specific bacteria that's at the source BV, and the biofilm that is the TRUE reason for recurrent outbreaks. I feel very thankful that scientists are actively working to find effective treatment for this problem that supposedly doesn't have a cure. Hope is on the horizon! Proposed BV Treatment options [[My personal notes are in double brackets]] Study name: Efficacy of Vitamin C Vaginal Tablets as Prophylaxis for Recurrent Bacterial Vaginosis: A Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial; Vladislav N. Krasnopolskya, Vera N. Prilepskayab, Franco Polattic, Nina V. Zarochentsevaa, Guldana R. Bayramovab, Maurizio Caserinid, Renata Palmierid, e -Treatment overview during trials: Within 24 hours of cure from a recent episode of BV by metronidazole or clindamycin, implement vitamin C for six consecutive monthly cycles. Each cycle consists of inserting one vaginal tablet for 6 consecutive days during each month following menses [[Use with tampon to keep the vitamin C inside]]. -Tablets are 250mg ascorbic acid [[though many women on various forums have claimed to use 500 mg with success]] in a silicone carrier that ensures prolonged action [[find one without added sugars, such as Twinlab C-500 Caps, Crystalline Vitamin C capsules]]. -[[No statistical significance was noted within the 3-month period, only becoming apparent during month 5. Conclusion was that the regular use of the tablets for the suggested duration following the success of metronidazole treatment reduces the reoccurrence rate from 32.4% to 16.2%.]] “A therapeutic approach in the treatment of BV relapse is to re-establish and maintain the physiological acidity of the vagina, as the growth of anaerobes and other faecal bacteria is inhibited by low pH. Attempts to achieve this via re-colonisation with exogenous lactobacilli have not been successful. Another, more accepted approach is to reduce vaginal pH, in order to create a negative environment for pathogen growth and to achieve long-lasting normalisation of vaginal flora using intravaginal ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The use of antibiotics may induce resistance in the pool of bacteria recognised to cause BV and, conversely, could affect the normal flora of lactobacilli [9], favouring recurrence within a few weeks in over 70% of women taking antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [18]. Ascorbic acid [[250 mg, in a silicone carrier that ensures prolonged action]] plays a vital role in maintaining low vaginal pH values and enhances healing processes in the vaginal ecosystem - recolonisation with lactic acid bacteria. The mechanism of action is simple: through the lowering of vaginal pH to the physiological level of 3.8 - 4.5, anaerobic overgrowth is inhibited and the conditions for the re-growth of physiological lactobacilli flora are re-established. “ “The results of the present study show that 250 mg ascorbic acid vaginal tablets taken 6 days per month safely halves the risk of BV recurrence from 32.4% to 16.2% during a 6-month prophylactic treatment. The O.R. confirms that subjects treated with placebo had a doubled risk of BV recurrence compared with the group of subjects treated with vitamin C. Considering the time to the first BV relapse, treatment of at least five cycles is necessary in order to reduce, at a significant level, the risk of BV recurrence. As this was a prophylaxis study, in women who at the screening visit were healthy and who terminated the study in case of relapse, a between-treatment difference in clinical parameters was not expected. At the same time, differences in pH were not expected but conversely, a reduction in pH was noted for 3-month and 6-month treatment. “ In conclusion, regular use of silicon-coated vitamin C (250 mg) tablets, after the standard antibiotic treatment for BV, protects women by reducing the risk of recurrence probably by re-establishing the normal lactobacilli flora that is able to maintain vaginal pH.” Study name: Bacterial Vaginosis Biofilms: Challenges to Current Therapies and Emerging Solutions; Daniela Machado1, Joana Castro1,2, Ana Palmeira-de-Oliveira3,4, José Martinez-de-Oliveira3,5 and Nuno Cerca1* “Being polymicrobial in nature, BV etiology remains unclear. However, it is certain that BV involves the presence of a thick vaginal multi-species biofilm, where G. vaginalis is the predominant species. Similar to what happens in many other biofilm-related infections, standard antibiotics, like metronidazole, are unable to fully eradicate the vaginal biofilm, which can explain the high recurrence rates of BV. Furthermore, antibiotic therapy can also cause a negative impact on the healthy vaginal microflora. These issues sparked the interest in developing alternative therapeutic strategies. This review provides a quick synopsis of the currently approved and available antibiotics for BV treatment while presenting an overview of novel strategies that are being explored for the treatment of this disorder, with special focus on natural compounds that are able to overcome biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance.” Current available treatments: Metronidazole and clindamycin are shown to be effective against anaerobic microorganisms, though tinidazole was the most recently approved antimicrobial agent for BV treatment, and is considered an alternative antimicrobial agent, particularly whenever metronidazole and clindamycin are unavailable or not tolerated. Being a second generation nitroimidazole with a longer half-life than metronidazole, it requires lower dosages, to be taken less frequently than metronidazole. Although antibiotics are effective against anaerobic microorganisms, the have an inability to completely eradicate the densely-structured polymicrobial BV biofilms-associated bacteria G. Vaginalis. Alternative solutions: Probiotics have been shown to modulate vaginal microbiota”: “In the human vagina, certain Lactobacillus strains can act as probiotics, preventing the growth of BV-associated bacteria through two main mechanisms: the inhibition of pathogens adhesion to vaginal epithelium (Machado et al., 2013); and the production of antimicrobial compounds like hydrogen peroxide (Mastromarino et al., 2002), lactic acid (Boskey et al., 2001) and bacteriocins (Aroutcheva et al., 2001b). Diverse pharmaceutical formulations containing probiotic lactobacilli strains have reduced BV symptoms, improved the vaginal microflora profile, being usually well-tolerated (Rossi et al., 2010;Hantoushzadeh et al., 2012; Facchinetti et al., 2013; Vujic et al., 2013; Vicariotto et al., 2014). “ “In contrast, despite their therapeutic potential, some clinical trials have not detected a significant improvement in BV management (Falagas et al., 2007). Alternatively, probiotics have been proposed as adjuvants to antibiotic therapy [[meaning, using probiotics following the use of antibiotics]]. Several combinations of metronidazole, clindamycin or tinidazole with lactobacilli probiotic preparations have displayed promising results in BV treatment since they have been associated with high cure rates, low recurrence or quick re-establishment of an healthy vaginal microflora (Marcone et al., 2010; Bodean et al., 2013; Recine et al., 2016).” “Probiotics have also been used in an attempt to specifically deal with BV biofilms. Remarkably, in 2007, Saunders and colleagues showed that L. reuteri RC-14 was able to disruptin vitro G. vaginalis biofilms (Saunders et al., 2007). Later, McMillan and colleagues demonstrated that probiotic L. reuteri RC-14 and L. rhamnosus GR-1 were able to incorporate themselves into BV-biofilm, composed by G. vaginalis and A. vaginae, causing both the disruption of the biofilm structure and bacterial cell death (McMillan et al., 2011). These findings provide some evidence of how lactobacilli probiotics might interfere with an abnormal vaginal microflora, reinforcing the hypothesis that probiotics could eradicate vaginal pathogenic biofilms and restore the normal microflora in in vivo situations.” “It has also been proposed that prebiotics [[such as the product Multigyn FloraPlus]], nutritional substances that stimulate the growth of probiotics, could be used as alternative to treat BV (Roberfroid, 2007). Interestingly, Rousseau and colleagues demonstrated that prebiotic preparations containing oligosaccharides were able to promote the growth of beneficial lactobacilli strains but not of the pathogenic microorganisms often found in urogenital infections including G. vaginalis (Rousseau et al., 2005). “ “Later, Zeng and colleagues compared the efficacy of a prebiotic gel containing sucrose with 0.75% metronidazole vaginal gel to treat BV (Zeng et al., 2010). In that study, the prebiotic gel displayed a similar therapeutic cure rate to metronidazole, having a major advantage of quicker restoration of the normal vaginal microflora. Recently, Coste and colleagues evaluated the efficacy and safety of another prebiotic gel, applied as adjuvant therapy [[combined with antibiotic treatment]], in women treated for BV and showed an improved recovery of the normal vaginal flora, reducing the risk of recurrences (Coste et al., 2012). Plant-derived compounds: “Surprisingly, up to now only one study evaluated the capability of plant-derived compound to eradicate BV biofilms.

I have only had two outbreaks in the last three years (from what I know now I was misdiagnosed years ago when I had an initial outbreak and by a dermatologist of all people!) and he used having 6 outbreaks a year as a baseline of whether or not I would need daily suppressive therapy. I pressed him on this further with my concern of transmission to another person as my outbreaks are few and far between and are very mild (at least I can be thankful for that). I was told that as long as I'm using condoms and abstaining when I have outbreaks that I wont transmit it. I didn't feel like arguing with him and I sort of don't feel like I should argue with an experienced medical professional, but I thought this was how the medical community used to handle this (maybe around the 80's and 90's) until they better understood how often shedding occurred. From just about everything I've read that just doesn't seem true and condoms only protect the area they cover leaving everything else vulnerable to transmission. I know even with condoms and medication it is still possible, but the risk is greatly reduced. Does the advice I was given seem out of touch? The only other conclusion I can try to grasp is that because I have such infrequent outbreaks I don't shed as much or there is less of a risk? I have yet to read anything that would back that up. If it does seem off I don't feel like I can tell my doctor to prescribe me more for daily suppressant or that I disagree with his medical advice. Do I go to different doctor and try to explain this or a family planning center? It's such a pain to establish with another doctor and I feel like a dick telling him I think he's not giving me the best info. I was really hoping to feel less burdened by this disease today, but this took the wind out of my sails. I just don't feel that I would be giving a potential future partner the best scenario to prevent infection and makes me feel less confident in putting myself back out there. Do you think going to a family planning center would be better or they would understand where I'm coming from and suggest daily therapy? It seems like they deal with sti's more directly and could be more knowledgeable."

She uses the birth control patch but she has used the pill in the past and had the same issue. Her doctor has done blood tests and an ultrasound but they could never diagnose the problem. I'm looking for any suggestion to help figure out how to control this bleeding so this doesn't ruin our relationship.

It doesn't happen everytime, but more often then not, I will bleed while having sex.  We've been somewhat rough at times, but again, it doesn't consistently happen, so I don't know if that's the cause. I don't feel any pain or discomfort and can never tell when it's happening. I have been to my doctor twice now - back in May and about 2 weeks ago. She has done a Pap both times, both which came back normal. Also was tested for STDs, that all came back negative, as well Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida species, and Trichomonas vaginalis by DNA Probe (not entirely sure what those are) but again, all came back negative.  She did mention that my cervix was inflammed, but couldn't give me an exact reason why. During both of my Pap smears, I started bleeding as well; which she mentioned isnt abnormal. But knowing that I've experienced bleeding during sex as well as the Pap smear, I wasn't sure if there could be a common denominator between them? She said a little blood during a pap isn't uncommon, and said something about the lining being thin?  With that being said, after going to the doctors twice, I still don't have an answer as to why this is happening and what the next steps I should be taking are. I've read what I feel like is every article out there as to what it could be, but would appreciate any advice or suggestions if you've gone through something similar or have any idea what could be going on.

He has a bad immune system and is older so he often has breakouts and generally always has some kinds of sores on his face.

One is that herpes cannot live on dead surfaces for more than 10 seconds, but I've also read it can live on non porous solid objects for 4-8 hours (like a faucet) and wet cloth for 2-4 hours and dry cloth for 15 minutes. Not sure what to go by and what my risk is considering it was a wet solid object and I immediately stuck my finger in my eye but it was an hour after the sink was last used. I don't want to make him feel bad about it so I don't bring it up but I'm crashing here for a little bit and when things like this occur I worry about transmission. It's not usually the first thing on my mind though so I do things like shut off the faucet and then rub my eyes thinking, 'oh, i just washed my hands so they're clean and I can clean my eyes,' and then start to worry ten minutes later realizing I didn't do the most sanitary thing and could have exposed myself to it."

I am just asking if this would be a situation to go into the doctor about or what I should do. A little background is that both of my parents have atrial fibrillation, not sure if this is the same thing. A little bit a go I was just sitting on the couch and felt my heart racing like crazy and I felt a little off, so I checked my pulse and it was 125 and I thought that was odd so I took a drink of water and then started to feel light headed and weird and checked my pulse again and it was 54. After that I laid back down because I just felt ""off"" I could feel my heart start racing again and had the high pulse, my legs felt a little tingly and it was a little bit hard to catch my breath. Then is when I was curious about my blood pressure and had that taken and I was 128/98 which is a bit high for me considering I am usually around 108/64. I am still feeling odd and it is hard for me to even type this out I just have a weird feeling in my extremities. I am also light headed and am seeing a bit blurry at times. Lastly, I am a healthy 20 year old female so I am not sure what this could be or me just being paranoid."

So he says I may have some kind of heart thing where it skips a beat or whatever, can't recall the name (right?) but he said probably nothing to worry about but I can do an echo if I want. He said it would probably just make me more anxious but it was up to me. I declined.  He does think I would benefit from a stress test, which I still have to schedule.  But I have been having this fake burping thing where I just have to feel like relieving stress in my upper chest, like air trapped there and will burp air, not a belch, just like I make myself do it, vs. have to and usually a bunch in a row which annoys my wife who always asks ""am I making you nervous?""

I've spent the last several years in non-stop pain (from head to toe) with debilitating weakness 24/7.

I was unable to tolerate the side effects so I was back in pain and unable to drag my body around so I stayed in bed.....a lot! THAT IS THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO TO YOURSELF!!!!! FIBROMYALGIA IS NOT*NOT*NOT A DEADLY DISEASE!!!!! You really are in control.....you just have to get informed, inspired, and find the right support system. I thank God that my husband is a butt...that man saved my life! I laid around so much that my diaphragm muscles became just as weak as my legs and arms. He went from being sweet and understanding (by taking care of everything $$, I couldn't work anymore) to pushing me to GET UP AND LIVE MY LIFE!!! At first I was sad, then mad, then inspired by him b/c I wasn't ready to ""roll over and die"" as he put it once.  I PERSONALLY RECOMMEND: *****EAT RIGHT....(more fruits/veggies and stay away from processed/junk food and drinks)***** *A little caffeine for headaches(can be addictive so be careful. Pills are available) *Physical Therapy for pain and weakness  *Brain Training games and activities, also consume memory boosting foods(of course for the FibroFog) *NOTE: If you reside in a state where marijuana is legal you are in luck!!! You can probally skip PT and pain meds.....but you'll need to double up on the Omega-3 Fatty Acids to keep your mind sharp! The bottom line is if you lay around (I KNOW it feels like you CAN'T move) YOUR BODY MUSCLES WILL WASTE AWAY!!!  *As for as sleep disturbances try taking your television, cellphone, and all electronic devices out of your bedroom. You absolutely can train your body. Device time should be in another room, no exceptions! If you ONLY sleep in your bedroom, when you lay down your mind will go into relax mode instead of being stimulated and your body will follow.

My body would start tingling in my feet and hands working its way up to my face. Then I would get tingling in my tongue and a metallic taste in my mouth. My whole body would shut down so that I couldn't move, speech or see. This would go on for 30 minutes to up to 3 or 4 hours at a time On and off all day and night. This went on for weeks. It has taken me months to get a bit better but it still happens. Also, if I have no full blown shut down I usually have trouble walking, talking, thinking and generally functioning. I have fibromyalgia, Hashimotos, and I am diabetic with IBS and gluten and diary intolerance. The doctors have diagnosed psychological stress. I wondered if anyone else has had these neurological symptoms. I am female and 53 years old. I am a bit worried as I keep relapsing despite giving up my job and trying to be less stressed. It's not much of a life when just going to the shops means I spend the next day in bed. Any advice?"
