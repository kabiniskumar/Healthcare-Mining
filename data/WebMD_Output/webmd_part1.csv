My outer ear canal itches, sometimes unbearably! Occasionally, I also have a mild to medium earache. She said there was no wax , no discharge, no redness, no rash. Everything looked fine.  I’m afraid to put cortisone cream there, or any other anti itch cream, for fear that might really cause an infection. I’ve been trying a few drops of hydrogen peroxide but while nothing is getting worse, the itch is not getting better.  Is there a good OTC ear drop for swimmers’ ear, if that’s what this is?"

I finished it with no relief and in fact my hearing has gotten worse to where I can't really hear at all on my right side as if I have an earplug shoved deep in there. I went into a walk in clinic 03/03/20 due to the several days wait with my regular doctor and I was prescribed Amox again with ear drops. I have no relief but I do now have an incredibly sore throat that not only makes swallowing difficult due to the pain but that it is also incredibly swollen that even small pills are a challenge. I drink plenty of water, take clariten-D for the sinuses and for the draining, drink honey/lemon tea for the throat, gargle warm salt water, pretty much all that i can find home remedies and I have no relief. The pain has made sleep very difficult and myself pretty irritable and I would love to know if there is a way to get some form of relief and even my hearing back."

She has no water retention, no heart noise (I forgot the name of the noise they look for), has driven to from the Northwoods several times without issue, is not nauseous, no muscle cramps, vomiting or any of the other symptoms of kidney failure. Again - she feels fine.  They've been letting her be because why make her feel like crap if she feels fine. Well, the other day they decided she needed to start dialysis three times a week starting tomorrow. They're fitting her with a port today. Now she will feel like crap 6 days a week.

So sadly I don't necessarily trust those doctors. Well, I don't trust any doctor who's going to make her feel sick when she doesn't now. Thoughts, second opinions, ideas? Could any of her other medications cause problems, like the one she takes for gout or HBP? What about certain foods that I'm 'sure' she shouldn't be eating. What about pills she takes for helping her to absorb more calcium? Just love my sister a lot and want to make sure she's making the most sound decisions. Oh, let's not forget to mention that she's 63, about 5'7"", over 250 pounds and is very inactive. She also still has her period from month to month and should have a hysterectomy to relieve that problem since no treatment or D&C's have helped. So lots of blood loss from time to time. Could gall bladder issues cause anything? My mother and I both had 'sand like crystals' in our gall bladders, not stones.

I've had two renal failure patients whom were also diabetic. Both of these patients had bgl that registered as LOW on our glucometer. Both patients I was unable to obtain IV access so I used 1 mg glucagon IM. In both cases I did not get a discernable rise in bgl as both pt remained LOW on subsequent rechecks. Why is this?

I have experienced post nasal drainage longer than I can remember and I have always had a suspicion that this was the because of my bad breath. Later, after seeing an ENT to remove my swollen adenoids due frequent nasal infections, they discovered two small holes in the roof of my mouth. I was told these holes should have closed at birth but for some reason they did not. The physician seemed to brush it off like it was nothing at the time but did however mention if it continues to be an issue, I may need to have surgical intervention. After my adenoids were removed I experienced a dramatic reduction in sinus infections but the drainage was still there. I am constantly having to spit and I frequently feel the accumulation of tiny food particles following meals. All these symptoms are accompanied by a bad taste and smell in my mouth; almost rotten. The smell diminishes after I vigorously clean my teeth but never for more that a day or so.

I only have few questions: 1. Does it HAVE to be refrigerated? There is NO. WAY. I am putting a jug of pee in the fridge where we keep our food and beverages. I am also not putting a cooler in the bathroom because a. no room for it and b. the cats would get into it. 2. Can I do it over a weekend? Because I'm never taking a day off from work for this kind of nonsense again (last time was for a colonoscopy...never having one of THOSE again). 3. How important is it to ""catch every single drop"", which is what I am reading in some on-line forums. As an older woman, I have some light bladder incontinence, for which I wear one of those light panty-liner thingies. Also, if the urge comes on me suddenly (and it can), I may not make it to the bathroom with the collection device and/or will probably go a little in my pants. So NO, I will never be able to ""collect every single drop"". And finally... 4. Will anyone REALLY know if I didn't follow all of the above rules to the letter? Years ago I worked in an endocrinologist's office and I watched people bring in those big brown jugs. I then saw the nurses pouring off all but a normal urine specimen cup-full of all that; the rest of the collection was flushed.  In all honesty, I'm looking at this 24-hour thing with the skepticism I had in sophomore year biology, when the teacher said he COULD tell the difference between a 1st generation fruit fly and a 3rd. He couldn't - because all my flies died after the 2nd generation and I turned them in anyway and wrote a 5-page essay on the experiment. Got an A. My lab partner had the same issue and did the same thing; got a B+. I'm betting I could collect my pee for a WEEK and they wouldn't know the difference. Right?"

Also, I believed once the shots were used, u couldn't use the pills for treatment. I'm in the ""Chronic"" stage with some liver damage now. I was happy to find I was wrong about the pills tho n am half way thru. However; my concern is last time I needed 3 white cell ""booster"" shots after the interferon shots. I received ONE. My insurance wouldn't allow the other two! I'm very afraid now, if I need those shots again, the stupid insurance won't help me. Any idea on if I'll require white cell shots like last time, after my pill treatment?? Thank you for any help u can give. I'm pretty worried honestly."

At first my mom wondered if it could be chicken pocks but after I took a shower and changed my clothes they went away. then these hives started showing up every night in the middle of the night. I would go to sleep fine but at like 2-5 am I would wake up so itchy and covered in raised, not round, red hives. The only thing that would make them go away was taking a shower and giving them time. I went to the doctor for this after it didn't go away for weeks, and the doctor told me to try taking Zyrtec because that's an antihistamine originally for hives. She told me that if that didn't work she would have blood work done and see what's wrong. Zyrtec worked AMAZINGLY. whenever I take it everything is gone and I'm not itchy anymore. at first I had to take 2 Zyrtec per day to see results but soon that became one and now I take one every other day. I moved to Australia in September, and the hives came with me. I also worked with children in a summer camp over the summer and am wondering if that could have caused it."

She returned soon after and they replaced the applicator at the top of the syringe before applying the paste to my son's tooth. this is concerning enough and I wasn't quick enough to pull them up on it but did afterwards and the dentist admitted it was wrong and in response and to try to make me feel better he then went down the hall and argued with the other dentist (we are in China and I could not understand what they were saying) then came back and pulled up the other patient's information on the computer and explained to me this was a child & hence low risk. By this time I was in shock and could not believe what I was seeing and hearing. I am now concerned that they may have re-used lidocaine vials that are meant to be only for one patient. What if they used the same needle twice for one patient and invected the vial then used it on my son? What to test for and how long to wait? The clinic looked clean and everything that was re-usable looked like it was packaged as if it had been autoclaved. Four days post this he has a sore throat :(

No pain, no problems. Went to doctors, sent me to urologist. Booked me in for cystoscopy under a general as I had hypospadias when I was younger...... anyway.Had ct scan.... never heard back from anyone about ct scan? (Assuming was clear!)On the morning of surgery (Wednesday) the surgeon said a lump on kidney was found on ct. they will see what the lump is via the camera...when I woke I was told, the tubes from kidney to bladder was too small and they have put a stent in....Wtf?... why wasn't I informed about the ct? I didn't have any pains or discomfort before operation. Now it's just horrible I don't want to go to toilet. The pain is unreal.... after the burning,when urinating. Then comes an intense pain up your back. Almost like pulling a muscle or trapped nerve. It has eased up a little. My urine is red then brown then normal. I get spasms, Odd feeling around my chest.... and I was feeling normal Tuesday. I can't do all the normal things I did. Worried about going back to work. Was intending to go back to work Friday. But got the hassle of having to take holiday so I get paid. And the more exercise I do, the more I will bleed....? Why the hell did I bother going for op. I was fine before.Why so much lack of communication with me?... I now have to have chest ct scan?... and go though all the pain again when I heal.I just want to know what's happening?Is this lump likely to be a stone? Why would he say lump, not stone?Would a stone look completely different to a tumour/lump on ct scans?I need more information before I lose the plot. Can anyone tell me what it's likely to be?"

Over the period of the next few weeks I got more swelling with some side pain. For 3-4 weeks I was going from Dr. to Dr. focusing on my leg swelling which nobody seemed to be able to figure out.  After x-rays, multiple blood tests, etc. etc. cancer was seemingly ruled out. I took a break from one week with continual leg swelling and some back pain which I falsely attributed to exercise and yoga. I did notice very frequent urination during this time.  I eventually went back to the Dr and I suggested a urine test because my original blood work had a high white blood count. Well, long story short, it seems that I might have had a low grade bladder infection for a year that eventually went into my kidneys causing edema of my right leg. I finished my course of antibiotics but because of the very late diagnosis which for the most part I arrived at on my own I fear I have now permanently damaged my kidneys. For 4 weeks I was walking around with an undiagnosed kidney infection. Now I have Proteinuria (foamy urine). My Creatinine levels were very high but still barely in range. My EGFR was above 60 which indicates relatively good filtration ability.  My question is, is the proteinuria common for a period of time after a pretty bad UTI and kidney infection? Does it go away?

Other option is surgery through kidney to gain access to the stone, which is what my Dr. recommends.

I wasn't quite sure where to put this, so kidney disorders it is! I am an eighteen-year old female. For last few months (perhaps four?), I've been experiencing some really weird symptoms and we're not quite sure why. Every couple of days, I have spells of sudden onset, extreme fatigue and exhaustion, accompanied with generalized weakness, some dizziness, a headache, and general malaise. The episodes do not seem to be triggered by anything specific and happen almost any time of day, though more often in the afternoons and evenings. They seem to be unrelated to my blood glucose, as I've taken readings during those times and they're normal. They also seem to be unrelated to the amount of sleep I get and my sleep patterns. I have no history of major illness, excluding polycystic ovary syndrome. The only medication I am on is hormonal birth control to control symptoms of PCOS. I have fairly recently had a number of blood tests done, and my TSH and CBC results came back normal.

I wasn't quite sure where to put this, so kidney disorders it is! I am an eighteen-year old female. For last few months (perhaps four?), I've been experiencing some really weird symptoms and we're not quite sure why. Every couple of days, I have spells of sudden onset, extreme fatigue and exhaustion, accompanied with generalized weakness, some dizziness, a headache, and general malaise. The episodes do not seem to be triggered by anything specific and happen almost any time of day, though more often in the afternoons and evenings. They seem to be unrelated to my blood glucose, as I've taken readings during those times and they're normal. They also seem to be unrelated to the amount of sleep I get and my sleep patterns. I have no history of major illness, excluding polycystic ovary syndrome. The only medication I am on is hormonal birth control to control symptoms of PCOS. I have fairly recently had a number of blood tests done, and my TSH and CBC results came back normal. I also had a complete metabolic panel, and everything there was normal, with creatinine and BUN reading low. I have no history of anemia, except where readings are a little low immediately following a blood donation. I always recover within about a week or so, and don't experience any symptoms from that.

It was directly correlated to drinking alcohol as the symptoms were not present otherwise. Drinking has in my opinion been done in moderation however for the past 2-3 years I have stopped drinking altogether. There were however maybe 2 or 3 occasions when I was younger in which I drank to the point where I may have done some long term damage. Recently, slight twinges and pain sensations in both kidneys have come about recently even after not drinking alcohol. Questions are below: I was not aware of kidney pain being related to alcohol, is this common? Is it possible for 2 or 3 heavy drinking events to cause long term damage to kidneys or would it have to be an accumulation of heavy drinking over time? What are the gold standard tests/exams to check for kidney function? How are kidney donors tested to confirm they have healthy kidneys for transplants? What are some tips to promote healthy kidney function?"

Now as a procrastinator and waited 10 yrs. my colonoscopy is scheduled in 2 weeks. After talking to my Gastro Dr. He said I could have had kidney trauma from the prep for the procedure. I had the pills and I understand with research into the matter these could have been a cause. My caring Dr. Of 10 yrs.( and he has done a wonderful job) doesn’t think this was ever a factor and completely dismisses my concern.

Additionally, I have sharp intermittent pains in the right side of my throat.  I have seen over 7 doctors, had 3 MRIs, 2 CAT scans, 2 endoscopes, Fine Needle Aspiration of 2 lymph nodes, blood work by an oncologist, a PH study for GERD, imaging for TMJ, etc. Every single search has turned up absolutely nothing. But yet, the pain persists. I have even recently started having night sweats every few weeks, maybe related to my increased anxiety, and hopefully from nothing more sinister.  The only physical manifestations of all of this pain is some irritated tissue at the back of my throat the doctor says is from acid reflux (which I take dexilant for), and lots of mucous forming in the piriform sinus.  I am a 38 year old white male that exercises regularly and is in generally good health otherwise.  Has anyone had any similar symptoms without diagnosis?"

The original post is found here:    It was posted 10 years ago. JanDob posted: Hello,  I have been diagnosed by my ENT with intermittent spasm of tensor tympani muscle in my right ear and I know it is a right diagnose because I have been through a great deal of stress lately and it somewhat ""damaged"" my nerves. I can feel and see for example also a fasciculation on my calfs (but sometimes even on other parts of my body). The Eustachian Tube is ok, ENT said.  The spasm feels like a ""clicking"" sound in my ear and it it the worst during speaking when conversation is somewhat stressful for me. It occurs then mainly during swallowing but generally it occurs virtually whenever (but in less intensity). Maybe it is worse in the morning after getting up. I feel that my ear is then sometimes ""tired"".  I had noticed this problem about one month ago and now it has devoloped in chronic nature.  I' ve been taking Lexaurin (Bromazepamum) (according to my ENT advice) (so far 2x1,5 mg a day, and now I'm starting to take 3x1,5 MG a day, 1 tbl in the morning and 2 tbls in the evening) along with magnesium, b-complex vitamins and other balanced vitamins and minerals (calcium and magnesium 2:1). So far with no significant effect. I am maybe a less anxious but the spasm in my right ear still continues. I know that I should rid off stress as much as possible but trouble is that spasm anxious me, it isn't accompanied with pain but it is annoying anyway so it's some kind of ""vicious circle"".  I'm considering to change Lexaurin for Myolastan (Tetrazepamum) which should have larger myorelaxant effect.  But in general, I want to take these psychofarmacs only for a necessary period of time.  Than I have question. Do you think that repeated politzeration could help? To somewhat ""loose"" the muscle? I'm aware of autopolitzerating my ear and I do it sometimes and seems to help a bit but without any long lasting effect.  I'm thinking also about some muscle relaxation psysical exercise but when the muscle is in my ear I don't know how. Then I'm considering some massage or other ""alternative"" methods like acupunctury.  What are your treatment suggestions or advice? Do you think it will, itself, go away in time if i try to be stress free as much as possible?  Thank you in advance. I very much appreciate it.  Jan Dob. Czech Republic. The Old Continent ).  P.S. I have felt these muscle contractions in my ear already about twice in my lifetime, so I have probably more sensitive nerves here, but it has been only a momentary matter and then it went away immediately. But now the stress I've been through, was so great and long lasting, that it has developed to this chronic matter.  I don't have any other problems with my ears and I have never have them in my life time (except for those stated above).  Again. Thank you. I'm 28 years old."

Dog bite resulted in lose of cartilage in nose and infection—VERY SERIOUS!!,"Hello,  I am writing on behalf of my sister in law. A year and a half ago her dog bit her on the bottom of her nose causing extensive damage. The cartilage In between the nostrils deteriorated and has fallen off leaving an open slit wound—effectively leaving her with the appearance of 3 nostrils.  She has visited various EMTs and plastic surgeons within the Dallas Ft. Worth area but everyone says the same thing—they “have never seen anything like it”, check her nose to see if the condition has worsened and then schedule another follow-up appointment in 2-3 weeks. A few months after the injury a plastic surgeon performed a skin flap procedure in an attempt to fix the appearance of her nose. It was unsuccessful because it was soon very apparent there were some MAJOR issues inside the nose that needed to be addressed first because the pressure within her wound quickly “blew” open the stitches.  After it was concluded that a cosmetic fix would only work after the underlying problems within her nose were addressed and completely gone she began to see EMTs to solve the problems that were taking place within her nose and sinuses.  The unknown issues have resulted in headaches, lots of pressure throughout the nose and into the sinuses and leakage from her nose.  She has been using Aquaphor on the wound to keep it moist but the build up of pressure inside her nose is so bad that it causes the Aquaphor and other tissue, cartilage, and possibly homeopathic ointment that had hardened out of her nose causing great pain—She has described the feeling as “giving birth” or going through pregnancy labor within her nose. Her nose is swollen and continues to become more so causing great concern.  The exterior of the bottom of her nose in between the nostrils doesn’t appear to be the root of her issue even though she now has three openings. The slit or other nostril (the place where there is normally cartilage) is the place where the discharge comes from which causes everyone to believe there is something behind that which may be the “root of the problem”.  As previously stated she has been to various EMT and plastic surgeons within the DFW area in the last 18 months with no real resolution. She recently developed an infection which included the presence of pus on the wound within her nose which she is taking antibiotics for now.  She complains of having inflamed sinuses and sever headaches—which have worsened within the last 3 weeks.  The doctors that she has visited thus far have all said they have never seen a case like hers but because she is so stoic about it all they don’t seem to prioritize her case. Her pain has become almost unbearable and yet she still goes to work and pushes through.  As a family we are very concerned that an infection could reach her brain or bloodstream, etc. We can see that her condition has worsened and we are in desperate need for a doctor who can help her, so I am putting her case on medical forums hoping that someone somewhere can help. Please contact me if you might know of someone that can help or has heard of a similar situation. Additional information, details and pictures can be provided. PLEASE PASS THIS INQUIRY ON.

By the next day I was feeling very fatigued with a stiff neck, nausea, pressure in the back of my head and pain between shoulder blade and spine. Later that day the left side of my face and left half of my tongue became numb. This continued. On June 6th I was walking at work and became extremely lightheaded and had to sit down immediately. I left work and went to the ER where they took a CT scan of my brain and blood lab tests which both came back normal. They said it was probably a pinched nerve and sent me home with a Rx of 5, 50mg Prednisone tablets. By June 8th I felt the worse that I ever had. I was extremely fatigued and still in a lot of pain. My head felt like it weighed 50 pounds. By June 13th the facial and tongue numbness had started to subside but I was still having pain behind the ear, facial spasms, neck pain and head pressure and dizziness. June 17th I had an appointment with my family doctor where I was I told I possibly had Bell's Palsy. At this time the facial and tongue numbness was pretty much gone. All other symptoms were still there but not as bad. She checked my ears and said my left ear drum looked bulged and both ears appeared to have fluid around them. She called for an MRI of my brain and neck and referred me to a Neurologist and an ENT specialist. The MRI of the brain came back normal and the MRI of the neck showed 2 midline bulging discs at C6 and C7 which I already knew about as I had been told about them years ago. She said that I could benefit from another round of steroids and gave me a Decadron injection as well as a prescription for a Prednisone taper pack. I felt improvement that lasted for about a week. On July 1st I got a pulsating headache behind my eyes and left temple. I couldn't stand it any longer so I went to the ER in the next town over where they gave me an IV injection of steroids and a migraine cocktail. The following day I had a dentist appointment to see if any of my symptoms were dental related. They took xrays and found that I have 4 impacted wisdom teeth with one that has broken through the gum. I was scheduled for removal the next day but the oral surgeon would not sedate me due to my headaches and dizziness. He wanted me to see my neurologist first but said the wisdom teeth definitely need to come out soon because one of them had a pocket of fluid around it. He said my jaw muscles had a lot of tension and they were very tender. Side note: I have had TMJ disorder for around 15 years. July 18th I start getting the ear pain and pressure in my right ear. Before it was only the left side and my right side felt fine. On this day I see the neurologist who confirmed the Bell's Palsy and some physical tests to check my nerve function. She looked in my ears and also said I have fluid behind my ear drum and recommended an ENT, which I already had an appointment for. She asked me to wait around 3 more months if possible to have my wisdom teeth removed as she felt it could worsen my other symptoms. July 25th I go to the ENT appointment which ended up being a waste of time. The Dr here was very rude and seemed rushed. I tried to give him backstory on my symptoms but he wouldnt listen and kept talking over me. He barely tapped the Otoscope to my ears and said they looked perfect. He told me to take Motrin for pain and sent me home. So, it has been nearly 7 weeks since the start of all this. I am still dealing with pretty much constant pressure in the back of my head and ears. My ears feel full like they need to be popped but popping doesnt help. I still have random days where the pain behind my ear and neck pain/stiffness is worse. I have been taking ibuprofen everyday for the past 2 weeks or so. No one can seem to figure out what caused all of this to happen and why I'm still having this weird head and ear pressure all the time. I don't understand why all of this has moved from the left ear to the right. Some days it will be both ears. Some days I will have what feels like sinus pressure on my cheekbones and brow bone. Also, I will get random tender points on my face that comes and goes. When pressed it feels like its bruised but it isnt. This has been the most bizarre experience I have ever had in my life. I have been a fairly healthy person and hadn't had an illness before this in over 3 years. Has anyone else experienced anything like this before or had these symptoms? Could it be wisdom teeth? Sinus? Viral?"

Then, on the left side, the facial numbness, jaw pain, and tooth pain can back fool force. I've also had some sensitive breathing.

I’m going to confess that I take twice the recommended dose. It is a bit of a problem and I have tried multiple times to ween myself off of it.  Over the last 10 years I have noticed an increase in a thick post-nasal drip and recurrent sinus infections. I’ve seen multiple doctors and my CT scan of the sinuses came back clean. Also tested negative for all major allergens. They always end up prescribing antibiotics and tell me to drink plenty of fluids. I am a med student and have at least a passing understanding of the human body and am wondering if the doxylamime succinate in unisom is drying me out and thickening the mucus leading to the infections and post nasal drip. Can anyone point me to any studies on this or have any experience with this sort of thing?

That kind of thing. I told my social worker who represents 180 dialysis patients about this. I simply mentioned it in passing and she matter-of-factly said that dialysis can sometimes cause short-term memory loss. I did some research online regarding the possible connection, but I could not find anything definitive on the subject other than a ""side bar"" indicating the increase of creatinine levels can cause that if the dialysis is not as efficient as it should be. Two grafts have failed 3 days after they were created. I'm still using ports on the right side of my chest. I'm running at about 75% efficiency on the machine for 4 hours M/W/F.

My stone type is Calcium-Oxalate. I tried every diet, tried drinking water, lemonade, everything else they suggested, they still come back. Every time I went to the urologist they always told me that while the kidney stones are inside my Kidney that they won't cause pain. Most of the time they would still write me a prescription for Norco and send me on my way. I'd keep telling them that the Norco wasn't really helping that basically I would have to take so much of it I was in la la land and didn't care about the pain anymore but it wasn't stopping the pain most of the time.  About 3 years ago my stones were so bad they had to go in and remove them via surgery, lithotripsy wasn't working on them. They came back and last year they had to do lithotripsy again. Now, I've been having back trouble for 6+ months not sleeping well and I went to the Urologist and I have a 12mm stone in each kidney. He told me that they were not blocking my ureter that it couldn't be the source of my back pain plus I had a stone in my other kidney but it doesn't hurt on that side. He diagnosed me with something Sponge Kidney. He sent me home with an appointment in six months to check them again and hopefully by then I could get insurance and they could do the surgery. The medicine they have been trying to put me on costs over 100 dollars a month which I cannot afford. He gave me no advice as to what to do even though I told him it was so bad I was being forced to self-medicate with alcohol just so I could get some rest. I went to my regular doctor and they checked that it wasn't muscular or skeletal problems causing my pain and to go back to him for a reevaluation. She wrote me a prescription for Meloxicam 15mgs once a day which helps to a small degree she told me it helps make it manageable, well it's manageable about every other day as long as I don't do anything at all strenuous. The last time I tried Norco for this pain about a couple months ago it did NOTHING for the pain. It still put me into la la land, so it's not a tolerance problem, but the pain was so bad even that wasn't enough. I live with my mother whom I try to take care of and she makes barely too much money to qualify for any kind of help with insurance for me. It was going to cost us over $13,000 after the deductible before they would pay anything if I got insurance. That's almost a 1/5th of her yearly income. Most of the money she brings in goes out in bills from when my father was still alive. I am pretty certain that I will be turned down at the free clinic because of the household income and the same for the charity group, I am in my mid 30's and even though this condition is extremely disabling I'm almost positive I wouldn't qualify for disability. I don't care for the check I just need medical help. So here's my questions, is it ABOSOLUTELY impossible for your kidneys to hurt even if they stone is just sitting inside, and what advice can you guys give about finding help with my medical bills."

At the same time, the roof of my mouth and throat feels dry while my teeth, lips, tongue and lower portion of the mouth remain moist!

I went to see ENT because of a fluttering/vibrating feeling in my right ear. Repeated annual MRI with and without MultiHance of my head/brain led to diagnosis of a 3 x 3 x 4 mm lipoma in right distal IAC adjacent to the fundus. Same testing in the following year showed no change but added information indicating ""There may be some associated architectural distortion of the distal aspect of the right cranial nerves VII and VIII"". Over two years there appeared to be no change in size. The fluttering/vibrating feeling was absent for several years but is now back.  In the interim (2015-2018) I have on occasion had excruciating facial pain that feels centered about 2 cm right of the bottom of my nose that feels like it is inside my skull and feels like someone stabbing me with an ice pick or something else. At times this is accompanied by pain in my right shoulder and to the right of my sternum. The pain near the sternum had me in the ER because ""chest pain"" in with my family history is very concerning. No cardiac issues have been identified and inclined stress tests with sonogram put me at low risk of heart attack. I am 1) curious to know how likely it is that the ear issue could be the result of the lipoma and if there is any chance that the facial pain could also be related and 2) wondering if I ought to return to ask about additional imaging given my belief that there is not much that could be done about a lipoma in the location described. Thanks for patience to anyone who reads this."

It's a somewhat long read but I hope you read it... TL;DR: 9 years of 24/7 nasal congestion. 2 surgeries and years of various medical regimens have provided no relief. Problem: Nasal congestion 24/7/365. When it started: Around 9 years ago, I came down with a pretty bad cold. After the cold symptoms went away, the nasal congestion stayed.  After seeing an ENT specialist several times (around 2010), they believed the nasal congestion was caused by GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease) even though I have zero heartburn. They had me start taking Prilosec for for a few months and sleep with my bed on a slight incline so that the stomach acids could not flow into my throat due to gravity to see if this helped the symptoms. I was using Flonase as well. None of this made a change. Fast forward to about 2014 and I was still dealing with the same nasal congestion. I decided to start seeing an ENT again to see if I could get to the bottom of this. First I was put on a Sudafed/Flonase regimen for a few months. No change. Was put on a local raw honey regimen to see if it was allergies causing the congestion. No change (which I already knew was going to be the result because it started in MA where I was born and raised and I've lived in IL and now CA since).  I was referred to an Allergy specialist where they performed an allergy test where they poke the 40 something needles into your back to see what you react to. The only things I reacted to were a few types of grass that are not present in my current region or anywhere I have ever been.  Now I was finally referred to an ENT where my nasal passage was scoped a few times. It showed redness and inflammation in my turbinates but that's about it. We decided to move forward with a Turbinate Reduction surgery (2014) as well as a slight deviated septum correction. The deviated septum was very very minor and did not cause blockage but the doctor figured since we are already going in there we might as well take care of that as well. 6 months after the surgery, the congestion was slightly less but still there. Then eventually it went back to the way it was pre-surgery and the turbinates were inflammted still. I elected to move forward with another Turbinate Reduction surgery (2015) and understood this was pretty much the last time I could do this procedure as anymore reduction would start causing negative effects.  Fast forward to present day, OCT 2018, my nasal congestion is still present all day every single day. Throughout the years, I've used a Netipot, quit smoking, quit drinking, been put on Azelastine Hydrochloride spray. The only relieve I get is from a nasal decongestant like Afrin but I don't use it as it just makes it worst if I use it longer than a few days. I also get relieve when I'm using the Breathe Right nasal strips when I sleep.  It's honestly frustrating and I would really love to be able to breathe normally again."

Now I was finally referred to an ENT where my nasal passage was scoped a few times. It showed redness and inflammation in my turbinates but that's about it. We decided to move forward with a Turbinate Reduction surgery (2014) as well as a slight deviated septum correction. The deviated septum was very very minor and did not cause blockage but the doctor figured since we are already going in there we might as well take care of that as well. 6 months after the surgery, the congestion was slightly less but still there. Then eventually it went back to the way it was pre-surgery and the turbinates were inflammted still. I elected to move forward with another Turbinate Reduction surgery (2015) and understood this was pretty much the last time I could do this procedure as anymore reduction would start causing negative effects.  Fast forward to present day, OCT 2018, my nasal congestion is still present all day every single day. Throughout the years, I've used a Netipot, quit smoking, quit drinking, been put on Azelastine Hydrochloride spray. The only relieve I get is from a nasal decongestant like Afrin but I don't use it as it just makes it worst if I use it longer than a few days. I also get relieve when I'm using the Breathe Right nasal strips when I sleep.  It's honestly frustrating and I would really love to be able to breathe normally again."

It’s all came on after using a netti pot and and using albuterol for a cold. Sometimes it’s more intense than others. I have been to 3 ENTs and had all kinds of head scans. I can feel pressure in my sinuses and my ears constantly pop. A few times I have felt in the back of throat where my nose drains a chunk and I get it out and it’s a fleshy white mass. It looks like a chunk of skin tissue. I can’t find answers and I really want to feel better. Anyone with similar problems or answers? Thank you.

I had a dream when I was about 9 years old and it was so scary and real I could never forget. I was in a room and there were creatures around yelling and laughing gibberish stuff. Then there was a man with a really big head yelling as loud as he could at me. It was all gibberish so nothing he said was real words but I knew what he was telling me somehow.  He was telling me to touch a block with my hand and then touch another one on the other side of the room without letting go of the first one. I couldn't do that because they were too far apart so I was getting afraid When he started yelling louder. When I woke up(i was really awake entirely, not still dreaming) the unbearably loud noise that was happening and the amount of color and the creatures and man were still there. I could hear everything from the dream and no other noise from the world around me because it was so loud(even when my mom was trying to talk to me). When I opened my eyes, I looked at the walls and I could still see everything in the dream perfectly. When I closed my eyes it was still there. It would not go away so I was even more agitated. I went to my parents (I walked down the hall and none of the sounds or visuals stopped) and climbed into their bed, cried and screamed until eventually I passed out because I was so tired. I woke up the next morning feeling okay but every once in a while for YEARS NOW, if I hear a noise(anything, even an air conditioner going off one time) I can suddenly hear the man yelling and it's still so vivid and really loud at times. I haven't had the problem of triggering the noise in about 2 years now but I was just wondering why this all happened because it was the scariest time of my life and I was only maybe 8 or 9 so it sort of? traumatised me. If any one has any answers, please let me know. Thank you to anyone who was patient enough to read my rant even if you can't help me."

So I've decided to come here because I'm seriously getting fed up with this.  It's basically this: When I'm sleeping with someone else in the room (my boyfriend, one of my friends, brother etc) before I fall asleep or just after I wake up, I tend to respond to them though no one's said anything! NOTE: This happens ONLY when I fall asleep or wake up near other people. I can genuinely clearly remember hearing and seeing things, they seem like hallucinations. On bad days this can happen like 5 times in a row. It's not like I'm dreaming, I am aware that I am awake, and that's what makes this so strange to me. -------- For example: My boyfriend and I were watching the Pokemon movie with Entei. I clearly remember a bunch of Chikorita happily jumping up against a fence. So I said ""awww, look at those cute Chikorita!"" and my boyfriend was like ""... But there's no Chikorita"". So I looked at the screen and it showed some Pokemon in the snow.  Another example is when my friend stayed over a couple of days ago. I responded to her SO many times though she never said anything. And I clearly remember I had to tell myself ""Nope, don't respond yet... Just look at her first"" so I looked over and she was fast asleep.  And yet another example I clearly remember. I remember my boyfriend asked me to watch something on Netflix with me. He was looking towards me laying on his side. I said ""Nah, don't really feel like it"" and my boyfriend was like ""... Huh?"" so I looked over and he was lying down playing his 3DS with his back towards me. It's honestly annoying to keep apologizing because it's one of those times again. I've tried looking it up on Google but I can't seem to find anything. It's getting extremely annoying and I wonder if anyone knew what it was. I've also had very shaky hands lately which is apparently linked to Parkinsons, but it doesn't seem very common in 20 year old females.  Thank you in advance."

Only tonight it was different, I was in that sleep paralysis state but instead of not being able to move my body was shaking. I felt this type of straining feeling I get when trying to come out of it and “woke” up. I tried to sleep again only this time it was more intense and happened quickly. I was turning over in bed and as I was doing so I closed my eyes, my head twitched, and instantly my body started to shake uncontrollably lasting about 10-15 secs. Finally I just stayed up a little and fell asleep fine later. I never experienced this before, when I have sleep paralysis I’m just stuck there either with my eyes open or close never seeing a demon or something. I’m just confused on the shaking, like should I be worried? Though I think when having seizures aren’t people disoriented and forget them? So what was this shaking?"

They prescribed me antibiotics in which I never took because the pain suddenly dissappeared, as suddenly as it came on! That's what happens. It will come on suddenly and then just stop as if a switch was flipped, an hour or so later.  Nothing really alleviates the pain. Not even Advil. Every so often I am able to tug or press on the area and I'll ear a pop (an external pop, not the kind you hear when you swallow). It sounds like when you crack a knuckle, and then the pain will suddenly go away. That doesn't always work though and so sometimes it last a few hours and then just disappear. When the pain is there it's horrible. It's achey and sometimes shooting. I can't turn my head or I'll geta really sharp pain. Forget touching that part of my ear, it's so tender. Sometimes my ear will feel hot and get red on the rim of my cartilage. It's really painful.  Ive been examined before while the pain was going on and they saw nothing unusual. I always ask my husband to look at my ear when it's happening, and he sees nothing. I went to see an endocrinologist who tested me for several autoimmune disorders and he ruled out Relapsing polychondritis (which seems to be the only disorder that matches my symptoms).

I also apply a steroid cream to the painful area.  2) the other culprit is my headphones but this one I'm not to sure of. I often fall asleep with headphones in my left ear. They are the earbud type that come with iPhones. I know you shouldn't do that, but it happens. while I believe it can be them, I wonder why I don't get the pain every time I fall asleep like that.

I figured I'd try again.  Every once in a while I get this horrible, excruciating pain in the external, left ear, on the area that's labeled ""concha"", if you look at a picture of outer ear anatomy. It started over a year ago and it comes so randomly. I want to a ER/walking clinic once while I was experiencing the pain. They prescribed me antibiotics in which I never took because the pain suddenly dissappeared, as suddenly as it came on! That's what happens. It will come on suddenly and then just stop as if a switch was flipped, an hour or so later.  Nothing really alleviates the pain. Not even Advil. Every so often I am able to tug or press on the area and I'll ear a pop (an external pop, not the kind you hear when you swallow). It sounds like when you crack a knuckle, and then the pain will suddenly go away. That doesn't always work though and so sometimes it last a few hours and then just disappear. When the pain is there it's horrible. It's achey and sometimes shooting. I can't turn my head or I'll geta really sharp pain. Forget touching that part of my ear, it's so tender. Sometimes my ear will feel hot and get red on the rim of my cartilage. It's really painful.  Ive been examined before while the pain was going on and they saw nothing unusual. I always ask my husband to look at my ear when it's happening, and he sees nothing. I went to see an endocrinologist who tested me for several autoimmune disorders and he ruled out Relapsing polychondritis (which seems to be the only disorder that matches my symptoms).  It's so frustrating because when I'm having an episode it hurts so bad, I feel like I cannot function and I get really touchy and agitated. Every doctor tells you to come when you're having it but even though I've been logging my episodes, I cannot predict when I'm going to have one! It just happens like turning on a switch, in the middle of the day, and it goes away that same way.  Weirdly enough too I've notice that I get it a lot more during the week before my period.  I've narrowed it down to three possible causes after I've been actively logging episodes.  1) I have mild psoriasis on my scalp. Recently I noticed very small patch of it behind my right ear, right in the fold, where your ear adjoins to your neck. I have read that you can gerbil psoriasis actually inside your ear canal. I wonder if that's what it is and maybe it effects a nerve that goes to my outer ear. Sometimes I pour peroxide in my ear during an episode and the pain dissappears. I also apply a steroid cream to the painful area.  2) the other culprit is my headphones but this one I'm not to sure of. I often fall asleep with headphones in my left ear. They are the earbud type that come with iPhones. I know you shouldn't do that, but it happens. while I believe it can be them, I wonder why I don't get the pain every time I fall asleep like that.

Tried Ativan, Seroquel, Klonopin, Elavil, and 2 other prescriptions but I can't think of their names...NOTHING HELPS ME TO EVEN FALL ASLEEP AT ALL!  At the current day and time I'm writing this post, Thursday at 1:30pm, I have not fallen asleep yet from going to bed last night around midnight...but adding to that...this is my 4th day/night in a row that I've yet to fall asleep at all. I'm extremely fatigued, my head is killing me, I've got pain from the back of my head going down my neck and shoulders then radiating right down to both oh my hips. My entire body just hurts and yearns for relief. The moment I drag myself into the bed and my head lays comfortably on the pillow and I shut my eyes...PRESTO!! The triggers fire away in my head and every thought of worthlessness comes to mind, and NEVER STOPS THINKING!! So, as is routine now, I'll usually end up going as much as 6 days straight without any sleep and then my mind finally gives way to the total sleep deprivation and I'll actually sleep for as much as 3-4 hours...then we begin this ridiculous fiasco all over again! I'm so TIRED of BEING TIRED!!!"

I hope I get what I might have so it all started in like I think december 2015 when I have Insomnia problems then it got really worse ff to 2016 like awake for 3 days and sleeping only 2 hours and in the time period of 2017 to 2018 it was so bad that I no longer get restful sleep, I still have hardtime falling asleep and now I can't stay asleep. I'm always kind of light headed, lost of concentration for years, short memory loss for years also and the worst is I can't endure this anymore muscle twitching all over body and also face for I think a year? I have no Idea how I do it since it happens every minute every 12 to 30 second I think I just got used to it since its not painful only veru uncomfortable and I always want to stretch the part that twitch or idk involuntary muscle movement the worse ones are it does not stop and just move on one muscle rapidly until I massage a lil bit on the part sometimes it stop sometimes it does not. All of this happend everyday. I tried telling my parents we go once they just check blood said all normal and heartrate is only a little bit abnormal they said its ok since I play sports (well I used to alot but kind of stop because of all these stuff happening to me. I try to play only on good days) so yeah I havent really had a proper HEALTH medications since I'm from 3rd world where these stuff does not happen and not common so my parents does not believe me they just get mad all the time so I stopped and endure this for a year. Even the doctors here they only bring me to normal docs where other stuff is not handled like mental and such. I am not depressed. But when I start to have Insomnia I think I got depressed and developed bad anxiety over the course of the years."

Approximately 4 days ago I was exposed to a very loud fire alarm in a small corridor. After the fire alarm went off, my ears were hurting a bit but everything went back to normal. I came home a few hours later and fell asleep on the the couch. When I woke up I noticed my tinnitus was way louder than usual, I was dizzy, all sound has became sensitive to my ears, have nausea, diarrhea, hot and cold flashes, and my ears feel like I have an ache in them. (my ear felt like fluid was inside causing an ear ache) I searched online for answers to see if I was coming down with something, as multiple people at work were getting sick. To no avail, I found nothing useful of what I was going through as all my symptoms carried over to too many multiple diagnoses. 4 days after all of this I went to an urgent care to get seen because nothing is changing and sometimes I feel like my symptoms are getting worse. The doctor told me that I have some liquid behind my ear and my throat is slightly swollen. Prior to this I told him last week I had a sore throat, (which I assumed was strep throat), and like I always do I take over the counter medicine and wait it out. Unfortunately my throat has been swollen with no pain for the whole time leading up to the other incident and symptoms. The doctor said that the tube that goes from my throat to my ears are filled with the liquid from a sinus infection and they will clear in time as my infection leaves my body. He said this is causing my middle ear to be muffled inside, even if it doesn't sound like it, and it's causing my ears to be sensitive to noise which is making my tinnitus sound like it's more potent then normal.  I was advised to take 3 ibuprofen every 6 hours until swelling in my throat dissipate's and if nothing changes within 3 days to come back for further evaluation. Also the nurse that took my vitals said my temperature and blood pressure are normal but she's seen more people this past week for sinus infection than usual due to the weather and allergies. Where I'm getting at through my whole story is if there's anything I can do to help sooth my tinnitus sound until this all clears up. I'm used to my tinnitus and have lived with it for so long that it's part of my normal life, but with the sound becoming more distinguished and potent, it's driving me a little bit insane. My hope is that the case of my tinnitus being so loud is due to the liquid and muffled ears, because when I muffle my ears with my hands the ringing sounds normal like it used to. However when I un-muffle my ears the sound isn't like it used to be prior to all of this. It's very hard to even fall asleep right now even with a background white noise due to this situation. I used to be able to fall asleep by just focusing in on a fan or music but now the ringing is over masking all of this, which would make sense if my ears are being muffled. Questions: 1. What will help clear a sinus infection? (viral bacterial infection as I believe the doctor called it) 2. Is there hope the tinnitus will dissipate? 3. What other helpful insight is there on background noise to help sooth the ringing while I sleep?"

He said this is causing my middle ear to be muffled inside, even if it doesn't sound like it, and it's causing my ears to be sensitive to noise which is making my tinnitus sound like it's more potent then normal.  I was advised to take 3 ibuprofen every 6 hours until swelling in my throat dissipate's and if nothing changes within 3 days to come back for further evaluation. Also the nurse that took my vitals said my temperature and blood pressure are normal but she's seen more people this past week for sinus infection than usual due to the weather and allergies. Where I'm getting at through my whole story is if there's anything I can do to help sooth my tinnitus sound until this all clears up. I'm used to my tinnitus and have lived with it for so long that it's part of my normal life, but with the sound becoming more distinguished and potent, it's driving me a little bit insane. My hope is that the case of my tinnitus being so loud is due to the liquid and muffled ears, because when I muffle my ears with my hands the ringing sounds normal like it used to. However when I un-muffle my ears the sound isn't like it used to be prior to all of this. It's very hard to even fall asleep right now even with a background white noise due to this situation. I used to be able to fall asleep by just focusing in on a fan or music but now the ringing is over masking all of this, which would make sense if my ears are being muffled. Questions: 1. What will help clear a sinus infection? (viral bacterial infection as I believe the doctor called it) 2. Is there hope the tinnitus will dissipate? 3. What other helpful insight is there on background noise to help sooth the ringing while I sleep?"

It's not a tingly numb feeling, it feels more like my head and hands are almost bloated if that makes sense. Theres no pain and I find if I lie on my back the feeling subsidies and then I can go back to sleeping on my side. I used to get the same sensation as a child but only when I was ill. Recently however I am getting this every night despite being fit and healthy. It's not affecting my sleep and I'm not overly worried about it - more curious. I have also in the past suffered from sleep paralysis but not for a few years now. It could be related. Thanks"

I've noticed while sleeping I often suffer a series of( sometimes painful) jerks. Sometimes they are widespread all over my body, but are also isolated.The most common jerk I've experienced is a series of neck movements where my neck moves side to side,which is quite painful. More recently I've started feeling twitching in my leg,attempts to speak and woken up gasping for air about 4 times. I've had a history with sleep paralysis but don't I don't snore. When these jerks happen, I am fully aware of their occurance, but I am still unable to stop them as I'm still asleep. I usually sleep on my side and I am pretty bad with keeping a consistent bed time.I typically wake up with my covers all over the place and I'm fearing I'm suffering from seizures in my sleep which is very frightening to me as my cousin died in my bed not to long ago from SUDEP.

This not yet confirmed until goes to radiology I think she said, but I am almost certain I have them because of pain and my mother had them as well. The dr said theyre not very big, but was hesitant to give me any more information until confirmed results are in next Friday.  I am extrelemely worried to the point where I cant sleep, I am probably worrying my parents to death, and I'm finding it very difficult to wait till Friday for answers. I am a male, 24 years old, and I have a narrow urethra so I am scared to death that is going to be bad.  My questions are: 1. My doctor told my dad that they were ""minimal and able to use alpha blockers to dissolve them to dust"", but to be completely honest I feel like he is only making this up to make me feel better.  Is this even possible to dissolve kidney stones with alphablockers, or any other medication for that matter, to the point where you can pass them painlessly? 2. My second question/worry is that I have been opioid dependant and addicted to pain meds in the past, and have currently been on subxone for 3-4 years and am still taking it to this day, my tolerance is extremely high to opioids although my suboxone dose is now lower than thought possible, like .4mg a day, (I have tried to come off the suboxone several times but have not been able too because of pain I assumed was withdrawals, it makes me wonder if the pain that I attributed to suboxone withdrawal was really pain from the kidney stones this whole time, but I know nothing to prove this. ) What are the options for pain medications for this? Is there alternatives to opioids? I do believe I could control myself, especially with my mothers help, if I had to do opiates, but I really am hoping there is a better way to relieve severe pain. Any insight into this would be so much appreciated as I am scared to death right now, I am sorry for being hysterical and hectic, I am really trying not to be."

I am a 23 year old male. I sometimes get this issue where I can hear my alarm clock going off in my ears. My alarm clock has a really harsh bell sound. Sometimes I will hear it and then go to my room to shut it off and its not going off. I know this might sound like a psych thing or whatever but also, when this happens i get like a tingling sensation in my ears. Any ideas? I am a nurse and my only thought was possible tinnitus, but i don't know why it would sound like my alarm clock."

Since then she has been on antibiotics a total of 23 days, and now we are starting again with some more strep.

My question is that it seems like a lot and I am not sure if I should take all of this. Should I stop and try to see my primary or even an ENT? Thanks"

I'm guessing it's psychological, as I've ruled out diet and lifestyle habits as potential reasons why this is happening. I've always had occasional insomnia, but it seems to be getting worse. I take magnesium and melatonin because I don't want to take any mood-altering drugs, which will only open up a whole new can of worms that I have no desire to embark down that path. If anyone has been in a similar situation and has found results without the use of drugs or other mood-altering chemicals, please share your secrets with me.

I don't doubt that the fact that mornings are dark at this time of year is partly to blame, but that alone can't be the only reason.  I have my alarms set to 5am and 5:30, but more and more I am getting up at 6 or closer to 6:30, and therefore have an hour or less to prepare before I'm catching my bus. This has resulted in me getting to work at 8-8:15am, which means I have no ""me time"" before I have to boot up my work computer and start cracking (I have a desk job). If I could just get up at 5:30 am at the latest, then I wouldn't be cutting things this close to the wire. Lately, I've had to choose between eating breakfast, taking a shower, or making lunch (showers have always taken precedence, since I can always buy breakfast and lunch, but that's not a good habit to be falling back on. In a perfect world, I take showers the night before, but life isn't always perfect). Now, here is another piece that makes this situation more frustrating: If I am to wake up at 5-5:30 am with the suggested amount of sleep (8-10 hours), that means I have to be ASLEEP by 7-9 pm! Which then means I have to be in BED by some ungodly hour because all my life it has taken me a good hour or two (or three; I never look at the clock when I'm trying to sleep because that would make it worse) to actually fall asleep. With getting home after work between 5:30 and 6 pm, that's just not possible. There is no way I can get the suggested hours for healthy sleep, which means I always will be struggling to get out of bed. I worry I will be sleeping in later and later with each day until I am consistently getting to work late. I can't even force myself to turn my bedside lamp on, and don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on some smart lamp with daylight-imitating bulbs. I am 28 years old and relatively healthy. There is no reason why this should be getting worse for me already at so young an age. No articles out there have any solutions that I've found to work for me. And on top of it all, I have always been a morning person. Once I actually get OUT of bed and drink a warm cup of tea, I am fine. But getting physically out of bed and keeping my eyes open before that is what is getting worse with each passing day. I apologize for the essay, but I wanted to be as detailed as possible. This situation is just really, really annoying, understandably."

My major issue here and concern is i seem to frequently masturbate, i wake up in the morning and im just covered in dried up cum, i have had sex while asleep but this does not happen nearly as much as the masturbation. My penis started to get raw right underneath the head of my penis as i must be rubbing alot. I finally set up a camera and it appears that i will masturbate at times on and off for hours, cumming 2 or even 3 times. I now have to sleep naked so i dont have to do as much laundry. After doing the video for 30 days straight It seems this happens mostly within the first several hours of falling asleep. More troubling concerns is when i sleep away from home, i have stayed in Hotels and woke up with my curtains open and im naked on the bed, i have woken up with my door open and several times woken up to another person in my bed whom i did not know and finding out i had sex with a total stranger. Whats even scarier is not knowing what has happen the times i woke up with my door open and im just laying on bed naked, people have left me notes telling me they had a good time. Does anyone know how to control this? My sex drive when im asleep appears to be off the hook,to avoid getting my penis rubbed raw i now cover my penis in lotion before i fall asleep, it seems to somewhat work but i do end up rubbing the lotion mostly off. I even had to move one time out of total humiliation. I need help with this but embarrassed to ask the Dr i mean what do i say>? What will she offer to do? Is there test or medication that can help? I am so freaked out over this, just wondering what i have done now over the years or who i have done it with, i stay often in hotels and the door open has happen so many times.

Remember the fall and severe pain in chest and the need to fall asleep.  Approximately 15 minutes later a friend carried me to the car, I was able to speak normally, although slightly confused. About 5 minutes later I started feeling a severe pain in my clavicle, the pain worsened and a few minutes later the hearing in my right ear cut off completely. I was taken to the emergency room, it was concluded that I had broken my right clavicle. Paralysed and confused from the pain, I can’t recall if I mentioned the hearing problem. Whilst lying in the bed in the hospital, my right ear started bleeding. I had ruptured my ear drum. I also had a concussion and took me a while to recall what had happened.  X-rays were taken of my shoulder and skull; the only evident broken bones were my right clavicle.  I was released from the hospital, as I do not have a medical aid. I spent the rest of the day sleeping and vomiting in the backseat of the car. I had been drinking the night before and was given morphine.  At about 17h00 that day, I attempted to move from the car to the bed. I couldn’t balance on my own, and became severely nauseous when upright or moving. My ear and back of my right shoulder were bruised, thus can be assumed that I fell directly on them. After 2 days the vertigo lessened significantly. I was able to walk slowly and by myself. I experienced and overwhelming sensation of tinnitus. To the extent that I struggled to hear in normal conditions, as it was so over powering.  Hearing didn’t return after a few weeks, went for an auditory test. The first ENT concluded that I had damaged the internal nerves. The second ENT had a different reason (I can’t recall). The same auditory test was done a few weeks later, but less of a distortion was heard. The audiologists didn’t think anything of this, and offered a cochlear implant.  Weeks after the incident, and after being cleaned by more than one specialist, an audiologist noted blood on my eardrum.  About 4 weeks after, for a few days, clear liquid uncontrollably expelled from my nose. I thought it to be sinuses, although I’d never experienced such problems. It was small amounts, but enough to need wiping away. It was completely clear and thin.  Within 6 weeks of the incident, I would hear loud noises in the right ear, but they would feel far away from the ear, as if the ear is hearing them, but not processing them as closely as it should. Sounds like drums, ie rather very loud.  I was cleared to fly in that time. While the aeroplane was descending, I was asleep and woken up to an extremely loud pop/bang in the broken ear. About a week later, after taking a shower, I felt something discharging from my ear. An ear bud revealed a watery, bloody substance.  I could hear very loud sounds, but they felt very far away and were not clear of perfect. Random clicking/tapping noise would be heard in broken ear, over the sound of tinnitus, and not as constant. Especially when getting up.  Strange tinnitus sounds were heard every now & again, a sound that sounded like something trying to connect. When I stood upright and held my head at a certain angle, the pressure in my broken ear would make me feel as if my head was going to explode, until I angled my head normally again.  November 2016 When touching my outer ear, the touch would trigger a shock to my tongue. At first it was subtle, but the feeling became more prominent and consistent. December 2016 I blew my nose normally (and quite hard) for the first time since the incident and heard my ear ‘pop’ for the first time. Before this, there was no sound at all, nor do I recall a feeling of eardrum movement. In a clavicle related check-up in September, a GP claimed that my eardrum was moving normally, but looking back, I don’t think he made the correct diagnosis.  Was driving long distances and ear felt like it wanted to equalise, sensation was slow, and didn’t feel relief. Felt like it went up to about 55%. January 2017 The shocking tongue sensation lessened, but transformed into moving my tongue from side to side causes a feeling of movement inside of my broken ear. I have this sensation to this day.  February onwards Feeling the need to equalise often, but to no avail. Pressure in head feels irritated, equalising eventually started working, but wasn’t always an optimal feeling. Mostly the pressure just felt better temporarily.  After equalising, I am able to hear loud sounds as a distortion. The sound is similar to that of bicycle training wheels, I hear this distortion until I swallow, and then everything cuts off again.  I started feeling a sharp pain in my ear and pain behind the bone of my ear. Ear often felt wet inside and itchy.  When pushing down on my tragus, sounds like it’s blocked and makes a wobbly echo at the end. Very loud and perfect sound, definitely not transferable over the skull to working ear.  Chewing sounds became very prominent, even in the broken ear. Could hear the water crashing to the floor in the shower, only certain sounds of, and sound felf far away, but still in the right ear.  Moving my head from side to side quickly, it sounds as if there is water inside the broken ear.  I started feeling like there is liquid running out of my ear, but it is completely dry.  July 2017 As time progressed, my tinnitus lessened immeasurably. Today, at times, I can barely hear it and is not affected by fatigue or external noise, as it was fir the first few months.  An accidental loud shout in the broken ear, and accidental slap, on several occasions, both caused the overwhelming tinnitus that I had first experienced and lasted a few days.  Found myself instinctively massaging the upper neck muscles on the right side. Physical exercise made my ear feel like it needs to equalise.  September 2017 I went to a loud music concert, the next day there was blood in right ear’s canal. I was working in a bar at the time, so loud music wasn’t something that I was completely estranged to, although this was louder than usual.  December 2017 Woke up to an extremely loud sound in ear. Like a bang or tear, its difficult to describe, but it was so loud that I lay still for a few minutes, scared to move as I thought I would break something.  January 2018 Can now hear my finger scratching in my ear canal. Isolated and clear, no distortion.  Can hear loud sounds like a blender, still not clear, but doesn’t feel as far away in skull as used to. Such loud sounds make my broken ear feel extremely uncomfortable afterwards. I start feeling sickly, as if I’m getting flu. The gland in my neck on the right side swells up and I feel like I’m getting a throat infection. This clears up after a few hours.  Feels as if there is a baby hair in my ear. Was given a neck massage and heard movement in ear – as if there was waves/ water in ear and moving.  February 2018 Equalised and for less than a second I could hear a “whole” sound – wasn’t distorted, and a lot closer than usual. Hasn’t happened again.  When I get out of bed very quickly, my tinnitus disappears for a few seconds. As if trying to find balance. Only happens sometimes.  Attended a ballet class and the jumps made my ear feel very uneasy.  1/20 times will actually feel relief when equalising.  May 2018 Hearing bones creek in broken ear, eg neck. Was listening to music, softly, could converse normally, picked up certain sounds as whistle sensations in broken ear.  Ear doesn’t produce any wax at all when compared to working ear. To this day I have done numerous auditory tests and seen 3 ENTs. None of them come to the same conclusion, nor have any interest in these strange symptoms. I don’t have a medical aid, so finding the right direction to go in has proved very challenging. After each hearing test, my tinnitus was excruciating."

Remember the fall and severe pain in chest and the need to fall asleep.  Approximately 15 minutes later a friend carried me to the car, I was able to speak normally, although slightly confused. About 5 minutes later I started feeling a severe pain in my clavicle, the pain worsened and a few minutes later the hearing in my right ear cut off completely. I was taken to the emergency room, it was concluded that I had broken my right clavicle. Paralysed and confused from the pain, I can’t recall if I mentioned the hearing problem. Whilst lying in the bed in the hospital, my right ear started bleeding. I had ruptured my ear drum. I also had a concussion and took me a while to recall what had happened.  X-rays were taken of my shoulder and skull; the only evident broken bones were my right clavicle.  I was released from the hospital, as I do not have a medical aid. I spent the rest of the day sleeping and vomiting in the backseat of the car. I had been drinking the night before and was given morphine.  At about 17h00 that day, I attempted to move from the car to the bed. I couldn’t balance on my own, and became severely nauseous when upright or moving. My ear and back of my right shoulder were bruised, thus can be assumed that I fell directly on them. After 2 days the vertigo lessened significantly. I was able to walk slowly and by myself. I experienced and overwhelming sensation of tinnitus. To the extent that I struggled to hear in normal conditions, as it was so over powering.  Hearing didn’t return after a few weeks, went for an auditory test. The first ENT concluded that I had damaged the internal nerves. The second ENT had a different reason (I can’t recall).

Remember the fall and severe pain in chest and the need to fall asleep.  Approximately 15 minutes later a friend carried me to the car, I was able to speak normally, although slightly confused. About 5 minutes later I started feeling a severe pain in my clavicle, the pain worsened and a few minutes later the hearing in my right ear cut off completely. I was taken to the emergency room, it was concluded that I had broken my right clavicle. Paralysed and confused from the pain, I can’t recall if I mentioned the hearing problem. Whilst lying in the bed in the hospital, my right ear started bleeding. I had ruptured my ear drum. I also had a concussion and took me a while to recall what had happened.  X-rays were taken of my shoulder and skull; the only evident broken bones were my right clavicle.  I was released from the hospital, as I do not have a medical aid. I spent the rest of the day sleeping and vomiting in the backseat of the car. I had been drinking the night before and was given morphine.  At about 17h00 that day, I attempted to move from the car to the bed. I couldn’t balance on my own, and became severely nauseous when upright or moving. My ear and back of my right shoulder were bruised, thus can be assumed that I fell directly on them. After 2 days the vertigo lessened significantly. I was able to walk slowly and by myself. I experienced and overwhelming sensation of tinnitus. To the extent that I struggled to hear in normal conditions, as it was so over powering.  Hearing didn’t return after a few weeks, went for an auditory test. The first ENT concluded that I had damaged the internal nerves. The second ENT had a different reason (I can’t recall). The same auditory test was done a few weeks later, but less of a distortion was heard. The audiologists didn’t think anything of this, and offered a cochlear implant.  Weeks after the incident, and after being cleaned by more than one specialist, an audiologist noted blood on my eardrum.  About 4 weeks after, for a few days, clear liquid uncontrollably expelled from my nose. I thought it to be sinuses, although I’d never experienced such problems. It was small amounts, but enough to need wiping away. It was completely clear and thin.  Within 6 weeks of the incident, I would hear loud noises in the right ear, but they would feel far away from the ear, as if the ear is hearing them, but not processing them as closely as it should. Sounds like drums, ie rather very loud.  I was cleared to fly in that time. While the aeroplane was descending, I was asleep and woken up to an extremely loud pop/bang in the broken ear. About a week later, after taking a shower, I felt something discharging from my ear. An ear bud revealed a watery, bloody substance.  I could hear very loud sounds, but they felt very far away and were not clear of perfect. Random clicking/tapping noise would be heard in broken ear, over the sound of tinnitus, and not as constant. Especially when getting up.  Strange tinnitus sounds were heard every now & again, a sound that sounded like something trying to connect. When I stood upright and held my head at a certain angle, the pressure in my broken ear would make me feel as if my head was going to explode, until I angled my head normally again.  November 2016 When touching my outer ear, the touch would trigger a shock to my tongue. At first it was subtle, but the feeling became more prominent and consistent. December 2016 I blew my nose normally (and quite hard) for the first time since the incident and heard my ear ‘pop’ for the first time. Before this, there was no sound at all, nor do I recall a feeling of eardrum movement. In a clavicle related check-up in September, a GP claimed that my eardrum was moving normally, but looking back, I don’t think he made the correct diagnosis.  Was driving long distances and ear felt like it wanted to equalise, sensation was slow, and didn’t feel relief. Felt like it went up to about 55%. January 2017 The shocking tongue sensation lessened, but transformed into moving my tongue from side to side causes a feeling of movement inside of my broken ear. I have this sensation to this day.  February onwards Feeling the need to equalise often, but to no avail. Pressure in head feels irritated, equalising eventually started working, but wasn’t always an optimal feeling. Mostly the pressure just felt better temporarily.  After equalising, I am able to hear loud sounds as a distortion. The sound is similar to that of bicycle training wheels, I hear this distortion until I swallow, and then everything cuts off again.  I started feeling a sharp pain in my ear and pain behind the bone of my ear. Ear often felt wet inside and itchy.  When pushing down on my tragus, sounds like it’s blocked and makes a wobbly echo at the end. Very loud and perfect sound, definitely not transferable over the skull to working ear.  Chewing sounds became very prominent, even in the broken ear. Could hear the water crashing to the floor in the shower, only certain sounds of, and sound felf far away, but still in the right ear.  Moving my head from side to side quickly, it sounds as if there is water inside the broken ear.  I started feeling like there is liquid running out of my ear, but it is completely dry.  July 2017 As time progressed, my tinnitus lessened immeasurably. Today, at times, I can barely hear it and is not affected by fatigue or external noise, as it was fir the first few months.  An accidental loud shout in the broken ear, and accidental slap, on several occasions, both caused the overwhelming tinnitus that I had first experienced and lasted a few days.  Found myself instinctively massaging the upper neck muscles on the right side. Physical exercise made my ear feel like it needs to equalise.  September 2017 I went to a loud music concert, the next day there was blood in right ear’s canal. I was working in a bar at the time, so loud music wasn’t something that I was completely estranged to, although this was louder than usual.  December 2017 Woke up to an extremely loud sound in ear. Like a bang or tear, its difficult to describe, but it was so loud that I lay still for a few minutes, scared to move as I thought I would break something.  January 2018 Can now hear my finger scratching in my ear canal. Isolated and clear, no distortion.  Can hear loud sounds like a blender, still not clear, but doesn’t feel as far away in skull as used to. Such loud sounds make my broken ear feel extremely uncomfortable afterwards. I start feeling sickly, as if I’m getting flu. The gland in my neck on the right side swells up and I feel like I’m getting a throat infection. This clears up after a few hours.  Feels as if there is a baby hair in my ear. Was given a neck massage and heard movement in ear – as if there was waves/ water in ear and moving.  February 2018 Equalised and for less than a second I could hear a “whole” sound – wasn’t distorted, and a lot closer than usual. Hasn’t happened again.  When I get out of bed very quickly, my tinnitus disappears for a few seconds. As if trying to find balance. Only happens sometimes.  Attended a ballet class and the jumps made my ear feel very uneasy.  1/20 times will actually feel relief when equalising.  May 2018 Hearing bones creek in broken ear, eg neck. Was listening to music, softly, could converse normally, picked up certain sounds as whistle sensations in broken ear.  Ear doesn’t produce any wax at all when compared to working ear. To this day I have done numerous auditory tests and seen 3 ENTs. None of them come to the same conclusion, nor have any interest in these strange symptoms. I don’t have a medical aid, so finding the right direction to go in has proved very challenging. After each hearing test, my tinnitus was excruciating."

I used to sleep 7-8 hours.  I used some sleep apps like snore lab and among the few I used it either said I did not snore or was a very light snorer. I also have very vivid dreams every night that I am able to recall, I saw that was something people with apnea generally don't have.  However a few things make me nervous and suspect I might have it, one would be obviously feeling tired not enough to sleep but still fatigued, another would be I sometimes grind my teeth when I sleep and generally I wake up with my mouth open. When I am anxious and have appointments I need to get to early I will wake up 5 times beforehand. I also wake up with a tight chest but no rapid heart rate had an ekg and stress ekg done and both came back perfectly fine.

I slept maybe 2-3 hours across the three nights (only 30 minutes the last night). I was having auditory/visual hallucinations and some pretty severe emotional problems by the end of it.  But eventually, I got to the place I was staying and slept for 3 hours or so that afternoon (Thursday). When I got up, I noticed my body was shaking--I'd describe it as similar to shivering with a slower back-and-forth of muscle contraction.  In the 3 days since Thursday, especially after I wake up, I get these tremors and sometimes they stick around all day but aren't as severe. I've also been getting night sweats, which isn't usual for me.  I have peripheral neuropathy of unknown origin as well; all my major organs/nutrients are in check. Blood sugar is fine too and has been tested numerous times. I've been worried about it as I've been having fatigue and low blood pressure for a few months, and both started out of the blue and come and go for months at a time. A digression, possibly, but I included it in case it sheds more light on my problem post-sleep deprivation.  My question is, does anyone know how long the effects of acute and severe sleep deprivation last? I'd read that tremors can result from sleep dep, but I was under the impression it happens during, not after. Anyone had any experience with it? Thanks!"

I had to lay on the floor for a little bit as my whole body still felt numb and I couldn't get up, I couldn't even crawl I was just stuck in that position that I fell in. I never have had sleep paralysis, and I didn't have any nightmares or feelings of fear, so I don't think that was what it was.

These bumps are all over my tongue including the sides and underneath it and slowly seems to be getting bigger in some spots. There is also bumps on the roof of my mouth that are abrely noticeable. Also the weirdest thing to me is that I will get sores on the inside of my cheeks one day and the next it would be gone. This comes and goes and is not consistent. I don't know if this has anything to deal with it but I have been havng a lot of troubles falling asleep and waking up, my ears have been hurting randomly, I get dizzy a lot and have constant headaches that sometimes come with nausea and I would get really shaky.

It did help reduce my AHI from 50's to mid-20's, but my sleeping has not improved and I continue to wake up throughout the night and feel fatigued in the morning, day and night. I've lost my mental sharpness and have become very irritable which has taken its toll on me personally and professionally.  So I did an experiment in an effort to narrow down the scope of what is causing my issues. I live in Colorado and wondered if altitude was an influencer. I recently travelled to Mexico on vacation and thought I would test my Oxygen levels between two drastic elevations (6300ft and Sea Level).  I didn't notice a difference in my sleep per se, but I did wake up much easier and with much more energy, unlike at home. What is interesting is that while I was at sea level, my SPO2 levels seem normal, hardly ever dropping below 90% (less than 1% of the time). However when at altitude, my SPO2 falls below 90%, which totalled 50 - 70% of my sleep time. See visualization (bar chart) My doctor wanted to put me on oxygen but of course insurance denied it (...to be continued). I'm considering if I need to move to lower altitude in order to get better sleep or if my sleep apnea and low SPO2 is a symptom of a much larger issue. I feel like I have to manage my own health because my Primary and Sleep Specialist want to treat the symptoms and not the issue.  Any thoughts or insights?"

If I travel overseas and get jet lagged, I may sleep later for a while, but as soon as my body clock gets reset, I am back to my usual early bird schedule.

If it is inherited, wouldn't most sufferers have the problem all their lives as I have had? Are there any other younger folks like me who have it? Or am I basically alone in having this problem at my age? If anyone else has had this problem, what has helped? Only advice I could find in online research is to turn on bright lights at night (which would only mean I get to bed later, but still wake up early, and so get less sleep - not helpful in the long run), and to use dark curtains to shut out the light in the morning (which I am doing, and it helps a little, but not much since I am awake before it starts to get light anyway).  Medication is a possibility, some suggested Melatonin, but I don't want medication. Especially if it makes sleepy for too long in the mornings. I don't mind being an early bird- within reason!

484,C0016053,Fibromyalgia,"C0596601, C0015672, C3714552","gastrointestinal gas, Fatigue, Weakness",https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/51962/where-would-i-get-this-extraordinary-smelling-ability-tested,Where would I get this extraordinary smelling ability tested?,"My age is 49, my sex is male, and I am caucasian. All indications are that I have an extremely rare ability (not sure even how rare, I am sure other people have it, but I could be the only person on the planet to do it at this extreme) autustic ability regarding smell. Before you read this, please do not dismiss what I am about to say as impossible, because I already had some of this ability tested at my doctor's office and it has atleast been verified that I can do it well enough that it is beyond a normal person's abilities. Furthermore my parents have witnessed me do it all my life. And lastly it took like 8 hours of search on the internet (thats how rare it is to find info on this) to find a reference by a medical doctor who talks about a rare occurence with fibromyalgia that can also happen with autistic patients because of how both disabilities effect the central nervous system. As I understand it, some fibromyalgia and autistic patients only require maybe a 1000th of the stimuli from a sensory gland of a normal person to detect something, because of how their central nervous system gets stimulated so much more easily or reacts much more faster (not sure which). The reference on the internet I found speaks of fibromyalgia patients who can hear the humming of the ballast tubes in flourescent lights that no normal human can hear, because of their central nervous system. That reference also refers to the possibility of it also effecting a fibromyalgia or autistic's sense of smell. In my case, almost all my senses are effected to some extent but smell seems to be effected the greatest. Let me give some examples. When I was around 18. I was in my bedoom behind a closed door, with tape all over the door to keep smells out (thats how sensitive I am to smells), and I am like 40 feet away from the kitchen and my sister cooks a tv dinner (like fish with white wine source). Both my mother and sister are standing 3 or 4 feet from the microwave and can't smell the alcohol. I smell it behind the taped door in my bedoom, from 40 feet away. I also smell odors thru walls, thru pipes, etc. Recently, just happened a couple months ago, I smelled something like a dead animal when I was in a car (the smell was overwhelming to me). Both my parents were in the front of the car and couldn't smell something that was overwhelming to me, and it wasn't until the moving car went for another couple minutes that my parents could finally smell it. So maybe 200 to 300 feet or perhaps more feet in distance before they could pick up the smell. Just another case of how much farther away I can smell stuff then normal people. And as I mentioned earlier my doctors office tested and verified that I wasn't just imagining this ability. I go to a therapist for my autism. The therapist told me that he put a tiny amount of cleaning stuff on a chair to test me (I was unaware that he did it until after the test was over). A patient came in 15 minutes later, and even sat in the chair and could not smell it. Then a patient came in an hour later and sat in chair, and couldn't smell it. Then another in 2 hours, then another in 3 hours. I came in 4 hours later and smelled it, as soon as I opened the door, and could even state where the smell is coming from, the chair. The same therapist also tested me another 20 to 30 times, and each time I correctly identified the smell, and it was a smell that was too weak for normal people to pick up. And today, believe it or not, I smelled better then a gas detection meter. I'm getting tired of typing so will summarize quickly. I lived next to gas stoves for 32.5 years and never reported a gas leak. What are the mathematical odds, if you pick a random day in 32. 5 years to just report that you smell gas and there really is a leak, and it is just coincidence? The gas man is saying it is impossible because his meter (which apparently isn't as accurate as me) didn't pick up the smell in the hallway, when I smelled gas coming from a neighbor's apartment. Never reported something like this in 32.5 years of being around gas stoves. The day I reported it, the gas man, goes into the apartment and checks the stove and there is a leak (I was correct). And just to be clear again: I walked in front of every apartment in the building, didn't smell gas at any, except for the one where the gas man actually said there was a leak and I never reported a gas leak in 32.5 years of being around gas stoves. It would be around a 1 in 60,000 (or higher) mathematical probability that it was done by random chance. The gas detection meter couldn't detect the gas in the hallway, but the only way I could of known which apartment out of all of them in the building had the leak, and the only way I could of reported this on the correct day of the leak (when I never reported a gas leak in 32.5 years) is it was NOT random chance or coincidence.

It has happened for about a year now. I have been to an ENT doctor and an allergist. No allergies were found in two tests and the ent doctor found nothing when he put a camera in my nose and down my throat. While looking in my mouth for the pain, I noticed large white masses behind the arches in the back of my mouth (sides of the back wall of mouth). Sometimes they are smaller and I can barely see them. When the pain is bad however, they are huge and protrude past the arches. I believe they might be related to my pain. Can anyone identify these lumps? My phone won’t let me upload the image of my throat so here is a link."

Headaches and shaking came back but I also started to find it hard to focus. Still no fever. The doctor gave me a Z Pack but told me to wait 3 days to take it cuz my ear looked fine and I didn't have a fever; that this could be a viral infection.  I waited but only got worse so I took the Z pack and noticed really quick improvements. I swear I could feel it fizzing inside of my face, jaw, and back of my head. But again, by the time I took the last pill it seemed that I was on the verge of getting fully cured, just the tiniest of pain on the back of my head.  I felt fine for maybe 5 days but then the cycle started again. Severe headaches, stiff neck so bad that I couldn't rest my head on my pillow to sleep, I had to sleep in a seated position. Again it was hard to focus and I would have some confusion. Twice I went to my car and opened the passenger's side door instead of driver's side.

Towards the end of our trip, she developed a cold, which I caught two days later. Up to a couple of days ago, I was exhibiting normal cold-like symptoms: lightly scratchy sore throat, mild cough, and sinus congestion. I was given an over-the-counter medication in France that is similar to Mucinex, and I've been taking that for about six days.  Upon my arrival home four days ago, I was feeling much better but noticed that the congestion had moved to my ears and seemingly stagnated. Yesterday I woke up with mild balance issues and vertigo. I went about my day normally, but was nauseous by the end of the day.  Late last night, I quickly developed chills that got worse over time. Thinking I probably had a fever, I took my temperature and was shocked to see that it was 96.3 degrees. I was slowly getting colder. I immediately put un multiple layers of clothing and a heavy blanket and was able to get myself back into the 98 degree range after about four hours. My questions are these: Could my sudden drop in temperature be related to my cold and possible inner-ear issues? If not, what could it have been caused by? Could my inner-ear issues be caused by something other than my cold and congestion? P.S.  My girlfriend is now fine, and did not exhibit any ear or temperature problems when she had her cold."

I had been in great health, take ballroom dance lesdons. Started having abdominal GI dic could not diagnose. Suggested I take another Lorazapam. Then, when I had to have some minor surgery I was told to stop all meds. I did not know benzos must be withdrawn very slowly I had major withdrawal symptoms. A psychiatrist treated me by switching to Clonazapam, another benxo, and added Effexor for panic attacks and withdrawal symptoms. Only then did I learn you have to detox from Benzos AND Effexor very gradually. I am finally off the Effexor and it has been terrible. Even 2 weeks later I have symptoms. Now I must tsper off the Clonaxapam too. Very tired all the time. I recently learned that antibiotics in the Cipro family cannot be used with Benzos. I have needed them before so I really feel I must get off the Benzos entirely. I fo not know how long it will take or what to do about the insomnia if it returned. Basically I am saying don't take Benzos other that for acute medical reasons. You can become addicted in a week. The withdrawal symptoms are worse than any reason you take them forbut docs throw them at you for anything related to dleep and stress. It has been a year until I learned my illness was from the drugs prescribed."

She had ran into the room, and before I tell you what happened after she went in I want to notify you that I did not wake up during or right after the incident and did not notice anything strange when I did wake up. So as I was saying, she went in and saw me choking in my sleep, even not breathing at all. She said she went on the bed next to me and tried grabbing my arms to shake or move me, but when she did she told me my muscles were VERY stiff. She told me she was afraid to even grab it and forcefully moved it because she though that if she did she would end up breaking something. So instead she grabbed my shoulders, started shaking me and screaming my name because she said that she had felt that my soul/spirit was drifting away as if I was dying in my sleep even. This has happened on 2 occasions and I'm worried it could be something serious or I have anything similar or do have sleep apnea. Like my arms she said my whole entire body was stiff like I was a statue. I wasn't even moving or slightly shaking but as I said, very stiff. This went on for what she had told me a few minutes and the scene ended. After I still stayed sleeping and I peacefully released my body from the stiff stance for the rest of the night. It's only started happening and that last one was a few months ago. It's a rare occasion and I have no idea if it's even happened again since I don't wake up during this. I also wanted to note I had one or two occasions of feeling like I am trapped on my bed and can't move, then see a black shadow or creature walk across my room. During this scene I didn't have those common terrified thoughts it was more like empty, but now thinking back on it, it was actually really scary. And by posting this my goal is to figure out why I had this and what conditions are possible to cause this, I hope you find an answer to my question."

All came back with no abnormal results. I still have a pending sleep study that will be looking for sleep apnea. I do not have a known cause yet, but I was out drinking the night before my flight and dealt with a big hangover, lack of good sleep, didn't eat much the whole day, and didn't drink a ton of water as I was nauseous that entire day leading up to my flight (the night after I was out drinking).

I ended up at the front desk with the help of some other person staying at the hotel and they took care of me and got me back in my room, but I had no idea what was going on and only loosely recall where I was and what I did. The hotel called my room the next day to check on me and that solidified to me what happened. That was the first time something like that ever happened to me and happened the first week I was in this hotel.

I have a history of wax build-up. My doctor treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide and warm water rinse. I left the Dr's office with ear still blocked. He said it would take a few days to clear up. I am almost into day 3 and I hear a constant high pitch sound while the ear is getting better as for the blockage. Should I just be patient and maybe the sound will disappear as the blockage gets better? I have not ruled out a possible upper respiratory problem as I have had a cough for a few weeks also. I have full confidence in my PCP and will follow up with him tomorrow. Just wondering if anyone has had a similar situation? Any reply would be greatly appreciated.

It happens when I'm just about ready to fall asleep and then it will start. Its not a pain or a twinge or an uneasy leg. Its not constant but comes in a cycle about every 7-10 seconds and it doesn't happen all the time. Its this uncomfortable non painful withdrawal type of uneasy feeling that just makes you uncomfortable throughout mostly the middle part of your body seemingly emanating mostly from between the legs and prostate area but will also effect arms and hands. Its like the blood in those parts every 10 seconds or so just is uncomfortable and very annoying to where you can't be comfortable enough to sleep. Im sorry its hard to explain. Its weird because if i stand up or walk around i can't sense it. It only happens when I lay relaxed in bed. If you move when it happens it will kind of subside but like i said it'll come back around in 7-10 seconds. It kind of makes you want to stretch or kind of flex the area that it effects to deal with it when it comes. When I first starting getting it I thought it was alcohol withdrawals of some kind and it centered in the lower genital anal area. Its been effecting me for years now and it will move up into the arms and hands at times and it so uncomfortable. The arms and hands area makes the hands a little tickle and light but just makes you want to make a fist when it comes. The only thing that has seemed to help it when it comes is head to the fridge and chow down on food and snacks because it feels like my body needs something. And usually that will take care of it but lately it hasn't. I don't have any medical conditions and I haven't drank in over a week and it hit me last night bad so its not alcohol related i don't believe. I take a benadryl every now and then to help me sleep and haven't kept tabs on whether that may cause but last night I did take one and it hit after the benadryl wore off because it didn't put me to sleep. But it has happened without taking benadryl obviously just as frequent so not sure if thats it either. Any help or input or suggestions about this will be very welcome!

No runny nose etc. I put in 3 drops of Otosporin in my ear to ease the pain and till night, the pain was gone. Though the very next morning when I woke up, I felt like I was hyper sensitive to sounds. Higher pitch sounds like horns, female voice and etc were causing me irritation as I felt they were too loud. Beside that, there was a constant ringing sound in my ear like a sharp dial tone which couldnt let me concentrate on anything. It was way more loud in silent places and make it very hard for me to fall asleep.  I went to see an ENT, he prescribed me few meds and said just take meds and it will be fine. I am taking those meds, its been 3 days and I havent seen any improvement. I can still hear that ringing sound and hypersensitivity to sound is present.  Since yesterday, my both ears feel more blocked like an air or fluid pressure or something.  Please assist me on this and suggest something. Its getting hard to live with day by day.  Thanks."

I've experienced this issue at other times throughout my life but this current time is the longest and worst it's been. It has been getting steadily worse since November and now also occurs noticeably during the day. I have been taking 25mg of trazodone before bed but it's not really working anymore. I have always felt this issue is connected to my heart as I have been diagnosed with moderate mitral valve regurgitation, which causes palpitations and skipped beats, but have never gotten confirmation of a link to this adrenaline sensation even after countless tests. I have anxiety associated with my heart but I'm tired of being told this sensation is caused by anxiety alone. I exercise regularly, never have caffeine, and in my normal life I do not typically have any issue falling asleep.  I'm currently waiting to undergo a sleep study as well as wear a holter monitor as I'm concerned there may be an arrhythmia associated with/causing this. I'm also getting my cortisol levels tested to see if there's an overproduction issue at fault here.  Has anyone else experienced this and/or found a solution?"

However, since then I developed difficulty falling asleep and when I do getting up every two hours. I am someone who used to sleep like a rock. I also got dx with bruxism at my dentist's office. In addition, during wakefulness if I am going over a bridge or high overpass, I get the same feeling as being thrown out of bed but feel like the car is going to go over the bridge and always to the right. This causes a tremendous amount of anxiety and fear. I am normally a very calm person and don't feel depressed. I was very active and never had fears of overpasses, didn't like bridges but managed them without these experiences. Never had fears of driving. All of these things seem to be connected. I drank wine to get to sleep initially but felt tired the next day and then asked my PCP for a sleeping pill and got Ambien. I hate taking medications or alcohol for sleep.

When I described my symptoms he said it might be a retinal tear so they took photos of my retinas and did ultrasounds on my eyes, but didn't find anything. I still felt like my eyes were bothering me but now in the form of occasional blurry vision and increased floaters, but I thought it was probably just in my head. I suffer from anxiety and have been sure I had something terrible going on when it was really nothing before, but it's been under control and that hasn't happened for the last 3-4 years.

But I finally went to my doctor because in the past those symptoms have always gone away within a few hours once the anxiety passed. But now I'm starting to worry because they've lasted for a few weeks. These symptoms also feel a lot more intense than what I felt during past anxiety. I went to my regular doctor and had a hard time describing what was going on because I didn't take the time before hand to sort it out and write it down. He ended up checking my vitals and looking in my ears. He found fluid behind my ear drums and said that one looked discolored, a grayish color. He said that I have a sinus infection and prescribed antibiotics. I haven't taken them because I don't really have any symptoms of a sinus infection other than the brief headache that has been gone for weeks and I really don't want to take antibiotics for nothing. I'm hoping someone can tell me if the symptoms I described really are common for a sinus infection, and that could be what's going on even with no stuffy nose, no post nasal drip, and no sensation of pressure.

This lab test shows the way Narcolepsy sleep patterns function.  In a non-narcoleptic sleep cycle the person will fall asleep without much trouble though it may take about 15-20 minutes. Then once asleep they will reach REM sleep in approximately 4hours. Then they will slowly cycle up toward a wakened state but never very close.

It simply means that they don't remember dreaming. For those of you who remember dreaming it is in the early morning as our sleep cycles shorten and reaching REM becomes quickest.

You may experience blurry vision, social or other anxiety and many other hindrances.

Often misdiagnosed by physicians and self diagnosis alike as insomnia or poor sleep habits etc.  Most people do not get the 7-9 hours sleep recommended for healthy individuals. So actually getting referred to a sleep lab twice is unusual as it is fluffed off as ""who isn't tired?"" The first lab is to rule out sleep apnea among other sleep disorders and second to rule out Narcolepsy (where in addition to sleeping overnight, one is to take 4 naps all of which I fell asleep in under a minute after 8 hours of sleeping the previous night).  This lab test shows the way Narcolepsy sleep patterns function.  In a non-narcoleptic sleep cycle the person will fall asleep without much trouble though it may take about 15-20 minutes. Then once asleep they will reach REM sleep in approximately 4hours. Then they will slowly cycle up toward a wakened state but never very close. Throughout the night they will head down into REM slightly sooner then the sleep cycle prior and sooner and sooner as the night progresses. We dream in REM sleep though don't recall these dreams as REM is reached more gradually than in Narcoleptics. Many people surprisingly say they don't dream. They do. It simply means that they don't remember dreaming. For those of you who remember dreaming it is in the early morning as our sleep cycles shorten and reaching REM becomes quickest. Wakefulness and Dreaming often blend together and we remember dreams that were most likely only seconds but felt like hours.  For Narcoleptics, we reach our first REM in under one minute and wake up and these cycles repeat all night long. Creating confusion between what is a dream and what is real, causing terrifying night terrors, sleep paralysis and many other things.  For example I will reach for a drink of water, fall asleep while still holding the glass, dream that what's in my hand is something else and drop it all over me, the bed and the floor. I try to stay awake to clean up the mess and fall asleep and wake up on the other side of my room.  So, there are pharmaceuticals that can help us to try and stay asleep ""fake sleep"" and meds that try and keep us awake during the day ""fake awake"". Never do we ever achieve actual restorative sleep.  Think of when you missed one nights sleep, does your brain function well the next day? No! You may experience blurry vision, social or other anxiety and many other hindrances. Narcoleptics describe as I have, double vision, confusion, hallucinations and always a desire to sit at least if not lye down to avoid falling over. (Btw never enough seats provided in public places.) It is one of several ""invisible"" illnesses where people say you look well, while inside you are feeling horrible.  People also say ""Oh, I get tired too!"" Which may come from an empathetic place though Narcolepsy is much more than being tired. The truth is even when we tell someone that we have Narcolepsy, most people just stare at you because most people don't know what it is.  So my end point to this long message if you made it here is to never judge others. We just don't have all the facts to make those assumptions. Also if you have experienced trouble sleeping for more than 2 weeks see a doctor and ask for a referral to a sleep lab.  I went to rule out sleep apnea and discovered this.

It would take too long to describe all so will keep it to the so-called recent past. 8 years ago my Mom was diagnosed with colon cancer. I had moved her to my place from So. CA, USA to No. CA, USA. When she grew ill once she was out of the hospital (after a month, in which I sat bed side daily) I tried to take care of her at home. Even ended up sleeping with her, so I could hear her call for assistance if she needed it. I was sleeping ok, but naturally was tired from the stress. She passed, scared and in a convalescent home. I lost my home and had to live in an RV. Moved from an RV park due to close living and no privacy. When there at RV park, I started getting panic attacks at night which would wake me up. Sought out Psych. Doctor. Gave me buproprion and klonopin. The klonopin was taken when the panic attack would awake me nightly. I moved. sadly I ended up on an illegal pot farm with other tenants who abused heavy drugs and alcohol and fought physically at times. My land lady was a narcissist and would scream and be delusional and just plain mean. She hated I'm a vegan and generally a quiet, keep to myself person and would badger me. I could not move due to financial reasons, although I kept looking. One cannot live looking over one's should daily and avoiding or trying to, the harassment and yes, at time sexual advances from other tenants. Many tenants came and went due to the activity on property. (lucky them!) I lived with this for over 7 years and except for exactly 6 'windows' of normal sleep, I never had a restful nights sleep. Kept seeking out new doctors to help to no avail. After 7 1/2 years I finally got subsidized housing and it is far, far better than where I had been and I thought I would get better. I'm better in that I'm not being harassed and am beginning to make friends though I need much quiet time. BUT I still spend nights shaking and awaken very early and pace the floor, so I turn on TV and make my morning health shake (plant proteins/banana/blueberries) These activities ease the shaking but I'm so very tired of never getting quality sleep. No one seems to be able to help. I just got a new Doctor and had a blood panel done and will see him in a week or so. I don't want to go on more drugs. He understands that and will try and work with me. I take magnesium, B12, tryptophan, melatonin and a herbal tincture for sleep aid. Yep I'm now having a glass of wine before bed, I'm that desperate. Is this shaking and tension Generalized Anxiety Disorder or PTSD? I'm so very sick of being tired. BTW my sister was just diagnosed with breast cancer and I helped take care of her and her home and now walking her through radiation treatments by just being there with her. I am reaching out to my new neighbors and use the computer in the common area and visit, but I can only take so much interaction and need to retire to my living space. I dread nights, but need what sleep I can. Anyone have similar symptoms? Suggestions? Thanks!!!"

The main thing is that her nose is awfully congested and runny (if she leans back, you can see how filled and overflowing it is). She also has a minor wet cough, but that is much more manageable. By now we have figured out quite the ""system"" - since she needs to blow her nose every 2-10 minutes (no joke), she has packs of tissues in her desk and bag at school, there are boxes all over my house, and at dance, she makes sure there is always a box in the studio she's dancing in. But she is very uncomfortable. And now as she's becoming a more competitive dancer, competitions have been very difficult for us (for her solo, she was blowing her nose until she went on stage and I was ready with a tissue backstage for when she came off) and we are still too scared to send her to a convention. And it doesn't help that she can't breathe through her nose, so she gets out of breath so quickly.  We can't really travel with her or even go on day trips because of this. When we went on a ski trip, she skied one day, constantly stopping on the hill for tissues and water (her throat gets so dry because of her heavy mouth breathing) and she came home with the messiest face mask and jacket I've ever seen. She didn't ski another day. And when we went to Florida, she was in the room for most of the day because she couldn't really swim. And car/plane rides are miserable.   The coping mechanisms we've developed so far, besides keeping tissues handy at all times, have been a) we do a sinus rinse every few days (haven't found this to be helpful) b) she does nasal spray five times a day (7, 11, 2:30, 6 or 7, before bed) which we have found to be helpful, but you're supposed to clear your nose before which she can't really do.. c) she will occasionally take a decongestant. Her nose is also so red and raw from blowing it like 2 or 3 hundred times a day so we put stuff on it for her whenever she needs it. And she has an inhaler for when her cough is bad.  We've gone to our doctor and some specialists and the only answer they've had has been that it is very severe nonallergic rhinitis and that something is causing her mucus to rapidly overproduce (I know, gross!). They say surgery couldn't help because it's not about her adenoids or anything like that. So, do you guys have any ideas of what could be causing this or any ideas for some more coping mechanisms to help? Thank you so much :)"

He is a very friendly, active, and happy boy that never seems to tire. In our home we have a very consistant schedule. We eat dinner between 6pm and 7pm and my three children get about a hour to hour and a half of screen time from the time we get home until 730 when we put screens away at which point we brush teeth, get on pjs and then go to their room for quiet play, stories and what have you. They don't particularily like having the TV off or screens away but thats the rules. 830pm is strictly lights out and although my other two children have no problem going to bed (our 4 and 6 in same room) my 3 1/2 year old will throw a fit and cry. When that stops it is constantly coming out wanting something, anything he can think of he gets told no and brought back to bed and each time he throws a fit crying and rolling out of bed. Eventually he will give up coming out but then will sit up playing in his room with anything he can. By the time we actually get him to sleep its between 12pm and 2am. He gets up every morning between 8am and 830am for daycare/school. We resorted to using melatonin which doesn't seem to even affect him unless he is receiving 4-5 pills of 5mg doses and thats not something I want to be giving to him regularly. What else can I do? What can help? Should I take him to see a sleep Specialist or is this common?"

I had a lot of ear infections as a kid, so I had the tubes in my ears several different times. My ears have never been the same since then. If I yawn or swallow, my ears pop. When they pop, I hear everything very muffled until I sniff in and it is like something closes and then I can hear regular. I recently saw an ENT specialist and I definitely have some hearing loss. She had me pop my ears and she said that when I do that a bubble forms outward. She told me not to force my ears to pop, but sometimes I need to do that and then sniff in several times before my ears go back to normal. She did say that to help my hearing, I can either get a hearing aid or try the tubes, but she can't guarantee that if I get the tubes in my ears, the popping will stop. If I had anyway of knowing that the popping would stop, I would have it done in a minute. I would like to find out if there is anything I can do to help stop my ears from popping or to at least reduce the popping. I have had this all of my adult life.

I had a lot of ear infections as a kid, so I had the tubes in my ears several different times. My ears have never been the same since then. If I yawn or swallow, my ears pop. When they pop, I hear everything very muffled until I sniff in and it is like something closes and then I can hear regular. I recently saw an ENT specialist and I definitely have some hearing loss. She had me pop my ears and she said that when I do that a bubble forms outward. She told me not to force my ears to pop, but sometimes I need to do that and then sniff in several times before my ears go back to normal. She did say that to help my hearing, I can either get a hearing aid or try the tubes, but she can't guarantee that if I get the tubes in my ears, the popping will stop. If I had anyway of knowing that the popping would stop, I would have it done in a minute. I would like to find out if there is anything I can do to help stop my ears from popping or to at least reduce the popping. I have had this all of my adult life. I am 54 years old, so it has been going on for a long time. For the most part, I am using nasal spray and taking a decongestant when needed to help with the muffled hearing.

Hello I am a F 26YO. I have suffered from severe lack of breath for about 13months now. It started when I was pregnant and I am not 6m post partum and still struggling.  I have severe shortness of breath and irregular breathing for about 80% (sometimes more, sometimes less) of my waking day. Sometimes I breath in so deep and so hard that my ears pop and unpop, and I can continue in that state for an hour or more trying to regulate my breathing and unpop my ears permanently. Sometimes my breathing is so messed a whole hand or side of my body will go numb like I’m having a stroke. Sometimes my chest gets very tight and I feel I really won’t be able to catch my breath. I often think I’m going to pass out or choke but I never do. When I was pregnant it manifested itself as a dry cough which I had for 6m straight, literally from lack of breath. It affects my life as I can be rude or snappy to people when I’m trying to regulate my breathing, and I’m often not present in what’s going on. Plus all the hard deep breathing is causing pain in my back. I have been to three different doctors and all of them have diagnosed anxiety (something I have struggled with in different forms for 11years). They think it’s this because i seem to be fine when I sleep and for the first 10 minutes when I wake from sleeping, and if I am very preoccupied (in some situations). I have been diagnosed escitocitalopram 20mg for the anxiety. I’ve been on it for around 10 months (or longer) with no success. In my country you only qualify for free/subsidised non-medical counselling help if you are depressed and on the verge of suicide. Other than my days being hard work because I can’t breathe I have a happy life and am not depressed hence why I cannot get counselling. In my country doctors are extremely overworked and I’m concerned they have overlooked something hence why after 13 months I am still struggling. I can’t do another year of this, please help !"

He told me to sit upside down on my head on a couch, push and blow air into my head as hard as I could while he held my ears closed, and I held my nose and mouth closed so the air had nowhere to go. I did not see rainbows.  Since I am not there, hypothetically speaking what kind of damage could have occured from doing this? I've heard others online say things like herniated sinus, damage to vagus nerve, cranial damage, etc. I've also heard people say anxiety, but my eyes become bloodshot after bending over, that's a direct physiological response, I don't just have anxiety. I would like to know what to tell the doctor or what kind of tests I should have. I've told him and haven't been referred to anyone for it. I'll be seeing a physical therapist in a month for my back, I'll tell him about the head or nasal issues.  Symptoms: When I bend over forward or tilt my head too far (other triggers too see below) my eyes become red and burn, vision a little blurred. I feel pain somewhere I think in my nasal cavity. I feel like there is some kind of unequal pressure in my head and pain as I move it around like my brain is swollen or it feels like I have painful moving jelly in my head. It becomes a lot harder to think, foggy thinking. I have difficulties remembering things. While its happening I have a lot less energy, my heart feels stressed if I try to run while feeling like this, I feel a throbbing sensation in my fingers and other places. Sudden or inconsistent sounds and or lights feel like they are ""grabbing"" at my heart or cause a little pain in my head. Some kind of slight epilepsy? (I also had a head injury a little before then see below) I think I've had a couple of small seizures. I feel like I need to keep my head as level as I can and can't tilt it past a certain point.  Also when laying down I get tiny air bubbles that trickle out of one of my nostrils making a tick, tick sound, even when I hold my breath, doesn't seem to be coming from my lungs. Not sure if that's related.  Symptom Triggers: Some are stronger than others. If I bend over and it triggers the symptoms, that can last all day. Other triggers don't make it last as long.  Pushing when pooping or farting. Tilting my head too far. Breathing through my nose or blowing my nose. Swallowing. Sucking. Sneezing.  ----- Now years later with a possible back injury, when walking I feel pain in my heels (does not radiate throughout legs) each time I feel pain in my heels I feel a corresponding pain in my head. It seems like Sciatica, except from what I've read Sciatica doesn't radiate to the head. Rolling my heels slightly, or being on uneven surfaces feels like it pinches my heels and at the same time causes a pinching pain feeling in my head and each step triggers some or all of the above symptoms temporarily or for longer time.  Before all of this when I was in 7th grade I was running fast in the hallway at school. I dropped my lunch box outward and while running I bent over to attempt to retrieve it and with my head tilted down I hit my head on the corner of a wall hard. I then had a big pool of blood about a few feet wide on the ground. I was taken to a small clinic up in the mountains and they only gave me stitches. No ER room, no tests. The scar is about four inches long. Maybe that has something to do with part of it such as the epilepsy like symptoms? Cranial damage which makes my head not feel solid?

I am a 15 yr old female and my main problem is a fullness/popped/clogged feeling that has been happening in only my left ear multiple times a day for sometimes hours and hours at a time for three months. Nothing else is wrong with interior of my ear; no pain, ringing, etc just a feeling of fullness. I went to my pediatrician about a month ago regarding these little hard pea sized bumps growing in my ear lobe under the skin. I was referred to an ENT who said it was blocked oil glands and nothing to worry about so i briefly mentioned the popping and he said it was nothing to worry about also. A couple weeks ago when looking up what i could have, some symptons of mine were related to cancer but i knew it was rare, but can happen so i checked my lymph nodes first and found that i have a slightly swollen lymph node on the right side of my neck (posterior cervical) which is a little longer than the lenght of a quarter and witdth of a finger nail. I also noticed one the shape of a pea directly under it. And on that same side of neck at the bottom of my ear i noticed a hard pea size lump last night that grew rapidly. So worried that one side of my head has an ear that continues to pop with ""blocked oil gland cyst"" on it and the other side of my head has swollen lymph nodes i told my mom to book a doctors appointment for today. MY doctor looked in my ear and said she saw nothing abnormal and said that it was also normal for lymphnodes to swell, she diagnosed me with fluid in my ear which she thinks it is and prescribed me with 3 alllergy medicines for two weeks to see if it helps and if not i go to the ENT again to see about ETD. I feel like I am being overlooked or that i just worked myself up over nothing. I havent been sick in forever and have no infection so i dont know why my lymphnode has been swollen.

Ever since my childhood about 8yo I was having ""middle ear infections"" ? in English I think it is called Otitis media?. It started usually at night, the pain was intolerable so my mom would take me to the emergency room where they always punctured/pierced my ear drum. The procedure was very painful but it relieved the pain almost immediately.  This was recurring at least once a year until I was about 14yo. At that age, I started to experience hearing loss. I went to see a doctor but after checking my ear he told me that everything looks fine. So I just continued with my life until the hearing loss became so severe that I couldn't even hear the teachers at school. I went back to the doctor explaining my situation. After looking in my ear again he apologized for not noticing it the last time and told me I have a different kind of infection ""infection of sekrets"" ?sinusitis? and recommended me to an ear specialist supposedly top of his field. The new doctor confirmed the diagnose and scheduled me for a procedure/surgery where I laid down the nurse would hold my head very tight to avoid any movement and the doctor would again pierce my ear drum but this time left the needle there and connected something like a vacuum cleaner to it and sucked the ?puss? out and inserted gromets ?myringotomy?. This was even more painful than the previous procedures and left me very light headed after. However, my hearing went back to normal immediately after. This again recurred at least once a year for both ears. About 3 years ago when I was 24 I asked him if the condition is ever going to go away or if I'll have to undergo this procedure yearly all my life. He sent me to get a CT scan and after the result came told me I have some ""dead tissue"" in my head/ear and recommended a surgery. When I asked him what the surgery was he explained that they would have to cut a little triangle out of my skull behind my ear end insert tubes that would stick out of my head for about 3 weeks during which I would have to stay in the hospital. He also told me that the procedure is extremely painful and that there is no guarantee it will help. Also, the side effects were very scary like loss of taste, paralysis and even death. So I declined the surgery and started looking for a new specialist. I then found a private clinic (very expensive) with hitec equipment. The doctor there found that my ""nose tonsils"" ?adenoids? are severely overgrown and that they are pressing against my eustachian tube, therefore, preventing drainage. So he scheduled me for a surgery to remove the ?adenoids? and also ?myringotomy?. This time everything was done with lasers and I was under anesthesia. It has been about 2 years since the surgery and it all looked fine until about a month ago when I started to notice that I'm starting to lose hearing in my left ear again but it doesn't come close to what it used to be.  I have been living in California for the past 18 months and currently don't have health insurance because I can't afford it yet but will get it soon. (btw several doctors recommended that it would help to move to a warm/tropical country) So my question is what kind of procedures would American medicine recommend? Cost? If I grew up here would the doctors here proceed the same way or do something differently? P.S. I apologize for the long post but I wanted to include as much info as possible."

I didn't choke or have issues breathing. Over the next hour or so I started to get anxious and drank some water and with that it felt like it was moving with each swallow but the feeling didn't go away. So I went to the hospital and over the next 7 hours they did did an X Ray, a Nasal Scope, and either a CAT or CT Scan (can't remember). And said they found nothing. That I may have just scratched my throat with said peanut. I also have Acid Reflux and read that it makes it feel like there's something in your throat and can make it hard to swallow food as well (I've had issues with that in the past). My question is should I just stop worrying about it or get a second opinion? I mean, I feel like going to the hospital should be enough but I still feel like there's something in my throat and I feel really anxious. I'm afraid to eat but ate and drank something small earlier and there were no big issues. Breathing is fine and all that, but I just don't get it."

Couple of weeks later they come back this time I also got Ill with zebra I think was a bad cold, I had fever of 38, headaches and mucus. I noticed it took me a long time recovering from that cold. When I got better 2 weeks after since I was still having palpitations I went to the cardiologist.

The Dr said it was nothing serious so prescribed nothing. Meanwhile I had lost 5kg in a month ( probably because of the cold). Had an investigation of what was causing the heart murmur so I did:  Thyroid eco: found several cistes on thyroid  Heart eco- all normal and functioning normal no alterations  Thyroid hormones tested- TSH, T3 and T4 all within normal range  Blood work- all normal  Nose and throat bacteria test- found a Kleibsiela bacteria on my throat (antibiotics prescribed for that) nose come back clear.  During that time I started experiencing sometimes pain on my left arm ( I thought I would have a heart attack) but it went away  I had electric shock like sensation down my right arm or shoulder sometimes but it would last miliseconds (that also stopped)  I experienced sometimes at night my temperature raising and a little bit of sweating (really minimal sometimes just between my breasts a bit)  I still have excessive hair loss and recently had to have my hair cut short (but I also been trying a new hair relaxer and dye it might be it. I just never had so much hair loss before)  I noticed jerk like movements when I'm about to fall asleep at the first it happen 3 times now I have muscle spasms constantly they are very small and last miliseconds too  My heart had no reason to be having arritmia so I was sent to the endocrinologist.

I think it's worth mentioning that last year I had pretty much the exact same issues, but about 100x worse.

I couldn't get into a doctor but I got an appointment with a nurser practitioner who said she could see a ""bulge"" on my left ear but she thought it was due to allergies and told me to just continue to take flonase without really addressing the lightheaded/dizzy feeling. However after coming home from the appointment and laying down to take a nap, everytime I closed my eyes, I could really feel the dizzy feeling hit me, like everything was moving when I closed my eyes. I called my doctors office back but could only manage to talk to an on call nurse who's very rudely told me to go to Urgent Care ( which I can't afford anyways). The feeling has gotten a little better but every once in awhile I feel it hit me. Could there be fluid in my ears causing this? It seems this would've been caught but I don't know what else it could be and its really hard to function with this coming and going. Also my doctors office is closed until Tuesday. Any advice on how to manage until then?"

It happens every day, and typically lasts between 5 minutes and sometime up to an hour. The volume she spits up can sometimes be as much as half a cup. It is very red and liquidy and is definitely blood (its been tested). She has had extensive workups at 2 leading hospitals that has included: multiple overnight admits; tons of lab work (all fine), an angiogram (all fine), 2 ENT scopes, dentist (all fine); consults with a multi-disciplined team (ENT, gastro, pulmonary, neurology, hematology, etc.) They appear to have ruled out soooo many things, but the daily spitting up of bloody saliva continues despite all of this. Her ENT recently even cauterized some suspect blood vessels (talangatasias, sp?) in her throat thinking they might be the source. Even thought she might have HTT, which was ruled out via labs.  Her labs are all good, never any temps, eats great, sleeps great, well-adjusted girl otherwise. Never any blood in stool and does not appear to be coming from stomach (never resembles ground coffee , and is not acidic at all per lab testing). She's been tested for so much, and so much has been ruled out, but the daily bouts of spitting up the blood continue. Not a ton of blood in the spit up as she never gets anemic. Also, there is never a cough associated with this, and her lungs are clear as a bell. All the leading docs are saying is that they can take another look via scope to see if they missed anything.  To find the source of the blood and end this is the goal. We are not sure where to go next. Any insight would be much appreciated!"

It feels like someone is tickling it with a feather, but it swiftly becomes painful. Many times the pain will peak for about 10 seconds and then fade away again, but sometimes it doesn't go away. I've found I can ease the irritation by pressing a finger against the upper arch of my ear canal, but obviously I can't spend my whole life with a finger in my ear. :-/ Recently the pain has been getting significantly worse, and now my ear hurts most of the time even without the vibration. It's a steady ache with small, sharp intermittent stabs of pain. I saw my doctor a few days ago, and he glanced briefly at my ear and said there's no redness or swelling inside, so it's probably just allergies and there's nothing I can do about it. He also said something about both eardrums seeming a bit shrunken, but didn't think that was contributing to the problem. If this was ""just allergies,"" why doesn't taking an allergy medicine work? What can I do to ease this discomfort? It's becoming a real issue. Thank you, in advance, for your advice!"

My tongue felt like it was burning also, it was very very sore in one localized spot. I looker in the mirror and it appeared like some sort of burn. In addition to this, my inner arms broke out in a rash of tiny red dots. Two days later, I went to the doctor, by this point the tongue lesion was gone and the soreness in my throat and neck had reduced. I had no fever, my lymph nodes were not swollen either and the rash on my arms was gone. The doctor told me to wait. Since then, the sore throat has not completed subsided and I can feel a slight ache in my neck and throat that seems to flare up to be worse every few days. When it is flaring up, I have a hard time concentrating and become tired.  I have went to three doctors at this point and also went to an ENT specialist. He examined me and said the throat was irritated slightly. He also stated there was no infection. I need help figuring out what to do. I expressed concerns to each of these doctors that this could be serious or a form of cancer. They all checked me and found nothing. Is it not possible i need an anti-biotic.

My tongue felt like it was burning also, it was very very sore in one localized spot. I looker in the mirror and it appeared like some sort of burn. In addition to this, my inner arms broke out in a rash of tiny red dots. Two days later, I went to the doctor, by this point the tongue lesion was gone and the soreness in my throat and neck had reduced. I had no fever, my lymph nodes were not swollen either and the rash on my arms was gone. The doctor told me to wait. Since then, the sore throat has not completed subsided and I can feel a slight ache in my neck and throat that seems to flare up to be worse every few days. When it is flaring up, I have a hard time concentrating and become tired.  I have went to three doctors at this point and also went to an ENT specialist. He examined me and said the throat was irritated slightly. He also stated there was no infection. I need help figuring out what to do. I expressed concerns to each of these doctors that this could be serious or a form of cancer. They all checked me and found nothing. Is it not possible i need an anti-biotic. I am having a hard time working or enjoying life with this painful throat, sore neck issue. It is also almost as if I can actually hear a ringing when this flares up."

We went to the ER about a month ago because his calf was tight swollen and agry red. Also causing a lot of pain for him. They ran a few tests and did a sonogram to see if he had a blood clot. They found nothing and gave it a generic diagnosis of cellulitis. He went home wih a prescription for antibiotics. Some of the swelling, the redness, and the pain went away but his ankles remain extremely swollen. To the point that he has no ankles. But today the redness and pain have returned! What could be causing his symptoms? Could it be his kidneys?  I realize he can't be diagnosed just by reading brief message about it but I would like some advice none-the-less. Thank you"

First to start out with, a little backstory of how this all started. 3 Months ago I was admitted into the ER and diagnosed with Sepsis. I was shaking, had a cold prickley sensation all over my body, Increased heart rate, and a fever of 102F. During my time in the ER they ran every test that they could think of, including testing my urine, bloodwork, giving me an ultrasound of the heart, and a CT scan of my upper body. However, none of the tests revealed any sign of infection and i was sent home a day and a half later. 2 Weeks had passed since my first ER visist with no noticable issues, until one day when I was just sitting down watching youtube my heart started racing for no discernable reason. Again I was taken to the ER, and when I got there my heart rate was at around 140bpm. They put an Iv in my arm and pumped me with Saline, and about a half an hour later my heart rate was back to normal again and I was sent home that same night. After my second ER visit I went in to see my family doctor, and he reffered me to see a Cardiologist. The Cardiologist put me on a holter monitor for 24 hours and had me do a stress test, wich both revealed nothing out of the ordinary.  A couple of weeks went by, during wich I felt relatively normal until one day when I woke up my eyes felt like they were burning, and my vision had become fuzzy. I went to go sit down at my computer, and found it difficult to look at the screen because the light would hurt my eyes.  I went in to see an Optomologist and they had me do a bunch of tests. They found nothing out of the ordinary besides my Astigmatism (wich I already knew I had) and perscribed me a new pair of glasses.  The new glasses arrived about a week later and improved my overall vision, but I was still experiencing the sensitivity to light and some fuzziness in my sight. To further complicate matters, around this time I started to feel a sensation of Dizziness...like I was moving although I was physically sitting still. It also became increasingly difficult for me to concentrate and think clearly. I went into the family doctor again, and they reccomended that I have an MRI and CT scan done of my brain just to rule out anything serious. About week later, my insurance approved the scan and the results came back normal for both scans. My brain was apparently ""unremarkable"" and normal for someone of my age (26). The sensitivity to light dissipated in time, but the vertigo did not. I was also still having difficulty concentrating, and a high-pitched ringing began to develop in both of my ears, so this time the family doctor reccomended that I see an ENT (Ear Nose and Throat Doctor). The ENT determined that I have an Acute Sinus Infection, and perscribed me antibiotics to take for 10 days. I am 9 days in, and the dizziness has almost gone away entirely, however I do still notice it when I sit down and when I concentrate on objects. I start to feel wobbley and uneven. The ringing is still there as well, but has gone from being high pitched and intolerable to a sort of low ""hum"". I am sorry for the extremely long post, but I felt it important to give my full background from when I first started noticing a problem upto where I am now. These past few months have been really bad for me, and I just want to find out what could be happening. i have been to multiple doctors, multiple experts, and had many different tests done...but really am no closer to understanding what is going on. I would love to think that this was all just some bacterial infection that has been working it's way through my system and that the antibiotics are now flushing out but I just dont know, and that is what is most scary."

However, none of the tests revealed any sign of infection and i was sent home a day and a half later. 2 Weeks had passed since my first ER visist with no noticable issues, until one day when I was just sitting down watching youtube my heart started racing for no discernable reason. Again I was taken to the ER, and when I got there my heart rate was at around 140bpm. They put an Iv in my arm and pumped me with Saline, and about a half an hour later my heart rate was back to normal again and I was sent home that same night. After my second ER visit I went in to see my family doctor, and he reffered me to see a Cardiologist. The Cardiologist put me on a holter monitor for 24 hours and had me do a stress test, wich both revealed nothing out of the ordinary.  A couple of weeks went by, during wich I felt relatively normal until one day when I woke up my eyes felt like they were burning, and my vision had become fuzzy. I went to go sit down at my computer, and found it difficult to look at the screen because the light would hurt my eyes.  I went in to see an Optomologist and they had me do a bunch of tests. They found nothing out of the ordinary besides my Astigmatism (wich I already knew I had) and perscribed me a new pair of glasses.  The new glasses arrived about a week later and improved my overall vision, but I was still experiencing the sensitivity to light and some fuzziness in my sight. To further complicate matters, around this time I started to feel a sensation of Dizziness...like I was moving although I was physically sitting still. It also became increasingly difficult for me to concentrate and think clearly. I went into the family doctor again, and they reccomended that I have an MRI and CT scan done of my brain just to rule out anything serious. About week later, my insurance approved the scan and the results came back normal for both scans. My brain was apparently ""unremarkable"" and normal for someone of my age (26). The sensitivity to light dissipated in time, but the vertigo did not. I was also still having difficulty concentrating, and a high-pitched ringing began to develop in both of my ears, so this time the family doctor reccomended that I see an ENT (Ear Nose and Throat Doctor). The ENT determined that I have an Acute Sinus Infection, and perscribed me antibiotics to take for 10 days. I am 9 days in, and the dizziness has almost gone away entirely, however I do still notice it when I sit down and when I concentrate on objects. I start to feel wobbley and uneven. The ringing is still there as well, but has gone from being high pitched and intolerable to a sort of low ""hum"". I am sorry for the extremely long post, but I felt it important to give my full background from when I first started noticing a problem upto where I am now. These past few months have been really bad for me, and I just want to find out what could be happening. i have been to multiple doctors, multiple experts, and had many different tests done...but really am no closer to understanding what is going on. I would love to think that this was all just some bacterial infection that has been working it's way through my system and that the antibiotics are now flushing out but I just dont know, and that is what is most scary."

They all occurred during the night, after I had woken up and used the toilet. Every time I would lay back down, there would be an intense ringing in my ears that gets louder and louder. I would start to feel nauseous and sick, and my arms and legs would begin to tingle and sweat. After this I would start to notice my heart beat increasing in speed, eventually pounding very fast and loudly. It would continue to do this for at least 2 minutes. During this time I would feel very sick, and the first time it happened I actually experienced diarrhoea. After these attacks my body feels tingly and shaky. I have been experiencing tinnitus for the past year, which has been steadily getting worse. I have depression and am taking Lovan, but have never had this kind of attack happen during the day. Nothing in particular seems to trigger this, but it always happens during the night after I get up and use the toilet. Any information or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you."

I was trying to move but I was just paralyzed. Mind I was still asleep, so it's not sleep paralysis. Anyway, then it flashed into a party, where these two guys came in and were threatening me and my friends. One got in bed with me and fell asleep with me and then while I was laying there, it flashed white, and I was paralyzed again, and horrific pictures kept flashing in and out, like someone being buried alive, a murder, a dead body, a girl with no eyes screaming, and more and this happened and I was paralyzed and horrified, and then it stopped and I explained it to my friends (in the dream still) and as I explained it it happened again. Then my mom came and I tried to explain it to her as well, and then it happened again. When I woke up, I texted my friend and told them about it and my heart started to pump and it felt like a soon to be panic attack. Anyone know what this is? I'm actually scared to fall back asleep."

Although I'm more comfortable, this isn't really the best option.  Also because of the lack of sleep, I am facing a lot of health issues. Severe headache makes me lazy and I am not able to work. Lack of sleep really affects my health quite drastically. I need a good sleep at night. This has been going on this way for 4 years. It has now come to a point where my son is at home after his studies. He can't sleep since his room is next to our room. Both our children have chronic fatigue syndrome so need a night of nondisturbing noise. The solution my son found was to search for a CPAP equipment and supplies (   ) in our locality and buy a mask that quite the snoring sound. It stops the snoring sound.  I told my husband that he needs to see a doctor. But he blankly refuses to see a doctor. So I think this will be really helpful.

What should I do?,"For the past week, my son has been suffering from sleep paralysis. I don’t know if this is normal but having to deal with it for how many days is not normal anymore. My 15 year old kid kept on telling me that he’s having nightmares and bad dreams, which I don’t like. I read an article in a foreign site talking about the death of a girl who had a sleep paralysis. Please tell me what should I do. My son is at risk here. Hear me please."

My wife complained that I used to snore in the midnight with very loud noise and I used to wake up in the midnight. I went to my family doctor who suggested undergoing Nocturnal polysomnography. I was not knowing what it was. As per doctor's proposal, I have undergone the test in which I was hooked up to equipment that monitors your heart, lung and brain activity, breathing patterns, arm and leg movements, and blood oxygen levels while you sleep. After the evaluation doctor said that I am suffering from sleep apnea. I am planning to undergo treatment for that. My doctor suggested Continuous positive airway pressure but I am afraid of the mask as it reminds me of the ICU memory I had two years back. So when I asked my doctor he suggested about sleep apnea treatment from a clinic Aurora (   ). It is a dental clinic. I think that they will be giving some mouth guards which may help me out. May I know what actually the treatment is? Will it be effective? Should I take special care for the treatment?"

This is only my experience, I'm no professional, but I hope it helps to reassure and prepare others. I have Cystinuria, a genetic kidney disease where my kidneys produce too much cystine and my kidneys think sparkly yellow stones are a great idea. I had a mass in my left kidney that got blasted with lithotripsy when I was seven but we were only just told about cystinuria recently when we discovered stagnorn stones in both my kidneys. My kidney function is 78% in my right and 22% in my left, which added some risk to the situation.  They decided to clear my right kidney first, since that is the most important, and so one week ago I went into hospital for a right PCNL. When they set you up in theatre, you fall asleep on your back, but they roll you onto your side, once out, so they can access your kidney. A scope is put through your side into your kidney and a guide wire is threaded up through your urethra etc so they don't get lost. Various tools are put through the scope to break up and extract the stone fragments. When I woke up, the first thing I knew was that I needed to pass urine so badly it hurt. This, of course, wasn't the case. The uege to urinate is common, they had emptied my bladder and in my case my bladder and muscles were spasming. A day later the spasms meant I still couldn't pass urine and they put an indwelling catheter in to relieve the strain on my smaller left kidney. This pain was a 10 on the pain scale. Before your surgery, ask if you will need a catheter and ask if it can be inserted while you are under. My next one will be. I had two J stents inserted in the surgery. These are tubes that go from your kidneys to your bladder in your uretas. They allow urine to pass both ways, which meant until I got the catheter, my left kidney was sending waste to my bladder and then up to my right kidney. Finally, I had what is called a nethrostomy tube. It is a thin tube left in place of the scope to allow your kidney to be drained while you heal. It's a safety measyre in case your kidney clots up at the entrance to your stent. Here is where things went wrong for me. My nethrostomy tube somehow got dislodged from my kidney and got stuck in the surrounding fatty layer. This resulted in acute pain that would only subside with iv morphine. The nethrostomy site leaked every day and had to be redressed a lot. Most of the nurses hadn't really dealt with nethrostomy tubes, lor hadn't encountered my type. Some assumed I was exaggerating the pain. Some thought my tube was blocked with clots and then some of those people tried to flush it with saline. Flushing the tube can be risky, but seemed to give results so they kept doing it. Sometimes nothing would drain, I would be curled in the foetal position in bed unable to move or barely breath, and they would refuse iv morphine. They will make you get up and walk around the next day. This is to prevent clots and pneumonia. They will also be rather obsessed with when you poop. I got constipated and didn't go for four days. The catheter made it harder for me, but that's all working fine now. They made me wait days for a special xray scan with a contrast solution. This is a standard procedure after PCNL so they can track your kidney's drainage into your bladder to see if it is safe to remove the stents and nethrostomy tube. It's also to make sure your surgeon got all the stones. I was in so much pain, they had to slide me from my bed to the table under the enormous fancy machine. The staff wear lead vests and the room has to be kept cold for the machinery. When they injected the dye, that is when they realised the tube was dislodged. This raised questions of how was my tube leaking/draining if it wasn't in my kidney. There were talks of sending me back into surgery days before Christmas, lucky for me the urology team decided to take the nethrostomy tube out. Taking the tube out is uncomfortable, but not as bad as you expect. When you're sent to your ward, after surgery, the orderlies bring a wrapped up plastic doohicky that can go down into the tube, 'unlock' it and pull it out. It's over quickly, especially if you're exhaling while the tube comes out. My pain instantly subsided when it came out. They observed me overnight, took out the catheter and discharged me lunchtime the next day. ORDINARILY, upon a successful scan, they would remove your nethrostomy tube and stents all at once under a local anaesthetic. Because of my complications that were unnecessarily dragged out, I'll be getting a CT scan and then they'll be removed after Christmas. I hope this is helpful/insightful. I have to go back for my left kidney once I've recovered and hopefully I'll be able to add thoughts of a more standard experience then."

This is only my experience, I'm no professional, but I hope it helps to reassure and prepare others. I have Cystinuria, a genetic kidney disease where my kidneys produce too much cystine and my kidneys think sparkly yellow stones are a great idea. I had a mass in my left kidney that got blasted with lithotripsy when I was seven but we were only just told about cystinuria recently when we discovered stagnorn stones in both my kidneys. My kidney function is 78% in my right and 22% in my left, which added some risk to the situation.  They decided to clear my right kidney first, since that is the most important, and so one week ago I went into hospital for a right PCNL. When they set you up in theatre, you fall asleep on your back, but they roll you onto your side, once out, so they can access your kidney. A scope is put through your side into your kidney and a guide wire is threaded up through your urethra etc so they don't get lost. Various tools are put through the scope to break up and extract the stone fragments. When I woke up, the first thing I knew was that I needed to pass urine so badly it hurt. This, of course, wasn't the case. The uege to urinate is common, they had emptied my bladder and in my case my bladder and muscles were spasming. A day later the spasms meant I still couldn't pass urine and they put an indwelling catheter in to relieve the strain on my smaller left kidney. This pain was a 10 on the pain scale. Before your surgery, ask if you will need a catheter and ask if it can be inserted while you are under. My next one will be. I had two J stents inserted in the surgery. These are tubes that go from your kidneys to your bladder in your uretas. They allow urine to pass both ways, which meant until I got the catheter, my left kidney was sending waste to my bladder and then up to my right kidney. Finally, I had what is called a nethrostomy tube. It is a thin tube left in place of the scope to allow your kidney to be drained while you heal. It's a safety measyre in case your kidney clots up at the entrance to your stent. Here is where things went wrong for me. My nethrostomy tube somehow got dislodged from my kidney and got stuck in the surrounding fatty layer. This resulted in acute pain that would only subside with iv morphine. The nethrostomy site leaked every day and had to be redressed a lot. Most of the nurses hadn't really dealt with nethrostomy tubes, lor hadn't encountered my type. Some assumed I was exaggerating the pain. Some thought my tube was blocked with clots and then some of those people tried to flush it with saline. Flushing the tube can be risky, but seemed to give results so they kept doing it. Sometimes nothing would drain, I would be curled in the foetal position in bed unable to move or barely breath, and they would refuse iv morphine. They will make you get up and walk around the next day. This is to prevent clots and pneumonia. They will also be rather obsessed with when you poop. I got constipated and didn't go for four days. The catheter made it harder for me, but that's all working fine now. They made me wait days for a special xray scan with a contrast solution. This is a standard procedure after PCNL so they can track your kidney's drainage into your bladder to see if it is safe to remove the stents and nethrostomy tube. It's also to make sure your surgeon got all the stones. I was in so much pain, they had to slide me from my bed to the table under the enormous fancy machine. The staff wear lead vests and the room has to be kept cold for the machinery. When they injected the dye, that is when they realised the tube was dislodged. This raised questions of how was my tube leaking/draining if it wasn't in my kidney.

The back seems fine, just partially gone on the front side I guess lol it is so hard to tell. I am pretty sure I have never noticed anything wrong with it before. The more I think about it I vauguely remember a dream where a tooth broke off or something like that. Now I wonder if it really happened while I was half asleep during the night.

There's like a line but I can tell by feeling it it's the bone and it's a little slanted.

There has to be something wrong when I get sick but last night I felt like I was going to throw up. Not sure if this has any thing to do with it but I just started my period.

My face is a bit scraped up but I’m concerned about my nose; it’s quite swollen, and I am getting a lot of pain when raising my eyebrows. The bridge of my nose is cut and this is where most of the pain is. I had a nosebleed when the incident first occurred which lasted for about a half an hour, however now my nose feels very stuffy and makes it difficult to breathe out of my nose. I have to wait 10 days for a GP to refer me to an ENT specialist, however I am concerned that my nose is broken, because I’ll need to inform the university! Help!"

No problems, felt fine at the time, but for the past few days my ears (the inside) have been getting itchier and itchier. No fever or cold or anything else indicating another infection, so I'm wondering if it has to do with the candling? Is that possible? Most importantly, what can I do to make this itching go away???"

I am just curious to know if this is my new normal or if the tonsil will ever return to its previous size? The first picture is from when I was sick for 7 months and the 2nd is the size that's is been since then."

Part of this misdiagnosis (what I believe it to be anyway), could be partly due to me not relaying as much information as I could, as I felt the doctor seemed rather rushed. Slight hearing loss was noticed on the morning of 2/13; the day after I started wearing my new pair of headphones and sound equipment. I did not think they were causing much damage as it wasn’t really much louder than my old setup but I did feel pressure and itchiness (both outside and inside the ear), I think this is because the low frequencies were much more pronounced. For the following week, buzzing in my ears started to get worse and I eventually began to feel a little fluid in my ear. I was then prescribed prednisone on 2/21; slowly hearing came back slightly until 3/2, where I felt 70% of my hearing had returned.  However one very significant problem remained, and one in which I feel I cannot articulate effectively. It doesn’t feel like my eardrums vibrate much at all. I don’t think this is a very accurate description though, the lack of sensation I’m getting is when you go to a concert or listen to bass accentuated music, there is that noticeably pleasant vibration you get. I’ve always considered this sort of the texture or layered part of music.  My audiogram displayed ‘Normal Hearing’, though it feels far from it. I have scoured the internet and I have only read of one somewhat similar case (their cause way unknown). I ran into this case again 3/16 just six hours from my ENT visit. Same audio setup, although at very low volume this time around with significant ringing unlike the first time. Ringing stopped a couple days later (but the hum from the first incident has remained). I just started another prednisone prescription after going to urgent care on 3/20. Any Help would be greatly appreciated! -AJ"
