My body would start tingling in my feet and hands working its way up to my face. Then I would get tingling in my tongue and a metallic taste in my mouth. My whole body would shut down so that I couldn't move, speech or see. This would go on for 30 minutes to up to 3 or 4 hours at a time On and off all day and night. This went on for weeks. It has taken me months to get a bit better but it still happens. Also, if I have no full blown shut down I usually have trouble walking, talking, thinking and generally functioning. I have fibromyalgia, Hashimotos, and I am diabetic with IBS and gluten and diary intolerance. The doctors have diagnosed psychological stress. I wondered if anyone else has had these neurological symptoms. I am female and 53 years old. I am a bit worried as I keep relapsing despite giving up my job and trying to be less stressed. It's not much of a life when just going to the shops means I spend the next day in bed. Any advice?"

(is this coincidental?).  CPR OF 17mg/L (inflammation count in blood) 0 to 3mg/L is normal and over 10mg/L, a sign of an undiagnosed desease. (Is this coincidental?)  I have IBS, (irritable bowl syndrome), most FM sufferers have it.  I have NCS- Neuro Cardio genic syncope. Autoimmune heart desease,(is it coincidental?)  I am Hypotensive, ( low blood pressure) and heart rate?  Neurogenic bowel and bladder conditions. (unable to feel when to go to the loo.) Very low red blood count, (4 years ago, resulted into chest pains, dizzy spells, head aces and serious fatigue.) Blood count 5, women normal iron blood count +/-12.  After blood plasma transfusion and iron/magnesium supplements, these symptoms improved dramatically. (Coincidences?)  I also have diverticulosis?  Just recently been discharged from hospital, with a bladder and kidney infection, of which I have had many. Report result confirming, urine draining from my kidneys are slow, does not empty completely, as too my bladder. (being the cause of my countless infections).  Depression is a secondary symptom of Fibromyalgia, I can say this with overwhelming confidence, is due to obvious reasons, chronic pain and undiagnosed medical problems?

Now like the chicken and egg dilemma, which came first and is there any relation?  Worst of all, most medical staff I come across, are oblivious to what the condition Fibromyalgia is. Ask me I know, go to an ER Room and explain to the medical staff, you have Fibromyalgia and you are allergic to Quinolin (synthetic penicillin, just had to add this).

After 5 years of suffering numerous symptoms of which fatigue, to me was/is the worst.  In and out of hospitals and ER rooms, to many to mention, no one could diagnose the problem/s. Until one day out of the blue, I started doing research desperation being my motivation, I stumbled on this word Fibromyalgia, after comparing various symptoms checking.  I went to a Rhumetoligist that specializes in Fibromyalgia, which confirmed it and at last something started making sense.  I, as many other women with FM have been told in the past, is a a condition caused in the brain, due to abuse, mentally or physically or both (basically a mental condition) ""It IS NOT An ACTUAL MEDICAL Condition""  HOWEVER -  Please explain to me, why I have the following : After a Nuclear scan, reported I have inflammation in all my joints, spine, neck, shoulders, elbows hips, hands, knees and ankles.

So i guess i know i have RA, but beyond that, my last ER visit they mentioned Myalgia. I guess bc i was saying i was in a lot of widespread pain but they found no obvious serious illness. Im afraid to discuss changing my pain meds to a longer lasting pain med, bc of the way they r these days. Im at a loss at how/why i feel this bad. I seem to have many symptoms of RA but not the obvious ones. Any suggestions on dealing with Pain Dr on getting better pain relief. My meds help for about an hour and im back in pain again.

Sometimes they are just like pins and needles and then sometimes they get so intense they sting. The stinging will cause a sort of itching sensation. I have had this now over 6 weeks non-stop.

It first started in 2016 when I got a headache that felt like it was cracking my head open, just after the headache started I battled to look at any lights. This got increasingly worse and I started getting a fever. I was exhausted and could not stay awake. About 3 hours later I went to the doctor. They admitted me into hospital straight away suspecting meningitis. I was put on meds and given a cortisone injection. The symptoms were better but the headache did not go away for a couple of days. The doctors did a Lumbar Puncture and the results showed a high white blood cell count but it was just below what was required for meningitis. After 2 weeks I was pretty much back to normal and didn't think about it again. In 2017 I then started getting tonsilitis once a month for about a year and eventually they removed my tonsils. (I'm not sure if this in anyway related). After the tonsil removal I have felt constantly tired and this has not stopped. In September 2018 I got a severe headache again as well as a sensitivity to light (The sensitivity was not as severe this time but the headache was just as bad). The headache stayed for 3 days and then I started getting fever sweats and chills alternatively. I went to the doctor and tick bite fever was suspected, I was put on antibiotics and seemed to be a bit better but still had fatigue. A couple of days later my pinky and ring finger on my right hand started tingling and this worsened so I went back to the doctor and they said I had tennis elbow so put me on anti-inflammatories. A week or so later the tinglign worsened and moved to both my hands (all fingers) and my feet (all toes). I also started shaking severly throughout my entire body. A couple of days later, one side of my face went numb and I could not raise my one eyebrow or move my mouth on that side. The face paralysis only lasted 3 days. I also had very stiff muscles. I went to the doctor and they referred me to the physio. The physio refused treatment and sent me to the neurologist. The neurologist did a full blood count, lumbar puncture, MRI, a nerve conduction stud and an EEG. The only results outside of normal ranges were the inflammation markers in the blood tests, the white blood cell count was only slightly above normal and the nerve conduction study picked up an irregularity between my elbow and hand on my right hand. The neurologists suspects Multiple Sclerosis or Fibromyalgia and is going to retest in a years time. In December 2018 I then went to a homeopath who put me on a high dosage of magnesium as well as a variety of other vitamins. This subtantially helped all the symptons. The numbness and shaking is almost completely gone now and only comes back very occassionally. I have not been taking any tablets for a couple of months now and feel ok. The only thing that I still battle with is the muscle stiffness and the fatigue. I have also noticed a significant increase in visability of my veins since December 2018 and this is worsening over time (not sure if this is relevant). Can anyone help me with a diagnosis and treatment?"

I went to the doctor and they referred me to the physio. The physio refused treatment and sent me to the neurologist. The neurologist did a full blood count, lumbar puncture, MRI, a nerve conduction stud and an EEG. The only results outside of normal ranges were the inflammation markers in the blood tests, the white blood cell count was only slightly above normal and the nerve conduction study picked up an irregularity between my elbow and hand on my right hand. The neurologists suspects Multiple Sclerosis or Fibromyalgia and is going to retest in a years time. In December 2018 I then went to a homeopath who put me on a high dosage of magnesium as well as a variety of other vitamins. This subtantially helped all the symptons. The numbness and shaking is almost completely gone now and only comes back very occassionally. I have not been taking any tablets for a couple of months now and feel ok. The only thing that I still battle with is the muscle stiffness and the fatigue. I have also noticed a significant increase in visability of my veins since December 2018 and this is worsening over time (not sure if this is relevant). Can anyone help me with a diagnosis and treatment?"

I'm in the process if changing them and have realised how much they do help. At the moment, my whole body aches, headache, brain fog e.t.c. I can't brush my hair as my scalp is so tender.

The 2nd time 2 days ago they did a d-dimer, contrast CT and sent her home!! I asked them to scan her brain they didn’t and they only put Diagnosis of coughing up blood - she complained of right leg Charlie horses and they did not even check for a blood clot! Symptoms List Summarized: -chest pain over a year now -at ER 2 nights ago she described it as a constant pain in her left upper side of her chest Coughed up blood clot 2 weeks ago -Fatigue -nose bleeds -Anxiety and Stress (she attributes to being from her job and some of it probably is) -Feels like it’s hard to swallow -she is always clearing her throat -recently I see her grabbing her neck more and more (universal sign for choking) -lack of balance -dry cough -feels like she is congested -coughed up almost a 1 inch blood clot less than 2 weeks ago -Charlie horse pains often in her right foot and lower leg (sign of DVT) -she described to me she “felt like there was a blood clot in her neck”  -she physically looks drained -she seems to know something is wrong -she is forgetting things she never should forget (she bought my baby an elephant and it’s head and ears flap - she was SO happy to show my baby this toy and less than ONE or TWO months later, she asked me who got it for my daughter!! I almost cried because I know something is wrong.) -today she was holding my daughter standing still and lost her balance and said “woah” this has happened more and more frequently! -severe constipation (thinks her bowels were impacted and couldn’t be go to bathroom for a week!) -dehydration -extremely thirsty *My Dad thinks her tripping is normal and I think he is blinding himself to it because he doesn’t pay enough attn or he thinks it’s normal and he said he forgets stuff sometime and loses balance but I can tell you for a fact he doesn’t and if he does it’s nothing like my Mom has been!  Detailed explanation and symptoms: I need help getting my Mom diagnosed and admitted to a hospital until they are 100% positive about her diagnosis.  My Mom has had chest pain for over 6 months, probably a year. She coughed up Blood 2 weeks ago and is not a smoker. In November, when I knew something was wrong; I told her to go the ER - I made her go quite honestly. They did an EKG, and said everything was fine and her heart looked good. I know she has a lung problem, thyroid problem and possibly a brain problem. I am positive because of handwriting analysis. I backed off for a while after her EKG was good because I was worrying her and my parents were both getting upset. She had mild and completely random - maybe once a week or once every two weeks - problems with her memory. She had random leg pain only in one leg and she didn’t know how to describe it. She had a minor and very little cough I think she has been hiding from me. In December, around Christmas, she was watching my baby and she said she reached for something behind the radio and pulled a muscle. I kept telling her to go make sure that was all it was and she just kept ignoring it. She had the pain to where at times I could tell it was bothering her and at times it hurt her to sit and feed my baby when she visited which really bugged me. This pain she had was in her upper left quadrant (near her ribs and she described it as basically from the front of the lower rib area to the back of the lower rib area). She never had it looked at! It hurt her for ATLEAST a month probably more like 2 months.  I have noticed her “tripping” or losing balance for the past 3-6 months but it is becoming more and more often. I said something to her almost every time I seen it happen and she brushes it off as if nothing happened. Well, it has got more and more frequent to the point I’m worried she will fall and really hurt herself or while holding my baby, fall and hurt my baby along with herself!! :(  Also, she told me just recently she has been having a lot more symptoms than I realized. I made her go to the ER last night with the following symptoms: -Coughed up blood clot 2 weeks ago -Fatigue -Anxiety and Stress (she attributes to being from her job and some of it probably is) -Feels like it’s hard to swallow -she is always clearing her throat -recently I see her grabbing her neck more and more (universal sign for choking) -lack of balance -dry cough -feels like she is congested -coughed up almost a 1 inch blood clot less than 2 weeks ago -Charlie horse pains often in her right foot and lower leg (sign of DVT) -she described to me she “felt like there was a blood clot in her neck”  -she physically looks drained -she seems to know something is wrong -she is forgetting things she never should forget (she bought my baby an elephant and it’s head and ears flap - she was SO happy to show my baby this toy and less than ONE or TWO months later, she asked me who got it for my daughter!! I almost cried because I know something is wrong. Her grandma had mini strokes often and her grandma and grandpa were both on blood thinners. Last night they gave her a contrast ct of her chest, blood work and d-dimer and told her she did not have a PE or lun cancer. They didn’t even check her right leg for a DVT!  She is also lightheaded and said she gets dizzy when she goes to lay straight back or when she touches or lays on a specific area on the back top of her head.  They didn’t even do an MRI!!!! They released her with a diagnosis of coughing up blood - they didn’t even do enough testing to find out wtf is going on!!!!! Please help. Before her contrast ct last night they gave her Ativan via her IV... she went to work after the hospital without sleeping even though she assured me she would sleep. Today, on the way home from work, she actually went off the road and could have Really got hurt. That was almost a full 10-12 HOURS after the Ativan. I realize lack of sleep could cause it but I know something is SERIOUSLY wrong. She has an apt. Monday at 8am.

I asked them to scan her brain they didn’t and they only put Diagnosis of coughing up blood - she complained of right leg Charlie horses and they did not even check for a blood clot! Symptoms List Summarized: -chest pain over a year now -at ER 2 nights ago she described it as a constant pain in her left upper side of her chest Coughed up blood clot 2 weeks ago -Fatigue -nose bleeds -Anxiety and Stress (she attributes to being from her job and some of it probably is) -Feels like it’s hard to swallow -she is always clearing her throat -recently I see her grabbing her neck more and more (universal sign for choking) -lack of balance -dry cough -feels like she is congested -coughed up almost a 1 inch blood clot less than 2 weeks ago -Charlie horse pains often in her right foot and lower leg (sign of DVT) -she described to me she “felt like there was a blood clot in her neck”  -she physically looks drained -she seems to know something is wrong -she is forgetting things she never should forget (she bought my baby an elephant and it’s head and ears flap - she was SO happy to show my baby this toy and less than ONE or TWO months later, she asked me who got it for my daughter!!

Detailed explanation and symptoms: I need help getting my Mom diagnosed and admitted to a hospital until they are 100% positive about her diagnosis.  My Mom has had chest pain for over 6 months, probably a year. She coughed up Blood 2 weeks ago and is not a smoker. In November, when I knew something was wrong; I told her to go the ER - I made her go quite honestly. They did an EKG, and said everything was fine and her heart looked good. I know she has a lung problem, thyroid problem and possibly a brain problem. I am positive because of handwriting analysis. I backed off for a while after her EKG was good because I was worrying her and my parents were both getting upset. She had mild and completely random - maybe once a week or once every two weeks - problems with her memory. She had random leg pain only in one leg and she didn’t know how to describe it. She had a minor and very little cough I think she has been hiding from me. In December, around Christmas, she was watching my baby and she said she reached for something behind the radio and pulled a muscle. I kept telling her to go make sure that was all it was and she just kept ignoring it. She had the pain to where at times I could tell it was bothering her and at times it hurt her to sit and feed my baby when she visited which really bugged me. This pain she had was in her upper left quadrant (near her ribs and she described it as basically from the front of the lower rib area to the back of the lower rib area). She never had it looked at! It hurt her for ATLEAST a month probably more like 2 months.  I have noticed her “tripping” or losing balance for the past 3-6 months but it is becoming more and more often. I said something to her almost every time I seen it happen and she brushes it off as if nothing happened. Well, it has got more and more frequent to the point I’m worried she will fall and really hurt herself or while holding my baby, fall and hurt my baby along with herself!! :(  Also, she told me just recently she has been having a lot more symptoms than I realized. I made her go to the ER last night with the following symptoms: -Coughed up blood clot 2 weeks ago -Fatigue -Anxiety and Stress (she attributes to being from her job and some of it probably is) -Feels like it’s hard to swallow -she is always clearing her throat -recently I see her grabbing her neck more and more (universal sign for choking) -lack of balance -dry cough -feels like she is congested -coughed up almost a 1 inch blood clot less than 2 weeks ago -Charlie horse pains often in her right foot and lower leg (sign of DVT) -she described to me she “felt like there was a blood clot in her neck”  -she physically looks drained -she seems to know something is wrong -she is forgetting things she never should forget (she bought my baby an elephant and it’s head and ears flap - she was SO happy to show my baby this toy and less than ONE or TWO months later, she asked me who got it for my daughter!! I almost cried because I know something is wrong. Her grandma had mini strokes often and her grandma and grandpa were both on blood thinners. Last night they gave her a contrast ct of her chest, blood work and d-dimer and told her she did not have a PE or lun cancer. They didn’t even check her right leg for a DVT!  She is also lightheaded and said she gets dizzy when she goes to lay straight back or when she touches or lays on a specific area on the back top of her head.  They didn’t even do an MRI!!!! They released her with a diagnosis of coughing up blood - they didn’t even do enough testing to find out wtf is going on!!!!! Please help. Before her contrast ct last night they gave her Ativan via her IV... she went to work after the hospital without sleeping even though she assured me she would sleep. Today, on the way home from work, she actually went off the road and could have Really got hurt. That was almost a full 10-12 HOURS after the Ativan. I realize lack of sleep could cause it but I know something is SERIOUSLY wrong. She has an apt. Monday at 8am. I am going to type a letter with all of her symptoms and demand they admit me her and find out what is causing all of these symptoms. I’m frustrated and disgusted with the care she is receiving.

It hurt a lot and I had a ringing in my head after that incident. I was alright nonetheless, just a little hurt from the microwave.  In under 28 hours, I had a long day and then I was going to bed (I have been crying the whole day so my heart was hurting). As I was laying down I weirdly had a huge pop in my left ear, extremely sharp pains on the back of my head, my left shoulder and left foot couldn’t move. I was then able to lay on my bed unstuck 30 seconds after. Nonetheless i had a very hard time rolling over it changing positions. The next morning, I felt like I was out of breathe, uncoordinated, and had extreme headaches to the point where I felt dizzy. I also felt as if I couldn’t really hear out of my left ear well enough. Right now I still feel tired. I still feel depressed so my heart is still hurting. I can move my body normally but I just feel the need to stay in bed because I am tired and depressed. I have a buzzing in my ear again, but my head is feeling okay pain wise. I don’t know what’s going on with me, is it something as severe as a stroke or am I going through extreme depression?

I’ve never had any side effects. In fact I wouldn’t even know I was taking it except for the fact that I swallow a pill 3xs a day and it’s been working WONDERS. Last week my Psych prescribed me 10mg of Adderall XR once a day. I’m very careful to check all interactions when I’m prescribed a drug. If it will interact with Lyrica I won’t take it. Lyrica is the only thing that has worked this well and I will not give it up. Long Story short(er). I made sure no interactions, and took my first Adderall yesterday morning. Around 10:30 am or so I noticed I was STONED. Not a opioid high, I felt like I smoked a couple bowls of hash. I def know the difference between the two highs, I’ve been smoking for almost 40 years. Anyways, I’m confused as to where this buzz came from. I know Amphetamines do not produce this feeling and as I said I’ve never had any side effects from Lyrica. I looked all over, but cannot find anything about the two potentiating each other. Has anyone ever experienced or heard of this? Don’t get me wrong, it’s lots of fun. But I definitely could not be productive at work like this. Thanks in advance!"

I'm now to the point that it's sometimes hard to get out of bed, my face swells, i have horrible headaches, im sore all over no matter what, and always in pain.

I got diagnosed with Fibro last week and I'm having trouble coping/understanding it. My RA tried her best to explain it to me which I get the pain and nerves part but she didn't really explain the mental aspect of it. Like I'm having a really hard time accepting it I guess? Like sometimes it's just hard for me to go to school and I guess I don't feel valid to miss those days because I'm not feeling well, because you physically can't see anything wrong with me. I'm in the process of trying to get accommodations for it through my school, but I feel like my professors won't really understand. I'm going to start physical therapy soon and I don't know how its going to make me feel since I already feel bad on my own from doing nothing, and I haven't been prescribed any medication yet. I just I don't really know what to do because I just honestly don't feel valid, I don't really know how to explain it. My mom seems to understand a little bit but my dad is giving me the impression of ""its really not that bad come on"" which I mean I can understand he can't see it, but if he knew what pain I go through on a daily basis he'd understand. Like sometimes my clothes make my skin burn, any light scrape on my skin burns, or if I hit my arm or even lay my arm on my desk my skin becomes inflamed and hurts. I'm just kinda lost in what to do because I don't know anyone that knows anywhere close to being me.

I am new to this board, but not new to Fibro. I have CFS since 1987 and Fibro since 1994. I was 27 when I became ill with Fibro and went on permanent disability. Since I was relatively young when I went on disability I get a decent amount a month but not enough to live alone. Am living with family right now but I am looking to see if anyone needs a roommate to split living costs. My family don't believe I am really ill. They never have. They say I'm on vacation.  I know this is not a normal way someone goes about looking for a roommate. But since I am no longer socially active, I don't get a chance to meet people.  My fibro is kinda controlled. I learned what to eat and not eat and that makes a big difference in my symptoms.  If you or anyone you know is looking for an easy going roommate who is happy to be of help if their illness is flaring, please contact me.  Thanks, Susan."

About 3 years ago, I snorted a small bump of cocaine. Around 20 seconds later, I became very dizzy, and nearly lost motor and bowel control for a duration of around 10 seconds. I have a history of generalized anxiety/OCD disorder and I assumed it was an anxiety attack (about taking the drug) that combined with the drug to give me that reaction, however I would like to hear a professional opinion on the symptoms.   Fast forward to the present. One thing I have noticed within this past year is that I have slightly less feeling on the left side of my body. I have had a CAT scan that has shown nothing. The only thing I could attribute this imbalance to was that one incident a long time ago. I have had no other issues other than a bout of vertigo last year, which was cured by an Ear, Nose, and Throat doctor and has not recurred. I would like some professional insight on all of this, what are your thoughts? Can a small dose of cocaine produce catastrophic long-term effects?"

I went to the ER and the Dr didn't even look at my foot or leg. He said that my bloodwork showed no indicators of a blood clot. So with the pain in my leg and my BP running too low (last time it was checked, it was 75/57), he sent me home. I have a follow-up appt with my Dr tomorrow. Does anyone know if you are on Xarelto, and the bloodwork come back with no indicators, could there still be a DVT?

I was diagnosed with this and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or CFS in 2012. At that time there was not a lot of information out there and even fewer doctors who had come across this. I was initially sent to a psychiatrist for ""behavioral modification"" in order to address this as it was much more commonly thought to be a psychiatric disorder instead of a neurological one. Thankfully the consensus has changed and there are more out there that do recognize this as a physical entity with overlapping mental health aspects. I will discuss more of the mental health in a moment. First I would like to take a moment to talk about the physical portion.  I am not a doctor nor am I a scientist, however, there are a lot of things that I have tried and there are a lot of things that I have observed. Please understand that what I present to you are all things that have not been ""scientifically"" proven. Also, what works for one may or may not work for all so please, use your own best judgement in response to anything you read in my posts. Now that the ""official"" stuff is out of the way I will start in.  I have noticed that there are certain similarities among those that have experienced this illness. The first is that a significant back or spinal injury has happened to most. Illnesses such pneumonia, hepatitis, mono, staph infections, and other invasive types have occurred within ten years prior to a back injury that predates the onset of fibro. Fibro mimics lupus, MS, and at times parkinsons, as well as transient ischemic attacks. The major differences in these illnesses between fibro and the others is that the others show up on medical tests. I will say again that what I am saying are only observances that I have made. I do not have any correlating evidence. There may be a link in the way that fibro comes about. I am purely speculating that there is a potential genetic predisposition that becomes activated when an injury occurs that leaves the spinal fluid/cord exposed to an infection that then triggers the illness. Once the illness is triggered the body's response becomes one of almost continuous activation of the adrenalin hormone in the brain which can then rewrite how the respondent nerve endings process pain signals. This could explain why when we are in pain it is difficult to process higher thinking such as problem solving, complex communication, or complex emotional response sequences. This is only a theory.   I have many in the medical profession who have told me that fibro is not a progressive illness yet I have many occasions where in my symptoms become much worse and then lighten up. Over the years the ""episodes"" I have experienced have increased not only in duration but in intensity. I have gone from being able to be fairly active to partially paralyzed and bed bound then back to active. I have had temporary blindness at one extreme and severe light sensitivity at the other. My body can go from being painfully sensitive to touch so much so that just wearing clothes is too much all the way to being completely numb no matter what the stimulus. I have repeatedly been tested for everything under the ""sun"" to determine a ""true"" diagnosis with the medical community coming up with blanks. This is incredibly frustrating as well as baffling. If you are in this position understand that you are not alone in this. You are not imagining things and yes your body is doing it's best to confound you.   On the bright side there are some good observations that just may help you out. Pay attention to the weather. When low pressures exist in the atmosphere you are more likely to feel the effects of fibro much more. When the pressure is high you have a good chance of feeling pretty good. Warm is better than cold but hot is too much. Try to find the balance that works best for you. Pay attention to the temperatures, the pressure, the amount of sun that makes you feel your best. Some that I know have found great relief in acupuncture, alpha stimulation, tens unit machines. Personally I have found that meditation, time in a heated swimming pool a couple of times a week, some yoga (fused so can only do a bit), tai chi, easy hikes, and socializing have helped me more than a lot of the drugs that get prescribed. Being active when it hurts can be a real challenge but trust me when I say that even a small amount of movement everyday will help much more than not. Don't try to climb Mt. Everest, set small goals and achieve them. I moved into a two story house with the simple goal of being able to use the stairs ten times in a day. Might not seem like much but it can be a lot on certain days!   Eat healthy and light. Not only can the medications upset how your body breaks down food fibro can do quite a tricky job as well. Experiment with different types of food to see what your body can work with. I spent five years in unbearable stomach pain due to not understanding how my digestion had changed. Pay attention to how food makes you feel. Pay attention to how much water you are drinking and your appetite. Talk to a nutritionist to help design a food plan that will help you. If you find that you are not eating or drinking a lot you need to reach out to your doctor. Those are warning signs you have to pay attention to. Also, be aware that pain does funny things do us. I have stood for ages in front of an open refrigerator door in great pain looking for something, anything that would help. Sounds stupid but it does happen."

My body can go from being painfully sensitive to touch so much so that just wearing clothes is too much all the way to being completely numb no matter what the stimulus. I have repeatedly been tested for everything under the ""sun"" to determine a ""true"" diagnosis with the medical community coming up with blanks. This is incredibly frustrating as well as baffling. If you are in this position understand that you are not alone in this. You are not imagining things and yes your body is doing it's best to confound you.   On the bright side there are some good observations that just may help you out. Pay attention to the weather. When low pressures exist in the atmosphere you are more likely to feel the effects of fibro much more. When the pressure is high you have a good chance of feeling pretty good. Warm is better than cold but hot is too much. Try to find the balance that works best for you. Pay attention to the temperatures, the pressure, the amount of sun that makes you feel your best. Some that I know have found great relief in acupuncture, alpha stimulation, tens unit machines. Personally I have found that meditation, time in a heated swimming pool a couple of times a week, some yoga (fused so can only do a bit), tai chi, easy hikes, and socializing have helped me more than a lot of the drugs that get prescribed. Being active when it hurts can be a real challenge but trust me when I say that even a small amount of movement everyday will help much more than not. Don't try to climb Mt. Everest, set small goals and achieve them. I moved into a two story house with the simple goal of being able to use the stairs ten times in a day. Might not seem like much but it can be a lot on certain days!   Eat healthy and light. Not only can the medications upset how your body breaks down food fibro can do quite a tricky job as well. Experiment with different types of food to see what your body can work with. I spent five years in unbearable stomach pain due to not understanding how my digestion had changed. Pay attention to how food makes you feel. Pay attention to how much water you are drinking and your appetite. Talk to a nutritionist to help design a food plan that will help you. If you find that you are not eating or drinking a lot you need to reach out to your doctor. Those are warning signs you have to pay attention to. Also, be aware that pain does funny things do us. I have stood for ages in front of an open refrigerator door in great pain looking for something, anything that would help. Sounds stupid but it does happen."

I was diagnosed with this and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or CFS in 2012. At that time there was not a lot of information out there and even fewer doctors who had come across this. I was initially sent to a psychiatrist for ""behavioral modification"" in order to address this as it was much more commonly thought to be a psychiatric disorder instead of a neurological one. Thankfully the consensus has changed and there are more out there that do recognize this as a physical entity with overlapping mental health aspects. I will discuss more of the mental health in a moment. First I would like to take a moment to talk about the physical portion.  I am not a doctor nor am I a scientist, however, there are a lot of things that I have tried and there are a lot of things that I have observed. Please understand that what I present to you are all things that have not been ""scientifically"" proven.

The first is that a significant back or spinal injury has happened to most. Illnesses such pneumonia, hepatitis, mono, staph infections, and other invasive types have occurred within ten years prior to a back injury that predates the onset of fibro. Fibro mimics lupus, MS, and at times parkinsons, as well as transient ischemic attacks. The major differences in these illnesses between fibro and the others is that the others show up on medical tests. I will say again that what I am saying are only observances that I have made. I do not have any correlating evidence. There may be a link in the way that fibro comes about. I am purely speculating that there is a potential genetic predisposition that becomes activated when an injury occurs that leaves the spinal fluid/cord exposed to an infection that then triggers the illness. Once the illness is triggered the body's response becomes one of almost continuous activation of the adrenalin hormone in the brain which can then rewrite how the respondent nerve endings process pain signals. This could explain why when we are in pain it is difficult to process higher thinking such as problem solving, complex communication, or complex emotional response sequences. This is only a theory.

When low pressures exist in the atmosphere you are more likely to feel the effects of fibro much more. When the pressure is high you have a good chance of feeling pretty good. Warm is better than cold but hot is too much. Try to find the balance that works best for you. Pay attention to the temperatures, the pressure, the amount of sun that makes you feel your best. Some that I know have found great relief in acupuncture, alpha stimulation, tens unit machines. Personally I have found that meditation, time in a heated swimming pool a couple of times a week, some yoga (fused so can only do a bit), tai chi, easy hikes, and socializing have helped me more than a lot of the drugs that get prescribed. Being active when it hurts can be a real challenge but trust me when I say that even a small amount of movement everyday will help much more than not. Don't try to climb Mt. Everest, set small goals and achieve them. I moved into a two story house with the simple goal of being able to use the stairs ten times in a day. Might not seem like much but it can be a lot on certain days!   Eat healthy and light. Not only can the medications upset how your body breaks down food fibro can do quite a tricky job as well. Experiment with different types of food to see what your body can work with. I spent five years in unbearable stomach pain due to not understanding how my digestion had changed. Pay attention to how food makes you feel. Pay attention to how much water you are drinking and your appetite. Talk to a nutritionist to help design a food plan that will help you. If you find that you are not eating or drinking a lot you need to reach out to your doctor. Those are warning signs you have to pay attention to. Also, be aware that pain does funny things do us. I have stood for ages in front of an open refrigerator door in great pain looking for something, anything that would help. Sounds stupid but it does happen."

I am purely speculating that there is a potential genetic predisposition that becomes activated when an injury occurs that leaves the spinal fluid/cord exposed to an infection that then triggers the illness. Once the illness is triggered the body's response becomes one of almost continuous activation of the adrenalin hormone in the brain which can then rewrite how the respondent nerve endings process pain signals.

I am a doctor and was diagnosed with fibromyalgia about 6 months ago. I am 50 years old and have been in severe pain for the past 2 years. I just thought i was overworked. It got to the point where i couldnt sleep properly at night for months and then my ability to focus decreased. I was just holding myself together just enough to deal with my patients.  Once diagnosed i was put on pregabalin and vit D which helped remarkably. I was able to improve by 90percent. I am still tired but the sleep has improved and i can at least enjoy the little things of life that people take for granted

Be patient with yourself. Educate yourself and learn to communicate with others about how you are feeling. Socializing can be hard when all you want to do is curl up in the fetal position in pain. What I have learned is that by doing the opposite, you can have greater control of the pain. It is not going to go away. It will change how you feel, what you do, and how your life is. It does not have to define you in a negative way. Take a deep breath and know you are going to be ok. You can deal with this and you can grow. Life is still a wondrous experience that is to be embraced. Be sure to share what works for you and what you have learned. Please if you do leave comments be kind and be positive.

I got really panicked and disoriented in the gas station and had trouble finding my way out. This is the last thing I remember before crashing my car. Apparently I drove about half a mile then off the road and into a parking garage and another vehicle. Even once the police were able to wake me or when I remember them I still wasn't sure what was going on and wasn't really sure where I was. My memories are spotty for I'm assuming what was the next hour. I only have a clear memory from the point of being downtown handcuffed in the back of a Police SUV.

It was my senior year of college after I had the stroke and I continued doing most of my unhealthy habits a few months following the stroke such as binge drinking on the weekends and smoking cigarettes socially when drunk ( probably around 1 cigarette per week or every 2 weeks) as well as smoking pot occasionally maybe once or twice a month. Now that I am graduated I have just quit smoking and drinking. I am 3 weeks free of drinking and smoking everything. I am so nervous though because I have read a lot online concerning cigarettes. I understand that smoking is bad but I cannot go back in time and unsmoke the cigarettes I have already. I understand I put myself at risk by smoking but does smoking the amount I did (significantly less than a pack a week) put me at a decreased risk of future stroke than those who smoke a lot more.

I have a lot to say and hope by reading this that it is helping you.   Food plays a tricky part in all of this. A lot of the medications, especially the pain meds and the psych meds, interfere with how our bodies break down food as well as toxins. It is imperative to pay attention to the signals your body is sending. If you are feeling full all the time with little to no appetite you need to talk to your doctor. If your skin or eyes become yellow you need to get to an emergency room. You MUST drink a lot of water. Our kidneys and liver are easy targets for the breakdown of the medications to damage. If you are not drinking enough water or your body isn't having regular bowel movements you are at risk for severe damage. How often is a normal bowel movement? You should be having at least one a day, every day. Certain pain meds can cause you have to have severe chronic constipation. When that happens the food and toxins you ingest do not move through the system. As they break down they release poison into the body. Over time this can make you even more sick than you already feel. This can even cause permanent damage if it goes on too long. I said before that I spent five years in great stomach pain all due to the medications shutting down my digestive system. I now suffer the consequence of that in having damaged kidneys and a very slow metabolism. I had to advocate for myself and refuse certain medications. I had to learn from nutritionists what my body can process and how to slowly rebuild my system. It has been a year now from that monumental situation and I am just starting to reap the benefits.   Since I brought it up allow me a moment to discuss the medications. Almost everyone I have ever come across when they experience pain, especially ongoing chronic severe pain just want it to stop by any means necessary. Please do not be disheartened by what I am about to say. Nothing you do will ever make the pain you are enduring go away. That is an incredibly difficult thing to accept but it is undeniably true. The pain killers they give you, the opioids, will reprogram your brain and ultimately make your pain worse. That is not going to be a popular statement but it is a true one. So what does that mean? Understanding and accepting that pain is now a part of your life will take you much farther along the path to finding those ways that will help. Help in this sense is more about understanding your good days and your bad days, communicating your needs to those around you, educating others, advocating for yourself, and finding your path to peace. This sounds like nonsense doesn't it? I know, sounded that way to me too at first. Until the meds almost killed me.   Time to get a little uncomfortable, if you are ready. I was on a little triangle of medications that created synthetic heroin. Yep, heroin. Ain't that something? I was on Lyrica, Percocet, and Soma for pain and spasm management. I was also on Effexor (venlafexine) and Lamictal (lamotrigine) for the psychological effects of long term diagnosis for chronic pain. The first three created the heroin. I would literally sleep for days. When I did wake up I felt incredibly sick all the time. Once I took my medications I would feel better for a short while until it was time to take meds again. If I missed any doses due to being asleep the sick cycle would start back up. The psychotropics were for ""severe depression."" Of course I was depressed in the beginning! Who wouldn't be? Instead of helping through therapy I was given drugs that I did not need. These all combined in my body and my brain to wreak havoc. It was by accident that this cycle was broken. I had a doctor that took me off the Soma and shortly after due to a screw up in writing the prescriptions the Percocet wasn't sent out on time which led to withdrawal. Now I am not advocating that anyone go through this without having medical oversight. It was awful as anyone who has experienced it can tell you. Once I was through it I realized that I was feeling a lot better. Yes, I was still in pain and yes, I still had fibro. I just wasn't sick all the time.   Then came the psych meds. I had spent the last year on them feeling incredibly suicidal. I did not reach out for help. I did not talk to my family. I just had all these horrible thoughts in my head all of the time. I truly thought about dying every day. After I was no longer on the synthetic heroin I discovered that Effexor and Lamictal if given to those who do not have a correct mental health diagnosis can experience suicidal tendencies. For me, I made the decision to come off of them. I cannot tell you that it is wise for you to do the same. That is something you have to do decide and you have to talk to someone about. For me, and my situation it was the best thing I have done in a very long time. I want to make it absolutely clear though that these decisions should be made through wise counsel.   Now that I am no longer on these meds I have designed a regimen of things that help me a lot. I have made a concerted effort to wake up at the same time every day. I do simple stretches, simple exercises, and spend time constructively. If I am having a terrible pain day, I slow down, accept that I am in pain, communicate with others, and practice patience."

This sounds like nonsense doesn't it? I know, sounded that way to me too at first. Until the meds almost killed me.   Time to get a little uncomfortable, if you are ready. I was on a little triangle of medications that created synthetic heroin. Yep, heroin. Ain't that something? I was on Lyrica, Percocet, and Soma for pain and spasm management. I was also on Effexor (venlafexine) and Lamictal (lamotrigine) for the psychological effects of long term diagnosis for chronic pain. The first three created the heroin. I would literally sleep for days. When I did wake up I felt incredibly sick all the time. Once I took my medications I would feel better for a short while until it was time to take meds again. If I missed any doses due to being asleep the sick cycle would start back up. The psychotropics were for ""severe depression."" Of course I was depressed in the beginning! Who wouldn't be? Instead of helping through therapy I was given drugs that I did not need. These all combined in my body and my brain to wreak havoc. It was by accident that this cycle was broken. I had a doctor that took me off the Soma and shortly after due to a screw up in writing the prescriptions the Percocet wasn't sent out on time which led to withdrawal. Now I am not advocating that anyone go through this without having medical oversight. It was awful as anyone who has experienced it can tell you. Once I was through it I realized that I was feeling a lot better. Yes, I was still in pain and yes, I still had fibro. I just wasn't sick all the time.   Then came the psych meds. I had spent the last year on them feeling incredibly suicidal. I did not reach out for help. I did not talk to my family. I just had all these horrible thoughts in my head all of the time. I truly thought about dying every day. After I was no longer on the synthetic heroin I discovered that Effexor and Lamictal if given to those who do not have a correct mental health diagnosis can experience suicidal tendencies. For me, I made the decision to come off of them. I cannot tell you that it is wise for you to do the same. That is something you have to do decide and you have to talk to someone about. For me, and my situation it was the best thing I have done in a very long time. I want to make it absolutely clear though that these decisions should be made through wise counsel.   Now that I am no longer on these meds I have designed a regimen of things that help me a lot. I have made a concerted effort to wake up at the same time every day. I do simple stretches, simple exercises, and spend time constructively. If I am having a terrible pain day, I slow down, accept that I am in pain, communicate with others, and practice patience."

We know its been studied & is a well documented symptom. We are NOT lazy people! Did you know that mostly very well educated, intelligent, driven & successful young ladies are the common recipients of this disease? That's my story, too. I was never happier in my life .when I became ill. We fight for anything & every thing ""normal""!  So- as far as the fatigue- its the biggest part of this nightmare we face. I begged my Dr. to give me something for energy for years. I just wanted a springboard to help me to do all the common sense stuff I knew I needed to do- like exercise, shop well for the most nutrious foods. After asking for a year-   he reluctantly gave me Ritalin. Started very low- .5 mgm if my memory serves me. 3x day. Gradually increased to what worked. It was so good to feel/think clearly. I had some motivation & it was life changing. I could make plans! And show up! I made meals! Initiated phone calls, stayed up past 8:00 pm! However- the downside was my desire to do more- take better care of my kids, get a PT job, etc. Had so.much to catch up on. So I slept less- did more activity than was good for me; then I crashed. For a week. So NOT good.  But if you can adhere to the instructions -  this might help. I've read about Modafinil & Provigil to be mild stimulants that could work.

What happened to me? What more can I do to get better?,"This journey of mine started with an incident that happened to me when I was in my apartment last October. Nobody knows exactly what happened. One work day I did not show up at work and I did not call in, and that’s not the way I normally operate. One of my co-workers got very worried and vocal about me missing, to the point my boss drove to my apartment and banged on the door. Someone eventually opened that door, and they found me passed out in my bed, bleeding on the right-hand side of my head.  They took me to ST. Luke’s hospital and performed a craniotomy, to stop the bleeding. Someone called my younger brother in New Jersey to tell him where I was, and that they did not think I would survive. He flew out here immediately in shock. Three weeks later, I was transferred to a rehabilitation clinic in Overland Park, Kansas, where I was still in a wheelchair. It was there I began to regain my memory, because I do not remember the hospital at all.  They had put in a feeding tube in my stomach because they were afraid I would choke to death because I did not swallow correctly. This takes all the joy out of your life by not being able to eat and taste food.  I remember when a therapy girl helped me by removing all the staples they had used to close my head back up. 45 staples. The person stapling my head must have had a grand old time banging away.  So here at this rehab place they would feed me by pouring glop into a tube connected to my stomach. In the afternoons, they would take me to a GYM to do some exercises. I spent most of the time sleeping and watching TV.  Several weeks later a new person stood in my room and drove me to Omaha Nebraska to a rehabilitation place named QLI. I was there for 4 months. If anyone had previously told me about this place, I would not have believed them. It’s something you must experience.  QLI is on a large piece of land with many buildings. They have 10 houses for residents to live in, each house has 8 to 10 bedrooms. I was in house 2. It sure was different for me to be among so many people. I am single and live alone, so this was defiantly different.  One other building has a big room where they zap you while you pedal a stationary bike. They also have a big thing they call “ZERO G”. Zero g is a very long I-Beam that they put you into a harness, connect you to a trolley, can raise and support some of your body weight, allowing you to walk under the I-Beam somewhat like a normal person.  There is another room that has a submersible treadmill. There you change into a swimsuit, walk out onto a platform that has the treadmill on it, hold onto the handrails, get lowered into about 4 feet of heated water, and begin walking on the treadmill.  Another building is filled with offices, meeting rooms, and a big gym. Part of what I did for a living was Corporate Instructor, where I teach up to 10 guys from our service shops around the USA all about a product they will be installing, servicing, and repairing. Part of my job is preparing, creating, and presenting power point presentations. QLI obtained a couple of these from my boss, and I presented them to a meeting room full of people at QLI as if I was instructing a class. One of the girls, named Alex, filmed my presentation on her phone without my knowing. When I found out about it later, I remember I got very mad at her, calling her a “sneaky redhead” She laughed and laughed!  House 2 has a large room filled with many tables to eat at, as well as a couch and comfy chairs to sit in, with a TV. They had a large kitchen, stove, microwave, and three refrigerators. They would take me to a local food store to buy frozen dinners, so If I did not like what they were serving, I could have something else.  Yes, I could eat again. It happened after they took me to a hospital for yet another swallow test. This is where you eat and drink foods while they take X-Rays of you swallowing. And this time, I passed the swallow test. Shortly after I did, one night, at about 8:30, a new lady appeared in my room, said she was a nurse, and was here to remove my feeding tube. I asked her if it was going to hurt, and she said “YUP!”.  She grabbed the tube, told me to take a deep breath, and pulled it like she was trying to start a lawn mower. It popped out of me causing deep pain. She wiped up the mess and taped a big gauze pad over my stomach. I moaned for a half hour before ringing for aspirin. Then I could fall asleep. It just kept getting better after that. Because NOW I could eat real food!  At QLI they did lots of exercise both in the mornings and in the afternoons. They taped pads to my leg and shocked me while I pedaled a stationary bike. They took me for walks with a walker, and had me climb stairs. One day, they took away my wheelchair and gave me a cane and a leg brace. I missed that chair for 2 weeks!  I had to have an escort walking with me when I had to go to exercise sessions. The walk was about a city block. They would put a gait belt on me and sometimes hold onto it. So, I used to sneak out by myself and walk, and sometimes I would get halfway there when I heard running feet behind me, and a loud voice saying “WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE ALL BY YOURSELF?” I really miss those times!  One day, I was walking back to house 2 and decided to take a short cut across the grass. I miss stepped, lost my balance, and fell. I was not hurt; it was soft grass. But there was nothing to grab onto to get back up, so after trying to get up and failing at it, I gave up and waited for someone to come out and help. They all came out one at a time and stood near me, laughing, asking me how the air was down there, and generally having fun with me. I was sure to avoid taking any short cuts from then on.  They found out I like to cook food, and am good at it. I started planning a weekend meal for the people in the house. I would go with an escort to the food store, buy the food, and usually on Saturday prepare and serve dinner for anyone who wanted to have it. I made stuffed peppers one time, stuffed cabbage another time, lemon whole chicken, and lots of other things. All my cooking was greedily consumed down to the last bite with lots of compliments!  QLI has a room where they kept special bicycles that were low to the ground. Some of these were 2 people bikes. One day we loaded 6 bikes into pickup trucks and drove to a riding trail that was supposed to be 40 miles long. It ran in the middle of some blocks between the houses and back yards, behind businesses of all kinds, and along a chuckling creek. We peddled 3 miles out and 3 miles back. It was a LOT of fun! We would go riding on the QLI campus as well. And if it was raining, they had a stationary one set up in front of a computer. It was almost like riding one outside for real.  My insurance was due to stop paying QLI, and I found out that during one of their appraisal meetings one of the therapists was very vocal about me, and said if I were to stay another month I would be very much better. So, QLI gave me a free month at their own expense for me to succeed. I can almost cry when I remember this. I told their CEO “thank you” in person, god bless you and QLI! She just smiled, and said her job was easy, all she had to do was say “YES”.  My Therapists once drove me home for a day trip. Alex and Megan and I. Megan saw where I lived and recommended some things; like handrails in my bathroom, which I did have installed. She scrubbed my refrigerator sparkling clean! It was empty and turned off. Alex was visiting where I worked and seeing my desk and other things. It was just for the day, so we drove back. It’s a three hour drive each way.  The next trip I took home was with Roni. She drove us, and I stayed home and slept in my bed for three days. I went to work as well, and while I was at my desk answering phone calls, Kim from Human Resources, and my boss, were both sitting nearby listening to me talk of the phone as they were also busy on their laptops. After three days, I guess they were satisfied that I was doing OK. I must say I am a lucky man to have such a job. I have been treated very well. But I have also worked for them since 1979!  The day came that I was discharged from QLI, and they drove me home for the last time. I was there for about 4 months. I miss the place and all the wonderful people there. But I do keep in touch with many of them via email. They are wonderful people who did so much for me.  Before I was discharged, Roni and Vanessa and others asked me about continuing therapy on an outpatient basis in Kansas City, and we found Ability KC. I chose this place because they are local, AND they have a driving program as well. I have a nice Crown Victoria that is waiting for me, but I want to do it right.  At this point I have completed a physical therapy course and also an occupational therapy course. I continued to go twice a week there for electrical stimulation on my right leg while peddling a stationary bike. But now I am taking a break from therapy and thinking of what to do next.  So, I am still walking with a cane and am still weak on my right leg, ankle, and right hand. What puzzles me is what happened? My understanding about a stroke and bleeding on the right hand side of the brain would affect the left side of the body. But I am affected on the RIGHT hand side. I am seeking suggestions as to what might have happened to me, and what I can do to improve to the point of not needing a leg brace or a cane to walk around. Thank you, and god bless you. John M"

I spent most of the time sleeping and watching TV.  Several weeks later a new person stood in my room and drove me to Omaha Nebraska to a rehabilitation place named QLI. I was there for 4 months. If anyone had previously told me about this place, I would not have believed them. It’s something you must experience.  QLI is on a large piece of land with many buildings. They have 10 houses for residents to live in, each house has 8 to 10 bedrooms. I was in house 2. It sure was different for me to be among so many people. I am single and live alone, so this was defiantly different.  One other building has a big room where they zap you while you pedal a stationary bike. They also have a big thing they call “ZERO G”. Zero g is a very long I-Beam that they put you into a harness, connect you to a trolley, can raise and support some of your body weight, allowing you to walk under the I-Beam somewhat like a normal person.  There is another room that has a submersible treadmill. There you change into a swimsuit, walk out onto a platform that has the treadmill on it, hold onto the handrails, get lowered into about 4 feet of heated water, and begin walking on the treadmill.  Another building is filled with offices, meeting rooms, and a big gym. Part of what I did for a living was Corporate Instructor, where I teach up to 10 guys from our service shops around the USA all about a product they will be installing, servicing, and repairing. Part of my job is preparing, creating, and presenting power point presentations. QLI obtained a couple of these from my boss, and I presented them to a meeting room full of people at QLI as if I was instructing a class. One of the girls, named Alex, filmed my presentation on her phone without my knowing. When I found out about it later, I remember I got very mad at her, calling her a “sneaky redhead” She laughed and laughed!  House 2 has a large room filled with many tables to eat at, as well as a couch and comfy chairs to sit in, with a TV. They had a large kitchen, stove, microwave, and three refrigerators. They would take me to a local food store to buy frozen dinners, so If I did not like what they were serving, I could have something else.  Yes, I could eat again. It happened after they took me to a hospital for yet another swallow test. This is where you eat and drink foods while they take X-Rays of you swallowing. And this time, I passed the swallow test. Shortly after I did, one night, at about 8:30, a new lady appeared in my room, said she was a nurse, and was here to remove my feeding tube. I asked her if it was going to hurt, and she said “YUP!”.  She grabbed the tube, told me to take a deep breath, and pulled it like she was trying to start a lawn mower. It popped out of me causing deep pain. She wiped up the mess and taped a big gauze pad over my stomach. I moaned for a half hour before ringing for aspirin. Then I could fall asleep. It just kept getting better after that. Because NOW I could eat real food!  At QLI they did lots of exercise both in the mornings and in the afternoons. They taped pads to my leg and shocked me while I pedaled a stationary bike. They took me for walks with a walker, and had me climb stairs. One day, they took away my wheelchair and gave me a cane and a leg brace. I missed that chair for 2 weeks!  I had to have an escort walking with me when I had to go to exercise sessions. The walk was about a city block. They would put a gait belt on me and sometimes hold onto it. So, I used to sneak out by myself and walk, and sometimes I would get halfway there when I heard running feet behind me, and a loud voice saying “WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE ALL BY YOURSELF?” I really miss those times!  One day, I was walking back to house 2 and decided to take a short cut across the grass. I miss stepped, lost my balance, and fell. I was not hurt; it was soft grass. But there was nothing to grab onto to get back up, so after trying to get up and failing at it, I gave up and waited for someone to come out and help. They all came out one at a time and stood near me, laughing, asking me how the air was down there, and generally having fun with me. I was sure to avoid taking any short cuts from then on.  They found out I like to cook food, and am good at it. I started planning a weekend meal for the people in the house. I would go with an escort to the food store, buy the food, and usually on Saturday prepare and serve dinner for anyone who wanted to have it. I made stuffed peppers one time, stuffed cabbage another time, lemon whole chicken, and lots of other things. All my cooking was greedily consumed down to the last bite with lots of compliments!  QLI has a room where they kept special bicycles that were low to the ground. Some of these were 2 people bikes. One day we loaded 6 bikes into pickup trucks and drove to a riding trail that was supposed to be 40 miles long. It ran in the middle of some blocks between the houses and back yards, behind businesses of all kinds, and along a chuckling creek. We peddled 3 miles out and 3 miles back. It was a LOT of fun! We would go riding on the QLI campus as well. And if it was raining, they had a stationary one set up in front of a computer. It was almost like riding one outside for real.  My insurance was due to stop paying QLI, and I found out that during one of their appraisal meetings one of the therapists was very vocal about me, and said if I were to stay another month I would be very much better. So, QLI gave me a free month at their own expense for me to succeed. I can almost cry when I remember this. I told their CEO “thank you” in person, god bless you and QLI! She just smiled, and said her job was easy, all she had to do was say “YES”.  My Therapists once drove me home for a day trip. Alex and Megan and I. Megan saw where I lived and recommended some things; like handrails in my bathroom, which I did have installed. She scrubbed my refrigerator sparkling clean! It was empty and turned off. Alex was visiting where I worked and seeing my desk and other things. It was just for the day, so we drove back. It’s a three hour drive each way.  The next trip I took home was with Roni. She drove us, and I stayed home and slept in my bed for three days. I went to work as well, and while I was at my desk answering phone calls, Kim from Human Resources, and my boss, were both sitting nearby listening to me talk of the phone as they were also busy on their laptops. After three days, I guess they were satisfied that I was doing OK. I must say I am a lucky man to have such a job. I have been treated very well. But I have also worked for them since 1979!  The day came that I was discharged from QLI, and they drove me home for the last time. I was there for about 4 months. I miss the place and all the wonderful people there. But I do keep in touch with many of them via email. They are wonderful people who did so much for me.  Before I was discharged, Roni and Vanessa and others asked me about continuing therapy on an outpatient basis in Kansas City, and we found Ability KC. I chose this place because they are local, AND they have a driving program as well. I have a nice Crown Victoria that is waiting for me, but I want to do it right.  At this point I have completed a physical therapy course and also an occupational therapy course. I continued to go twice a week there for electrical stimulation on my right leg while peddling a stationary bike. But now I am taking a break from therapy and thinking of what to do next.  So, I am still walking with a cane and am still weak on my right leg, ankle, and right hand. What puzzles me is what happened? My understanding about a stroke and bleeding on the right hand side of the brain would affect the left side of the body. But I am affected on the RIGHT hand side. I am seeking suggestions as to what might have happened to me, and what I can do to improve to the point of not needing a leg brace or a cane to walk around. Thank you, and god bless you. John M"

One work day I did not show up at work and I did not call in, and that’s not the way I normally operate.

Luke’s hospital and performed a craniotomy, to stop the bleeding. Someone called my younger brother in New Jersey to tell him where I was, and that they did not think I would survive. He flew out here immediately in shock. Three weeks later, I was transferred to a rehabilitation clinic in Overland Park, Kansas, where I was still in a wheelchair. It was there I began to regain my memory, because I do not remember the hospital at all.

She wiped up the mess and taped a big gauze pad over my stomach. I moaned for a half hour before ringing for aspirin. Then I could fall asleep. It just kept getting better after that. Because NOW I could eat real food!  At QLI they did lots of exercise both in the mornings and in the afternoons. They taped pads to my leg and shocked me while I pedaled a stationary bike. They took me for walks with a walker, and had me climb stairs. One day, they took away my wheelchair and gave me a cane and a leg brace. I missed that chair for 2 weeks!  I had to have an escort walking with me when I had to go to exercise sessions. The walk was about a city block. They would put a gait belt on me and sometimes hold onto it. So, I used to sneak out by myself and walk, and sometimes I would get halfway there when I heard running feet behind me, and a loud voice saying “WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE ALL BY YOURSELF?” I really miss those times!  One day, I was walking back to house 2 and decided to take a short cut across the grass. I miss stepped, lost my balance, and fell. I was not hurt; it was soft grass. But there was nothing to grab onto to get back up, so after trying to get up and failing at it, I gave up and waited for someone to come out and help. They all came out one at a time and stood near me, laughing, asking me how the air was down there, and generally having fun with me. I was sure to avoid taking any short cuts from then on.  They found out I like to cook food, and am good at it. I started planning a weekend meal for the people in the house. I would go with an escort to the food store, buy the food, and usually on Saturday prepare and serve dinner for anyone who wanted to have it. I made stuffed peppers one time, stuffed cabbage another time, lemon whole chicken, and lots of other things. All my cooking was greedily consumed down to the last bite with lots of compliments!  QLI has a room where they kept special bicycles that were low to the ground. Some of these were 2 people bikes. One day we loaded 6 bikes into pickup trucks and drove to a riding trail that was supposed to be 40 miles long. It ran in the middle of some blocks between the houses and back yards, behind businesses of all kinds, and along a chuckling creek. We peddled 3 miles out and 3 miles back. It was a LOT of fun! We would go riding on the QLI campus as well. And if it was raining, they had a stationary one set up in front of a computer. It was almost like riding one outside for real.  My insurance was due to stop paying QLI, and I found out that during one of their appraisal meetings one of the therapists was very vocal about me, and said if I were to stay another month I would be very much better. So, QLI gave me a free month at their own expense for me to succeed. I can almost cry when I remember this. I told their CEO “thank you” in person, god bless you and QLI! She just smiled, and said her job was easy, all she had to do was say “YES”.  My Therapists once drove me home for a day trip. Alex and Megan and I. Megan saw where I lived and recommended some things; like handrails in my bathroom, which I did have installed. She scrubbed my refrigerator sparkling clean! It was empty and turned off. Alex was visiting where I worked and seeing my desk and other things. It was just for the day, so we drove back. It’s a three hour drive each way.  The next trip I took home was with Roni. She drove us, and I stayed home and slept in my bed for three days. I went to work as well, and while I was at my desk answering phone calls, Kim from Human Resources, and my boss, were both sitting nearby listening to me talk of the phone as they were also busy on their laptops. After three days, I guess they were satisfied that I was doing OK. I must say I am a lucky man to have such a job. I have been treated very well. But I have also worked for them since 1979!  The day came that I was discharged from QLI, and they drove me home for the last time. I was there for about 4 months. I miss the place and all the wonderful people there. But I do keep in touch with many of them via email. They are wonderful people who did so much for me.  Before I was discharged, Roni and Vanessa and others asked me about continuing therapy on an outpatient basis in Kansas City, and we found Ability KC. I chose this place because they are local, AND they have a driving program as well. I have a nice Crown Victoria that is waiting for me, but I want to do it right.  At this point I have completed a physical therapy course and also an occupational therapy course. I continued to go twice a week there for electrical stimulation on my right leg while peddling a stationary bike. But now I am taking a break from therapy and thinking of what to do next.  So, I am still walking with a cane and am still weak on my right leg, ankle, and right hand. What puzzles me is what happened? My understanding about a stroke and bleeding on the right hand side of the brain would affect the left side of the body. But I am affected on the RIGHT hand side. I am seeking suggestions as to what might have happened to me, and what I can do to improve to the point of not needing a leg brace or a cane to walk around. Thank you, and god bless you. John M"

What happened to me? What more can I do to get better?,"This journey of mine started with an incident that happened to me when I was in my apartment last October. Nobody knows exactly what happened. One work day I did not show up at work and I did not call in, and that’s not the way I normally operate. One of my co-workers got very worried and vocal about me missing, to the point my boss drove to my apartment and banged on the door. Someone eventually opened that door, and they found me passed out in my bed, bleeding on the right-hand side of my head.  They took me to ST. Luke’s hospital and performed a craniotomy, to stop the bleeding. Someone called my younger brother in New Jersey to tell him where I was, and that they did not think I would survive. He flew out here immediately in shock. Three weeks later, I was transferred to a rehabilitation clinic in Overland Park, Kansas, where I was still in a wheelchair. It was there I began to regain my memory, because I do not remember the hospital at all.  They had put in a feeding tube in my stomach because they were afraid I would choke to death because I did not swallow correctly. This takes all the joy out of your life by not being able to eat and taste food.  I remember when a therapy girl helped me by removing all the staples they had used to close my head back up. 45 staples. The person stapling my head must have had a grand old time banging away.  So here at this rehab place they would feed me by pouring glop into a tube connected to my stomach. In the afternoons, they would take me to a GYM to do some exercises. I spent most of the time sleeping and watching TV.  Several weeks later a new person stood in my room and drove me to Omaha Nebraska to a rehabilitation place named QLI. I was there for 4 months. If anyone had previously told me about this place, I would not have believed them. It’s something you must experience.  QLI is on a large piece of land with many buildings. They have 10 houses for residents to live in, each house has 8 to 10 bedrooms. I was in house 2. It sure was different for me to be among so many people. I am single and live alone, so this was defiantly different.  One other building has a big room where they zap you while you pedal a stationary bike. They also have a big thing they call “ZERO G”. Zero g is a very long I-Beam that they put you into a harness, connect you to a trolley, can raise and support some of your body weight, allowing you to walk under the I-Beam somewhat like a normal person.  There is another room that has a submersible treadmill. There you change into a swimsuit, walk out onto a platform that has the treadmill on it, hold onto the handrails, get lowered into about 4 feet of heated water, and begin walking on the treadmill.  Another building is filled with offices, meeting rooms, and a big gym. Part of what I did for a living was Corporate Instructor, where I teach up to 10 guys from our service shops around the USA all about a product they will be installing, servicing, and repairing. Part of my job is preparing, creating, and presenting power point presentations. QLI obtained a couple of these from my boss, and I presented them to a meeting room full of people at QLI as if I was instructing a class. One of the girls, named Alex, filmed my presentation on her phone without my knowing. When I found out about it later, I remember I got very mad at her, calling her a “sneaky redhead” She laughed and laughed!  House 2 has a large room filled with many tables to eat at, as well as a couch and comfy chairs to sit in, with a TV. They had a large kitchen, stove, microwave, and three refrigerators. They would take me to a local food store to buy frozen dinners, so If I did not like what they were serving, I could have something else.  Yes, I could eat again. It happened after they took me to a hospital for yet another swallow test. This is where you eat and drink foods while they take X-Rays of you swallowing. And this time, I passed the swallow test. Shortly after I did, one night, at about 8:30, a new lady appeared in my room, said she was a nurse, and was here to remove my feeding tube. I asked her if it was going to hurt, and she said “YUP!”.

I have to make an effort somewhat to swallow my spit. But swallowing food and water is fine.  7. Sudden onset of headaches.

I've been to the ER 2 times in the last 2 months and the problem is, unless you show the most IMMEDIATE, DROP TO THE FLO, signs of a stroke, they(ER MD's) will say ""Oh you're young, it's very unlikely, such and such."" One of the two relatives was my dad, and perhaps his death is what puts the concern to the forefront of my mind.Originally he had his stroke while teaching a classroom. After the stroke, he successfully stood up and tried to teach the class(lol), thats until he tried to talk and thats when his students knew there was a problem. They rushed him to the hospital and he tragically passed(from a subsequent stroke 3 weeks later). Even before he passed, he went from not remembering who I was, to gaining 70% of his memory back(I get my number from our conversations). I bring up my father as an example to say this, I suspect that I'm having ministrokes. But because I'm so big and physically strong(mentally strong too), I'm not keeling over like the average person would do so. Hence, when I test strongly in front of MD's, automatically dismiss the notion that a mini stroke is happening. Now, I may be a hypo, but I don't want to die to find out I'm right.  1. If a doctor does not believe, what diagnostic tests should I demand? 2. What medications should I demand? My dad was on blood pressure and thinner meds, is it the same for anyone? 3. Should I shoot straight to a neuro doctor?  Thanks for the response to my likely hypochondriac post."

Does anyone know of a way of at least relieving this fatigue when it happens. I would dearly love to get rid of it, but I would imagine that is just a pipe dream, but something to reduce the symptoms would be great. Thanks Eileen"

I don’t know and that’s stressing me out physical therapy doesn’t work baths make me lock up the only thing that seems to work is my painkillers now and then but I dont want to rely on them if people know what I mean.

I see a psychiatrist, he's brilliant, I see him since the burnout I had in 2001. He manages the mental issues that come in the Fibro package, and tries to help with the pain as well. But my main issue at the moment is that I feel very lonely. People around here (I live in Switzerland) are very narrow-minded and don't even believe Fibro is a thing.  My Mum was my rock, she always supported me, but she passed away 3 yrs ago.  My best friend has just been diagnosed with ALS, and truly, I don't want to burden her with my problems... she's having it way worst than me... And what hurts the most is that my husband (who is very Swiss) gets almost angry during my flare-ups. He acts with contempt, doesn't offer any help, and pretty much disappears from my life until I do better. He doesn't say it openly, but he acts like my problems offend him. Sorry for the long downer... today I'd love to talk to someone who understand what I'm going through, and this forum is the closest I have. Thanks and have a nice day :-)"

Of course, I may get the placebo but the hope it gives me that Life won’t always be this way makes such a big difference. Check it out yourselves and I wish you all good luck!  Epicgenetics Fma test"

Slowly but surely I have learned to live with it but it does change your life and I watch every little thing become a ""CHRONIC"" issue with me BUT last month I woke up with a strange foot pain, it was very odd and did not feel like FMS. I just dealt with it BUT then a week or so later it was also in my other foot and this concerned me. I went to doc and of course its more than likly a flair up but again it felt weird, not FMS like. the pain quickly moved into my calves and even further my thighs. now today it stays with me and is off the charts rediculous. I saw a neurologist and they ran a CT for MS and blood work. The test came back good but of course MRI was needed but cant have that due to a spinal stimulator. a few days a go my left wrist started to hurt and now has become a huge issue and my jar started to pop while eating and locks up....all muscle related it seems which does look like FMS BUT again does not feel like it. I wake in middle of night when i do fall asleep and I could have horrible unbearable pain in my hands, or one night it was my big toe...it seems worse in morning and evenings..I get up barley and have to hold on to things to walk. Im on percoset, gabbepentin, Butabatol for headaches,,,I have flexeril, hydro, tramadol, and a few others in the locked arsenal but Im very careful.

In between, the Pulmonologist suspected a lung infection and started some heavy dose anti biotics and he thinks she has reacted to it well, which means hopefully there is no issue with lungs.  she is out of ICU, but absolutely weak in right side.  Please tell me, what would be the ideal process of recovery for her. Will she be able to walk again (they did many CT scans after but says there were no extra strokes!)

Please tell me, what would be the ideal process of recovery for her. Will she be able to walk again (they did many CT scans after but says there were no extra strokes!) Will giving more blood thinners, once the hospital feels it ok to give her, help her retrieve, please.  Forgive me for any lack of clarity in this message as am in deep pain and all.

She had some weakness with her right leg and hand and the speech was not clear and the mouth was turning to a side a bit.  However, she was in the ICU and after 4 days she was out into a room and her mobility got better each day.  Unfortunately, she was coughing hard and on the day she was to be discharged from hospital we noticed that her stomache was growing and after a CT scan found out that there was blood and clot accumulated in the wall of stomache, right side. An I&D was done by the General surgeon and nearly 1 and half litres of blood and clot was removed. She was back in ICU.  They had to stop all blood thinning medicines hence.  Slowly her right side is weak again and after more than one week of I &D, they have restarted just 75mg of Aspirin but nothing else.

It isn't always easy for people to recognize symptoms of a small stroke. They may mistakenly think the symptoms are a part of aging, or the symptoms may be confused with those of other conditions that cause similar symptoms. Every second counts when a stroke occurs.

I was on 10 mg prednisone daily for about 3 years. It worked ... my blood pressure rose a bit and my skin was thinner, so my doctor sent me to a RA doctor to find another option. The RA DR did many scans and xrays. Not arthristis, but doesn't know why the prednisone was working for fibro. I can no longer walk without pain, but blood pressure and skin have returned to normal, but I can't enjoy my grandkids with this pain. I manage, but some days I want my prednisone back and will deal with the two side effects I had. SO My question is has anyone out there used prednisone for fibro and had it work? I should clarify that we discovered the prenisone worked when I hurt my foot/ankle and couldn't walk."

The best coping mechanism is regular exercise & I use essential oils on a daily basis, topical & through diffusing.

It keeps me up at night. My husband tries to help, but it's never enough. When I splurge on a 90-minute professional massage, I leave wishing I could afford several more hours. Right now, the muscle that's driving me nuts is my left ileopsoas. I can feel it from the inside of my femur head all the way up through my pelvic girdle to where it connects to the inside of my spine. It's been ""itching"" for weeks. Stretching helps only a little.

I guess my story is probably similar to many of yours. For the best part of these 10 years I was in the most awful state imaginable. I was close many times to just run the car into the next tree and make this misery an end. I have had gabapentin, Cymbalta and many other drugs that did not help me at all, if anything the side effects made it even less worth living. We emigrated and so got a new doctor. Although he really tried to help but I guess he didn't know how. However during one check-up he had a flash of inspiration and prescribed me Arnica-Betula compound drops - yes a homeopathic remedy - and yes I went home in tears, thinking what a waste of money but low and behold no more burning muscles in my body and the fibro fog had also disappeared - a miracle in my eyes. A little bit later he put me on Spiricort for something completely unrelated but it worked for the Fibro, the arthritis in the whole of my spine, and all the destroyed discs too. And by accident I discovered that a protein shake in the morning made a massive, massive difference to me. I actually have now a bit of get up and go- something I could only dream of before. In the last 2 months I have been able to clean and sort out my whole house- something I am really proud of having achieved. Without the help of the drops, the tablets and the shakes totally impossible. I also take the vit D3 of course, when necessary i.e. when my bones hurt. I am now able to work 55% and on my days off I go walking with our dog - something I have not been able to do without screaming in pain afterwards, for a long long time. Although I know I am not healed but these measures made life worth living for me. I am thinking of trying Ginko for my brain - my short term memory is atrocious. Anyone tried that?"

Once I get the opportunity to speak with my team of doctors I, hopefully, will get some answers. But in the meantime, does anyone else have these type of symptoms that can ease my mind a little?"

I noticed that I was stumbling over words, stuttering and losing track of where I was. I wasn't extremely bad so I assumed it was stress because things were bad at work and I was looking for a new job. This continued for the next few months. At the end of May I was offered a new job that was exicted about. I quit the job I hated on May 26th since I was given a start date of June 13th. I decided to spend some summer time with my daughter. That job then was postponed a week or two. I tried calling the company several times and eventually was told it was postponed til August. June 25th I was sitting at home with my family when I got a metallic taste in the left side of my mouth. It also felt like something moved in my left ear canal. I assumed it was sinus issues so I took meds and both issues eventually went away. July 2nd we were at my in-laws and I walked out into their garage when suddenly my left cheek went numb. No other symptoms just numb. My husband checked me for obvious signs of stroke. There wasn't any so I went and sat down for awhile. The numbness eventually went away but still felt weird. I went to my Primary doctor July 5th, she saw no signs of stroke either. She gave me antibiotics and said if symptoms persisted that we would do an mri. July 9th I had trouble getting my eyes to focus then starting my left jaw bone started burning/tingling, it worked it's way up to my cheek bone and my left upper lip. I then noticed swelling and felt pressure around my left eye. Called my doc and scheduled the mri. When I got mri results I was told I had a brain tumor and was referred to brain surgeon. I of course freaked out. Surgery was schedueled. My pre op blood work came back showing my clotting function too high, retested, still high. Then I was sent to Hematologist to figure out what was going on. Turns out Several of my clotting functions were high. Because of that They determined I didn't have a tumor but a stroke. Surgery cancelled of course. I'm now on blood thinners to reduce the risk of another stroke.  My problem now is I'm scared all the time. What if it happens again? Worse this time?

I am getting desperate & I can only imagine how my husband feels. My husband has had roaming joint pain for maybe five years now. It will move from his left elbow to his right foot to his right middle finger without reason. This used to occur sporadically - maybe once a month to once every two months & last from a few hours to a few days. He was also extremely fatigued, napping every day after work & every weekend. He did seem to feel sick more than ""the average person"" as well with headaches & flu like symptoms often. In the past two years it has gotten extremely worse. There have been virtually no breaks in the pain. Some days he can barely walk after getting out of bed. Let me say that he is fairly healthy, in his 40's & not remotely overweight (6 feet, 170 pounds). This now seems to be affecting not only his joints but also his tendons & fascia. He will have swelling above one of his knees (also red & warm), his finger will swell to almost twice it's size & occasionally he will be unable to bend his wrist or straighten his finger. The pain/swelling is still roaming - there seems to be no rhyme or reason to where it will show up.  He is still exhausted. It is hard for him to get up for work & he is down for a nap as soon as he gets home from work. It is not unusual for these naps to last through the night. He naps most of the weekend as well. He is also now in pain while he is sleeping/laying down. He will often moan during the night & last night I found him in the chair because it hurt too bad to lie down.  On the days that he does wake up feeling ok, it is usually short lived & he will be back in pain before the end of the day. His blood test have come back normal for the most part. He has been tested for Lyme disease a few times & it has been negative. The only thing that tested positive (once) was ANA. The rheumatologist however said that was inconclusive.  We've been less than pleased with the 2 rheumatologist we have seen - they seem to blow this off. Our GP has been great, but there doesn't seem to be much he can do other than refer us to a rheumatologist. It is very frustrating to see him in this much pain & not have a plan of action. He has almost given up on doctors. I just cannot imagine him having to suffer for the rest of his life.

Yes it’s hard. Unfair. But now I’m on probiotics and enzymes. Our immune systems are weak and need xtra support. I’ve been sick, really out if it since Jan and now I’m taking control. Try herbs.

I had been having ""flare ups"" prior to the diagnosis since 2016 but didn't know what it was since I have other medical issues as well. I then noticed last year it became increasingly difficult to concentrate and focus. I had no idea what was going on. So, I spoke with my neurologist and she put me on Zoloft. It didn't help at all and I was on it for 6 weeks. She then prescribed me Effexor which she said would most likely be more effective. It started working almost immediately. I felt alive again. The depression and feelings of anxiety started to decrease and I've been taking it ever since. I then saw a Rheumatologist who diagnosed the fibromyalgia in the first appointment. The trigger points on my body are in my neck. Once my neck starts to hurt, the pain travels down my back, arms, legs, and abdomen. It is the worst pain ever. I am now on Lyrica for the fibromyalgia and it's been helping. But I must say in order to keep the ""flare ups"" at bay, your diet has to change. Your diet contributes a great deal to the ""flare ups."" Sugar, carbs, and soda are major factors. I have accepted that there is no cure for this but I've learned to manage it the best way I know how."

I have permanent brain fog, somedays worse than others and some days my legs just feel heavy and although I am walking the dog it feels like they are somehow disconnected to my body. They feel heavy and the soles of my feet feel somehow wierd when they hit the ground. Other days they feel normal.  I have had MRIs of my brain ( 2 over 4 years) MRI of my back, I have had steroid injections in my back, I do YOGA, exercise etc but nothing helps. The tingling is now permanent in my feet and I also get buzzing in my ears.  Some days the fatigue is overwhelming, on other days its not.  My doctor says I dont' have MS or Parkinsons of MND, but no one can tell me WHY i feel like this :-( I am terrified it will just get worse and worse and one day I won't be able to walk .  HELP"

Made me go see a doctor. Doctor lost his ***, made ultrasound, said ""yeah there is something going on there, probably have to get medications"" (talks to me nervously for 1,5 hours). Sends me to a cardiologist. Cardiologist does ultrasound too, also on the heart (+ stress ECG, looked good). He shows me 2 minimal spots where there was minimal buildup of what could be plaque in one of the carotid arteries. Says he neither understands the reaction by first doctor, nor sees any correlation between what he saw in ultrasound and that x-ray. Is genuinely baffled. Says I should exercise and quit smoking, but there is no ""stenosis"" or need for medication. Blood levels still pending. Can anybody help me? I really need to know wtf happened.

I had them in for 14 years and had severe capsular contracture.) My illnesses, (probably Sjogren’s since it’s systemc) have changed my brain (centralized sleep apnea and severe narcolepsy), and my internal organs, wounds won’t heal. It took over 6 months for my hysterectomy (took my cervix and appendix out) to heal enough to have intercourse, biopsy still shows pre-cancerous cells. I had my tonsils removed at 62, and they were severely infected, which my ENT was surprised about. My pathology report on that surgery and my hysterectomy showed enlarged lymph nodes. I also had my gallbladder removed this past summer. All these operations occurred within the past 10 months.  I was seeing a pain management doctor, who I never liked, but he never talked to me about what I had except my spine problems, which are horrible. I had a terrible reaction to the steroid injections and can’t take them anymore. In December I switched my appointment to the next day to watch my granddaughter, and I was set up with another doctor that I had seen frequently. The doctor I didn’t like came in and accused me of trying to get to another doctor to get more meds. I have NEVER taken more than prescribed, but it escalated from there because when I started to cry a little because I was so insulted and had a temp of 103, he told me to go see a psychiatrist, and he literally said, “Yeah, yeah, everybody’s got a sob story. Do you know how many times I’ve heard that?” He beat his chest and told me that ‘They work under ME!”  I looked at his reviews and every other one was horrible, including one written by a nurse accompanying a patient, who she said was a very honest man!  I cannot get my files from him now. I can’t drive because of my previous surgery to go there, and even my case manager tried, and they faxed the wrong info.  I’m beside myself because I can’t take steroid injections and every doctor either won’t prescribe medications, which are the only things that work for me. I see a chiropractor, have been through countless physical therapies, and do everything right, but I have congenital spine defects and autoimmune pain. I dont know where to turn!  I live north of Detroit, and have become a recluse, because I’m recovering from surgery, and I’ve lost so many relationships, family, friends, etc., because I can’t keep up.

Doesn't happen all the time, but it happens quite a bit. I have Fibromyalgia (and Raynaud's). I have siblings with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Haven't been to the rheumatologist's for a while, but when I went a few years ago, I told the doc about it, and he said not to use the mouse (like that's possible!).  I'd love to hear if anyone else has this problem going on, and if it's related to Fibro."

The doctor's have tried several drugs and pain management clinics to assist with my disabiling pain. Opioids, morphine and many other drugs all which have little effect. I am desperately trying to get a ketamine infusion which will give me some very serious pain relief, meaning I can get out of bed and start helping and interacting with my family. Can you please help me raise funds to get this much needed treatment. There's only one hospital in Melbourne who will do the infusion and it's Epworth private hospital they are asking for $8904. If there was any other way I would definitely do it. Private health insurance want$108 per fortnight and on a pension it's impossible to pay this amount of money."

Three months after we had sex and two months after having mono symptoms were persistent I took another rapid 4th generation test and a HIV RNA test both at three months and both were negative. After those test I started having vertigo sensations and extreme fatigue, I took another test at 4 months it was negative. Are these symptoms related to my mono, stress or do I HAVE HIV? Please my doctor says I do not have it but online I see wait till 6 months. Do I have to wait that long? Another bonus he did ended up giving me mono and genital herpes. I am okay with both because both are not life threatening my main concern is HIV? Please I NEED HELP!!"

I went for a massage in a spa few days ago and while I was preparing for the massage and lying on my stomach, I noticed two dark brown spots or stains in the pillow case which actually touched my lips and eyes briefly. Now I was not sure if they were blood spots or other stains from previous clients. I am not also sure if the spa do change the sheets or pillow cases after another client. Not also sure if those stains were wet or dry coz I immediately asked to replace my pillow. What if those stains were blood and have HIV? Is there possibility of transmission if the pillow case briefly touched my lips and probably my eyes? Do you think I need to get tested ? Thanks very much. I hope you can answer me for my peace of mind."

The sex was protected, but being drunk and stupid I used the small Thai condoms which split. I only noticed the condom had split at the end but I know it was intact 5 minutes before this. The girl was 24 and I am 19. I do also remember performing oral sex on the girl, as did she on me but I had a condom on at this point. 7 days since the event I have come down with really bad flu like symptoms, been in bed all day today. I have had diarrhoea, and felt sick also. I have a ulcer under my toungue which is small but I know it’s there. I have managed to get up and about but I certainly don’t feel great. I am currently in Bali and am unsure what to do in this instance.  The girl has added me on social media and I asked her if I should get checked. She asked how many girls I have slept with and when I told her she was shocked and thought she also needed to get checked as apparently she has only ever had one partner (which raises my suspicions as this can’t be true).

In the room was a shower where she rinsed herself before we even started. She gave me oral sex with a condom on. Used tissue to remove the condom before using a new one to have vaginal sex. She was on top of me and when she remained on top while I was ejaculating. Some semen spilled on the base of my penis (not the head). She quickly came off and wiped it up with tissue. My question is, that was the first time I ever had sex so I know I was negative at the time. am I at risk as it's my collected semen that fell on my penis?  Also did another dumb thing another time.  2) A colleague of mine gave me oral sex without a condom. We had sex twice that same night with a condom. Problem is she's quite promiscuous and had a wild sex life. Am I at heavy risk? I'm going to get tested next weekend as I've been experiencing weird burning stinging sensations that feels internal inside my body.

I started using September 1st and I have darn near zero fibro pain now! They are loaded with vitamins and garcinia something. I can't remember that name! Thank you fibro fog! My typical days before taking this was spent in unbelievable pain and burning all over. It felt like all the pain nerves in my back was radiating a burning pain all over my body. We have all tried the diff meds they but us on that never work. I started feeling like a lab rat. Nothing worked. I am really leary of anything new to try, but I was offered to try it for free for 2 days. So I thought what the heck, it's free. Day one my fibro pain was lifting, day two there was no pain. I wasn't sure if my body was letting me have a reprieve or if this stuff really did work, so I bought a weeks worth, knowing if I went 3 or more days then it had to be working. Needless to say, I was in contact with the seller after day 5 and no pain, ordering a months worth. Its a powder form you mix in water and drink twice a day. I have not went a day without it since I started. Afraid to get that pain back! I was diagnosed in 93 with fibro and suffered for so many years with it. Fit sticks aren't marketed to treat fibro but someone with fibro took it and I am so glad I was told about it. It's marketed for energy and weight loss. To me, that's just a nice addition to it relieving me pain. I have been so much more active, not sure if from Fit Sticks or just from not being in pain. My hubby is thrilled lol. I've been cooking new recipes I find on Facebook. Before, he was lucky if he got pork chops and French fries for supper! Anyways, I was just wondering if anyone else takes Fit Sticks and how it has helped them."

I have always had issues with the Pain Management doctors I go to each month, they treat you like cattle rushing us thru to get to the next patient. My doctors office I go too saw the main Dr. on my first visit but then after that you see his PA or NP. They make us all sit in a room after being seen to wait for the main Dr. come sign the prescriptions so we can go. The main Dr. is busy in the back part of the building doing spinal injections and comes out in between patients to sign the prescriptions for us and they label that as being seen by the Dr. I have tried and tried to get out of that office before they kill me but no other,offices will let me move to them for some unknown reason. They state that after reviewing my records they would not be able to offer any me any other additional treatment than what I am currently receiving and deny my transfer. Once you are seen by a pain management facility in my area you can't stop and then go back again so I can't make my move that way or have my fibro dr refer me to a new facility so my hands are tied. I have to constantly remind them that I have fibro only to be told they don't treat fibro even though the dr told me they do twice. A couple months ago I went for my visit and out of the blue she dropped my dosage down and when I asked why she said I was taking a benzo and I couldn't take them together even though I have been taking the same mess for two years. She wrote in my chart that I got upset when my dosage was changed without saying I just wanted a explanation of why. I told her I had not been taking that benzo in months and even then it was as needed. I have never asked to be increased I just tell them how I feel and let them tell me what I need. The very next visit she asked me have you quit taking the benzo I tried to explain again but added that I flushed them. She then said that she was going to take me off my pain meds completely so I asked why. She said because I wasn't getting enough benefit out of it and then said you look the best I have ever seen you look and I said that is because I take the pain meds and that I was having a goo day.Geez! So now I worry each month when it's time for my next appt. what is going to happen and with the Gov. Big Opiod issue going on I just don't know what to do or what to expect. I just had my disability case approved and being enrolled in Medicare and the coverage is better in the ACA. The drug plans are so expensive the best rate I could find is the tier three drugs have a $47 copay and I have seven of them total. I will be paying all of my disability money back to Medicare. So with this very long post I would like to know if anyone has info on what they are trying to do with the issue. It seems like they are trying to make it so expensive to have medication that we will have to go without it so then the opiod delima will be taken care of. MS Contin is non formulary on Medicare, maybe we have to decide each month which Rx to get filled. Will pain mgmt be nonexistent next year? If anyone read this whole thing I thank you and hope you have some info to pass along? Bless all of you and I hope you don't have pain in your life, take care."

A couple months ago I went for my visit and out of the blue she dropped my dosage down and when I asked why she said I was taking a benzo and I couldn't take them together even though I have been taking the same mess for two years. She wrote in my chart that I got upset when my dosage was changed without saying I just wanted a explanation of why. I told her I had not been taking that benzo in months and even then it was as needed. I have never asked to be increased I just tell them how I feel and let them tell me what I need. The very next visit she asked me have you quit taking the benzo I tried to explain again but added that I flushed them. She then said that she was going to take me off my pain meds completely so I asked why. She said because I wasn't getting enough benefit out of it and then said you look the best I have ever seen you look and I said that is because I take the pain meds and that I was having a goo day.Geez! So now I worry each month when it's time for my next appt. what is going to happen and with the Gov. Big Opiod issue going on I just don't know what to do or what to expect. I just had my disability case approved and being enrolled in Medicare and the coverage is better in the ACA. The drug plans are so expensive the best rate I could find is the tier three drugs have a $47 copay and I have seven of them total. I will be paying all of my disability money back to Medicare. So with this very long post I would like to know if anyone has info on what they are trying to do with the issue. It seems like they are trying to make it so expensive to have medication that we will have to go without it so then the opiod delima will be taken care of. MS Contin is non formulary on Medicare, maybe we have to decide each month which Rx to get filled. Will pain mgmt be nonexistent next year? If anyone read this whole thing I thank you and hope you have some info to pass along? Bless all of you and I hope you don't have pain in your life, take care."

I have always had issues with the Pain Management doctors I go to each month, they treat you like cattle rushing us thru to get to the next patient. My doctors office I go too saw the main Dr. on my first visit but then after that you see his PA or NP. They make us all sit in a room after being seen to wait for the main Dr. come sign the prescriptions so we can go. The main Dr. is busy in the back part of the building doing spinal injections and comes out in between patients to sign the prescriptions for us and they label that as being seen by the Dr. I have tried and tried to get out of that office before they kill me but no other,offices will let me move to them for some unknown reason. They state that after reviewing my records they would not be able to offer any me any other additional treatment than what I am currently receiving and deny my transfer.

The doctors aren't particularly helpful. However I am concerned that it could be related to their heavy use of vaping throughout the day. The issues seem to have started at the same time/immediately after they began to vape. Could this be causing the symptoms? I've seen a few people with the complaint in forums. No matter how much I try they won't stop vaping. The most they have done is change the brand of eliquid. Any advice would be great."

Ever since i stopped PEP i had diarrhea for 10 days and have had muscle/bone pains in my upper back and groin non stop that is very similar to the pains i experienced while on PEP. Does PEP stay in your system that long? Am i seroconverting?

(While drinking I notice slight blood on her teeth & gums & when eating apple, also I notice red/orange color on my groin area while washing at my home) Later, I tried to contact her, but she left to Philippines and I came to know where she was working that, she failed in her medical and was medically terminated as she was hiv positive. So she was untreated and highly infectious. I would like to know  What are my risk of acquiring hiv from Unprotected oral insertive sex with bleeding gums and multiple cuts on the penis/scrotum and groin area bearing the scrotum skin is very thin and sensitive. The hand massage was rough & the lot of force was applied, so, there could be possibility the blood mix with saliva, which was present on the groin area, was rigorously pressed toward the superficial cut, which could have opened and allowed it to enter the blood stream.  Also, she drink the alcohol before the blowjob, so the alcohol can deactivate the protective enzymes and protein of saliva.  I would like to know, what is more risky & dangerous, the multiple cuts or urethra. I have been browsing your forum and this forum has been consistently denying any risk of hiv from oral sex/exposure outside of body, The only risk is from vaginal and anal unprotected sex. Also, it is claimed that, hiv is very fragile virus, once it is exposed to air, it is unstable or not transferrable to infect. So, my question is if the infected blood from her mouth went to the cuts, so it may take maximum 2-3 seconds, so the virus is exposed to air and thus it will be unstable immediately or can live in the air for a while.  I also would like to know the seroconversion duration, whether it is 7-10 days or 7-14 days, upto 4 weeks, upto 6 weeks, or 6 months or forever. I don’t know what’s your research & first peer science reviewed study says. After 27 days of exposure, I am having ongoing symptoms since 3+ months, flu like symptoms, low grade fever every day with chills, white tongue, fatigue, tiredness (NO RASH & SORE THROAT). The most bothering is mild to moderate Myalgia/Arthralgia since 3+ months. Did all the blood test, sputum test, arthritis, TB, thyroid, uric acid, kidney & liver function, xray, ctscan, mri. But the symptoms is still going on. Only High Esr (40) & some inflammation is there in the body. Did thrice antibiotic course of 5 days twice, but no improvement. Cannot sit/work or sleep in AC, feel whole body hot (but not more than 37.5) with mild/moderate body & joint aches/fatigue. My Doctor is clueless about my ongoing symptoms, he cannot diagnose me since 3+ months. Unable to function, sit, walk, sleep, relax or concentrate on anything.  Also, is their Ongoing retroviral syndrome, instead of acute retroviral syndrome where you don’t recover from the sickness {Read Dr Sean from Freedomhealth), It make me to scare till death, as My symptoms is ongoing and I am not recovering. Maybe My immunity CD4 has been very down. Most reputable hiv doctors accepts, there is risk in giving Blowjob, So, I wanted to know, If the giver is blowing with his bleeding gums & the infected body fluid (semen/blood) from the receiver can infect the giver thru his bleeding gums, then why not the blood of giver can infect to the receiver through urethra or cuts. I have been browsing your forum since 1 years for oral sex, before going to Filipina for receiving oral sex and I was confident but, since I got the symptoms, I lost all hope. My case is different as all those who were previously received or gave blowjob they did not have so long ongoing symptoms which is classic ars flu like symptoms.  To be fair, I am very afraid of going for hiv test, due to ongoing flu type typical ars symptoms since 3+ months.

(While drinking I notice slight blood on her teeth & gums & when eating apple, also I notice red/orange color on my groin area while washing at my home) Later, I tried to contact her, but she left to Philippines and I came to know where she was working that, she failed in her medical and was medically terminated as she was hiv positive. So she was untreated and highly infectious. I would like to know  What are my risk of acquiring hiv from Unprotected oral insertive sex with bleeding gums and multiple cuts on the penis/scrotum and groin area bearing the scrotum skin is very thin and sensitive. The hand massage was rough & the lot of force was applied, so, there could be possibility the blood mix with saliva, which was present on the groin area, was rigorously pressed toward the superficial cut, which could have opened and allowed it to enter the blood stream.  Also, she drink the alcohol before the blowjob, so the alcohol can deactivate the protective enzymes and protein of saliva.  I would like to know, what is more risky & dangerous, the multiple cuts or urethra. I have been browsing your forum and this forum has been consistently denying any risk of hiv from oral sex/exposure outside of body, The only risk is from vaginal and anal unprotected sex. Also, it is claimed that, hiv is very fragile virus, once it is exposed to air, it is unstable or not transferrable to infect. So, my question is if the infected blood from her mouth went to the cuts, so it may take maximum 2-3 seconds, so the virus is exposed to air and thus it will be unstable immediately or can live in the air for a while.  I also would like to know the seroconversion duration, whether it is 7-10 days or 7-14 days, upto 4 weeks, upto 6 weeks, or 6 months or forever. I don’t know what’s your research & first peer science reviewed study says. After 27 days of exposure, I am having ongoing symptoms since 3+ months, flu like symptoms, low grade fever every day with chills, white tongue, fatigue, tiredness (NO RASH & SORE THROAT). The most bothering is mild to moderate Myalgia/Arthralgia since 3+ months. Did all the blood test, sputum test, arthritis, TB, thyroid, uric acid, kidney & liver function, xray, ctscan, mri. But the symptoms is still going on. Only High Esr (40) & some inflammation is there in the body. Did thrice antibiotic course of 5 days twice, but no improvement. Cannot sit/work or sleep in AC, feel whole body hot (but not more than 37.5) with mild/moderate body & joint aches/fatigue. My Doctor is clueless about my ongoing symptoms, he cannot diagnose me since 3+ months. Unable to function, sit, walk, sleep, relax or concentrate on anything.  Also, is their Ongoing retroviral syndrome, instead of acute retroviral syndrome where you don’t recover from the sickness {Read Dr Sean from Freedomhealth), It make me to scare till death, as My symptoms is ongoing and I am not recovering. Maybe My immunity CD4 has been very down. Most reputable hiv doctors accepts, there is risk in giving Blowjob, So, I wanted to know, If the giver is blowing with his bleeding gums & the infected body fluid (semen/blood) from the receiver can infect the giver thru his bleeding gums, then why not the blood of giver can infect to the receiver through urethra or cuts. I have been browsing your forum since 1 years for oral sex, before going to Filipina for receiving oral sex and I was confident but, since I got the symptoms, I lost all hope. My case is different as all those who were previously received or gave blowjob they did not have so long ongoing symptoms which is classic ars flu like symptoms.  To be fair, I am very afraid of going for hiv test, due to ongoing flu type typical ars symptoms since 3+ months. Also, their is no anonymous confidential test in dubai, else I have to go india for test.  Thanks & god bless you. Read more:"

Unmedicated for a long time, only medicated for 2.5 years. On gabapentin and amitriptyline. When I miss two or more doses, excruciating pain reminds me why I'm on meds. They had to keep upping my meds until I was at 2400 gabapentin and 50 amitriptyline.  I go through depression fatigue. I don't get sad, I just literally sleep as much as 22 hours a day. This happens 3-5 times a year and lasts a week or two. Then I also get episodes of insomnia at about the same frequency. In normal times have a hard time falling asleep, but also a hard time getting up. For the last like,.. 2 months straight I've been in a fatigue depression. I am literally sleeping my life away. Most days I get up for work. Sometimes I'm just toooo tired, even after 12 hours of sleep. I've also had a slow steady increase in aches and pains. I reached a point I was taking 800mg ibuprofen, and an Aleve several times a day too.  I told my doctor about my tiredness. He told me to quit the amitriptyline and see if that helps. I did. By the third day I was laying in a ball of pain. I started back up. Next visit I told his associate I had noticed how much pain the amitriptyline took away. She just upped it to 75 mg in hopes it would relieve more.  I also take vitamin d and b complex. My main doctor said there's no proof vitamins work, to save my money. But, I seem to think these two give me some energy.  I've also got this horrible sweet tooth and weight gain since I started these meds. I mean, every day on my way into work I have two slices of cheesecake. Because ""OMG I'm gonna die if I don't get them. They will make me feel soo good."" And they do. For a brief moment. Then right back to normal. Come lunch I'm getting cookies or ice cream. The cravings are unbearable, like it's crack.  I'm 5'2"" and weigh 215.  I don't think my doctor deals with fibromyalgia much. I think he's trying, but I'm open to any suggestions. Which I would lay before him, of course. He's told me that medicine changes all the time, and if I read or hear about anything I think might help, to let him know. I greatly appreciate that he isn't letting pride get in the way of my care.

It turned out to be a muscle strain after an MRI and pain pills. However, I finished the medicine. About 7 days into the medicine treatment, I developed a rash on my chest, oral thrush and a rapid heart rate. My doctor said I was allergic to penicillin and gave a steroid which helped for a while. It then came back and I have had severe anxiety about it being HIV. I asked my partner to get tested about 7 weeks later and she did and was negative. She said I have nothing to worry about however my anxiety is killing me. I did an Oraquick test last week and was negative which was about 11 weeks later. I still cannot get it out of my head.

I had unprotected sex for the first time on June 25 with a girl for a few minutes. I started with a condom but could not finish so I took it off for the end. A few days after, I developed a lot of pain in my groin area and legs. I went to my doctor and he said I have an infection and prescribed me penicillin. It turned out to be a muscle strain after an MRI and pain pills. However, I finished the medicine. About 7 days into the medicine treatment, I developed a rash on my chest, oral thrush and a rapid heart rate. My doctor said I was allergic to penicillin and gave a steroid which helped for a while. It then came back and I have had severe anxiety about it being HIV. I asked my partner to get tested about 7 weeks later and she did and was negative. She said I have nothing to worry about however my anxiety is killing me. I did an Oraquick test last week and was negative which was about 11 weeks later. I still cannot get it out of my head. Should I be worried? I have never felt so alone and scared in my life. Thank you."

I had what I like to call the Christmas tree effect going on in my body. Whenever the barometric pressure had a significant change, say a Hurricane was getting ready to form in the Gulf of Mexico. Then crash into another Hurricane brewing in the Atlantic off the Coast of GA. I knew something big was coming before the weather man said a word. My body flipped those rotating Christmas lights on, as if the darn Elf on the shelf had them on turbo. My pain would jump from one spot to the other. Then to kick it up a notch. It would feel like lightening bolts were shooting out of my toes. Initially when this all started, I thought the ground wire for our house had an issue. But that was immediately checked off the list, because I was the only person with the problem. At first I thought it was all in my head, and simply wouldn't acknowledge the pain. I've had one back surgery. I have no hardware as I was very clear with the first surgeon. Get it done on this go around. I'm only doing this one time. I've done PT along with water therapy. For me, my problem is I have a crazy high threshold for pain. With the additional issue that no form of pain medication has been able to ease the pain period. I have pain everyday all day. So, I simply don't take real pain medication. Morphine has zero effect on me. None. The others upset my stomach so bad, I'd rather be in pain. So, what can you do for pain? If you stay in bed all day, that makes your pain go through the roof. If you sit all day, the same problem. Walking and standing in place also cause an issue. So you have to find a balance. When my pain is so bad I don't think I can handle it one more minute. I clean and do laundry. For me, movement helps ease the pain. Keeping blood moving to all the injured parts of the body helps. Along with hot showers or baths. Heating pads. Etc. Mix it up. Going to a Pain Psychologist also helped. I'm able to mind over matter my pain. It takes patience and practice. But it can be done. I've been dealing with my back issue for almost 20 years. I've had my amazing Pain Management Doctor for 13 years. It's hard to give control to your doctor. I was really stubborn at first. Then I began to trust my her. She has helped me so much over these 13 years. You have to be willing to try different forms of treatment. I've been willing to do everything to easy my pain. Except take any medication that has Oxy in it or cotin as the end. I've never had the meds and never will. Some form of movement and a positive mental attitude also helps. Never ever give up. Do not let this disease win. Try and enjoy some of hobbies you enjoyed before you got kicked by this nasty little donkey."

If your answer is yes, then here is some food for your thought. The mind is said to be very powerful, when one focuses and channels one's energy the result is said to be powerful enough to move a mountain. Let's think of something much much smaller. Can we change a cell? Just one cell in our body? What if we gather a group of people diagnosed with HIV from different countries and hypnotize them to think they can bring forth a change in their body which will be able to destroy the virus. So as to give them the idea, that they have a chance to have an alteration in their genetic makeup, (just like what happens naturally). As that thought keeps working in their minds, maybe a change will occur, in 1 million if at least 5 people develop a cure, by studying them, we should be able to make the cure for everyone, suffering. Basically we're letting evolution give the answer and helping it by channeling people's minds. There are many psychiatrists around the world who are capable of hypnotizing patients in need. Hypnotherapy has been used to change behavior and feelings. So one would ask, why HIV? Not only is it due to the fact that the virus's illusive and changing nature has baffled scientists for years but also that it is the perfect disease for this study. It's easy to find at least 1 million people suffering from this illness who would be most willing to try out an approach like hypnotism in the hope that they themselves might be cured. Depending on the availability of hypnotists the patients can be hypnotized in centers around the world 10-20 per week in each center. From the moment of enrolment they should be followed up for at least 5 years.  The survivors will hold the key. A critic would argue saying whether this can be the cure for any disease, any cancer? Unfortunately for most other diseases we cannot find such a vast population of affected individuals. Evolution + hypnotism = a possible cure."

She served me about 1 hour and 20 minutes. 1. She rimmed me about 30 seconds then I told her to stop, I know that oral-anal sex is considered very low risk, but the thing is earlier in the day, I had noticed some specks of blood on the toilet paper I had used after washing my anus after I used the toilet. Does this increase the risk of infection? And because I don't know the oral health status of the woman, if she had bleeding gums, will this increase the chance of infection considering there is at least one cut on my anus according to the specks of blood on the toilet paper? I don't know if she insert her lips or tongue into my anus(I can't remember very clear), will this behavior increase the risk? 2. She gave me a fellatio about 30 seconds then I told her to stop(I didn't ejaculate in her mouth). According to other posts in the forum, it seems that the risk of receiving oral sex is also considered a very low risk behavior, but on the CDC website, it says that bleeding gums or other open cuts and sores in the mouth can increase risk of infection. Is this a risky behavior? 3. We didn't have any vaginal or anal intercourse, she gave me a handjob at last, I was thinking if it is possible to catch HIV virus because there is semen from a previous customer on her hand. 4.

I decided to take a trip to Japan and everything was great sightseeing and eating and eating more. Last night of the trip before flying back home, I ended up going to a love hotel with an escort. It was one of the escorts specializing in anal. I used one of those 0.001mm condoms they sold in Japan but broke during sex. I didn't notice until after I realized I ejaculated in her and pulled out (Probably lasted about 10 min broken). The agency offered bareback anal but I did not select that but the given the fact that the condom was completely broken and I did not notice for 10 minutes (might as well be unprotected sex at that point with most of the penis exposed) and even though Japan has a very low HIV rate, I am still worried I might've been infected. I shaved the morning of that day which also did not help this situation. It's been about 2 weeks since that happened and I am so paranoid about if I am infected with HIV. I read that there is a higher risk of getting infected through anal. I looked up the symptoms and do not have any flu like symptoms, rashes, vomiting, etc. The closest flu-like symptom that occurred was recent when I felt slightly dizzy and a slightly hot head for an hour but went away after. I figured this may have to do with the stress and sleeping 5 hours a day due to the anxiety and working full-time on top of that. The part that scares me is that the joint on my both thumbs started to hurt a little bit when I pressed somewhat on it. I read that joint pain is also one of the earlier symptoms. No neck joint pain or thigh area pain as of now. I did have skin peeling on my arm and face but that was due to getting sunburned and looking like a tomato. I did notice that I have slightly dry and flaky skin near my elbows but I'm not sure if that has to do with the sunburn, diet, stress, or worst case HIV. I have seen a few pinkish dots on my arm and stomach area but I think that's more towards a pimple since I always had skin problems on my chest and back (nowhere near the redness and density of a typical rash).  I am considering testing with the HIV RNA test which I heard searches for the actual virus and not the antibodies and allows the test to be accurate during the window period. Is this the way I should go or should I wait a week and test with the 4th generation test? I'm not sure which one is better. Also, is there a high chance I did get infected or is my paranoia psychologically making it a lot worse than it seems?"

I don't know what to do, I'm only a 19 year old female. Any advice or comments, suggestions, inferences or hypotheses as to what could possibly be going on with me would greatly appreciated. (writing this with shaky hands), here's a little in sight of what's been going on/ when it started and the symptoms i've been experiencing. I've wrote down the dates from day 1 to present (which might be a little off) *Prior to the first date i've listed below, I was experiencing other symptoms over the course of a month but gradually. Fatigue, feeling like I was in a fog most of the time, trouble remembering things, concentrating, just didn't feel all there. I noticed my right eye felt as if it wasn't as strong as my right one (blurriness). My right ear also felt plugged all the time followed by a pain on the right side of my face that was connected from my ear to my jaw that lasted a little more than a month but has now subsided. Things such as clumsiness, tingling in my hands and feet and weakness were also experienced. *May 27th 2017* Was when I first went to the ER for an excruciating headache, I was given an IV + headache medication, I felt this feeling of general discomfort throughout my body as the medication was going through the IV to my arm (have not felt the same since, it was like an irritable feeling that I still sometimes experience.) A few days after that I began to feel very shaky and just not okay. Was still having problems with my right eye, was also continuing to suffer from the intense headache listed above but it was now causing a burning sensation in different areas of my head and the back of my neck. This headache and feeling of pressure/ burning sensations continued on for about a week or so.  *June 3rd* was STILL experiencing this same headache/pressure and burning sensation, so I went back to the ER. After waiting for 4hrs+ at the ER just to see the doctor, he examined me and didn’t think anything too serious of the headache suggesting a possible sinus infection. I told him I didn’t think it was just a sinus infection after mentioning a history of brain tumour in my family, I asked for a CT scan of my head just to make sure. Hesitant to give me the CT scan because of his doubt that there was anything seriously wrong (such as a brain tumor) he prescribed me sinus infection medication and sent me on my way. *June 7th Went back to the ER with the same severe persistent headache and burning sensations throughout my head and neck along with a few new symptoms that presented themselves such as weakness as well as a burning sensation on the top of my legs. I was seen by a different doctor this time, who thought a CT scan was in my best interest. I agreed to the CT scan of the brain which came back as in fact sinus inflammation in the brain. I was given RAN- CLARITHROMYCIN 500MG & PMS-DEXAMETHASONE 4 MG. Although a sinus infection was the only thing to come of the CT scan, the symptoms I had been experiencing and explained to the doctor earlier ex. burning in my neck and head, trouble with my right eye, intense migraines, clumsiness, cognitive issues (poor memory, unable to concentrate) ""brain fog"", muscle weakness, suggested him to believe it could be something more, he mentioned a possibility of MS and told me he was going to order an MRI of my brain to rule it out.  *After taking the medication for the sinus infection the headaches did stop*. From June 7th - 16th awaiting the MRI of my brain the doctor from the ER had ordered I was very stressed and depressed about thinking MS was what was causing all these symptoms. I was under extreme amounts of stress. At this time I started noticing the fatigue becoming worse where I would just have to lay down due to feeling very weak and physically exhausted. Also at this time I noticed I was having sleep troubles. I would have a hard time falling asleep even to just nap even though my body was so tired, my brain would just not allow me to sleep. At night time especially I would also have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep as I would wake up every couple hours. I also noticed I'd developed a slight tremor in my right hand/arm whenever I would lay down. The tremor was not as noticeable to the naked eye as it was within my body, it would keep me awake as well due to just being uncomfortable. Within the next two weeks of experiencing these symptoms I also noticed a decrease in my weight. I lost a total of 14 pounds unintentionally, but possibly due to extreme stress.  *June 17th I had the MRI of my head. The tremor in my hand/arm got slightly worse as you could now see a slight shake with the naked eye, I also noticed my legs would twitch while laying down and feel as if they had a slight vibration to them coming from the inside. *June 19th exhausted from only getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night accompanied by the weakness in my body and tremor, I also noticed an irritable feeling in my upper back from time to time making it very uncomfortable to lay down or to sit for long periods. It felt almost as if I had restless back syndrome that persisted throughout the day and the night. Sometimes this feeling would go into my arms, as well as the burning sensations on the top of my legs continuing to persist. *June 22 Was my appointment with the neurologist to discuss my prior MRI scan of my brain to see if MS was the reason behind these symptoms or not. I and was told by the neurologist my brain scan was clear having no lesions, and that MS was ruled out. After explaining to the neurologist my still existing symptoms they did a physical neurological exam confirming it was still not MS. They then suggested an anti anxiety medication. I had an appointment with my family doctor that following day, and explained the persisting symptoms I was still having. My doctor also related it back to anxiety and prescribed me with an antidepressant/anti anxiety medication which I have not taken because I do not agree that these symptoms are from anxiety. As well as ordering more blood work, checking levels, deficiencies and ruling out any other scary things such as Lymes, Lupus, RA, & crohn's disease. *All blood work has came back normal, and negative for any autoimmune/rheumatic diseases*.  A few weeks later with still no answers and the same persisting symptoms, along with some new ones that are becoming quite concerning. I’m now experiencing widespread pain throughout my body. These pains come and go hitting my body in different areas giving me extreme muscle pain mainly in my back, forearms, shoulders, hips, knees and buttocks. The pain intensifies in different areas, the other day I woke up with my upper back aching for hours and then it would move down to my lower back. Then the next day my back wouldn't hurt any more but my left forearm would be in excruciating muscle pain as if I'd just exercised heavily the day before (which I did not). Other extremities such as my ankles, hands, feet, toes and fingers would just ache,pain and almost feel like little electric shocks(mainly in fingers and toes), throughout the day accompanied by the burning sensation. I am still not able to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night. I’ve woken up overheating and sweating, not being able to swallow. A rash that appeared out of nowhere on my neck (went away after an hour) along with a very flushed face. Restless back and leg pain (in the day and at night). At this point I just don’t know what to do!! I’m out of answers, very frustrated and in pain :( if anyone has anything similar experiences that followed by a diagnoses or any idea of what this may be let me know!!"

From June 7th - 16th awaiting the MRI of my brain the doctor from the ER had ordered I was very stressed and depressed about thinking MS was what was causing all these symptoms. I was under extreme amounts of stress. At this time I started noticing the fatigue becoming worse where I would just have to lay down due to feeling very weak and physically exhausted. Also at this time I noticed I was having sleep troubles. I would have a hard time falling asleep even to just nap even though my body was so tired, my brain would just not allow me to sleep. At night time especially I would also have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep as I would wake up every couple hours. I also noticed I'd developed a slight tremor in my right hand/arm whenever I would lay down. The tremor was not as noticeable to the naked eye as it was within my body, it would keep me awake as well due to just being uncomfortable. Within the next two weeks of experiencing these symptoms I also noticed a decrease in my weight. I lost a total of 14 pounds unintentionally, but possibly due to extreme stress.  *June 17th I had the MRI of my head. The tremor in my hand/arm got slightly worse as you could now see a slight shake with the naked eye, I also noticed my legs would twitch while laying down and feel as if they had a slight vibration to them coming from the inside. *June 19th exhausted from only getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night accompanied by the weakness in my body and tremor, I also noticed an irritable feeling in my upper back from time to time making it very uncomfortable to lay down or to sit for long periods. It felt almost as if I had restless back syndrome that persisted throughout the day and the night. Sometimes this feeling would go into my arms, as well as the burning sensations on the top of my legs continuing to persist. *June 22 Was my appointment with the neurologist to discuss my prior MRI scan of my brain to see if MS was the reason behind these symptoms or not. I and was told by the neurologist my brain scan was clear having no lesions, and that MS was ruled out. After explaining to the neurologist my still existing symptoms they did a physical neurological exam confirming it was still not MS. They then suggested an anti anxiety medication. I had an appointment with my family doctor that following day, and explained the persisting symptoms I was still having. My doctor also related it back to anxiety and prescribed me with an antidepressant/anti anxiety medication which I have not taken because I do not agree that these symptoms are from anxiety. As well as ordering more blood work, checking levels, deficiencies and ruling out any other scary things such as Lymes, Lupus, RA, & crohn's disease. *All blood work has came back normal, and negative for any autoimmune/rheumatic diseases*.  A few weeks later with still no answers and the same persisting symptoms, along with some new ones that are becoming quite concerning. I’m now experiencing widespread pain throughout my body. These pains come and go hitting my body in different areas giving me extreme muscle pain mainly in my back, forearms, shoulders, hips, knees and buttocks. The pain intensifies in different areas, the other day I woke up with my upper back aching for hours and then it would move down to my lower back. Then the next day my back wouldn't hurt any more but my left forearm would be in excruciating muscle pain as if I'd just exercised heavily the day before (which I did not). Other extremities such as my ankles, hands, feet, toes and fingers would just ache,pain and almost feel like little electric shocks(mainly in fingers and toes), throughout the day accompanied by the burning sensation. I am still not able to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night. I’ve woken up overheating and sweating, not being able to swallow. A rash that appeared out of nowhere on my neck (went away after an hour) along with a very flushed face. Restless back and leg pain (in the day and at night). At this point I just don’t know what to do!! I’m out of answers, very frustrated and in pain :( if anyone has anything similar experiences that followed by a diagnoses or any idea of what this may be let me know!!"

I don't know what to do, I'm only a 19 year old female. Any advice or comments, suggestions, inferences or hypotheses as to what could possibly be going on with me would greatly appreciated. (writing this with shaky hands), here's a little in sight of what's been going on/ when it started and the symptoms i've been experiencing. I've wrote down the dates from day 1 to present (which might be a little off) *Prior to the first date i've listed below, I was experiencing other symptoms over the course of a month but gradually. Fatigue, feeling like I was in a fog most of the time, trouble remembering things, concentrating, just didn't feel all there. I noticed my right eye felt as if it wasn't as strong as my right one (blurriness). My right ear also felt plugged all the time followed by a pain on the right side of my face that was connected from my ear to my jaw that lasted a little more than a month but has now subsided. Things such as clumsiness, tingling in my hands and feet and weakness were also experienced. *May 27th 2017* Was when I first went to the ER for an excruciating headache, I was given an IV + headache medication, I felt this feeling of general discomfort throughout my body as the medication was going through the IV to my arm (have not felt the same since, it was like an irritable feeling that I still sometimes experience.) A few days after that I began to feel very shaky and just not okay. Was still having problems with my right eye, was also continuing to suffer from the intense headache listed above but it was now causing a burning sensation in different areas of my head and the back of my neck. This headache and feeling of pressure/ burning sensations continued on for about a week or so.  *June 3rd* was STILL experiencing this same headache/pressure and burning sensation, so I went back to the ER. After waiting for 4hrs+ at the ER just to see the doctor, he examined me and didn’t think anything too serious of the headache suggesting a possible sinus infection. I told him I didn’t think it was just a sinus infection after mentioning a history of brain tumour in my family, I asked for a CT scan of my head just to make sure. Hesitant to give me the CT scan because of his doubt that there was anything seriously wrong (such as a brain tumor) he prescribed me sinus infection medication and sent me on my way. *June 7th Went back to the ER with the same severe persistent headache and burning sensations throughout my head and neck along with a few new symptoms that presented themselves such as weakness as well as a burning sensation on the top of my legs. I was seen by a different doctor this time, who thought a CT scan was in my best interest. I agreed to the CT scan of the brain which came back as in fact sinus inflammation in the brain. I was given RAN- CLARITHROMYCIN 500MG & PMS-DEXAMETHASONE 4 MG.

(writing this with shaky hands), here's a little in sight of what's been going on/ when it started and the symptoms i've been experiencing. I've wrote down the dates from day 1 to present (which might be a little off) *Prior to the first date i've listed below, I was experiencing other symptoms over the course of a month but gradually. Fatigue, feeling like I was in a fog most of the time, trouble remembering things, concentrating, just didn't feel all there. I noticed my right eye felt as if it wasn't as strong as my right one (blurriness). My right ear also felt plugged all the time followed by a pain on the right side of my face that was connected from my ear to my jaw that lasted a little more than a month but has now subsided. Things such as clumsiness, tingling in my hands and feet and weakness were also experienced. *May 27th 2017* Was when I first went to the ER for an excruciating headache, I was given an IV + headache medication, I felt this feeling of general discomfort throughout my body as the medication was going through the IV to my arm (have not felt the same since, it was like an irritable feeling that I still sometimes experience.) A few days after that I began to feel very shaky and just not okay. Was still having problems with my right eye, was also continuing to suffer from the intense headache listed above but it was now causing a burning sensation in different areas of my head and the back of my neck. This headache and feeling of pressure/ burning sensations continued on for about a week or so.  *June 3rd* was STILL experiencing this same headache/pressure and burning sensation, so I went back to the ER. After waiting for 4hrs+ at the ER just to see the doctor, he examined me and didn’t think anything too serious of the headache suggesting a possible sinus infection. I told him I didn’t think it was just a sinus infection after mentioning a history of brain tumour in my family, I asked for a CT scan of my head just to make sure. Hesitant to give me the CT scan because of his doubt that there was anything seriously wrong (such as a brain tumor) he prescribed me sinus infection medication and sent me on my way. *June 7th Went back to the ER with the same severe persistent headache and burning sensations throughout my head and neck along with a few new symptoms that presented themselves such as weakness as well as a burning sensation on the top of my legs. I was seen by a different doctor this time, who thought a CT scan was in my best interest. I agreed to the CT scan of the brain which came back as in fact sinus inflammation in the brain. I was given RAN- CLARITHROMYCIN 500MG & PMS-DEXAMETHASONE 4 MG. Although a sinus infection was the only thing to come of the CT scan, the symptoms I had been experiencing and explained to the doctor earlier ex. burning in my neck and head, trouble with my right eye, intense migraines, clumsiness, cognitive issues (poor memory, unable to concentrate) ""brain fog"", muscle weakness, suggested him to believe it could be something more, he mentioned a possibility of MS and told me he was going to order an MRI of my brain to rule it out.  *After taking the medication for the sinus infection the headaches did stop*. From June 7th - 16th awaiting the MRI of my brain the doctor from the ER had ordered I was very stressed and depressed about thinking MS was what was causing all these symptoms. I was under extreme amounts of stress. At this time I started noticing the fatigue becoming worse where I would just have to lay down due to feeling very weak and physically exhausted. Also at this time I noticed I was having sleep troubles. I would have a hard time falling asleep even to just nap even though my body was so tired, my brain would just not allow me to sleep. At night time especially I would also have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep as I would wake up every couple hours. I also noticed I'd developed a slight tremor in my right hand/arm whenever I would lay down. The tremor was not as noticeable to the naked eye as it was within my body, it would keep me awake as well due to just being uncomfortable. Within the next two weeks of experiencing these symptoms I also noticed a decrease in my weight. I lost a total of 14 pounds unintentionally, but possibly due to extreme stress.  *June 17th I had the MRI of my head. The tremor in my hand/arm got slightly worse as you could now see a slight shake with the naked eye, I also noticed my legs would twitch while laying down and feel as if they had a slight vibration to them coming from the inside. *June 19th exhausted from only getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night accompanied by the weakness in my body and tremor, I also noticed an irritable feeling in my upper back from time to time making it very uncomfortable to lay down or to sit for long periods. It felt almost as if I had restless back syndrome that persisted throughout the day and the night. Sometimes this feeling would go into my arms, as well as the burning sensations on the top of my legs continuing to persist. *June 22 Was my appointment with the neurologist to discuss my prior MRI scan of my brain to see if MS was the reason behind these symptoms or not. I and was told by the neurologist my brain scan was clear having no lesions, and that MS was ruled out. After explaining to the neurologist my still existing symptoms they did a physical neurological exam confirming it was still not MS. They then suggested an anti anxiety medication. I had an appointment with my family doctor that following day, and explained the persisting symptoms I was still having. My doctor also related it back to anxiety and prescribed me with an antidepressant/anti anxiety medication which I have not taken because I do not agree that these symptoms are from anxiety. As well as ordering more blood work, checking levels, deficiencies and ruling out any other scary things such as Lymes, Lupus, RA, & crohn's disease. *All blood work has came back normal, and negative for any autoimmune/rheumatic diseases*.  A few weeks later with still no answers and the same persisting symptoms, along with some new ones that are becoming quite concerning. I’m now experiencing widespread pain throughout my body. These pains come and go hitting my body in different areas giving me extreme muscle pain mainly in my back, forearms, shoulders, hips, knees and buttocks. The pain intensifies in different areas, the other day I woke up with my upper back aching for hours and then it would move down to my lower back. Then the next day my back wouldn't hurt any more but my left forearm would be in excruciating muscle pain as if I'd just exercised heavily the day before (which I did not). Other extremities such as my ankles, hands, feet, toes and fingers would just ache,pain and almost feel like little electric shocks(mainly in fingers and toes), throughout the day accompanied by the burning sensation. I am still not able to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night. I’ve woken up overheating and sweating, not being able to swallow. A rash that appeared out of nowhere on my neck (went away after an hour) along with a very flushed face. Restless back and leg pain (in the day and at night). At this point I just don’t know what to do!! I’m out of answers, very frustrated and in pain :( if anyone has anything similar experiences that followed by a diagnoses or any idea of what this may be let me know!!"

Then the next day my back wouldn't hurt any more but my left forearm would be in excruciating muscle pain as if I'd just exercised heavily the day before (which I did not). Other extremities such as my ankles, hands, feet, toes and fingers would just ache,pain and almost feel like little electric shocks(mainly in fingers and toes), throughout the day accompanied by the burning sensation. I am still not able to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night. I’ve woken up overheating and sweating, not being able to swallow. A rash that appeared out of nowhere on my neck (went away after an hour) along with a very flushed face. Restless back and leg pain (in the day and at night). At this point I just don’t know what to do!! I’m out of answers, very frustrated and in pain :( if anyone has anything similar experiences that followed by a diagnoses or any idea of what this may be let me know!!"

Changed condoms twice.,"About 4 months ago, I had sex with a commercial escort. Based on her face and appearance, it looked like she could be a drug user, not sure whether its intravenous or not though. She was a Caucasian female. Out of curiosity, I asked if she allowed unprotected sex, and she said no. Then later she said, “I mean, I’m ok with no condom as long as you don’t cum inside me.” That raised some red flags. Then she said, “But I’m clean.” Then I asked when she was last tested. She replied, “I get tested every 3 months. That’s my life!” Naturally, I know better than to trust some stranger so I didn’t believe her. We started off by doing some deep french kissing, lots of tongue too for about a few minutes. I also licked her nipples with my tongue. Then we moved on to her giving me unprotected oral sex. Before she started, she asked me if I was clean. I said yes. Then she started giving me a blowjob (fellatio). Her tongue swirled around my penis head. The we moved on to protected vaginal sex. First position was cowgirl and the motion got progressively vigorous. Then we changed position to doggystyle. After a while, suddenly the condom nearly slipped out as I thrust inward, covering only a little more below my penis head, but exposing more than half of my penis shaft. My tip was slightly inside her vagina when I immediately froze once I saw it slip. I then used my hand to pull off the condom, grabbing the furthest end that was near the penis head. Then I went to go grab another condom. I then handed it to her and she tore open the wrapper and put in on my penis. But my penis was moderately flaccid at that point when she put it on and it was loose. The size of this condom might have also been too large for me. So I told her to suck on it with the condom on to get it hard again. After sucking it, it got hard again. Then we continue on to missionary position. During the intercourse she rubbed a little area above her vagina with her two fingers during the intercourse. After a few minutes my penis went flaccid or soft again, so I pulled it out with the condom fully intact but loose. I pulled it out with my hand grabbing the base. And went to grab a third condom, gave it to her and she put it on and sucked on it again to get it hard. Then i went back to missionary. It was getting soft again so I used two fingers and pinch both sides of my penis at the base of the shaft to guide it in straight to her vagina as I thrust inward. I was trying to finish with an ejaculation but I couldn’t. As I was pulling out my flaccid penis, the loose condom slipped out and stayed stuck in her vagina. I couldn’t remember if it was me or her that took out the condom though. Then we were done. The day after, I was pondering whether I was at risk of exposure. 3 days later, I started having muscle twitches in various parts of my body such as thighs, legs, and arms. I also started to have sharp stabbing pains coming and going all over different parts of my body. My inner ear lobes were itching. I also had a few joint pain instances particularly on my fingers. I also had some muscle aches and tension, mostly on my right forearm. Roughly around 3 weeks after that suspected exposure an itchy mosquito bite-like bump appeared on my left forearm, but went away after a few hours. Could possibly be hives. A few weeks later another one appeared on my left calf. Then again on my left forearm in the same exact spot a week or so later. At around 3 weeks a little pink blotch appeared on one of my right knuckles and another one on my face to the right of my nose at over 3 months post incident. I also had a sharp pain on the left side of my head that lasted for 30 minutes at over 3 months post incident. Also at that time I woke up from bed one night with a little sweat around my neck and collar. Maybe it was a hot flash and not an actual night sweat otherwise my whole pillow would’ve been drenched. This happened at over 3 months post incident. Hypothetically, if the woman was HIV positive, was there a possible risk of exposure based on any of the actions discussed above? Is it somewhat possible that I may have mishandled the switching of new condoms and her vaginal fluid might have crept inward towards my urethra underneath the condom? Maybe when condom was loose? When she did fellatio on the condom trying to harden me? Or maybe during the intercourse motion? Maybe her saliva on my penis from the blowjob caused the condom to slip out. I know that kissing an oral sex had negligible risk. I wasn’t sure if she had any sores, cuts, or bleeding gums in her mouth. Now I regret for not checking beforehand. I am absolutely terrified. I can’t sleep well. I can’t focus on my everyday tasks. My anxiety is off the charts. My twitching, stabbing pains, and muscle aches hasn’t went away. I’m not exactly sure what’s causing these symptoms. Could it be a possible infection, other STDs/STIs, my anxiety, or something else? It’s been over 4 months and I know I could’ve tested at 3 months but I held it off because I wasn’t psychologically ready to take it. I’m so afraid. Sorry for the lengthy question, but I thought it was necessary to be specific. I need some clarity, and hopefully a peace of mind when I go get tested. Thank you."

Ty for what you do and spending time to answer questions. My experience is unprotected sex a ex girlfriend back in 2009. I didn’t really pay much attention to it until I decided to test in 2013. The Dr gave me a blood test antibodies 1/2 and it came out non reactive. Was I suppose to take this test sooner? Also is this good after years later? (This happens to me my only sex since then, none) I’ve have had rashes/white thing on my tongue today that’s hard to scrub away and still white. Of course I look this up and I’m scared about it. Not sure if I got it from bad oral hygienes and heavy beer drinking with out brushing going to bed. Is my antibody blood test good enough? Or I need more testing done?"

Over the last year I have had chronic pain from the shoulders down to my toes. In the beginning I didn't worry too much about it as I had started a new job and thought my body just needed time to adjust.  A little about me first I guess. I am a 53 year old female, a little on the heavy side but have been losing weight on my own, but could stand a little more. I have always worked a physical job, for over 20 years I worked as a CNA in the hospital, so that involves a lot of lifting, etc. I have also worked retail over the years and for the last year and a half that is my current job. When the pain began early last year, I just assumed it was getting use to standing/walking on concrete floors all day and lifting a lot of heavy boxes though out my shift. Well over time the pain has only gotten worse and after talking to my NP about it over many months, she did the tender point test on a very bad day, to the point I told her to quit touching me because I was hurting so bad. So, I was diagnosed with Fibro a few months ago.  Due to my health seeming to get worse from the pain and not getting any sleep because of it, my NP put me on Elavil starting me at a low dose and I am now built up from 10mg to 30mg at bedtime. I also take Alka Seltzer for pain and at one point was taking so much, my body was full of bruises from so much aspirin. I was told to cut it back to no more than 2 times a day as I had been taking it 4 to 5 times a day. She had put me on Gabapentin to help with the pain and after 2 months I quit taking them because they did not help at all. So, I am just taking the Elavil and Alka Seltzer for pain. The aspirin seems to take the edge of the pain off but not take the pain all away.  I also have arthritis in my knee joints and I know that isn't helping. I have also noticed over the last 5-6 months that if I sit in one spot too long and get up that my left leg does not want to go. My mind is telling it what to do, but being able to put pressure on it because of the pain and lack of strength in it, it takes me a few minutes sometimes to get it going.  One of my concerns is, is this really Fibro? It seems that the pain is never completely gone, my level at its best is usually a 2 and at its worst a 10+. Over the last 2 weeks with today being one of those days, I was actually feeling good or so I thought and my pain suddenly jumped from about a 2 to a 10+, no warning, just boom!!! I was all but in tears but was at work working the register and had to continue to manage a smile and be pleasant as the Assist Manager was on break. As soon as she came back she noticed a change in my behavior and asked what was wrong and I told her that suddenly the pain became almost unbearable. I went and sat in the office and cried for 5 minutes because of the pain. One night last week when I got home from work the pain was just as bad and I almost drove myself to the ER to see if they had any better answers than Fibro being the issue. But it was the fear of maybe being kept there that kept me from going. I was eventually able to sleep and woke the next morning with my pain being about a 5-6.  My NP says with taking the Elavil, I should not be having this much pain. So I was wondering if others may have experienced the same things as I have shared here? Thoughts appreciated."

Over the last year I have had chronic pain from the shoulders down to my toes. In the beginning I didn't worry too much about it as I had started a new job and thought my body just needed time to adjust.  A little about me first I guess. I am a 53 year old female, a little on the heavy side but have been losing weight on my own, but could stand a little more. I have always worked a physical job, for over 20 years I worked as a CNA in the hospital, so that involves a lot of lifting, etc. I have also worked retail over the years and for the last year and a half that is my current job. When the pain began early last year, I just assumed it was getting use to standing/walking on concrete floors all day and lifting a lot of heavy boxes though out my shift. Well over time the pain has only gotten worse and after talking to my NP about it over many months, she did the tender point test on a very bad day, to the point I told her to quit touching me because I was hurting so bad. So, I was diagnosed with Fibro a few months ago.  Due to my health seeming to get worse from the pain and not getting any sleep because of it, my NP put me on Elavil starting me at a low dose and I am now built up from 10mg to 30mg at bedtime. I also take Alka Seltzer for pain and at one point was taking so much, my body was full of bruises from so much aspirin. I was told to cut it back to no more than 2 times a day as I had been taking it 4 to 5 times a day. She had put me on Gabapentin to help with the pain and after 2 months I quit taking them because they did not help at all. So, I am just taking the Elavil and Alka Seltzer for pain. The aspirin seems to take the edge of the pain off but not take the pain all away.  I also have arthritis in my knee joints and I know that isn't helping.

When I was 16 I fingered a girl and got a thought that led me to think I had hiv. I had got a tat done in a house and person changed the needle but maybe not the ink so I was a bit worried hiv could of been in that ink since now I am older and read about it. I waited 3 years feeling sick or making myself feel sick. I told someone and they got me to go to doctors and I got a hiv swab test at 19. 3 years later after that stuff. I think it didn't register now because the doctor only put the swab on my upper gums in a quick motion that lasted 2-3 seconds and I hear people say their doctor put it in their mouth for 1-2 mins. Plus my mouth was dry and I even believe I had a couple sips of soda before she did it and I hear you should not drink anything before it is done. She came back with a negative test result but now I am 20 still worried even though I never had rapid cough, 3 week flus, rash breakouts over the body or swollen lympnodes because I read people with a good immune system can fight off all of it for years. Going on 21 now and never had sex or nothing but even recently believe a male masturbator toy or lube somehow gave me hiv. I know it is crazy but I can't shake the feeling I got it. So should I do a rapid blood test to know for sure? 2 days ago I had a fever, runny nose, headache and moderate cough that lasted 2 days then went away. A small shiny red painless red patch on penis and another symptom called sciatica I hear is common in hiv patients and I developed that also. Any replies will be appreciated..."

I went through all the different doctors, and frustrations.  Long story short, after many years, I was finally diagnosed with FM by a Rheumatologist. There was nothing she could do about my bouts of deep fatigue. The meds were helping, but, I was still in pain. The doctor couldn't do anything more. And, through someone I met at the time I was introduced to specialist doctors called Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. The doctor there prescribed me opioids. I finally felt like my pain was under control. I still have some pain, and still get fatigue, and brain fog, and I take antidepressant. I can sleep without waking up in pain, and, I no longer suffer from so much pain that keeps me from getting sleep. Good luck, everyone! Be well!"

After having a serious talk about STDs we decided to have sex without them.

I asked him and he told me that he is fine. We recently broken up because of my anxiety. The last time that we had sex his sperm was clear and I thought maybe it was an STD he told me no and that he masturbated earlier before seeing me. I will go for a full check up in a few weeks.

I was recently on short vacation in Thailand and I am worried about this situation. We'll I have several paper money on my wallet the night before and the following day, I took a taxi and sort out my money to pay the driver. I noticed that one of the bills has small dark red spots on it. I was not sure if those spots were blood. I assume that those spots are dried since the money was already on my wallet the night before. When I reached my destination, I washed my hands with water but did it hurriedly since there are quite a few people on the bathroom and no soaps around. After few minutes, I happened to pick the inside of my nose with same finger that could have touched the spots. Now I am worried if those spots eventhough dry could contain HIV and got transferred in the surface of my fingernails which in turn could have been transferred in the mucosa in my nose. Is this possible? I am worried. Do I need testing for this? I am not even sexually active. Thank you again."

But easily dismissed it that the pain was from gardening, the fog was ADD, the fatigue was well I am getting *older* (43). Gave in finally and went to doctor who ran some tests and xrays. Then saw the rhuemetory (sp?) doctor who said it's fibro. Spoke with doctor and for obvious reasons I told her I do not want opiates. I also did not want a bunch of meds all at once either. She put me on flexerill. I already take trazadone (no longer seems to work for sleep) and effexor xr. After some online research I started taking vit d, magnesium, melatonin, tumeric, and just recently valarian. I know I'll need to be on some actual meds cuz this old lady already feels like she's 90! Just wondering/curious what others have found helpful both rx and holistic."

Little reddish things on my back (it doesn't itchy or pain). I also still feel chills frequently. I get tired easily and short of breath. I sweat just when I'm exposed to sun for a few minutes. I know ""this is it"". I know that there couldn't be anything else but HIV ENTERING MY BODY. I have tried home-kit HIV test, It shows NEGATIVE but i know that , it's the period when home-kit HIV test cannot detect HIV in my blood because it is tested based on my immune system to HIV.  I've read online articles about HIV (first stage entering my body) and it all just matches with what I'm experiencing now. all the symptoms in me are HIV. I've been crying a lot , I have a wife whom I dearly love to death. I have been actively having sex with her (unprotected). I'm sure I could have had infected her as well.  I keep blaming GOD for what has happened to me. there are so many stuff going on my mind. I just feel extremely sad, knowing that I have infected innocent wife or worse, could be my family.  I'm the only son in my family and my family is dependent on me. Only I alone work for my family. For my lil sister, brother , mom and my dad.  I'm the only hope they have, but now i've gone and throw their hope away. I don't want them to know. I just want a peace and quite life till death comes to me. I have been preparing everything.  I'm sure there are so many people out there who are HIV Positive just like me. I know I'm being selfish to share my story here, I just don't know who to share this with.

My anxiety has been uncontrollable. I'm afraid of social situations. I'm afraid of talking to people. I'm afraid of letting people down. I've lost a lot of friends. I feel like my pain has gotten worse since I started my job. I stopped going on my morning walks and yoga classes because I feel tired and sore all the time. I called in sick today, because I could not sleep last night from my anxiety and pain. I'm afraid to ask for time off from work to see a doctor, since I'm still new at my job. I'm also a smoker, which probably isn't helping the anxiety or pain but I don't know what else to do when I feel anxious. Can anyone suggest any home remedies for me?"

The rheumatologist spent less than ten minutes with me and never asked about pain. He pinched my joints and said I had it and gave me a pamphlet which explained pain as the main symptom, just as everything I've read before and since says. I never followed through on it because my primary complaint is chronic intermittent fatigue... meaning I go through l long periods where I am always overtired, tired to the bone, is my usual description. And there were other reasons I didn't feel the doctor was a good match for me.  There are also times when I wake up not tired. Those times used to last longer than they do now. I'm not without pain, but 99% of the time it is logical. With the fatigue it seems that the closest I usually have of pain is a tired achyness like you might get doing some heavy labor, except I often wake up feeling it. Other times it unexpectedly wallops me. Other times I am just extremely fatigued with no pain or ache.  More recently I was diagnosed with sleep apnea. I'm very good about keeping my mask on all night and at first it seemed to help, but the fatigue didn't go away, just the tiredness -- ie. I'm not always sleepy, but just worn out tired for no reason So what I'm asking is does this actually seem like fibromyagia or it it ""just"" some form of cfs that my doctors can't or won't label as such. I don't care about labels, but maybe if this seems more like fm than cfs or ""unknown"", there may be different things to do to cope with it.

I believe I have had symptoms for 20 years. I got to be in so much pain after the last 10 or so. I was diagnosed quickly by a very good and intuitive doctor. I was given Vicodin in addition to meds I was already on. Right now I'm on flexeril, Prozac, Clonazapin and other unrelated medications. I was sent to a Rheumatologist he also diagnosed fibromyalgia. I was give up to 4 Vicodin a day. I moved twice since diagnosis and 4 additional doctors agreed.  I am now experiencing the worse flare I could imagine. I the mean time I have had injections in my lower back and shoulder. And they do work temporarily just like they do in any person with any ailment. So do not believe anyone who says otherwise. I had them but have not really needed them until now. I had injections in to my spinal cord guided by ultrasound I think.  I am a licensed funeral director and embalmer. I was the first woman funeral director in my county to become licensed. I had to do everything the men did and I knew I would have to prove myself. And I did lifted, embalmed, made removals etc. I was on call all the time. We used pagers then. I have been licensed 25 years. I am 55 years old. I know I may have damaged my back because of my job , but I have pain everywhere.  I went to mortuary science as though it was a calling. Not just a job. I did everything and more because I loved it. Truly loved every part of it. In my state you must mold a Bachelors Degree in order to be licensed. You must take a national testing exam and 2 other state exam and do a one year apprenticeship before getta license. I weighed about 100 lbs at the time but I did everything the guys did. It was funny to me that people would ask if I liked being a mortician. Who would go through all that and not love it?  I worked a long time with fibro until I just couldn't do it anymore. Even learning the new computer systems confused me. I was the one in the funeral home to go to out of state training for computer training and train the funeral directors at our funeral home and others. Now. I can do none of it. Can't stay on feet too long. Hands hurt and cramp. I drop things. I am clumsy. Extra sensitive to cold so taking out a winter funeral was actually painful. I could not do all the things I used to... And in funeral service if you can not do everything you don't keep your job if you can only accomplish 1 or 2 tasks. Well 2 years ago I quit working. Not by choice... The pain was getting so bad. Even with injections and all they can not nor will they give you injections all over you body. My hands, feet, back, hips,neck hurt everyday in some way. Do not even ask about sexual problems but my husband is not one that deserves this missing part of our lives. Some days worse than others just like you describe in your posts. But I will not give up.  I can not work and they do not think I need disability. So the profession I so loved is gone to me.  Do not let any doctors, nurses, rheumatologist or neurologist tell it doesn't get worse. My symptoms were progressing while I was still working. And I do believe they may get worse or out or control after a tragedy.  My oldest son was suffering from a disease that required a kidney transplant. At first he was not diagnosed and he was seeing a doctor who gave him OxyContin for years. After a couple suicide attempts I took him to the clinic. Needless to say the doctor fled the country and my son was hopelessly addicted to opiates.  We tried to tell everyone before surgery and after that he was narcotic intolerant. After surgery he was in so much pain I had to cry, Yell and to them over and over. Drew's surgery was a partial success but he still had a lot of pain and because I could not be sure the pain was real and and he was in detox several times I did not take him back to Cleveland Clinic. I am guilty of that. Meanwhile Drew fathered a beautiful little girl. They never married but she became a huge part of his life and ours.  Drew was a father to this beautiful girl. Unfortunately she lost her daddy to suicide when she was five.  I know all about grief. The normal and not normal and I thought I was doing ok. It took a time to even be ok I cry for him every night.  I now know that my symptoms of fibromyalgia were getting worse after his death. A bit at a time and just 2 years after his death am in more pain than ever. Am I having a flare or will I be like this the rest of my life? I can not work, I can't do housework, I can't do much of anything. I still do housework and indoor and outdoor gardening. Well I can't do it really without severe pain. But I will not have everything taken from me  Will I have to live my life like this. When I'll be able to do anything?? That is what concerns me most. I have a wonderful husband...but who would want to retire in 10 years to this? I have another son. He was born 16 months from Drew and is coping as well as he can. He was doing drugs and is in recovery. But went through so much to get him where he is no.  I want to be with with Drew and my mom and my sisters who are with him now... But I can not and will not. I have to many people to take care of. My dad lives with us. It's been 2 years he's been here and he has severe back pain and is being treated by the clinic. I take him where he needs to go as well. My mom died one year ago September. So of course I grieve her as well. She was my go to. Because those of us who have lost children have no names to describe us.  I was doing a funeral with a clergy member wo had lost one of his twin sons in a house fire. We were discussing that there is no name because it would be a very ugly name. Then he said to me "" yo know what we are ? We are screwed. With each new trial with my loved ones will I continue to get worse? Or more cramps and more pain and fatigue and scrambled egg brain going to get worse ? Or is this just a flare up ? My symptoms have got nothing but worse. I can't even blow dry my hair it hurts so much.  So until I talk to a doctor who has fibromyalgia all I know is it gets worse."

A bit at a time and just 2 years after his death am in more pain than ever. Am I having a flare or will I be like this the rest of my life? I can not work, I can't do housework, I can't do much of anything. I still do housework and indoor and outdoor gardening. Well I can't do it really without severe pain. But I will not have everything taken from me  Will I have to live my life like this. When I'll be able to do anything?? That is what concerns me most. I have a wonderful husband...but who would want to retire in 10 years to this? I have another son. He was born 16 months from Drew and is coping as well as he can. He was doing drugs and is in recovery. But went through so much to get him where he is no.  I want to be with with Drew and my mom and my sisters who are with him now... But I can not and will not. I have to many people to take care of. My dad lives with us. It's been 2 years he's been here and he has severe back pain and is being treated by the clinic. I take him where he needs to go as well. My mom died one year ago September. So of course I grieve her as well. She was my go to. Because those of us who have lost children have no names to describe us.  I was doing a funeral with a clergy member wo had lost one of his twin sons in a house fire. We were discussing that there is no name because it would be a very ugly name. Then he said to me "" yo know what we are ? We are screwed. With each new trial with my loved ones will I continue to get worse? Or more cramps and more pain and fatigue and scrambled egg brain going to get worse ? Or is this just a flare up ? My symptoms have got nothing but worse. I can't even blow dry my hair it hurts so much.  So until I talk to a doctor who has fibromyalgia all I know is it gets worse."

I was give up to 4 Vicodin a day. I moved twice since diagnosis and 4 additional doctors agreed.  I am now experiencing the worse flare I could imagine. I the mean time I have had injections in my lower back and shoulder. And they do work temporarily just like they do in any person with any ailment. So do not believe anyone who says otherwise. I had them but have not really needed them until now. I had injections in to my spinal cord guided by ultrasound I think.  I am a licensed funeral director and embalmer. I was the first woman funeral director in my county to become licensed. I had to do everything the men did and I knew I would have to prove myself. And I did lifted, embalmed, made removals etc. I was on call all the time. We used pagers then. I have been licensed 25 years. I am 55 years old. I know I may have damaged my back because of my job , but I have pain everywhere.  I went to mortuary science as though it was a calling. Not just a job. I did everything and more because I loved it. Truly loved every part of it. In my state you must mold a Bachelors Degree in order to be licensed. You must take a national testing exam and 2 other state exam and do a one year apprenticeship before getta license. I weighed about 100 lbs at the time but I did everything the guys did. It was funny to me that people would ask if I liked being a mortician. Who would go through all that and not love it?  I worked a long time with fibro until I just couldn't do it anymore. Even learning the new computer systems confused me. I was the one in the funeral home to go to out of state training for computer training and train the funeral directors at our funeral home and others. Now. I can do none of it. Can't stay on feet too long. Hands hurt and cramp. I drop things. I am clumsy. Extra sensitive to cold so taking out a winter funeral was actually painful. I could not do all the things I used to... And in funeral service if you can not do everything you don't keep your job if you can only accomplish 1 or 2 tasks. Well 2 years ago I quit working. Not by choice... The pain was getting so bad. Even with injections and all they can not nor will they give you injections all over you body. My hands, feet, back, hips,neck hurt everyday in some way. Do not even ask about sexual problems but my husband is not one that deserves this missing part of our lives. Some days worse than others just like you describe in your posts. But I will not give up.  I can not work and they do not think I need disability. So the profession I so loved is gone to me.  Do not let any doctors, nurses, rheumatologist or neurologist tell it doesn't get worse. My symptoms were progressing while I was still working. And I do believe they may get worse or out or control after a tragedy.  My oldest son was suffering from a disease that required a kidney transplant. At first he was not diagnosed and he was seeing a doctor who gave him OxyContin for years. After a couple suicide attempts I took him to the clinic. Needless to say the doctor fled the country and my son was hopelessly addicted to opiates.  We tried to tell everyone before surgery and after that he was narcotic intolerant. After surgery he was in so much pain I had to cry, Yell and to them over and over. Drew's surgery was a partial success but he still had a lot of pain and because I could not be sure the pain was real and and he was in detox several times I did not take him back to Cleveland Clinic. I am guilty of that. Meanwhile Drew fathered a beautiful little girl. They never married but she became a huge part of his life and ours.  Drew was a father to this beautiful girl.

He told me he is ok and recently got tested. I accused him in the past for what I thought was throat gono but it turned out to be strep. He told he doesn't have anything and if he did he wouldn't even have sex with me. I got in contact with him 2 nights ago and he told he ejacualted in me because I am on BC and he was tired of condoms. We aren't exclusive and he could be sexually active with other people. I don't know his condom habits. He told me that I am the only person he feels safe with going unprotected.  Is it possible I contracted every STD including HIV?????

A few days ago, I was essentially forced into giving this older man (40s) a blow job - It was no longer than 30 seconds max and his dick was circumcised & felt dry, so I assume there was no pre-cum. That night, I checked for any cuts/mouth in my mouth but there was the nothing - though the next day, there was a tiny circular cut on the side of my cheek so my anxiety started rising lol. I have impacted wisdom teeth coming in too, could that make it even more riskier? My main concern is that people where I live don’t get tested for stuff like HIV and it’s all kind of disregarded, so I cant just ask the guy if he has it because he may not even know. What’s the chances that I caught HIV? I’ve seen mixed responses everywhere. It is day six since when it happened and I cant deal with the paranoia - I never even wanted to do it and it’s just took on my mental health.  Thank you all."

My ptsd is due to the day he died which I recently found out my husband..Jeffs stepfather told the hospital he was Jeffs dad and gave permission to turn off life support. I was the only one that could make that decision and I knew my son was going to wake up and be ok. He wasn't brain dead. I have nightmares of him screaming inside for me to help him but no one could hear him. So much makes sense now why the dr wouldn't answer me..no one in the room would tell me what was going on; the death certificate was already in the room. Sorry for getting off subject. Do you have fibro or any of the symptoms related to ME/CFS? I couldn't believe all these years so many of the symptoms I thought was due to the fibro or the ptsd is ME/CFS. The new antidepressant they put me on I feel is helping a lot when it comes to concentration and focus. No side affects which is great. Its Trintellix 10mg once a day. You should have your adrenal checked also. Do you know if there is any test such as mri of the brain that shows anything that would diagnose ME/CFS opposed to CFS? Thank you again. Please get diagnosed as soon as possible."

By that time I got my precum out on my underwear and probably in the pants since my underwear is little small. Also the lady touched my penis with his hand for 2 sec. So with this event is it possible to have hiv transmission if that lady is hiv+,?All these time my penis is inside my underwear or at least inside pants. I believe it is not possible to touch anus or vagina through cloths and standing from behind. So any chance my precum through pants and her fluids (vaginal or anus) can contact and it pass it through my pants to my penis ? Sorry I have never studied Biology. After 2 weeks this event I got a dry cough which lasted for 3 days. No other symptoms. Later I had sex with my wife (unprotected) and my wife got severe cold and sore throat after some 8 days then there was a rash after 15 days of sex.

Right now it is a struggle to want to do anything as I am already in pain as soon as I open my eyes and any movement only intensifies the pain. Right now I am not on anything for the pain as my doctor and psychiatrist are trying to think of what medications will work well together and not cause any problems but until then I am left to deal with the pain and sleepless nights.

It was when I couldn't work that I decided it was time for some serious treatment for my depression. So, I found a residential treatment program, supposedly best in the world for trauma, and signed up. I've never been in any kind of residential treatment, so it was kind of traumatic having all my control over my life taken away, having my bags searched, and having to submit to a strip search (down to my undies).  But then they took away my Tramadol and Provigil! I wouldn't be able to work without the Provigil - it keeps me from falling asleep at my desk, in meetings, etc. I ended up leaving after 10 days rather than the minimum 28 days and now I seem to be in a relatively mild flare. Lots more pain than usual but not unbearable pain. Also, I had what I found out is called a Thunder Clap headache. That's when you suddenly get a crippling pain in your head for up to a minute followed by a bad headache lasting from an hour to several days. I Googled it and it said it could be life threatening and get the the emergency room immediately. So, I did and a CAT scan of my brain showed no damage. So that's great. But I am curious what people think about having my fibro meds (Tramadol and Provigil) taken away and being offered only Ibuprofen and Tylenol in place of my regular meds. I try to avoid Ibuprofen because it can cause bleeding in your stomach, I have taken a lot of it over the years and even before I ever started taking Ibuprofen, for the past 40 years I have had stomach issues - it feels like my stomach is on fire if I don't take Prilosec every day. And I never felt like Tylenol did anything for my pain. They said once I get the depression under control, I'll have more energy and less pain and won't need my fibro meds. So, do you think the Thunderclap headache was a result? What do you think of them taking away my fibro meds? Thank you!!"

Fall is coming soon and this is my favorite season. Spring is OK as we are so ready after a long winter but this is the time of year I feel better*. My stiffness is better, I sleep better and I have more energy in the cool air than I do during summer. Maybe it's from resting during the hot days or all the pool work that is able to get done to move my limbs and muscles. Maybe it's a higher or highest Vit D level as I take my vitamin and sit in the sun. All I know is I am better in Fall. I love the leaves changing and seeing the true color of that leaf before it falls off. Understanding this is the season of their lives. All things have a time to be born, time to live and a time to die. We have to stay in our living phase....moving and joining in to things happening around us. I know it is hard, but caring for yourself is imperative. Be a champion, be amazing....no one is going to care for you like you can. Don't put crap in your mouth, eat well. No soda, your body asks for water. H2O a simple chemical to help it clear its wastes. I so believe we are what we eat. I got here to the board because I asked so much of my body and gave it little. Well it stopped me in my tracks and I could hardly walk. The pain was a 12+ and movement so challenged. The board here 13 years ago saved my life. It is so valuable a home to come back to because of that. I am hoping the fmily will follow and return. Sleep was a big thing that this condition took from me. What helped? A memory foam topper, the thickest I could afford, I started with 3"" and now have 6"" from Overstock.com. It helped the trigger point knots from hurting and making me toss and turn all night.  The warm shower before bed and when I awoke to stretch and move a bit. I learned to change to a new shoe, using different leg muscles as I walked and it changes the whole body frame. Wear good shoes that support you. Paying attention to posture helped my muscles perform and know what was what. It took years of day by day and two steps forward and one step back....to get where I am today.  We are the strongest people I know. The trials this gave me were momentous and no one would understand, only the fmily here who was walking close to the path I had. Please stay and post your issues and needs. I am only here on the weekends now as I am back to work and am full time 5 (ugh) days a week. I do live to work as it takes all I have to do that. But that is OK, I am productive and I make a difference in the world. I hope one change at a time and a bucket of patience for you will make a difference for you too. The strongest med I take is distraction. Laughter and humor is second before the meds I swallow from the MD. After meds I get out and in distraction and the pain and dysfunction lightens up and is put to the back of my head so I can have a day.... my day. Memories made and then kept. We become the sum of our memories. OK, good luck to those who find this site. There are a few that are here. We don't always post but we read and maybe have nothing to add so they don't respond, don't take it that you are ignored...they just have no words to add.  Hugs from me, Nancy B"

So I recently ate in a restaurant and paid cash for my meal. I then received the change and put them in my pocket. I went to another place and spent nearly 3 hours and then I decided to take a cab. As I was about to pay, the driver, one of the money bills seemed to have dark brown spots which I suspect is blood. I thought it was dried. I handed that bill to the driver. When I got home after like 30 minutes, I happened to pick my nose with the same finger that touched the money with the dark brown spots. I mean nose is also a mucosa and I worried if the spots in that money came from an HIV positive individual. I have no other risk factors and just asking if I can get HIV from nosepicking from finger that could have touched the spots in the money. I am worried. Thank you"

Then, I gardened a little less and kneel-ed down, instead of squatting. Although my knees did not hurt for 4-5 years. They started getting very tired when I started riding bicycle as a routine. I have biked almost 4 days straight for an hour each, walked 40 minutes with regular pace and steps for one day, ridden about 4-5 hours one day, and then walked again for 20 minutes for one day. I know that I am supposed to rest for one or two days, yet I thought that walking with regular pace was just like taking a break. It's been about 2 years now ever since I started the biking routine. Not only are my knees tired but also my entire legs. Squatting down created a discomfort sensation. I feel the discomfort even when I go upstairs on the staircase. I really don't think I am overtraining. Fibromyalgia does not seem to fit my condition exactly. At this point, I am not sure what I am having. Any suggestions? Thanks"

He did not ejaculte. After this I checked the condom for any leaks and there was none. Should I be concerned about my status?

I got flu, fever, night sweat TWICE, muscles pain all over my body (still present) , nausea, constant headache (still present) and constant pain in my neck, also I found out this morning that I got rash on my back. Little reddish things on my back (it doesn't itchy or pain). I also lost about 5KG in just 2 weeks. I also still feel chills frequently. I get tired easily and short of breath. I sweat just when I'm exposed to sun for a few minutes. I know ""this is it"". I know that there couldn't be anything else but HIV ENTERING MY BODY. I have tried home-kit HIV test, It shows NEGATIVE but i know that , it's the period when home-kit HIV test cannot detect HIV in my blood because it is tested based on my immune system to HIV.  I've read online articles about HIV (first stage entering my body) and it all just matches with what I'm experiencing now. all the symptoms in me are HIV. I've been crying a lot , not because my own life, but other people who I sincerely love. I have a girlfriend whom I dearly love to death. I have been actively having sex with her (unprotected). I'm sure I could have had infected her as well.  I keep blaming GOD for what has happened to me. I mean like, why should it be me ? What sin did I do to deserve this ? there are so many stuff going on my mind. I just feel extremely sad, knowing that I have infected innocent girl or worse, could be my family.  I'm the eldest in my family and my family is dependent on me. Only I alone work for my family. For my lil sister, brother , mom and my dad.  I'm the only hope they have, but now i've gone and throw their hope away. I don't want them to know. I just want a peace and quite life till death comes to me. I have been preparing everything.  I'm sure there are so many people out there who are HIV Positive just like me. I know I'm being selfish to share my story here, I just don't know who to share this with.  I'm only 25, WHY ME ? why now ? why it has to be HIV ? why can't just die with accident or something else? with HIV in my body, I don't who have I infected with this VIRUS. I DON'T WANNA DIE AND I DON'T THEM TO GET SICK. I LOVE THEM ALL. I NEVER MEANT TO HURT THEM. I REALLY NEVER."

I had a sexual encounter with a csw in the last week of December last year. She gave me blowjob with one condom for 2 minutes and then she put another one and continued giving blowjob. I inserted my finger in the vagina for may be a minute or two and I wore a condom on my finger while doing this. She then shook mine till I ejacuated. now what scares me is that since that day till date I have been having stiff neck most of the time. I am feeling very tired and now since yesterday the left side near my groin there was a small lump which I broke and then it is become hard. I am scared of things after reading so many websites I need help from you people on what should I do. first I am scared that when she started giving me blowjob and the condom must have broken and that's why she must have put another one and that time I may have come in contact with her body fuids or saliva. and also when I fingered her the index finger I had a very small cut this was not bleeding or open but im concerned since I got this boil on groin now which is become hard after I have kept on pressing it so it this the lypmh node that I broke or something. please help me and guide me what should I do. I did not do any intercourse or anything with the csw other than what I have mentioned. please help me with what I should do now, im really very scared and worried coz of this mistake I have done."

I need help with my situation. I got my fifth test at 6th month and it also came back negative. But listen to my story please 6 months ago I was on a vacation. There was a bar with sex workers. Long story short all I did was a sex worker poured alcohol down her chest and I licked it. That’s it. I know it is impossible to get HIV this way. Unless she is lactating. But 10 days after this possible exposure I got my nodes swolen. They stayed like that for couple of days and went away. I had other symptoms like itchy hands in the morning. Actually to this day these symptoms are coming and going but its rare. Like every once in a week. Doctor said if you had hiv, swolen nodes wouldnt go away and came back. Anyhow, the problem is I get these symptoms I never had. 2 days ago I discovered scrabs in my hair. I checked it online. Site gave 12 reasons and last one is about HIV. I always have these little symptoms linked to HIV somehow and I am about to break down mentally. for symptoms I sometimes get very little bumps in my mouth. I sometimes have backpain. I dont feel sick or tired. But those little things are still there. The problem is I always had low Vitamin D count so in the first month I got medication to raise it so I always think can this medication somehow delay seroconversion this much? I know it’s a long shot but when It comes to your life and potentially someone elses, these tiny chances can make you go mad. Thanks in advence"

All wrong.  What they are not telling you. There are treatments for Chronic Pain....Lidocaine Infusions 6 treatments a year and covered OHIP Treatment Many patients start off their journey with fibromyalgia by seeing their primary care physician. After a thorough work-up, these general practitioners usually send patients to doctors who specialize in pain conditions. One possible physician you may encounter would be a rheumatologist, particularly if rheumatoid arthritis or lupus is suspected. In most cases, the patient will be treated for the chronic pain condition by a pain management physician, and they will coordinate other treatments in conjunction with the primary care doctor. The front line treatment for fibromyalgia by pain management doctors is medications. As mentioned above, antidepressants are often prescribed for mood adjustment, but they are also quite effective in relieving pain. Cymbalta is an anti-depressant that has been studied and found to be effective in treating the pain of fibromyalgia. In addition, anti-seizure medications, such as Lyrica, can also help with the fibromyalgia pain. Muscle relaxants, such as baclofen, and anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen, are also used to control pain. By combining these medication types, most patients experience pain relief. Opioids are not generally used for fibromyalgia because they tend not to decrease the specific pain of the condition.

I always had doubts because none of the diets or anything else that was supposed to help me did. Plus the onset was so sudden it just didn't make sense to me. Finally about 5 years after my diagnosis I came down with a bad case of Pink Eye. My eye doctor gave me a Azithromycin regiment. The antibiotics did nothing for my pink eye but after about 4 days it completely took away my pain. After about 2 weeks the pain came back. So I went to my doctor and told him what happened. He told me I was crazy! I said maybe but just for fun let's do the antibiotics thing again but this time give me a double regiment. It's been about 1 month and I'm still without pain. After some research I'm thinking possible leaky gut syndrome. So I started myself on trubiotics and l-glutamine. So far so good. I'm going to an infectious disease specialist in a couple of weeks.

Over the past few days, I've had diarrhea fairly consistently. I had a 4th generation antigen/antibody test about 47 days after exposure, and I tested negative.

I have been taking hydrocodone which was prescribed but when I ran out of it (it was just left over from when I had oral surgery in November) my mom who has numerous health problems is prescribed oxycodone and when I was in so much pain the other day and nothing was helping she gave me one to help me go to sleep. Completely forgot about it now I am scared to death . This a PCP not a pain management doctor also btw. But before prescribing narcotics they must dt. I am so scared guys. Finally I found a Dr that cares and listens and now I'm so scared they won't help me when I go back in two weeks . He asked me what would show up and I said my Adderall and hydrocodone because I had not thought about the oxycodone until after I got home. I saw sometimes drug tests u can get a false positive for oxycodone when taking hydrocodone. Someone please help put my mind at some ease. He gave me some tramadol to last me long enough until my next appt so he can prescribe something else but if I failed I'm scared they're.going to cut me off.

We had unprotected oral and protected vaginal sex twice (once eleven weeks ago and once seven weeks ago), after the second time a couple days later I noticed sores on my vagina that I assumed were herpes which made sense to me since he had performed unprotected oral sex on me. A couple days later I got it tested and came back positive for HSV 1, typically oral herpes. I started to get anxious about my HIV status, I had never been tested before but after contracting herpes I thought I should. Well I also just started birth control at thattime and about four to five days later started to experience mild headaches which I at first attributed to that. I also had had a cough for a month at that point that I thought nothing of. Well six weeks later I noticed a dry patch in between my fingers that was very itchy. I had a history of eczema so I bought cortozone lotion for it and it disappeared in around a day. I started to have really bad anxiety about it though and then started experiencing a sore neck and shoulders and sorenessunder my shoulder. I freaked out and bought an oraquick test (6 and ten weeks post exposure) which came back negative but it still didn't calm me down. I went to the clinic and had the nurse check to see if I had swollen lymph nodes which she said I didn't but I'm doubtful of her assessment. She also said a lot of my symptoms could be due stress. I was still nervous so I bought another oraquick oral swab test a couple days later which again came back negative. Then one night I woke up twice with night sweats and that really terrified me. I bought my last test at 7 and 11 weeks post possible risk events (I should note I'm unaware of this mans HIV status but he says he is negative. I'm pretty sure he isn't gay or an IV drug user which ik would greatly reducehis risk of having it, ive also asked his friends all of whom have said he doesn't have it) and it came back negative also but just this morning I noticed a possible cankor sore in my mouth. I haven't had these in years and it terrified me because I know that this is one of the symptoms of HIV. so my questions are 1. What is the chance I would contract HIV through giving oral sex without ejaculation, but possible pre ejaculation (ik a risk factor is open sores in mouth, I cant remember if I had any at the time but my wisdom teeth have been coming in for about a year. They don't bleed at all I was wondering if those count) 2. How accurate would my three oraquick tests be with the last possible exposure being 6-7 weeks ago testing negative 3. Could my symptoms really all be attributed to stress 4. Could taking antibiotics for herpes 5 weeks ago (I took them for four days) be delaying my production of antibodies, ik certain things like chemo therapy and bad immune systems can I was wondering if that could be why my tests are negative please someone answer I am worried sick I am going to get a blood prick tomorrow I'm so scared it will come back positive"

I’m taking an antihistamine which helps with the itching and Maca capsules which are a godsend for the sweats. Anyway I have noticed when I exercise and exert myself just slightly I become short of breath, coughing and wheezing... I mentioned it to my doctor who prescribed me an inhaler. I tried to shrug it off and convince myself this is all to do with my reflux as yes i have that too so never used the inhaler. Today after my bicycle ride I had all the symptoms so i decided to give the inhaler a go.. took two puffs and have to be honest did instantly feel a bit better. I also noticed after eating too I get short of breath and cough a bit so I’m really confused  Does this mean I have asthma or is this reflux and after any exercise I’m struggling so should I continue with the inhaler? Any advice would be so gratefully appreciated. Thank You"

Most of those people play sports or do exercise once a month at most. My doctors never care, they always just tell me to keep taking the meds. Sudden change: About 4 months ago I was training for a race. Everything was fine, the usual sh1t in my cornflakes with the asthma. But my performance was improving little by little (was doing 5k @ 15 k/h). Then one day during training I had a very intense abdominal pain. Unbearable, I had to stop almost immediately. This had never happened before, ever. After that I was never the same, and now it happens every time I train. My performance dropped drastically (now doing 3k @ 14 k/h). This is a huge drop. When I'm done I have the usual painful asthma symptoms plus the intense abdominal pain. I'm so tired of this sh1t.

Most commonly, people get or transmit HIV through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use. Only certain body fluids—blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk—from a person who has HIV can transmit HIV. These fluids must come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or be directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle or syringe) for transmission to occur. Mucous membranes are found inside the rectum, vagina, penis, and mouth. In the United States, HIV is spread mainly by Having anal or vaginal sex with someone who has HIV without using a condom or taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV. For the HIV-negative partner, receptive anal sex (bottoming) is the highest-risk sexual behavior, but you can also get HIV from insertive anal sex (topping). Either partner can get HIV through vaginal sex, though it is less risky for getting HIV than receptive anal sex. Sharing needles or syringes, rinse water, or other equipment (works) used to prepare drugs for injection with someone who has HIV. HIV can live in a used needle up to 42 days depending on temperature and other factors. Less commonly, HIV may be spread From mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Although the risk can be high if a mother is living with HIV and not taking medicine, recommendations to test all pregnant women for HIV and start HIV treatment immediately have lowered the number of babies who are born with HIV. By being stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle or other sharp object. This is a risk mainly for health care workers. In extremely rare cases, HIV has been transmitted by Oral sex—putting the mouth on the penis (fellatio), vagina (cunnilingus), or anus (rimming). In general, there’s little to no risk of getting HIV from oral sex. But transmission of HIV, though extremely rare, is theoretically possible if an HIV-positive man ejaculates in his partner’s mouth during oral sex. To learn more about how to lower your risk, see CDC’s Oral Sex and HIV Risk. Receiving blood transfusions, blood products, or organ/tissue transplants that are contaminated with HIV. This was more common in the early years of HIV, but now the risk is extremely small because of rigorous testing of the US blood supply and donated organs and tissues. Eating food that has been pre-chewed by an HIV-infected person. The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiver’s mouth mixes with food while chewing. The only known cases are among infants. Being bitten by a person with HIV. Each of the very small number of documented cases has involved severe trauma with extensive tissue damage and the presence of blood. There is no risk of transmission if the skin is not broken. Contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood-contaminated body fluids. Deep, open-mouth kissing if both partners have sores or bleeding gums and blood from the HIV-positive partner gets into the bloodstream of the HIV-negative partner. HIV is not spread through saliva"

However, after leaving I noticed that the findings from my chest x-ray included the following: ""Biapical pleural/parenchymal scarring is noted."" I assume that this is not very serious, since no one mentioned it to me at the emergency room. Can anyone shed some light on what this means and whether I should be concerned?"

I walked into a porta-potty and scratched myself on a dull piece of metal sticking out of the door. The metal was the holder of the door lock which had fallen off. Although the metal was dull, I hit it hard enough where it tore about an inch of top layer of skin off. There was some blood, but by no means gushing. It was very similar to being scratch by a cat, though a little but wider.I'm concerned someone may have also scratched themselves on it and I could potentially contract something they had. Or, since its in he inside of the porta-potty, I have no idea what's floating around airborne that may have been on it.I'm guessing the reasonable thing is go to the Doctor and get a blood test to be sure, but I'm also hoping someone smarter than I can tell me I'm being ridiculous and have nothing to worry about.Thanks in advance for any and all advice!"

I am constantly struggling to breath its a fight ever single moment and even with qvar, rescue inhailer, neutralizer with albuterol sulfate, antihistamines( allegra D or claritin D) and omeprizol ( for gerd). I am still struggling to breath even with all those. They offer no improvement what so ever. They used to help. But now no longer help. My doctor says my lungs sound fine and my oxygen lvls are most of the time 95-100 and somehow a test from 2 years ago disproves that I don't have asthma. They wouldn't do another test. Is this asthma doing? or is there something else I should be looking into? Has anyone else had this issue? Is it just bronchitis healing and if so how much longer will it take to breath again? It has been a month since this all started."

Another thing that made me question my health is that my smoker's cough changed into what I can describe only as a vibrating cough( vibration comes from the lungs or trachea?) that sometimes brings up some kind of white/translucent tissue that looks like the skin inside my mouth. I wouldn't be so concerned if those pieces of skin weren't striking my palate that hard(i drew the conclusion that they come from somewhere down my throat?).

Your body is trying to get rid of all that gunk in your lungs and grow back the cilia that line your bronchi and help to sweep out contaminants. I would definitely see a doctor, but be aware that it may take a month or more as this healing takes place. But hold on! You will feel so much better as a nonsmoker. Please allow me to put in a plug for Nicotine Anonymous. It does so much more than just help you quit, and it was a completely different experience than any other.

Here are my concerns: (1) I am under the impression that you need to have at least a little bit more real evidence to diagnose someone with asthma, which as far as I was aware is a chronic disease and to diagnose it requires lung tests, etc. Is this correct? (2) The doctor attempted to give me a package of BREO Ellipta which she recommended I take once a day and attempted to prescribe me a ZPak along with it. I diligently read up on this BREO Ellipta and found that this should apparently NEVER be prescribed for someone other than someone who either has asthma unmanageable with less potent medications or who has COPD, and that to prescribe a ZPak / azithromycin along with BREO is definitely contraindicated. Furthermore, I've found no support in favor of diagnosing ASTHMA, a chronic disease, in any way resembling what this Doctor did. Everything I've read has convinced me there is no way in hell this should ever have been provided to me and, unless I am gravely mistaken here, I am very glad I did not merely trust this Doctor and begin taking this medication. Infact, after easing up on trying to cough everything out my cough has significantly diminished after 6-8 hours.  So, my main question is, what would you recommend I do, is this something I should be reporting to someone? Are my assumptions correct?"

Yes I get therapy for these things.) So approximately 5 weeks ago, at the beginning of October, I performed oral sex on a guy without a condom (no anal/vaginal sex occurred). Someone I've known for a few years, and who has been with a few partners, but assured me afterwards he always uses condoms when having sex and is clean of STDs. Rational me believes this. But I worry. Recently, I've had some issues with headache, sore throat, general congestion, itchy skin (though I wouldn't say it's a defined rash...). Lately I've also found myself very forgetful and difficult to remember things in the short term. It is fall and full of bad weather, and I normally get allergies at some point this season, but again I go to the worst outcome. The stupidly anxious part about all this is that it did not last very long (~5 min) and he did not ejaculate in my mouth, so the most there would have been was pre-cum and probably not even much of that. Also, I did not have any mouth sores or bleeding, open wounds, nor were there any visible cuts/bumps/problems with his penis.  I have not been tested for HIV or any other STD.

Aside of that, I also had myself checked in the lab for regular blood test (just the one to check your LDL, etc) and VDRL test about 2 months after my sexual encounter with the masseuse (vaginal intercourse, no condom and I came inside her). The result is satisfactory, with VDRL test also came out negative. My immune system is also up and running pretty good. The problem now is, as of today, November 14th, 2017 (after 126 days has passed since my last high risk encounter), I suddenly have this headache, dry cough and a slight fever. A bit of fatigue as I kept on dry coughing. Also, my lower back could sometimes felt a bit painBut other than that, everything seems to be fine. My question is, is it possible that I actually have HIV and that I late seroconvert? As far as I know, I don't have any history on this immuno defficiency (the one that from most forums said that is one of the reason people could late seroconvert, the things like having transplantation, or undergoing treatment for cancer or the like).

It started in high school, while I was running cross country. My first semester I never had difficulty breathing, but the next semester I noticed my breathing was holding me back. Gradually my times tapered off as the years progressed. After races it's took me many more minutes that my friends to regain my breath. I asked my doctor for an invalid but it didn't make running any easier. One time I broke my mile time by 2 minutes effortlessly but after the race started coughing up mucus. Another time, I was racing my brother, who was 10. I beat him at sprints, but he won when we raced a lap around the track. He asked me if I had really been trying. It was clear to me then that I was fighting against something that he wasn't, and it only affected me in longer races that required efficient, constant breathing. I learned not to fight it and to just slow down if it happened. But the Shortness of breath was only an issue during exercise. I stopped running competitively in college, and in my final year of college I noticed Shortness of breath while not exercising. Now after graduating, I have episodes where my Shortness of breath is making me feel like I can't get enough air, even when I'm sitting or lying down. So now it's gotten to the point where I can't ignore it like I did before. The hardest part is expelling air- it feels like I can't breathe out to make room for more air. Pressing something against my back offers some relief. So what do you think? Is this asthma?"

I try to explain my case below:  I am male, 36 years old. I had a risky sex on AUGUST 9TH at a massage parlour with a woman. After some friendly touch, I did some fingering mostly in her vagina and a bit anal way with my right hand. After that I put on a latex condom. I believe and hope (!) that I did not use my right hand while putting on the condom. (IS THIS A RISK?)  After I put on condom, I did vaginal penetration slowly, and that last at most 20 seconds.  I pulled out, after that, I could see the condom still on my penis, and semen in the condom. It seemed proper.  After that I remember I removed my condom, and cleaned around my genital area with a dry towel. (I am scared that maybe I touched my urethrea before the towel, or inside my nose with my right fingers after the towel.) (IS THIS RISK?)  After a week, I became paranoid, thinking what if she was HIV positive. EXACTLY AFTER 7 DAYS (AUGUST 16TH), I went to see her again. I requested her to do a rapid HIV test. The result seemed positive to me. So I told her to go to a clinic and get it confirmed.  In the meantime, I got also HIV test on AUGUST 16TH. The result was surely negative.  She texted me 2 days later. She said she was positive. She said; she had unprotected sex only with her boyfriend; she was probably infected in the 1st or 2nd week of May after his business trip; in the beginning of June, she had some light flu and afterwards some cough. (So this makes her just at the end of WINDOW PERIOD on AUGUST 9th, right?)  After that I immediately visited a clinic and explained my case to a doctor. Doctor told me; I have 2 advantages: 1st I used a condom, 2nd I am circumsized.  Still I insisted to have a viral load test. Doctor said OK. I got the viral load test done on AUGUST 18TH (9 DAYS AFTER SEX).  In the meantime, on AUGUST 19TH and AUGUST 20TH, I started taking ARVs which doctor prescribed. (Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300mg, Lamivudine USP 600mg, Efavirenz USP 200mg). ARVs made me dizzy, so I stoppped on AUGUST 21ST and AUGUST 22ND.  I got the viral load results on AUGUST 23th. The test is called “HIV-1 Viral Load by Taqman Plasma (Quantitative)”. It read as “below 20 copies/ml” and log value “below 1.30”. It reads as “HIV RNA DETECTED (!), less than 20 HIV/RNA copies/ml)”  I got terrified. The doctor told me to continue ARVs. I immediately started again. I am scared because this time ARVs make me feel a bit less dizzy. DOES THIS CONFIRM THAT I HAVE HIV VİRUS? Because doctor told me that ARVs make HIV-positive people feel better, but HIV-negative people bad, dizzy, vomitting, etc.  Finally doctor told me to finish ARVs (30 per box, one per day) and after I finish ARVs, we will run additional tests or a second viral load test.  WHAT TEST SHOULD SHE DO THEN? ANOTHER VIRAL LOAD TEST? OR ELSE?  SHOULD OR CAN I TAKE ANY ADDITIONAL MEDİCATİONS?  SHOULD I STOP ARVs?  These are the questions I have now.  I am very scared but I am trying to stay strong. So please I need your support and valuable opinions!  (As for symtoms: Between 15th – 22nd AUGUST, I developed a flu which seems to have stopped by now. I am scared that I will have more symptoms in upcoming weeks. DO ARVs ALLEVIATE SUCH SYMPTOMS IN THE WINDOW PERIOD?)  I asked so many questions. I am so sorry for taking this much time of yours. But I feel really alone and don’t know what to do.

I try to explain my case below:  I am male, 36 years old. I had a risky sex on AUGUST 9TH at a massage parlour with a woman. After some friendly touch, I did some fingering mostly in her vagina and a bit anal way with my right hand. After that I put on a latex condom. I believe and hope (!) that I did not use my right hand while putting on the condom. (IS THIS A RISK?)  After I put on condom, I did vaginal penetration slowly, and that last at most 20 seconds.  I pulled out, after that, I could see the condom still on my penis, and semen in the condom. It seemed proper.  After that I remember I removed my condom, and cleaned around my genital area with a dry towel. (I am scared that maybe I touched my urethrea before the towel, or inside my nose with my right fingers after the towel.) (IS THIS RISK?)  After a week, I became paranoid, thinking what if she was HIV positive. EXACTLY AFTER 7 DAYS (AUGUST 16TH), I went to see her again. I requested her to do a rapid HIV test. The result seemed positive to me. So I told her to go to a clinic and get it confirmed.  In the meantime, I got also HIV test on AUGUST 16TH. The result was surely negative.  She texted me 2 days later. She said she was positive. She said; she had unprotected sex only with her boyfriend; she was probably infected in the 1st or 2nd week of May after his business trip; in the beginning of June, she had some light flu and afterwards some cough. (So this makes her just at the end of WINDOW PERIOD on AUGUST 9th, right?)  After that I immediately visited a clinic and explained my case to a doctor. Doctor told me; I have 2 advantages: 1st I used a condom, 2nd I am circumsized.  Still I insisted to have a viral load test. Doctor said OK. I got the viral load test done on AUGUST 18TH (9 DAYS AFTER SEX).  In the meantime, on AUGUST 19TH and AUGUST 20TH, I started taking ARVs which doctor prescribed. (Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300mg, Lamivudine USP 600mg, Efavirenz USP 200mg). ARVs made me dizzy, so I stoppped on AUGUST 21ST and AUGUST 22ND.  I got the viral load results on AUGUST 23th.

Two weeks last Friday I had a risky unprotected receptive encounter with a guy who I know, he said he didn't have anything yet I am concerned that I may have contracted something.  I have been on antibiotics for an infected wisdom tooth (Metronidazole) and have had past history of utricaria / hives. I have been really quite itchy the last week (face, legs and arms) and yesterday evening I noticed the rash that I have attached a picture of on my back. It is only approx 2cm in width and does not itch - it's strangely in the shape of wings.  Thanks in advance"

For the past 5 weeks I have had a chest rattle cough. There has been phlegm and a bit of nose and ear congestion. You can hear wheezing when I exhale. I was sent for an x ray that came back clear on the left side but they didn’t do right hand side.  There are no other symptoms. Maybe a bit of tirednesS. Is this something I should worry about?  On a side note I had a one night stand 6 weeks ago. Is this chest cough a symptom of any type of primary HIV infection?? Sorry I am a worrier.  Thank you

I went to eat out in a restaurant. I was first customer in restaurant as it was early in morning; they were opened few minutes back. You probably won’t believe but this what happened  A guy who was trans welcomed me when I entered the restaurant; When waiter came to our table; I felt he was little high and embarrassingly erected. A yellowish substance dried out on his face. It seems like he was involved in some sexual activity before serving to my table. I ignored him; he took my order and went back in. While serving complimentary; he spilled the food on me. Anyways , server was changed and trans guy came to serve on my table. I wanted to left without eating food but I thought it will be disrespectful to servers there. So I started to eat; complimentary were fried hard noodles and it got penetrated into my gum; I also have some wounds from deep cleaning of my teeth. I am diabetic and it takes longer my wounds to heal. Do you think if complimentary food got some infectious fluids from first server hands; could cause a hiv related situation?  I was reading actually HIV stay alive for sometime outside open air and example for that is transmission of hiv through prechewed food in infants."

So his mouth probably had inflammation and he might have had bleeding gums. He has very good oral hygeine normally and had no open sores or wounds in his mouth. Just 21 hours before he performed oral on me I had a risky sexual encounter with a stranger. If this stranger had hiv and had passed the virus onto me how long would it take to totally infect me? My parnter gave me oral 21 hours after my possible exposure. Does HIV take at least 24 hours to totally infect someone to the point where they can pass it on? Or is 21 hours enough and for me to have passed it onto him? Im very worried I have infected him and just need some answers if anyone knows anything about this :(

The therapist and I mutually fondled each other and then she came on top of me naked and started rubbing her genitals over my penis and testicles. I was wearing a thin disposable underwear while she was naked.I felt my underwear was wet while she was over me.  It has been several months since this encounter but I clearly remember that I did not have a complete erection while she was on top of me. She must have grinded for only a few minutes (1 - 3 minutes). I also responded by bouncing up on her for a few seconds. She resisted and held me back and grinded again. I dont remember any deep penetration or that of my penis getting squeezed in her vagina. She was quite heavy and in fact I felt the penis was semi-flacid at best,.  After some time she masturbated me to ejaculation.  I felt panic a few days after the incident and went to speak to her again. She said she was sure that there was no penetration and also that she would have charged me extra money if there was any. She had a fight with her boyfriend the previous day and she told me she felt relaxed and aroused as we fondled. Could that be a problem?  I've had no major symptoms(fever, rashes, etc) since the incident last November but I'm told HIV may not have any symptoms.  Please advise if I was at HIV risk, I'm still worried and apprehensive about a test.Could there be penetration with a semi flaccid penis? I'm also worried that she was completely naked while I was wearing a disposable underwear.  Kindly help !  Thanks."

Today while I was at work I had two friends come up to me. One gave me a high five and the other shook my hand. Due to the dry weather and over-washing, I had cracks both on the back of my hand and on my wrist, some of which were actively bleeding at the time. I realized this and quickly went to the restroom to wash. It probably took me under a minute afterwards to go and get washed up. I didn't notice any blood on my hand but the thought still bugged me. Assuming there was blood and enough of it, what is my risk? Could the water from washing push it in my bleeding sores? Also, does it only take one wash to clean blood off?

I walked into a porta-potty and scratched myself on a dull piece of metal sticking out of the door. The metal was the holder of the door lock which had fallen off. Although the metal was dull, I hit it hard enough where it tore about an inch of top layer of skin off. There was some blood, but by no means gushing. It was very similar to being scratch by a cat, though a little but wider. I'm concerned someone may have also scratched themselves on it and I could potentially contract something they had. Or, since its in he inside of the porta-potty, I have no idea what's floating around airborne that may have been on it. I'm guessing the reasonable thing is go to the Doctor and get a blood test to be sure, but I'm also hoping someone smarter than I can tell me I'm being ridiculous and have nothing to worry about. Thanks in advance for any and all advice!"

I've had a recurring nosebleed (daily) that lasted 2-3 months. I've since done cauterisation. However, I realised that I've been picking at my nose on a daily basis, and it bled everyday. The nose picking happened randomly and my hands were definitely not cleaned or washed. Considering that it was daily for a couple of months, and bleeding everyday, what is the likelihood that I contract Hepatitis C and HIV through the wounds in my nose (from daily surfaces that my hands come into contact with like subway railings, public tables, toilets, etc.)?"

I can safely say I have never experienced gastro problems like this in my life. Likewise, my partner having this same gastro problem means I know this is a viral infection of some sort. Is it at all likely that HIV could present itself in this way with no fever and no rash? Are there any other viruses which present themselves in both the respiratory and intestinal systems at the same time? 	-My negative 28 day test seems to be fairly conclusive based on what I can read. However, my symptoms at 2-3 weeks and now at 11-12 weeks are extremely concerning me. Is it possible that the lateness of my symptoms would correspond with a later seroconversion and subsequently my test results changing?

Everything started with some nausea (no vomiting) that initially went away, but came back few days later. I had some other symptoms such as excessive gas and gas related stomach pains. After roughly a month, I visited a doctor here in Japan (on a business trip here for 3 months), had a complete blood-work done including tests for liver and pancreatic functions and some cancer markers as well as an occult bleeding stool test. Everything was fine so I was given 30mg omeprazole to take every morning after breakfast for 6 weeks. The doctor things IBS or reflux. After some 3-4 days, all symptoms cleared, but another week later the intermittent, very light nausea came back. It is usually the worst in the morning, or in moments when I can stop my activity and sit down in the evening. I am working as a mountain guide so my days are mostly in the field and very busy, but once I have a moment to stop, it often re-appears.  I'm pretty good at googling scary things, so mostly worried about stomach or pancreas cancer... Do you think I should seek some further investigation right away, or rather wait to finish my omeprazole regimen and try to calm down? Thanks, T."

The pain is an unbearable, stabbing/ pulsating pain, and the only relief is to lie down with my knees up to my chest. It is affecting my work, school, and social life. I had a Dr.s appointment two weeks ago. He is considering IBS, and recommended I cut out sugars, breads, dairies, and processed foods.

So about 3 years ago I had my first incident when I choked when drinking a can of soda. I was put on Omeprazole for 1 month and it cleared me up, I quit fizzy drinks and continued to be fine, avoiding spicy foods too. 2 years ago it happend again and it was pretty much the same protocol, Omeprazole for 1 month and it cleared it up. Now, in December 2019 I ate a hot dog from the cinema and I couldn't swallow but my throat was been insane trying to produce saliva. This never happend before and was new. It was weird because it came on strong and sudden with the hot dog. I think it did very slightly start a month before as I was drinking more tea and occasionally it was weird to swallow water but not that noticeable or that often. I went to the doctor the following day after hardly any sleep and they have me Lansoprazole, and it did help starting on 2 doses at 30mg each. After I needed to take a lot of Gaviscon and it was quite bad I had to take the strong Gaviscon. Now I am on Omeprazole, I was on a single dose but I am now on 2 doses per day. This normally fixes after a week but now I am 3 months in and it's not getting better. I don't get heartburn or any feeling whatsoever, I just get the result of not being able to swallow water. Previously on Lansoprazole I kept getting too much saliva production which was weird, thats seem to have gone with Omeprazole. You can see red veins in the back of my throat and yellow/white splotches over the throat where it is all burnt from the acid. The side of my tonsils has a purple vein on it thats kind of bulging out like a spot. Again there are veins showing all around that area. It can be hard to swallow, since being on 2 doses of PPI I am able to swallow but sometimes it's tricky to swallow water at first, it takes me a few seconds to get it to a swallowing point which is scary. I even stopped drinking water for weeks because it was hard to swallow. Has anyone else experienced anything like this, where they have had the problem before then it comes back and won't resolve? Is there anything else that could be a problem? I have been eating really basic food, nothing on the naughty list. I have to take 2 doses of Omeprazole for 1 month then go back to the doctor.

Stressing ever since.,"Sometime in June I was poked by a fresh heroin needle in my mid shin area deep enough to draw blood it was a insulin type needle. I'm worried that I may have contracted HIV through this I took a Oraquick Test at around 4 weeks it was negative and I don't have major symptoms such as fever, night sweats,swollen loses or rashes but I have had a small cough headaches and back pain I'm just wondering if I should be worried or if I'm just over thinking and how accurate was the negative result"
