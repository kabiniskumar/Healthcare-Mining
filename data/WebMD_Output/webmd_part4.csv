Lately though I feel tight and sore on my base of my penis and bladder pelvic area. My penis also feels sore like I have been masterbating too much. When I masterbate I feel like it is toght or sore and I can't move my hand as fast as usual. I also have had a burning pain in my penis tipfrom inflamation. Not sure what the issue is of why I can't go at fully speed as usual. I think I did it to much and to fast is this right or is it something else???

One in January and one in August 2016. I still cant lift the one done first over an inch off the ground. I have to pick it up and put my leg in a car. my other leg is alittle better but not much. that leg has muscle knots in it. If i walk more than 50 feet my hips hurt so bad and it feels like i have a 500 lb block pressing down on them . I am pretty much confined to my room. I dont know what to do at first they said my muscles were weak .I went to PT for a year. no change. then the Dr said oh must be poor circulation.Has anyone else had this happen to them?

It’s on the floor and the only way I can read it is by sitting and lowering my head way, way down. Well while doing this, when my head was at the lowest it could go I suddenly feel this major cramping-like pain around my chest so I slowly move my head up and sit back up. When I looked down I was shocked to see something under my chest bulging out. The severe pain lasted less than a minute and once the pain subsided the thing bulging out under my chest disappeared as well. And just now it happened again when I was bending over the trash while throwing my food out. So my question is, what exactly caused that to happen?"

It is not painful but uncomfortable at the least. When I masturbate the skin seems to be a little red or irritated looking, but given time goes back to normal but still with a burning / itching sensation. No lesions, sores, or pimple like spots. It's not always constant, the burning / itching comes and goes. My recent history with a new partner : 3 times protected sexual intercourse, 2 unprotected oral. First thoughts being that it could be trauma as the oral. Both of us being transparent on STD's and sexual past being to her knowledge she doesn't have HSV2 - with that being said does this sound like HSV2 at all? I have an appointment later this week to get checked out, the fact that it came back out of know where being gone for a week has me concerned. Thank you for your time and I look forward to your responses."

I just want to ask about my situation, if it sounds more like I have herpes, genital warts, or something else. A month ago, my partner noticed some flat, blisters around my anus. There was also one, tiny, red bump on the hood of my clitoris (it didn't really feel painful or anything, but I could definitely tell there was some mild sensation upon touching it). After a day or two, the blisters occurred on certain areas in my vulva, including one on my pubic region. All of the lesions really hurt whenever I moved/walked and it caused a burning sensation during urination. We suspected it was herpes, also because a day before we noticed the lesions, I also had flu-like symptoms for 2 or 3 days. However, when we went to a hospital to get it checked from a doctor, she told me it was definitely genital warts. She also suspected chlamydia/gonorrhea/yeast infection and gave me a prescription for it. She told me to come back after a week and shave the pubic hear to see how it goes because she recommended me to go for cauterization. However, what I read from my research was that genital warts are not usually painful. After a week, the blisters were still there and caused discomfort, but immediately right after I shaved my pubic hair, the pain literally went away in an instant, and it felt normal walking/running. I came back to the doctor after that and she seemed sure it was genital warts. I was really confused because from the readings I've read, it pointed more to herpes, and from where I am, it is difficult to get tested for both herpes and HPV infection. After three weeks, the blisters became flat. A cluster of small ones developed little scabs, but the rest of the blisters didn't have scabs and just looked like round scars. I went to another doctor and she was not sure what it was, and aside from the STIs I mentioned, she pointed out to other conditions such as folliculitis and yeast infection blisters. She also prescribed me with neo-penotran as a suppository for my abnormal discharge. It has been 7 weeks now and all I have are the scars from where the blisters occurred.

We had met a couple of times before very briefly. We met, had lunch, a few drinks, there was lots of kissing (open mouth tongue kissing). I had booked a private booth in an underground bar. Before we went in the bar i went into the toilet/restroom and on the sink was some heavily perfumed and coloured handwash..i put lots in my hand and rubbed it all around the head of my penis (didn't even dilute it) and also dont think i washed it all off properly Anyway inside the private booth lots and lots of heavy kissing, i also put my fingers inside her vagina and also my penis was in her mouth for about 10-15 seconds..that was all. The next day, i notice small painless red bumps on my penis, like little red dots, around 8-10. Now..i also was suffering from a fungal infection in my groin, like jock itch. I was constantly inspecting my penis on Friday the day after and its totally possible i scratched my fungal infection then touched he head of my penis. On the satarday the spots had started to fade, by Sunday they had virtually gone (again all the time maybe scratching my fungal infection and touching my penis head), then on Monday morning i noticed a very slight burning near my peehole and just underneath it, Tuesday it was still there..its not painful when i pee but i can feel the heat a little bit more than usual. So i tell the woman..she is mortified that i am worried about this..her only sexual contact was back last August with her then husband who she split with in November, she is not a promiscuous woman. (she has also gone back and asked her husband about symptoms of anything of which he has hsaid he's not had symptoms of anything and never has) Also...she had a tiny coldsore on her lip..that had completely healed and dropped off the week before we met..she even went to see the pharmacist who confirmed there was nothing there and she was not contagious (because we wanted to kiss). She has no symptoms whatsoever of anything I have gone and got some canesten/thursh cream and have been putting that on, it is getting better but i am now thinking by smothering my penis head in canesten it is making it even more sensitive lol.. I have no other symptoms, i feel well, no visible marks or anything on my penis or the penis head, no disharge that i can see. It it possible it may still be the irritation from the soap getting into the urethra, or maybe i have transferred some bacteria from my fungal infection? Or do you think it could be something more sinister Thanks for your help G"

I am about 30 pounds overweight 	Early September this year my toddler daughter kicked me in the chest 2-3 times at the store when I was holding her. She kicked me around the middle and the middle sides of my chest. Also I think she kicked me in the upper middle and upper middle sides of my chest too. After a week My chest pain died down. After a a couple weeks my chest pain was gone.  I went to urgent care one week after I was kicked in the chest. My chest was not hurting that much when I went in, but my head and neck was. The doctor diagnoses was: Strain of Muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level, initial encounter. The Doctor told me my lymph nodes were causing pain on the right side of my face and head. My chin, right cheek, and right forehead (felt a little tingly and a little numb). Pain went a away after a few days when I was taking my medication and did what she told me to do (mentioned below in this paragraph). I can't breath out of my nose that well, so I breath out my mouth. A ENT doctor told me before I would need a operation to breath out my nose better. The urgent care doctor told me to put a pillow under my back up to my neck when I sleep. I did this and after a few days the major pain went a away. The pillow worked.   	The doctor gave me a low dose muscle relaxer and a high dosage of Ibuprofen (800 mg every 8 hours). After the first day of taking Ibuprofen I had some tinnitus and some hearing problems (like my ear felt blocked for a few hours). After the second day of taking Ibuprofen I had non stop tinnitus for 6 days straight. I had a month and a half of blocked hearing and ear fullness/pressure in my left ear. A ENT doctor told me to have no extra salt, no soy and no msg in my diet. This diet did not help. When I started doing neck exercises (stretching) my ear went back to normal after 2 days and a lot of my head pain decreased. Note: I stopped taking the Ibuprofen after the second day. I guess I can't take ototoxic drugs. 	For about 6 weeks I did not have chest pain at all. About two weeks ago my chest pain started again. I think it might have been caused by holding my toddler daughter. She weights 40 pounds. The seat belt pressing against my chest causes my chest bone to hurt a little. Carrying bottled water aggravates my chest bone pain. My jacket sometimes aggravates my chest bone pain. Below are my current symptoms My current symptoms are: 1. Chest pain in the middle of my chest on the right middle side (mainly), middle middle of chest (sometimes), and (once in a while) pain on the right middle of my chest. Feels like bone pain. Pain will last usually from 30seconds to several minutes, then it goes a way or pain does not feel too bad after several minutes. Carrying anything over 20 pounds causes it to hurt a little to hurt some. 2. Chest pain in the upper middle right (of breastbone, pain mainly here), upper middle middle (sometimes), and pain on the upper left (once in a while). Feels like bone pain. Pain will last usually from 30seconds to several minutes, then it goes a way or pain does not feel to bad after several minutes. Carrying anything over 20 pounds causes it to hurt a little to hurt some. 3. On the inside on my chest (a couple inches or so inside of chest) on the middle sides (of chest) around the bottom of the lungs or top of liver I get some aching (sometimes its aching and thumping) pain. I am not sure if its muscle pain or what. This pain could last anywhere from a 30 seconds to several minutes to a half hour. Sometimes I get this pain when I sleep on my side. 4. On occasion if feels I might have some calcification on one of my bones--in this area (mentioned above in number 3.) it feels like the bone calcified a little and is poking my muscle and causing a little pain. This happens on occasion and does not last long. 5. A little pain on the front sides of my neck. Usually a 1-2 in pain, sometimes a 3 in pain. The pain usually stays with me most of the day. 6. I get pain once in a while in other parts of my chest. Sometimes about couple inches inside right behind my right pectoral muscle. This pain can last a few minutes to several minutes and then goes away. 7. Once in a while a little pain about a inch below the clavicle bone (by shoulder). It feels like a nerve or muscle pain. This pain could last from a few minutes to several minutes. Note: My LUNGS DO NOT hurt or bother me when I breath. I have GERD (acid reflux). I had doctors and a physical therapist tell me that I have tight tendons/muscles throughout my body. When I touch my chest I DO NOT FEEL TENDERNESS IN THE CHEST AREA. 1.

Always the same never any variation. I sharp stabbing pain through my left eye through my head and out the lower left part of my skull by the neck. Feels like a cold steel spike through my head.  I recently am getting these ""Things"" I don't know what they are. I have lesions on my brain though why is a matter of debate. They are either MS or migraine lesions. Two different neuros two different opinions. But now that aside I am getting these attacks that last 5 days. The first happened October the 8th. Now it starts out as brain pain, I know that brain does not actually feel pain but for lack of a better term that is what I call it. It is very electrical in nature occurring in my hairline and forehead region. It is bilateral not one sided at all and not on the sides. It starts out with pain at a 7. Then over the next 3 days it builds in intensity to a 10. At day 4 and 5 there are surges of pain that are so far off the pain scale that I am literally incapable of thought when they occur. On day 6 it is just completely gone.  Not only does it cause this electrical brain pain but the normal chronic pain I have also ramps up in intensity with it untill it also hits a 10. But it seems to only be the chronic pain along my spine that gets worse leaving my shoulder which has chronic pain alone. So then in November also on the 8th it starts up again. Knowing that I will not survive it a second time I go to the ER and I am admitted. I am given IV steroids at a high dose for MS. Day 2 a new neurologist enters the picture says that he thinks that it is a migraine, and now the steroids are tapered down and toradol is added. Something breaks it on day 3. It just ends and I go home. Now I had never stopped the steroids in the hospital because I was on so much they couldn't just stop. The reason the new neurologist did not think it was MS was because he had never heard of any one who had MS not showing that on a spinal tap. However The National MS Society has stated that some 5-10% of people with MS test negative.   (CSF)  So here is the thing with it being a migraine the pain was electrical not stabbing, I did not have any sort of ""Premonition"", no over sensitivity to light or sound, no vomiting, no after headache and I never passed out from pain. These are all things that occur with my migraines. And it does not seem to fit the definition of stress or cluster headaches. I am not arguing for it being an MS attack, in fact I definitely do not want it to be one. It also does not sound familiar to people with MS, so there is that.  I am waiting to find out how many months I will have to wait until I can see a new neurologist as when I called the Office that I want to go to they were telling me the end of February and I have to have my doctor set it up"

Old flame reached out...,"I’m 32 y/o single male and have been for a few years. I date around a decent amount and have had my fair share of unprotected sex. I try to be smart about the “types” of women I sleep with, but obviously you never know.  About 2 weeks ago I was contacted by someone I was sleeping with last summer but have stayed friendly with here and there since. I suppose she was having a guilty conscious and told me that she was recently diagnosed with HPV when she had her yearly pap smear so she had to have gotten it within the last year. We slept together maybe 4-5 times and the last time was last Sept/Oct. She said it is HPV 16, which is one of the 2 that can turn into cancer and that it has already started changing her cells.  I feel badly for her but also not sure what I am supposed to do with this info. I have been sexually active with multiple partners since and hsven’t noticed anything particularly abnormal, though sometimes I can talk myself into thinking I do. I can’t seem to find much concrete info on this. From what I understand, HPV can come and go from your body. Even if I was exposed to it, theres a chance it didn’t affect me and could be gone? And it seems like only women can be tested for it? Is it possible I could have it and keep passing it to others without ever knowing if I have it? I obviously don’t want to potentially expose anyone if I do have it. And also cancer runs in my family so thats another worry.  The only thing I can think of that may relate to a symptom I’ve seen is within the last few months theres been a few times where i’ve had speech/loss of voice problems, sudden acid reflux, as well as jaw pain/feeling like I’m talking differently. These have been intermittent and I don’t even know if they’re related to each other (speech issues to the jaw pain) or separate issues altogether, as well as allergies.

Mild discomfort urinating, and mild morning erection discomfort. Clear discharge after urinating, and seems not able to empty bladder/leakage. Flare ups seem to occur every 1 to 2 years or seasonally. Do a round of antibiotics it clears up then reoccurs in the 1 to 2 year span.  Have been on majority of antibiotics usually for a 7-14 day period for the past 11 to 12 years. Have been on Azithromycin (the shot and pill form), Doxycycline, and Levofloxacin.  Visited a Urologist was given a scope, everything came back normal and then another round of antibiotics.  Had a white discharge with similar symptoms once in college, all tests came back negative was given antibiotics.  Another odd tidbit, I can't drink Redbull. If I do all the above symptoms come back immediately upon urination and is much more painful. Another incident happened with canned oranges/pear juice. Does anyone have any feedback?

I am a 25 y.o. male and usually wake up with a morning wood and get multiple erections throughout the day. A few days ago, I woke up and my penis was not only flaccid, but had also shrunk considerably. It is maybe a third of its normal flaccid size. It has become very soft and when touching it, it feels 70% numb when compared to normal. I have not had an involuntary erection in almost a week and I am unable to have sex. If I try to masturbate with extreme speed it expands, but only to the normal size of my flaccid penis, not even close to my usual erections. I went to the ER and to a walk-in clinic, where both doctors basically told me to wait a few weeks and said that it might be due to stress. However, I have not been stressed at all lately, quite the contrary. An X-ray of the lower back / pelvis showed no signs of injury. I do not drink or smoke and exercise routinely. My gut feeling is telling me that this is something completely physical, not psychological. My only lead is that I had a lower back pain a few days ago due to moving stuff around the house, but it is now gone. I would be very grateful if anyone has any ideas or suggestions. Thank you very much!"

I've been abandoned by my Dr of 8 years b/c he's afraid to continue the dose I need even though my diseases & intractable pain fall under the new exemption. I've lived with IP for 36.5 of my 47 years. When my IP was properly/adequately managed I worked 12 hrs/day on building several online business, I was social, I practiced Tai Chi, I went fishing, hiking & lived a good life. Now I cannot shower when I need, I cannot cook, clean my home, I cannot study, I cannot work on my Internet Marketing & Advertising business or any of my other ventures, I never see my friends, I cannot take proper care of my diabetic kitty, I can't sleep, I have trouble eating and no longer plan to return to college. I feel utterly useless & hopeless.  I'm a good person. I know opioids alone do not manage pain. I know how to manage my stress, I exercise, eat healthy, pray, have a health support team of family & a few friends, I use heat/ice, Advil, TENS unit, and I take supplements like tumeric, C, B's, E, K, Multi vitamin & more. I practice Tai Chi & keep myself centered.  I've had dozens of surgeries, medical procedures, (failed) injections, barely FDA approved medications & much more.  Since about age 23 I have used high doses of opioids to manage everything from endo, IC, TMJ, TN, Sciatica, herniated disc, arthritis, shingles, postherpetic neuralgia, chronic kidney stones, gallstones, migraines & cluster headaches, degenerative disc disease, moderate scoliosis, interstitial cystitis, urethral diverticulum, & more. Please pardon my spelling.  I've been told I metabolize medication quickly and so between that & years of OT the new (unsubstantiated) ultra low doses aren't effective.  I've lost everything and all I want is my life back. We can debate the ""epidemic"" till our faces are blue but in the end there ARE people like myself that simply require these medications to have a quality life. I have dreams to build, fish to catch & a huge house to clean. Would you please HELP me? I'm a kind and decent person who means no harm to anyone.

I'm 15 (83kg , 1.7m) and have pelving pain while masturbating. I'm going to get into detail about what's happening and I want some advice .  I've started masturbating at a very young age and that resulted in frequent masturbation. Sometimes I masturbate twice / trice a day. About 4 days ago I've noticed a small pain in the right of my pelvis while I was masturbating , the pain was dull but the day after I masturbated twice at an interval of about 4 hours. The second time there little semen and transparent watery liquid which has happened before but with no pain. I've google some stuff and I think that this pain is because I masturbated to frequently and should cut/pause masturbation for around 6 weeks. It doesn't hurt that much and the pain usually occurs when I get and erection and / or I start masturbating , but it goes away half the way to finishing , I've never ejaculated after I felt the pain. I've started masturbating today but didn't finish after thinking of the consequinces , after 10 minutes my right side of the pelvis became a little numb and it hurt a bit, but the pain stopped right after. I'm going to be cutting on masturbating 2-3 times a week now and I'm definetely scared about my future sex life. Got some advice and answears on this question ? Thanks"

I thought it'd go away on its own and that's it was just a weird fluke. But it's not. I went to the doctor and she told me it was a yeast infection, which I'm sure I did have one but I feel like that was its own problem. I've had yeast infections before and never has that made sex so incredibly painful. She gave me a dose of diflucan and that seemed to make everything (itching, dryness, etc.) except for the painful intercourse. I don't know what to think. Should I get another dose of diflucan? Should I wait it out? Anyone who would be able to help? The pain is like a burning, ripping sensation. It's so frustrating. I'm kind of afraid of what it could be."

I went to see a doctor the next day.He did an xray but nothing was wrong. he prescribed me some painkillers and gave me a knee brace to wear and told me I'd be better in five days. A week down the line there was no improvement. I went to see another doctor, he too did an xray after evaluating that my knee was filled with blood. There were no fractures or breaks in my bones but he did discover a bloodclot. He prescribed me pain killers and told me to massage the area with deep heat. He too said I'll be back to normal soon. Its been a week since then, i still cant put any weight on that leg without feeling a sharp pain on the inner side of my left knee. When i bend my leg the back of my knee hurts and the front feels tight. I've been limping and i want to get back to playing sports. Im an 18 year old female. I know something is wrong with me and i feel at this rate my recovery will keep being delayed. any suggestions. i wanted an mri but the doc claimed i dont need one. thank you"

I have always have this discomfort when I'm thinking that I have STD or when I'm at work, So I talk to my friend which she confirm that she is clean, I have always have this same scenario for the past 3 years, the first year is having a one night stand on a girl I met on a party, after a painful urination, when I check up for STDs I came up clean, and I was diagnose for dehydration, after a year I have again a unprotected sex with my girlfriend that time, then after a month I got a painful urination and a always a having a wet tip and small discharge, I check up with the doctor, they took a test and immediately give me a antibiotic for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea, after that we got the results and came up clean, after a week the painful urination and discharge are gone after a month, they put me on a KUB, to check my kidney and find out there is a small stone, they gave me a small medicine to melt the stones down, after that I got a second opinion with a Urologist, we took the test again and came negative in STD, HIV and Kidney Stones, I told the urologist that I have a different style on masturbation that is called ""Traumatic Masturbation Syndrome"" which started since I was young. I stop doing it and do the normal masturbation. I got broke up with my girlfriend, and start dating a new one after a year, we have a unprotected sex and after that i got this discomfort in my penis, and started to go to the doctor again, got the results again and shows negative on any STDs, the urologist told me it's on my mind, when I talked this to the girl I started to date, she got mad when I told her to take a STD test, she stop dating when she showed a results that she was clean. After a year here I go again, I don't know if this is on my mind or do I have a STD or something, a have discomfort in my penis, I always felt it when I'm thinking that I have STD, and also when I'm at work, but I don't feel it when I'm on a 3 day out of town vacation, a marriage ceremony of my friend and when I'm at home. I also think that their is a changes on my peeing stream. I tried to trim my pubic hair thinking that it may cause the discomfort, I also change from brief to boxes thinking that it may be the cause. What do you think this is? Do you think I have STD? If go to a doctor to check up again it will be a fourth year, I'm getting frustrated"

Frequent Urination, Penile Retraction, Rare Sharp Urethra Sensation when Urinating, Rare Hard to Describe Pains","So this has been an issue that hae plagued me for over half of my life and has resulted in terrible depression and a very poorvmental state. I beg of anyone to please take the time to read this post in its entirety and give advice or get it from an expert that could help. I'm currently a 24 year old Male. Around the age of 12-13, I was masturbating and tried to urinate in the middle of the process. I don't know why I did this at the time, I just remember do this. I was pushing out very hard in order to force urine through the erection. I looked down and saw a little blood come out. I stopped immediately. The next time I tried to masturbate, I felt a very sharp pain upon ejaculation. Ever since that moment, I started having the urge to urinate more frequently and I was always able to with ease. I also noticed that a small brown dot formed on the head if my penis. It's so difficult to explain what it felt like but it was almost as if my bladder wouldn't even hold urine, and that the urine would just go straight to my penis. My penis was also always going into a retracted state when I had to urinate or make a bowel movement. I also noticed I had this new ability to just keep pushing small amounts of urine out, which mainly occurred during bowel movements as I was already sitting on the toilet. Continuously doing this would greatly flare up my urethra and make it feel as if I needed to urinate even If i had already gone. It wasn't that bad at first so I didn't even realize anything was wrong. Through the years of puberty, my penis would on rare occasions go through periods of throbbing, specifically in the urethra area and almost always at night before bed. My penis also never really grew much during these time and it seems as if it's the same size as when the incident happened. As the years went by, the frequency of my urination got worse and worse and I was kind of living in denile because I was afraid to ask someone about it or go to a doctor to talk about my issues ""down there."" My freshman year of college, I was probably 18 or 19 and I finally got the courage up to say something to my mom. I thought at the time ""Oh I must have a UTI"" after doing a few minutes worth of research, so I ended up going to my family doctor and tested perfectly healthy. My family doctor ended up referring me to my first urologist. The urologist did a bladder ultrasound to see if I had any urine remaining in my bladder after urinating for him and he saw none. He figured I had some type of overactive bladder and put me on a medication for overactive bladder with directions to come back within a month. Well the overactive bladder pills did absolutely nothing for me and I ended up not returning because I was just so afraid of talking to someone about this issue. Fast forward about 5 years and I'm in my final year of college. My mental health is in peak decline. I'd been afraid to approach woman my entire life at this point due to my issues down there. It's also worth noting that the frequency of urination was at a point where I would ejaculate urine during periods of masturbation. This is one of the biggest issues I have with this main issue as it makes sexual intercourse a very awkward experience if I'm ejaculating urine from having to pee so badly after having just urinated 10 minutes ago... So I decided to try another urologist. This is where things go serious. Ended up getting a penile/bladder scope. It was a brutal procedure, I thought there's no way it could ever get worse than that. The nurse had to hold me down. This is where I thought for sure they would find something wrong, only to my mortification, it looked perfectly fine. I ended up getting put on another couple overactive bladder pills for month long periods all to no avail. Finally, they decided to do Urodynamics on me where they fill up my bladder and monitor the release. I was wrong about how it couldn't get any worse. I still have PTSD of sorts after getting the urodynamics done to me. Holy heck, that was brutal. I remember my urethra getting so flared up that I had to pee within 5 minutes and it was super hard to urinate in the position they had me sitting. I was sitting as I had almost passed out from the process of having the line pushed up into my bladder. The urologist determined from the results that I should have incisions made to my bladder neck which is typically only done to older men (I'm only 24). This procedure would prohibit me from ejaculating and greatly complicate the rest iprocedure. I have no desire to live life like that as a Male. I ended up going to a 2nd urologist in down in Columbus, OH and he was very surprised by hearing that this other urologist wanted to make bladder neck incisions due to the fact that I'm fairly young. This new Columbus urologist ended up putting me on a couple more overactive bladder medications that did nothing. He seemed really confused and ended up setting me up with a Pelvic Floor Therapist before deciding on moving forward with any procedure. It's now worth noting that none of these urologists spent much time at all drilling me with questions about what was wrong and none of them were very personable at all. The Pelvic Floor Therapist that I'm currently seeing was totally different. She spent the first session asking me a million different questions for nearly 2 hours which made me feel like she really cared. She also has me filling out bladder diaries (daily charts showing exactly when I'm peeing) which I was very surprised that the urologists had never done before. The therapy involved her trying to loosen up and relax certain muscles in the pelvic floor area. Unfortunately, it doesn't really seem to be working much. I talked with her about how frequent pushing out of urine, which mainly happens during bowel movements (I can just continuously push out small amounts of urine), really irritates my urethra and makes it feel as if I need to keep going. So part of the therapy also involved me trying to let any urine come out naturally without ever using the muscles to push out unless necessary. Doing this allowed for me to lengthen some of the time between urination and it also allowed for me to not need to ejaculate any urine during masturbation (up until about 15 min or a little before which still isnt 100% optimal). The current therapy is to try and hold my urine in and just increase the times between urinating in order to get my body and mind used to not peeing as often while is somewhat difficult after years of just going as much as I felt I needed to. I truly feel as if something is internally damaged although I'm not at all positive. I'm just really confused. I dont want to live life with any type of major procedure that wouldnt allow me to properly ejaculate semen anymore. I didn't think the urology field would be littered with so much uncertainty as well so that adds to the paranoia of nobody ever being able to tell me what's wrong or pinpoint something. If anybody has any advice or knowledge that I could pass onto my therapist or urologist, it would be life saving at this point."

Frequent Urination, Penile Retraction, Rare Sharp Urethra Sensation when Urinating, Rare Hard to Describe Pains","So this has been an issue that hae plagued me for over half of my life and has resulted in terrible depression and a very poorvmental state. I beg of anyone to please take the time to read this post in its entirety and give advice or get it from an expert that could help. I'm currently a 24 year old Male. Around the age of 12-13, I was masturbating and tried to urinate in the middle of the process. I don't know why I did this at the time, I just remember do this. I was pushing out very hard in order to force urine through the erection. I looked down and saw a little blood come out. I stopped immediately. The next time I tried to masturbate, I felt a very sharp pain upon ejaculation. Ever since that moment, I started having the urge to urinate more frequently and I was always able to with ease. I also noticed that a small brown dot formed on the head if my penis. It's so difficult to explain what it felt like but it was almost as if my bladder wouldn't even hold urine, and that the urine would just go straight to my penis. My penis was also always going into a retracted state when I had to urinate or make a bowel movement. I also noticed I had this new ability to just keep pushing small amounts of urine out, which mainly occurred during bowel movements as I was already sitting on the toilet. Continuously doing this would greatly flare up my urethra and make it feel as if I needed to urinate even If i had already gone. It wasn't that bad at first so I didn't even realize anything was wrong. Through the years of puberty, my penis would on rare occasions go through periods of throbbing, specifically in the urethra area and almost always at night before bed. My penis also never really grew much during these time and it seems as if it's the same size as when the incident happened. As the years went by, the frequency of my urination got worse and worse and I was kind of living in denile because I was afraid to ask someone about it or go to a doctor to talk about my issues ""down there."" My freshman year of college, I was probably 18 or 19 and I finally got the courage up to say something to my mom. I thought at the time ""Oh I must have a UTI"" after doing a few minutes worth of research, so I ended up going to my family doctor and tested perfectly healthy. My family doctor ended up referring me to my first urologist. The urologist did a bladder ultrasound to see if I had any urine remaining in my bladder after urinating for him and he saw none. He figured I had some type of overactive bladder and put me on a medication for overactive bladder with directions to come back within a month. Well the overactive bladder pills did absolutely nothing for me and I ended up not returning because I was just so afraid of talking to someone about this issue. Fast forward about 5 years and I'm in my final year of college. My mental health is in peak decline. I'd been afraid to approach woman my entire life at this point due to my issues down there. It's also worth noting that the frequency of urination was at a point where I would ejaculate urine during periods of masturbation. This is one of the biggest issues I have with this main issue as it makes sexual intercourse a very awkward experience if I'm ejaculating urine from having to pee so badly after having just urinated 10 minutes ago... So I decided to try another urologist. This is where things go serious. Ended up getting a penile/bladder scope. It was a brutal procedure, I thought there's no way it could ever get worse than that. The nurse had to hold me down. This is where I thought for sure they would find something wrong, only to my mortification, it looked perfectly fine. I ended up getting put on another couple overactive bladder pills for month long periods all to no avail. Finally, they decided to do Urodynamics on me where they fill up my bladder and monitor the release. I was wrong about how it couldn't get any worse. I still have PTSD of sorts after getting the urodynamics done to me. Holy heck, that was brutal. I remember my urethra getting so flared up that I had to pee within 5 minutes and it was super hard to urinate in the position they had me sitting. I was sitting as I had almost passed out from the process of having the line pushed up into my bladder. The urologist determined from the results that I should have incisions made to my bladder neck which is typically only done to older men (I'm only 24). This procedure would prohibit me from ejaculating and greatly complicate the rest iprocedure. I have no desire to live life like that as a Male. I ended up going to a 2nd urologist in down in Columbus, OH and he was very surprised by hearing that this other urologist wanted to make bladder neck incisions due to the fact that I'm fairly young. This new Columbus urologist ended up putting me on a couple more overactive bladder medications that did nothing. He seemed really confused and ended up setting me up with a Pelvic Floor Therapist before deciding on moving forward with any procedure. It's now worth noting that none of these urologists spent much time at all drilling me with questions about what was wrong and none of them were very personable at all. The Pelvic Floor Therapist that I'm currently seeing was totally different. She spent the first session asking me a million different questions for nearly 2 hours which made me feel like she really cared. She also has me filling out bladder diaries (daily charts showing exactly when I'm peeing) which I was very surprised that the urologists had never done before. The therapy involved her trying to loosen up and relax certain muscles in the pelvic floor area. Unfortunately, it doesn't really seem to be working much. I talked with her about how frequent pushing out of urine, which mainly happens during bowel movements (I can just continuously push out small amounts of urine), really irritates my urethra and makes it feel as if I need to keep going. So part of the therapy also involved me trying to let any urine come out naturally without ever using the muscles to push out unless necessary. Doing this allowed for me to lengthen some of the time between urination and it also allowed for me to not need to ejaculate any urine during masturbation (up until about 15 min or a little before which still isnt 100% optimal). The current therapy is to try and hold my urine in and just increase the times between urinating in order to get my body and mind used to not peeing as often while is somewhat difficult after years of just going as much as I felt I needed to. I truly feel as if something is internally damaged although I'm not at all positive. I'm just really confused. I dont want to live life with any type of major procedure that wouldnt allow me to properly ejaculate semen anymore. I didn't think the urology field would be littered with so much uncertainty as well so that adds to the paranoia of nobody ever being able to tell me what's wrong or pinpoint something. If anybody has any advice or knowledge that I could pass onto my therapist or urologist, it would be life saving at this point."

In fact, stress is one of those issues that not only can affect your sex life but also be alleviated by having sex. So if you want to get rid of stress and improve sexual performance, why don’t you just go have sex? The effects of stress are gradual. It damages on your physical, emotional and relationship health, probably more than you realize.  Here are five reasons stress impacts your sex life:  1.	Stress contributes to lowering our Self-Image. If we don’t like our bodies, it is pretty difficult to find the desire to shed your clothes and be into bed with your partner. Not suggesting that you should just get it over with and improve sexual performance, but it’s a vicious cycle. Lower self-image equals less sex and less sex always creates relationship problems. Our relationship should enhance who we are and not make us feel more stressed. 2.	Stress takes a toll on our Sexual Desire. Hormones affect our bodies in numerous ways from childhood to adolescence, pregnancy, and menopause and beyond. Cortisol is one of the hormones produced by stress. Our bodies need this hormone, but in small doses for short bursts of time. If levels of Cortisol are elevated for a prolonged period of time, they suppress our sex hormones. Lower quantity of sex hormones equals lower sexual desire. There are ways to improve sexual performance for me. 3.	Stress impacts our menstrual cycle and our fertility.  Stress can impact our pituitary gland, which controls the thyroid, adrenal glands, and ovaries. If ovaries aren’t functioning properly, your menstrual cycle is affected adversely. Periods may become irregular or we may even stop menstruating. If you are trying to get pregnant, you need to decrease your stress; which can be difficult, because there are few things more stressful than trying to become pregnant and not being able to do so.  4.	Stress makes us question our relationships and partners. We all have stressful experiences from time to time because stress can come from so many things; Finances, Family pressures, Work, and Relationships. It can make us argumentative and prone to lashing out - ready to lose our temper at everything and anything. Or it may cause us to do both of these things - swing between different moods at different times. Relationships suffer when we are stressed, especially if we stop communicating; or if our communication only consists of rolling our eyes and grunting or shouting at a loved one.  5.	Stress can lead to excessive drinking. It’s not a surprise that lots of people use alcohol to break-out of any situation. This isn’t about a single glass of wine, a bottle of beer or a drink with one of that cocktail with hot pink umbrellas in them. This is about excessive, prolonged and regular drinking. Men may face difficulty getting an erection when they drink too much. But, what about women? As it turns out, alcohol can dull your sex life, making it less pleasurable. Alcohol dehydrates us, making lubrication challenging. Without lubrication, sex is painful. So it’s time, to transform your life. Start an exercise, relax, take a bath, drink one glass of wine (not four), masturbate, make out with your partner and delegate some responsibilities to others. It will improve sexual performance and lower your stress and hopefully, make it a lot more enjoyable."

I went to the ER and said I tore my lis franc and I was to see a specialist. The specialist said I need surgery because it's a 50/50 chance that it could heal on its own. We got a second opinion and he said that it didn't seem bad enough to do surgery. We waited about 5 weeks and there was hardly an pain. We decided not to do the surgery since everything seemed fine. Haven't had any pain over the summer until fall soccer approached. Now I'm having pain in the same area. I've been icing it to help with the pain. Should I go back to have it examined again? The season is only 2 more weeks but I'm concerned for spring soccer. And If I get the surgery will I be able to play?

I have no feeling in my second & third fingers of that hand. I had P.T. for a year to help regain sensation & movement of the hand. It is still limited. Then about 3 months after the P.T. was terminated, I developed a rash on my back. Nothing seems to heal the rash, and it itches terribly. The itchiness can be on different parts of my body at times. This has gone on for over a year now. I have seen my internist, dermatologist, and gastroenterologist, and I still itch. I have taken steroid creams, prednisone, an immune suppressant drug to no avail. I have had skin biopsies & blood allergy tests. (negative) I have had sonograms of my gall bladder, liver biopsy, & an MRI with negative results. I am now taking methotrexate and still have the rash & itch. Can this be a result of the nerve damage with the carpal tunnel surgery?"

I have severe gulf war illnesses and lost my colon with other internal body parts are rotting away. Back in 2000 I was given Prednisone approx. 1200mg/day for about six months. Due to this, I have developed Avascular Necrosis of my right hip. Latest bone density scan says that it is severe, but I already have been feeling this since on or about May, 2003. I was then put on morphine (the pills that disolved under the tongue), it made me really nauseated. As did long acting morphine and methadone. They, the VA, put me on Fentanyl and was on such a high dose that they could never transition me to another drug, not sure if a drug other than Fentanyl is available. I had Ulcerative Colitis and with colon removed, I also have Crohn’s Disease, but in remission for about six years. Was on trials for Remicade/Infliximab and continued with that from civilian infusion centers to the VA every six weeks. After the four abdomen procedures that I have had, I developed over 50 hernias in my gut area. Hernia surgeon in Seattle, said that repair surgery would 50/50% put me in a long term nursing facility for the rest of my life. All of these problems can NOT be determined as to a cause and that is frustrating as hell to me, why or what happened to me.  This May, 2017, I was diagnosed with a 40% compression fracture of my T12 vertebrae. At the time of the break, I had been on 150mcg of Fentanyl since about 2010, for the AVN mind you. In the hospital the doctors said that it would be good for me to get off of the fentanyl. After discharge I weened myself off of Fentanyl completely. Did it waaaaaay to fast and had excruciating withdrawls. I plugged along doing physical therapy for the back. In doing the exercises I aggravated my hip and had to go back on the Fentanyl. At the same time I got a new doc at the VA. Now the reason for my post. Sorry for the length but a little background on my issues, I feel would be ok to relay. Oh, had three ACL procedures while on active duty in the Army on left knee. When i had the last surgery my body was rejecting the screws and such. They now say that I will reject any hip procedure...this is why I am on Fentanyl. Want to have something done, but do not want to have complications from it.  Question is...in a roundabout way.... I was on massive dose of Fentanyl and am on Oxycodone for the horrible hernia pain. New doc put me on 12mcg and we had a standing agreement that we would go up to a level that I would get some pain relief. From 150mcg - two months off of Fentanyl and on 12mcg....needless to say when that week was over and still doing physical therapy, I had to go up in dosage. She sent me 25mcg. i still was sucking pond water and last week went to appointment but they had cancelled it that morning. Her nurse, new btw as well, didn’t relay to the doc that the 25mcg patches were not working and as we agreed I would go to the 50mcg. Which is where as a max, i would really like to stop.   So, I get home and when the 72hours were up, I put on two of the 25mcg patches on. I have been trying to scale back on The Oxycodone to get a little more life out of my liver, i know that is going to bite me on the ass sooner or later. Two days ago I had my annual urinalysis for the pain clinic, but ordered by my new doc. She got on me as to why my patches are going to be gone about five days earlier than she planned...I told her that I spoke to the nurse as you had cancelled my appointment with you last week. All would have been good go go, if my *** would have been straightened out through the nurse! Doc called today and told me that I showed up as a negative on my piss test...I was like WTF!!! Never heard of catching *** for negative. She said I am probably selling them... I was like..so, I went through the withdrawls, decreased my intake of Oxycodone and I am now selling the 12mcg and new dose 25mcg!!! I said, if I am selling them now, then why wouldn’t I have sold the 100mcg’s and 50mcg patches??   How am I showing up negative for both Oxycodone and Fentanyl? I read that since I have done a complete diet change and whatnot, juicing everyday and the minuscule dose might not be metabolizing correctly? Pain clinic doc and pharmacy tech can’t figure it out either but for past 14 years and five pain clinics, never a problem. Any thoughts...? the doc said that for me, and my history and illnesses, that she sent it (urine) to another lab for secondary screening. What is possibly going on here?   Please offer advice as I am really wondering and freaking out...is something wrong with me and urine test is messing up or what?

I hope it's because the surgery was only four months ago and because of my age (61) that it's taking a little longer to heal. Once this is gone I will be like a new person.

I'm originally from the UK, where codeine pain meds are available without a prescription over the counter. My girlfriend is putting a lot of pressure on me to have someone back home post out codeine meds for her. I am very uncomfortable about doing this because 1) I dont think its legal and 2) I think it can't be good for her to be on codeine. She is getting mad that I'm hesitant, saying that she doesn't 'binge' on the pills and only takes them when her pain is bad to help her function but I still have reservations.

I’m only 22 (my birthday was yesterday actually) & when me and my fiancé try to be intimate I’m left feeling inadequate because even when I’m very turned on I’m still dry. I’ve been told many things like my depression is the culprit but I’ve been depressed practically my whole life & trust me when I say that NEVER got in the way of my sexual desires. We try lube but I’m very delicate, lube gives me yeast infections it does not matter if it’s proper lube. My GYN doesn’t really show any concern, & when I do have sex it ends up being painful. I wanted to know is there anything I can do to fix this? Or do I just have to deal with it."

She investigates surgery, injections, (and in many cases their lack of effectiveness) and finds some ""back whisperers"" in the country who think ""outside the box"" and prescribe some moves and exercises that help without surgery and shots. One of those thinkers has written a book for lay people. called ""Back Mechanics"", by Stuart McGill. He is in Ontario. Both books are available via Amazon.

I had the injection and got up off of the table and was immediately pain free for the past 7 years. Fast forward to March of this year when my worst nightmare happened and the pain came back. My pain always presents itself in the left leg from hip to ankle. I tried PT and then MRI revealed same situation, herniation and bulging on multiple levels.

So in the past he has always just taken Alieve to make it bareable. He is currently on new Depression / Bipolar medication (Lithiun) that he MUST take, and this medication can NOT be mixed with NSAID.

I make sure to drink enough water before bed (to the point where I sometimes need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night). And I try to eat a little something before going to sleep. Something strange I did notice is sometimes, right before I fall asleep, I feel as if I'm STARVING. I eat dinner pretty late, but it feels as if I didn't eat anything at all.  I also wanted to note that I am on a medication of 125mg of Lamictal (which I take at night) for anxiety problems. However, I think it's highly unlikely this is the main cause of my problem because the pain only occurs after I've fallen asleep. I was up through the night a few times over the summer and I didn't feel any headaches whatsoever. I've tried different positions to sleep in, as well, but nothing seems to work.  I truly do not know what I can be experiencing here. None of these symptoms occur during the day which is why I'm so confused. I plan on seeing a doctor soon, but I was wondering if anyone else ever had this problem."

It is usually worse when lying on my back or on my affected side (usually the right). When I have the pain it is really bad and keeps me up tossing and turning all night since I cannot get comfortable. Also, do to me trying to stay off the affected side, it usually then causes my other hip to become painful from constantly being on that one. This has been a chronic problem that I have had on and off for multiple years. I had an MRI done about a year ago, but was not currently in a flare-up at the time.

I'm at my wits end! I don't know what to do, I'm only a 19 year old female. Any advice or comments, suggestions, inferences or hypotheses as to what could possibly be going on with me would greatly appreciated. (writing this with shaky hands), here's a little in sight of what's been going on/ when it started and the symptoms i've been experiencing. I've wrote down the dates from day 1 to present (which might be a little off) *Prior to the first date i've listed below, I was experiencing other symptoms over the course of a month but gradually. Fatigue, feeling like I was in a fog most of the time, trouble remembering things, concentrating, just didn't feel all there. I noticed my right eye felt as if it wasn't as strong as my right one (blurriness). My right ear also felt plugged all the time followed by a pain on the right side of my face that was connected from my ear to my jaw that lasted a little more than a month but has now subsided. Things such as clumsiness, tingling in my hands and feet and weakness were also experienced. *May 27th 2017* Was when I first went to the ER for an excruciating headache, I was given an IV + headache medication, I felt this feeling of general discomfort throughout my body as the medication was going through the IV to my arm (have not felt the same since, it was like an irritable feeling that I still sometimes experience.) A few days after that I began to feel very shaky and just not okay. Was still having problems with my right eye, was also continuing to suffer from the intense headache listed above but it was now causing a burning sensation in different areas of my head and the back of my neck. This headache and feeling of pressure/ burning sensations continued on for about a week or so.  *June 3rd* was STILL experiencing this same headache/pressure and burning sensation, so I went back to the ER. After waiting for 4hrs+ at the ER just to see the doctor, he examined me and didn’t think anything too serious of the headache suggesting a possible sinus infection. I told him I didn’t think it was just a sinus infection after mentioning a history of brain tumour in my family, I asked for a CT scan of my head just to make sure. Hesitant to give me the CT scan because of his doubt that there was anything seriously wrong (such as a brain tumor) he prescribed me sinus infection medication and sent me on my way. *June 7th Went back to the ER with the same severe persistent headache and burning sensations throughout my head and neck along with a few new symptoms that presented themselves such as weakness as well as a burning sensation on the top of my legs. I was seen by a different doctor this time, who thought a CT scan was in my best interest. I agreed to the CT scan of the brain which came back as in fact sinus inflammation in the brain. I was given RAN- CLARITHROMYCIN 500MG & PMS-DEXAMETHASONE 4 MG. Although a sinus infection was the only thing to come of the CT scan, the symptoms I had been experiencing and explained to the doctor earlier ex. burning in my neck and head, trouble with my right eye, intense migraines, clumsiness, cognitive issues (poor memory, unable to concentrate) ""brain fog"", muscle weakness, suggested him to believe it could be something more, he mentioned a possibility of MS and told me he was going to order an MRI of my brain to rule it out.  *After taking the medication for the sinus infection the headaches did stop*. From June 7th - 16th awaiting the MRI of my brain the doctor from the ER had ordered I was very stressed and depressed about thinking MS was what was causing all these symptoms. I was under extreme amounts of stress. At this time I started noticing the fatigue becoming worse where I would just have to lay down due to feeling very weak and physically exhausted. Also at this time I noticed I was having sleep troubles. I would have a hard time falling asleep even to just nap even though my body was so tired, my brain would just not allow me to sleep. At night time especially I would also have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep as I would wake up every couple hours. I also noticed I'd developed a slight tremor in my right hand/arm whenever I would lay down. The tremor was not as noticeable to the naked eye as it was within my body, it would keep me awake as well due to just being uncomfortable. Within the next two weeks of experiencing these symptoms I also noticed a decrease in my weight. I lost a total of 14 pounds unintentionally, but possibly due to extreme stress.  *June 17th I had the MRI of my head. The tremor in my hand/arm got slightly worse as you could now see a slight shake with the naked eye, I also noticed my legs would twitch while laying down and feel as if they had a slight vibration to them coming from the inside. *June 19th exhausted from only getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night accompanied by the weakness in my body and tremor, I also noticed an irritable feeling in my upper back from time to time making it very uncomfortable to lay down or to sit for long periods. It felt almost as if I had restless back syndrome that persisted throughout the day and the night. Sometimes this feeling would go into my arms, as well as the burning sensations on the top of my legs continuing to persist. *June 22 Was my appointment with the neurologist to discuss my prior MRI scan of my brain to see if MS was the reason behind these symptoms or not. I and was told by the neurologist my brain scan was clear having no lesions, and that MS was ruled out. After explaining to the neurologist my still existing symptoms they did a physical neurological exam confirming it was still not MS. They then suggested an anti anxiety medication. I had an appointment with my family doctor that following day, and explained the persisting symptoms I was still having. My doctor also related it back to anxiety and prescribed me with an antidepressant/anti anxiety medication which I have not taken because I do not agree that these symptoms are from anxiety. As well as ordering more blood work, checking levels, deficiencies and ruling out any other scary things such as Lymes, Lupus, RA, & crohn's disease. *All blood work has came back normal, and negative for any autoimmune/rheumatic diseases*.  A few weeks later with still no answers and the same persisting symptoms, along with some new ones that are becoming quite concerning. I’m now experiencing widespread pain throughout my body. These pains come and go hitting my body in different areas giving me extreme muscle pain mainly in my back, forearms, shoulders, hips, knees and buttocks. The pain intensifies in different areas, the other day I woke up with my upper back aching for hours and then it would move down to my lower back. Then the next day my back wouldn't hurt any more but my left forearm would be in excruciating muscle pain as if I'd just exercised heavily the day before (which I did not). Other extremities such as my ankles, hands, feet, toes and fingers would just ache,pain and almost feel like little electric shocks(mainly in fingers and toes), throughout the day accompanied by the burning sensation. I am still not able to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night. I’ve woken up overheating and sweating, not being able to swallow. A rash that appeared out of nowhere on my neck (went away after an hour) along with a very flushed face. Restless back and leg pain (in the day and at night). At this point I just don’t know what to do!!

Sometimes this feeling would go into my arms, as well as the burning sensations on the top of my legs continuing to persist. *June 22 Was my appointment with the neurologist to discuss my prior MRI scan of my brain to see if MS was the reason behind these symptoms or not.

After explaining to the neurologist my still existing symptoms they did a physical neurological exam confirming it was still not MS. They then suggested an anti anxiety medication. I had an appointment with my family doctor that following day, and explained the persisting symptoms I was still having. My doctor also related it back to anxiety and prescribed me with an antidepressant/anti anxiety medication which I have not taken because I do not agree that these symptoms are from anxiety. As well as ordering more blood work, checking levels, deficiencies and ruling out any other scary things such as Lymes, Lupus, RA, & crohn's disease. *All blood work has came back normal, and negative for any autoimmune/rheumatic diseases*.  A few weeks later with still no answers and the same persisting symptoms, along with some new ones that are becoming quite concerning. I’m now experiencing widespread pain throughout my body. These pains come and go hitting my body in different areas giving me extreme muscle pain mainly in my back, forearms, shoulders, hips, knees and buttocks. The pain intensifies in different areas, the other day I woke up with my upper back aching for hours and then it would move down to my lower back. Then the next day my back wouldn't hurt any more but my left forearm would be in excruciating muscle pain as if I'd just exercised heavily the day before (which I did not). Other extremities such as my ankles, hands, feet, toes and fingers would just ache,pain and almost feel like little electric shocks(mainly in fingers and toes), throughout the day accompanied by the burning sensation.

I'm at my wits end! I don't know what to do, I'm only a 19 year old female. Any advice or comments, suggestions, inferences or hypotheses as to what could possibly be going on with me would greatly appreciated. (writing this with shaky hands), here's a little in sight of what's been going on/ when it started and the symptoms i've been experiencing. I've wrote down the dates from day 1 to present (which might be a little off) *Prior to the first date i've listed below, I was experiencing other symptoms over the course of a month but gradually. Fatigue, feeling like I was in a fog most of the time, trouble remembering things, concentrating, just didn't feel all there. I noticed my right eye felt as if it wasn't as strong as my right one (blurriness). My right ear also felt plugged all the time followed by a pain on the right side of my face that was connected from my ear to my jaw that lasted a little more than a month but has now subsided. Things such as clumsiness, tingling in my hands and feet and weakness were also experienced. *May 27th 2017* Was when I first went to the ER for an excruciating headache, I was given an IV + headache medication, I felt this feeling of general discomfort throughout my body as the medication was going through the IV to my arm (have not felt the same since, it was like an irritable feeling that I still sometimes experience.) A few days after that I began to feel very shaky and just not okay. Was still having problems with my right eye, was also continuing to suffer from the intense headache listed above but it was now causing a burning sensation in different areas of my head and the back of my neck. This headache and feeling of pressure/ burning sensations continued on for about a week or so.  *June 3rd* was STILL experiencing this same headache/pressure and burning sensation, so I went back to the ER. After waiting for 4hrs+ at the ER just to see the doctor, he examined me and didn’t think anything too serious of the headache suggesting a possible sinus infection. I told him I didn’t think it was just a sinus infection after mentioning a history of brain tumour in my family, I asked for a CT scan of my head just to make sure. Hesitant to give me the CT scan because of his doubt that there was anything seriously wrong (such as a brain tumor) he prescribed me sinus infection medication and sent me on my way. *June 7th Went back to the ER with the same severe persistent headache and burning sensations throughout my head and neck along with a few new symptoms that presented themselves such as weakness as well as a burning sensation on the top of my legs. I was seen by a different doctor this time, who thought a CT scan was in my best interest. I agreed to the CT scan of the brain which came back as in fact sinus inflammation in the brain. I was given RAN- CLARITHROMYCIN 500MG & PMS-DEXAMETHASONE 4 MG. Although a sinus infection was the only thing to come of the CT scan, the symptoms I had been experiencing and explained to the doctor earlier ex. burning in my neck and head, trouble with my right eye, intense migraines, clumsiness, cognitive issues (poor memory, unable to concentrate) ""brain fog"", muscle weakness, suggested him to believe it could be something more, he mentioned a possibility of MS and told me he was going to order an MRI of my brain to rule it out.  *After taking the medication for the sinus infection the headaches did stop*. From June 7th - 16th awaiting the MRI of my brain the doctor from the ER had ordered I was very stressed and depressed about thinking MS was what was causing all these symptoms. I was under extreme amounts of stress. At this time I started noticing the fatigue becoming worse where I would just have to lay down due to feeling very weak and physically exhausted. Also at this time I noticed I was having sleep troubles. I would have a hard time falling asleep even to just nap even though my body was so tired, my brain would just not allow me to sleep. At night time especially I would also have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep as I would wake up every couple hours. I also noticed I'd developed a slight tremor in my right hand/arm whenever I would lay down. The tremor was not as noticeable to the naked eye as it was within my body, it would keep me awake as well due to just being uncomfortable. Within the next two weeks of experiencing these symptoms I also noticed a decrease in my weight. I lost a total of 14 pounds unintentionally, but possibly due to extreme stress.  *June 17th I had the MRI of my head. The tremor in my hand/arm got slightly worse as you could now see a slight shake with the naked eye, I also noticed my legs would twitch while laying down and feel as if they had a slight vibration to them coming from the inside. *June 19th exhausted from only getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night accompanied by the weakness in my body and tremor, I also noticed an irritable feeling in my upper back from time to time making it very uncomfortable to lay down or to sit for long periods.

Hesitant to give me the CT scan because of his doubt that there was anything seriously wrong (such as a brain tumor) he prescribed me sinus infection medication and sent me on my way. *June 7th Went back to the ER with the same severe persistent headache and burning sensations throughout my head and neck along with a few new symptoms that presented themselves such as weakness as well as a burning sensation on the top of my legs. I was seen by a different doctor this time, who thought a CT scan was in my best interest. I agreed to the CT scan of the brain which came back as in fact sinus inflammation in the brain. I was given RAN- CLARITHROMYCIN 500MG & PMS-DEXAMETHASONE 4 MG. Although a sinus infection was the only thing to come of the CT scan, the symptoms I had been experiencing and explained to the doctor earlier ex. burning in my neck and head, trouble with my right eye, intense migraines, clumsiness, cognitive issues (poor memory, unable to concentrate) ""brain fog"", muscle weakness, suggested him to believe it could be something more, he mentioned a possibility of MS and told me he was going to order an MRI of my brain to rule it out.  *After taking the medication for the sinus infection the headaches did stop*. From June 7th - 16th awaiting the MRI of my brain the doctor from the ER had ordered I was very stressed and depressed about thinking MS was what was causing all these symptoms. I was under extreme amounts of stress. At this time I started noticing the fatigue becoming worse where I would just have to lay down due to feeling very weak and physically exhausted. Also at this time I noticed I was having sleep troubles. I would have a hard time falling asleep even to just nap even though my body was so tired, my brain would just not allow me to sleep. At night time especially I would also have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep as I would wake up every couple hours. I also noticed I'd developed a slight tremor in my right hand/arm whenever I would lay down. The tremor was not as noticeable to the naked eye as it was within my body, it would keep me awake as well due to just being uncomfortable. Within the next two weeks of experiencing these symptoms I also noticed a decrease in my weight. I lost a total of 14 pounds unintentionally, but possibly due to extreme stress.  *June 17th I had the MRI of my head. The tremor in my hand/arm got slightly worse as you could now see a slight shake with the naked eye, I also noticed my legs would twitch while laying down and feel as if they had a slight vibration to them coming from the inside. *June 19th exhausted from only getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night accompanied by the weakness in my body and tremor, I also noticed an irritable feeling in my upper back from time to time making it very uncomfortable to lay down or to sit for long periods. It felt almost as if I had restless back syndrome that persisted throughout the day and the night. Sometimes this feeling would go into my arms, as well as the burning sensations on the top of my legs continuing to persist. *June 22 Was my appointment with the neurologist to discuss my prior MRI scan of my brain to see if MS was the reason behind these symptoms or not. I and was told by the neurologist my brain scan was clear having no lesions, and that MS was ruled out. After explaining to the neurologist my still existing symptoms they did a physical neurological exam confirming it was still not MS. They then suggested an anti anxiety medication. I had an appointment with my family doctor that following day, and explained the persisting symptoms I was still having. My doctor also related it back to anxiety and prescribed me with an antidepressant/anti anxiety medication which I have not taken because I do not agree that these symptoms are from anxiety. As well as ordering more blood work, checking levels, deficiencies and ruling out any other scary things such as Lymes, Lupus, RA, & crohn's disease. *All blood work has came back normal, and negative for any autoimmune/rheumatic diseases*.  A few weeks later with still no answers and the same persisting symptoms, along with some new ones that are becoming quite concerning. I’m now experiencing widespread pain throughout my body. These pains come and go hitting my body in different areas giving me extreme muscle pain mainly in my back, forearms, shoulders, hips, knees and buttocks. The pain intensifies in different areas, the other day I woke up with my upper back aching for hours and then it would move down to my lower back. Then the next day my back wouldn't hurt any more but my left forearm would be in excruciating muscle pain as if I'd just exercised heavily the day before (which I did not). Other extremities such as my ankles, hands, feet, toes and fingers would just ache,pain and almost feel like little electric shocks(mainly in fingers and toes), throughout the day accompanied by the burning sensation. I am still not able to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night. I’ve woken up overheating and sweating, not being able to swallow. A rash that appeared out of nowhere on my neck (went away after an hour) along with a very flushed face. Restless back and leg pain (in the day and at night). At this point I just don’t know what to do!! I’m out of answers, very frustrated and in pain :( if anyone has anything similar experiences that followed by a diagnoses or any idea of what this may be let me know!!"

I'm at my wits end! I don't know what to do, I'm only a 19 year old female. Any advice or comments, suggestions, inferences or hypotheses as to what could possibly be going on with me would greatly appreciated. (writing this with shaky hands), here's a little in sight of what's been going on/ when it started and the symptoms i've been experiencing. I've wrote down the dates from day 1 to present (which might be a little off) *Prior to the first date i've listed below, I was experiencing other symptoms over the course of a month but gradually. Fatigue, feeling like I was in a fog most of the time, trouble remembering things, concentrating, just didn't feel all there. I noticed my right eye felt as if it wasn't as strong as my right one (blurriness). My right ear also felt plugged all the time followed by a pain on the right side of my face that was connected from my ear to my jaw that lasted a little more than a month but has now subsided. Things such as clumsiness, tingling in my hands and feet and weakness were also experienced. *May 27th 2017* Was when I first went to the ER for an excruciating headache, I was given an IV + headache medication, I felt this feeling of general discomfort throughout my body as the medication was going through the IV to my arm (have not felt the same since, it was like an irritable feeling that I still sometimes experience.) A few days after that I began to feel very shaky and just not okay. Was still having problems with my right eye, was also continuing to suffer from the intense headache listed above but it was now causing a burning sensation in different areas of my head and the back of my neck. This headache and feeling of pressure/ burning sensations continued on for about a week or so.  *June 3rd* was STILL experiencing this same headache/pressure and burning sensation, so I went back to the ER. After waiting for 4hrs+ at the ER just to see the doctor, he examined me and didn’t think anything too serious of the headache suggesting a possible sinus infection.

However I will continue to work part time as I have worked for my employer 18 years and enjoy what I do. But it is getting more difficult with the Fibro.

I noticed by touch a slightly raised small mark on my penile glands. When I looked at it the next day it was noticeable by sight and looked red to white colour. The next day when going to the toilet and pulled back my foreskin that there was a white kind of gunk behind my foreskin which I assumed was coming from the mark. This was pretty mini mull and caused no pain. The next day when peeing I noticed that it was very painful when peeing as I assume the urine was going onto the mark. It now looked like it may have split and was more a yellow colour. This was when I decided to see the doctor that morning. The doctor said it was probably Herpes as and told me to go to the GUM clinic for a test which I did. I had a culture test which was painful to take as well as a full std testing by urine sample. All these results including the culture came back negative. The pain when urinating went on for another day or two then stopped and the mark started to fade. 2 weeks later it is still visible to where the mark was but with no colour to it and it is not raised or causing any problems.  I decided to send off for a blood test online which was a IgG test for antibodies against herpes. This has again comeback negative.  I have never had this problem previously, I am recently married and been with my partner since 16 and are both now 33. We had one spell where we were not together about 8 years ago which was only a few months in which time I did have unprotected sex twice and she did not have any. Me and my wife have always had unprotected sex with each other and neither of us have had any symptoms of herpes before. With all this being said can I now rule out herpes with all these negative tests? And if it is not herpes then What would have caused the Problem I had as I am concerned it may be something more serious such as cancer. Do Cancer marks on the penile gland fade or they there always?

I'm thinking hell yeah finally we can have a normal marriage. Well now the doc say this year the strain 16 is back and showing strains 18 as well as 31-35 and some of the 40's. What does this mean? Can other strains develop from one strain? Is my spouse having sex else where? Now there is abnormal cells and more strains for a non sexually active person. I just need the truth.

PT was going good until around 8 weeks when I started feeling this bad pain in my right kneecap/ patella tendon area. The pain would not go away so at 12 weeks when I was suppose to start doing light jogging exercises, I was not able to. The pain is getting better but it is holding me back because I feel I cant attempt to jog because the pain might be that strong. I also had to stop doing certain things at physical therapy because of the pain. I am not doing PT anymore because my surgeon told me he was going to stop me at 12 weeks plus he wanted me to rest some so maybe the pain would go away. I see him next week. I am currently taking a strong anti inflammatory medicine but the pain still is there.  I am 21 years old and play competitive basketball so I need to be able to progress and get back but I dont even know how to start to return to jogging or anything with this pain. My doctor might not order me more PT but I can ask him to. My biggest concern is this pain and not understanding why it wont go away and how to progress and move forward and insure that I am able to return to my sport. What should I do?

They hurt pretty bad, but usually ice, massaging it, and painkillers stop the pain. It usually happens after exercise. He stretches a pretty good bit before working out however.   I would say it is chronic as he has been getting them 4-6 days per week lately. They hurt him very bad. Some nights he will wake up in the middle of the night almost crying in pain and won't be able to fall back asleep for about half an hour. He is a very healthy boy. We eat much healthier food than many other houses. He is not overweight has been working out daily for the past year or so. Should we go to the doctor? At first, we thought it was just muscle cramps, but he gets them more painfully, more frequently, and just worse in general than anyone else I know.

The pain was so extreme, and I was diagnosed with costcocondritis.  For the 1.5 years following, the pain would come back (though not as severe) occasionally triggered by exercise. The pain is sharp and wraps from my breast bone to my left upper rib area under my breast and all the way to my back to the left of my spine. It hurts to sit the most. Exercise and even walking hurt sometimes.  This past January I had a ""flare up"" after doing normal exercises. I decided to rest completely and did so for 6 MONTHS.  In June I began working out again slowly. After about a week I was in severe pain. That flare up lasted 2.5 months before I was really able to be comfortable again.  Finally, I decided to go to the doc again. I saw an orthopedist, physiatrist and neuro surgeon. i had a CT and MRI, a cyst was found on my nerve on my spine along with a ""subtle cortical and trabecular thickening of my 10th rib"" I was told the cyst could be causing this pain and likely I was misdiagnosed a few years ago.  So a week ago i went to have a steroid shot injected into the nerve in order to reduce the inflammation. Not only has it not helped, the pain is worse and back to unbearable.  I don't know where to go with this now. I can barely walk fast without aggravating it and hurting it further. Sitting hurts, standing hurts and the only thing that helps is my heating pad. I can't exercise and it's not healthy physically or mentally.  Does anyone have any ideas or thoughts? Doc recommendations?"

Symptoms showing?,"My last unprotected sexual partner was almost 10 months ago. After i had sex, I feared having an STD/STI because my penis just felt abnormally warm. I waited a few weeks and got tested for gono and chlamydia. Negative for both. After i was tested, my mind was at ease and that symptom went away. I was even tested again a few months later by a different doctor and chlamydia trachomitis+Gono came back clean again. Still had no symptoms but I wanted to make sure.  Fast forward to now, and I have since been in a monogamous relationship with my girlfriend which began about a month after that encounter. Me and her had unprotected sex about a month after my previous encounter. And we’ve had sex like rabbits for 9+ months now. Except recently, she experienced some terrible pain during sex. To the point where entry is not happening. She insists that it may be a result of friction and lubrication, which can always be better. We used a glycerin based lube and I foolishly placed a dab on her clitoris during cunnilingus and it burned when she peed.  We’ve went this long with zero symptoms or issues during sex. Now, I have been urinating frequently possibly due to anxiety about this. I’ll experience a light lower back discomfort which I would describe as internal. And I tend to have an “itch” around the head area maybe once or twice a day. Not persistent to the point of discomfort or emergency, but an annoyance every now and then.  She doesn’t have a frothy discharge. No foul odor. The only itching or pain vagina-wise is during sex and post-shaving around the pubic area. She’s complained of fatigue recently as well? I’ve called nurses and they insist that it isn’t a yeast infection because there’s no discharge. I went to the ER as well for dry skin on my shaft area and they said it does not look like yeast either.  I’m having anxiety about this because I truly have been monogamous and me and her have been on a roll in our relationship. Meeting each other’s families, becoming healthier everything. I’m fearing that something pre-monogamy may be an STD and cause her to think I cheated and ruin everything.  UTI? Yeast? Trich?

There was no pain at first (just the dull ache that comes after masturbating for a long time) so I didn't notice the swellling at first. It's different than genital lymphedema (which I've had in the past), as the use of hot/cold packs did not affect it. It also feels different. It still has the mostly uniform swelling of lymphedema, but there is also a small, hard, pea-sized lump that is slightly painful to touch. After touch the swollen area, there remains a dull ache/itching sensation (as if I need to pee) for several hours afterwards. The swelling is there in both flacid and erect states. Erections do not hurt and I can still ejaculate, but pressure is applied to the swollen area there is some pain and a slight pinching feeling. I also noticed a thin, hard shape about one inch long and maybe 2 mm wide, but have not noticed it since.  This happened four days ago, and there has been no change in the size of the mass. I'm concerned that may have I damaged some of the internal tissue. When my penis has swollen in the past there was no pain. It's almost as if some of the penile veins have clumped together in one area. Will this condition abate on its own?"

During the sex, I specifically remember feeling a lot of friction, but nothing painful. After seeing that my urethra was swollen, I thought maybe I contracted an STI, but it did seem odd that I had no pain peeing nor was there any discharge. As a few days went by, the swelling went down, and everything went back to normal. I ended up having sex with the same girl again about week after our first hookup, but this time with a condom. I woke up the next day and my urethra was swollen again! Just like last time, after waiting a few days, the swelling went down and I did not have any pain peeing. I then left school to come home and I've been worried about this ever since. My urethra swells after I masturbate, and it, again, swelled on New Years when I hooked up with a different girl. I went to the doctor to do an STI test this week, but I feel that I don't have an STI. The doctor recommended that if I don't have an STI, and the problem persists, that I go to a urologist. I'm just worried. Maybe I injured my urethra and it hasn't healed and every time I have sex, I just re-injure it? Has anyone ever had this problem? Thanks."

Just a post to vent. Very wet weather in our part of the country this past spring and summer. If it is not raining, it is very humid. I have been doing some yard work lately that had to be done. My pain levels are very high, probably as high as a '10', which is the worst. I am taking my enteric coated aspirin, muscle relaxers and resting as much as possible in my life recliner. I plan to go rumble soon - which means taking a nap in our sleep number bed with a vibrating frame. I will see my chiropractor next Wednesday. I see him on the third Wednesday of each month as that is when we get our SSD payments.  Remember the old ""Hee-Haw"" TV show and the song they used to sing: ""Gloom, despair and agony on me""? I have been singing that a lot lately. But, I am still abundantly blessed and thankful. How are you all doing?"

I am seeking help. I have withdrawn from benzos (4mg Klonopin) and opioids (200mg Oxycodone) at the beginning of this year. The benzodiazepine taper took 6 months. The Oxycodone was cold turkey. Anyways, at the moment I suffer from a groin injury for a few weeks now that hurts pretty bad at night which keeps me awake. So I tried to take Oxycodone on occasion. However, suddenly, the Oxycodone causes pain at two spots in my body that have been injured previously. My right wrist and my right shoulder. Everytime I take Oxycodone, those to spots start to hurt. I had a wrist strain a year ago and a shoulder bursitis. Both injuries healed (MRI was done). But still, the Oxycodone causes the same pain in those areas that I had a year ago. Now I am wondering if it has to do with the fact that I have withdrawn from the benzos. It seems Oxycodone indirectly lowers GABA and that opioid induced pain can be caused by NMDA and 5HT-3 receptor overactivity - both receptors go into overdrive during benzodiazepine withdrawal and both can cause pain. I also notice that I get muscle tightness in my neck and jaw after taking Oxycodone. Something that I never had when I took Oxycodone years ago before I used benzodiazepines. I have read that opioid induced hyperalgesia is pretty common. However, why do only those previously injured spots start to hurt when I take a medication that is supposed to help with pain? My groin injury is so bad that I need opioids to sleep, but it gives me aching pain in my wrist and shoulder that it is not of a big help. What's the mechanism behind this phenomen? Could it really be the GABA deficiency and NMDA overactivity I am suffering from due to benzo withdrawal or is there more to it? Kind regards!"

However, suddenly, the Oxycodone causes pain at two spots in my body that have been injured previously. My right wrist and my right shoulder. Everytime I take Oxycodone, those to spots start to hurt. I had a wrist strain a year ago and a shoulder bursitis. Both injuries healed (MRI was done). But still, the Oxycodone causes the same pain in those areas that I had a year ago. Now I am wondering if it has to do with the fact that I have withdrawn from the benzos. It seems Oxycodone indirectly lowers GABA and that opioid induced pain can be caused by NMDA and 5HT-3 receptor overactivity - both receptors go into overdrive during benzodiazepine withdrawal and both can cause pain. I also notice that I get muscle tightness in my neck and jaw after taking Oxycodone. Something that I never had when I took Oxycodone years ago before I used benzodiazepines. I have read that opioid induced hyperalgesia is pretty common. However, why do only those previously injured spots start to hurt when I take a medication that is supposed to help with pain? My groin injury is so bad that I need opioids to sleep, but it gives me aching pain in my wrist and shoulder that it is not of a big help. What's the mechanism behind this phenomen? Could it really be the GABA deficiency and NMDA overactivity I am suffering from due to benzo withdrawal or is there more to it? Kind regards!"

The pain lasts anywhere between thirty minutes to a couple hours, and then just vanishes. It is worsened by touching or moving my earlobe or turning my head. Lately, I've noticed that the pain is triggered when I rub a specific part of my neck, which is the sternocleidomastoid muscle right where it connects to my jaw.

A couple of days ago I noticed a strange lump on the right side of the shaft, just under my penis head which is slightly painful to touch but other then that it’d go unnoticed. What makes it harder is that I do have Phimosis, so I cannot investigate at the cause under the foreskin. Any ideas at what it could be, I am planning on visiting a doctor but would like some advice or general ideas. Thanks."

Why should we pay for insurance and not get the medical help we deserve. We are ALL on opiates due to a DR advise. Now they want to take what little quality of life we have and make it even worse. I just don't understand. And also its so bad in MO as I have recently found out. Should have checked that out b4 moving there. I have always followed the script on the bottle. If the pain is still bad I have to go to bed or lay on the couch. Gets very old.

This time in June '16 we did radiation treatment the day before the surgery and the morning of. My Ortho told me that he removed everything. Hip was fine until about January of this year, and it was bad. MRI ruled out any problems with the implant, but showed fluid around it. Hip was drained and fluid cultured, but no infection. Now onto an MRI on my Lumbar spine. This is the results:1. Mild multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine without thecal sac or significant neural foraminal narrowing. There is stable mild narrowing of the right neural foramen at L5-S1. 2. Mild levoscoliosis of the lumbar spine. Mild (grade 1) retrolisthesis of L4 on L5. 3. When compared to the prior MRI lumbar spine study from 8/15/2015, there has been interval development of atrophy and fatty infiltration of the left psoas and iliacus muscle. This correlates with a territory supplied by the left L1-3 lumbar spinal nerves and parts of the left femoral nerve. Now off to an EMG next week (Oh the fun..). Has anyone else been through this? What can I expect? All I know is that I have extreme pain in my hip/groin/upper thigh, along with numbness in my left foot/big toe. Just desperate for advice. Thanks, Mike"

Back on October 1st, I started having high fever and pain in my throat, particularly on my tonsils. It rapidly developed into mononucleosis with pus pockets and white linings present on both of my swollen tonsils. After lab-testing a sample of my tonsil's tissues, the diagnosis determined that it was Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2) who was the culprit. I'm going through a mandatory service along with 400+ of my ""campmates"". There we usually shared utensils and glasses when dining, and the hygiene leaves a bit to be desired. The doctor made an assumption that I may have contracted the virus from my fellow officers through these utensils, or it could have been the result of me giving oral sex. Curiously, other than the symptoms during the initial outbreak, which include: - Mononucleosis (enlarged tonsils with pus patches) - High Fever - Whole Body Soreness Curiously, I had no symptoms well-known amongst both HSV-1 and 2, including cold and genital sores, rashes and blisters.

I just received the call from my doctor that my test results were in and I tested positive for HSV2. I’ve been married 13 years. All I know for certain is that I’ve not been with anyone else in all these years. My husband has no symptoms. He says he never has. I’ve never had any symptoms. Is it possible one of us could have had this prior to our relationship and not known it?!?! Never had an outbreak?!? We’ve both been holding out hope that this wasn’t Herpes. Not sure what do think or how to live with this. I have to tell him when he comes home from work.

Years back I fell and fractured my spine. Good news; modern medicine was able to put me back together again but the bad news is I have residual pain which is 8/10 at best most of the time. Anyway, this message board is to tell you about things that have helped me with my pain, I will elaborate and I hope some of the things help you guys. First one is the toughest, I've learned to reduce the amount of stress in my life much as possible, everyone knows STRESS, specially when your confronted with it always makes the pain uncontrollable. I was able to stop working ( I realize this isn't possible for everyone) but if you can, stop. Then focus on things in your life that make you happy and do them on your schedule. Also, I've tried almost every modality available and the ones that helped me were, Nueromuscular Massage Therapy ( Myofacial Release), self hypnosis, listening to my favorite music ( my music isn't relaxing but I find it gets me to sleep), a really good bed ( tried them all and found the ""Sleep Number"" worked the best for me). Getting to realize your capabilities and learn to ask for help or do it yourself. I've found doing things myself again builds good cognitive awareness. Ice over heat. TENS, is a good distraction and sometimes it helps. I really have more but it feels like I'm writing a book so I'll stop here. Lastly, I want to point out medications I ended up taking after many years of hard opiates ( that's a whole story within itself).  I've found that Gabapentin, Klonopin, Lidocaine Patches, Vitamin D with Folic Acid, Wellbutrin ( for the depression) Celebrex are the major pills I take everyday. So check with your doctor. Guys, good luck coping,it's very difficult but it's beats the alternative. Gbdb15"

I was able to stop working ( I realize this isn't possible for everyone) but if you can, stop. Then focus on things in your life that make you happy and do them on your schedule. Also, I've tried almost every modality available and the ones that helped me were, Nueromuscular Massage Therapy ( Myofacial Release), self hypnosis, listening to my favorite music ( my music isn't relaxing but I find it gets me to sleep), a really good bed ( tried them all and found the ""Sleep Number"" worked the best for me). Getting to realize your capabilities and learn to ask for help or do it yourself. I've found doing things myself again builds good cognitive awareness. Ice over heat. TENS, is a good distraction and sometimes it helps. I really have more but it feels like I'm writing a book so I'll stop here. Lastly, I want to point out medications I ended up taking after many years of hard opiates ( that's a whole story within itself).  I've found that Gabapentin, Klonopin, Lidocaine Patches, Vitamin D with Folic Acid, Wellbutrin ( for the depression) Celebrex are the major pills I take everyday. So check with your doctor. Guys, good luck coping,it's very difficult but it's beats the alternative. Gbdb15"

I had a really bad yeast infection to the point where it started eating away at my vaginal area. I went to a walk-in doctor and they took and swab and took an STI blood test. A week after, I called the clinic to see if they had my results and I spoke to the nurse and she told me that my swab came back positive for yeast. I asked if that was it and she said yes. A few weeks later the clinic calls me to come in and I told them I already knew the results of my swab test and they said it was regarding my blood work. The doctor told me at the beginning my swab came back positive for yeast. He then proceeded to explain the blood work and said you are positive for herpes. The swab detected some traces of herpes. I am now left very confused because if the swab did test positive for herpes, would he have not have said it at the beginning along with the yeast diagnosis and not with the results of the blood test?"

She suffered from several ""attacks"" prior to this operation, where she would have stabbing/pulling pain in her lower abdomen that left her struggling to walk and move. Since the operation, her pains haven't ceased. There is also no pattern (can be two weeks; four weeks or six weeks between attacks).  She has had exploratory surgery and no adhesions were found and she was found to be healing well from the operation.  She does not got any dietary symptoms (diarrhoea; bloating or constipation); the pain is alleviated slightly by a full bladder and also requires strong painkillers, such as codeine.  Doctors are now shrugging their shoulders as to the issue. Does anyone have any ideas as to what the problem could be? She's missing a lot of school and is in a lot of pain."

Last fall I began waking up with my left knee hurting. Usually I'd just stretch and feel better, but I didn't really think about it. By January, I was walking with a limp and in pain, taking OTC pills to relieve it. I saw a doctor in February, she ordered bloodwork, an xray, and that I do some stretches as she thought I had sciatica. The xray didnt reveal anything special, nor did the bloodwork. After doing her stretches for a week, I could barely walk and felt severe pain. My parents pressured me to go to a chiropractor, and that's what I did. After some sessions, the chiropractor encouraged me to get an MRI on my lower spine. I did and it revealed that I had two protruding discs (L4 and L5-s) and he said I should try spinal decompression. After about 12 sessions of that, the pain only got worse. I stopped seeing him and have tried some stretches. While seeing him, my knee started popping. When asked, he said it was probably a leftover high school football injury, but my knee didn't pop before this. Overall, my pain has gotten better, but I'm nowhere near where I want to be. It has shifted, mostly condensed in my left knee and buttock, but it has moved to my hip. My question is, what could I possibly have? Who should I see? Why is my knee suddenly popping? Could that be caused by sciatica? Or is there something else happening? I can't exercise, I can't sleep, it's becoming difficult to function."

I fell from a height of about a foot and a half because I missed a step, and came down hard. X-ray didn't show any fractures. I've started having really bad pain in the back of my knee and it is tender to the touch. It also looks like there is a vein popping out on my upper calf right below the knee. Could that have been caused by the fall? Could it mean a blood clot? My leg isn't warm though it is a little swollen around the knee and in my ankle."

The my bicep is also unable to flex at all. Just want to know whats going on. It almost to me sounds like vibrating arm-hand syndrome. All the symptoms except white fingers (not all get the fingers) are there, but it says it takes years for it to develop. What else could it be? carpel tunnel? Ive had the numbness in hands and such at a previous job as well (catching chickens) which deals with no vibrations at all. Carpel tunnel is what i was kind of thinking with the chickens because it happened after months of being there. But why would the leaf blower bring that out doesn't make sense. It is a backpack style one so no weigh being held just hold a handle squeeze a trigger and aim the barrel around. Could the backpack maybe be pinching a nerve in my shoulder?

If I do any sort of serious cardio (read: run out of breath), then a day or a few days later I will sometimes get a sudden sharp pain in my chest, with a few pain “hotspots”, at least one of which is usually in the lower left of my ribcage. During this time, I can't breath normally because it hurts if I breath in even a little bit. After about 20 seconds, the attack slowly loosens its grasp on me and everything is back to normal. I don’t get this pain after weight lifting, but I recently started biking to work and my old friend pain has returned again, though not as bad as it used to be. For information, I do not smoke or drink and have always been skinny. Usually, the worse my lungs burn during exercise, the worse the pain afterwards will be. The doctors in two different hospitals in two different countries checked my heart and could not find anything. They did not think it has anything to do with my lungs, though I do. I am 30 now and this hasn’t killed me yet, but I do want to do more cardio training and I am still somewhat concerned that this pain may be a ticking time bomb.  Any ideas anyone?"

Normally I'm good at finding information, but I'm in a constant brain fog and severely fatigued (my family doctor believes this is due to blood loss, as I lost about a third of my blood volume waiting for surgery). What questions should I prepare with regards to the pregnancy and surgery? What questions and hoops should I prepare for with regards to ligating the remaining tube?  Please do not suggest the following: Hormone contraception, visectomy, condoms. Each of these comes with a long post that frankly I have neither the time nor patience to get into.

Right after I thought the headache was getting better, now it is coming on with a burning all over my head on top of the right temple pain. I feel disoriented, tired and just REALLY worried. The headache doesn't respond to Advil or Aleve. I can't say what makes it worse or better.  I can say we sold our house, moved into an apartment temporarily (they had to remove carpet for fleas) and we are buying a house, all with 3 kids, a cat, a lizard and a dog! I also quit my job of 11 years, and started a new job Jan. 9; SO I know this is related to stress, but I have really tried to manage that with good diet, exercise, massage and chiro... I am really worried nothing is working. It is very scary to have constant pain in the temple. I did see my neuro for a nerve injection blocker but so far the headache has been worse not better. Any advice? I am so worried about something sinister."

They are smaller than a .17 BB/pellet, there can be a little discomfort when masturbating but not much. I really can't even tell they are there throughout the day.  The bumps seem to be pretty dry one time i tried to squeeze one and I was able to get just a tiny tiny tiny bit of clear liquid out, but they don't ooze by themselves.  They seem to heel throughout the day by getting even drier and the outside getting harder with what I assume is dead skin, but then after masturbation they revert back (i guess the ""scab"" gets scraped off during masturbation). Overall they don't look very scary/suspicious but I can be paranoid.  I'm a virgin, but I have received a few hand jobs with saliva as lubricant, and a few blow jobs while wearing a condom. Most recently about 3-4 weeks ago.  They are just about healed about 10 days out.  Should I get tested for an STD, I feel like it might be a waist of time cuz I don't think I could have gotten one, I have never had any other symptoms of an STD. I assume they are just random bump that will heal up and never come back. But should I just to be safe? If i should get tested what Std should i be tested for? Also for genital Herpes, does the sore need to be present for testing? or will a blood test work?  Thanks,"

I started taking the medication and my symptoms got relieved withing 3-4 days of consuming it.But within a week I found out that my semen volume has significantly reduced.I checked for the side effects in the internet and found the same , but it was also mentioned that these effects gets reversed on discontinuation of medicine. So ,after 10 days of medication I stopped it to verify that the side effects can be reversed.But with all my astonishment i found no improvement even after 7 days of discontinuation of medicine. I would like to state that I remember having normal volume of ejaculation even couple of days before taking the medication. This has let me into a very tensed and depressing mind . I am afraid the effects has become permanent. I am not able to get an appointment with the urologist before next week .

It is now August 2018 and I haven’t had an outbreak since the initial one. I remember having a fever, feeling weak.. tired and having the blisters around my anus area and some in my vagina. My doctor informed me that it was GHSV1 and I most likely got it from oral sex with a partner that I had. I was so upset at first. The stigma around having herpes is not fun.. the jokes your friends tell, the lines in those movies or tv shows.. they all make me so upset. No one knows but my mother and I. I just try to brush it off knowing there’s nothing I can do about it but be careful and take medicine if I feel one coming on. I do get tingly and itchy down there but it stops and I never get any actual blisters or outbreaks. I’m assuming maybe it’s just the way I shave since my skin is very sensitive and products make me itch very easily. I wasn’t bothered as much and I try to go on with my day when I think about having it. The only time it truly gets to me is when I think of having sex, when I’m in the middle of a sexual encounter or when I think of a future long term relationship and I eventually have to tell the person that I’m with. I can’t even really enjoy oral sex anymore... I know transmission is lower than HSV2 but I’m still paranoid and instead of enjoying sex with someone, my mind runs and runs about my HSV1.

Any more advice on the transmission rates or just help/facts/advice in general so I’m more aware? It’s been a while but it’s been on my mind lately. I don’t know why...

It is now August 2018 and I haven’t had an outbreak since the initial one. I remember having a fever, feeling weak.. tired and having the blisters around my anus area and some in my vagina. My doctor informed me that it was GHSV1 and I most likely got it from oral sex with a partner that I had. I was so upset at first. The stigma around having herpes is not fun.. the jokes your friends tell, the lines in those movies or tv shows.. they all make me so upset. No one knows but my mother and I. I just try to brush it off knowing there’s nothing I can do about it but be careful and take medicine if I feel one coming on. I do get tingly and itchy down there but it stops and I never get any actual blisters or outbreaks. I’m assuming maybe it’s just the way I shave since my skin is very sensitive and products make me itch very easily. I wasn’t bothered as much and I try to go on with my day when I think about having it. The only time it truly gets to me is when I think of having sex, when I’m in the middle of a sexual encounter or when I think of a future long term relationship and I eventually have to tell the person that I’m with. I can’t even really enjoy oral sex anymore... I know transmission is lower than HSV2 but I’m still paranoid and instead of enjoying sex with someone, my mind runs and runs about my HSV1.

I have had anxiety for years so that's what my family and doctors keep passing it off as but I know my body and this has to be something else. It has particularly gotten worse over the last few months. I have been really fatigued and sleeping a lot and have been having persistent back pain in my upper right back for months. It feels like a heavy sort of pain. Over the last few weeks, it has also culminated into sharp pains in the left side of my chest, below my breast, which are quite scary. They are what I fear the most. I also have noticed I've been breathing deeply a lot and the pain often comes when I take a deep breath or shift positions. Another thing I've noticed is lightheadedness when standing and feeling like I'm bouncing up and down (which is horrible when I get out of an elevator and stand still). Another symptom I've been having daily is very red, bloodshot eyes, which come and go. They are really bad in the morning and sometimes, at night. The images below show what I mean with my eyes- they get very red and many people have questioned me about them. I have also not wanted to go out much in public places and have been isolating myself from friends for awhile. This is quite scary and honestly, I feel like I'm dying. I'm 18 years old and this is supposed to be the most exciting time of my life but I can't enjoy it because of my symptoms. Even sometimes when I laugh I get the sharp chest pain. But yeah I just feel out of it most of the time and my body doesn't feel the same as what it used to- it almost feels surreal or as if I'm not here at times. I'm 99% sure there's something going on and I just want answers."

She landed on her shoulders first before the impact made the back of her head hit the ground. She did not black out and was fully conscious the whole time.  She did start feeling nauseous though which is the worrying factor. But,this could be due to her anxiety making her feel this way. She hasn't show any other symptoms besides her neck/back hurting. She went to the doctors and they said to get a catscan, but it was around 10 at night and she decided to go in the morning instead.  Should we be worried?

I played volleyball through college and have surfed my whole life. On top of that I work out and used to practice martial arts. All in all, I was always active and always in shape. Now, I can hardly do any of the activities I used to enjoy. My back hurts so bad I can't play volleyball or most sports. My knees have started to ache which makes it difficult to surf and I have shooting pain from my shoulder to my wrist which makes it hard to do just about anything that requires hands. My back pain started 2 years ago, I was playing basketball and I turned for a pass and something happened. I can't recall if it was a pop or what, but it was definitely something that initiated the pain. From my research and countless doctors it appears to be a psoas injury. However, 2 years of stretching, icing, physical therapy, massage therapy and chiropractors have yielded NO results. I'm not nearly active as I was and yet my body keeps getting worse. My back hurts the worst now a days when I drive. If I drive for more then 20 minutes without having a bunch of pillows to sit on the pain quickly becomes unbearable. It also hurts really bad spiking in volleyball, something about the torque like movement on my lower left back or psoas or whatever it is. On top of that I've started to recently experience knee pain which hurts walking, running, biking, surfing, etc...it's been on going for about 3 months. I stretch every day for all the muscles around the knee and have surfed a LOT less than normal, but to no avail. My shoulder pain has been on and off for probably 5 years, I understand this is probably due to volleyball and probably some kind of nerve thing but my doctor said it's tennis elbow and to buy a brace which I think they pulled out of nowhere. Recently this has been getting far worse. My shoulder hurts, my wrist hurts my hand hurts and my elbow hurts worst of all. Very sharp pain that I can push through but extreme discomfort. I have no idea what's going on. I'm 5'10 about 170 lbs with very very low body fat. I'm in shape still as I still workout and exercise when I'm not in too much pain. I've had injuries before and strained muscles but these are way longer and persistent than anything I've experienced. I'm open to ANY advice you might have, I will be trying accupuncture soon, next step will be some voodoo doctors from Madagascar (not really, but I'm getting desperate).  Thank you in advance and if there is any more info that would help you advise me, don't hesitate to ask."

My knees have started to ache which makes it difficult to surf and I have shooting pain from my shoulder to my wrist which makes it hard to do just about anything that requires hands. My back pain started 2 years ago, I was playing basketball and I turned for a pass and something happened. I can't recall if it was a pop or what, but it was definitely something that initiated the pain. From my research and countless doctors it appears to be a psoas injury. However, 2 years of stretching, icing, physical therapy, massage therapy and chiropractors have yielded NO results. I'm not nearly active as I was and yet my body keeps getting worse. My back hurts the worst now a days when I drive. If I drive for more then 20 minutes without having a bunch of pillows to sit on the pain quickly becomes unbearable. It also hurts really bad spiking in volleyball, something about the torque like movement on my lower left back or psoas or whatever it is. On top of that I've started to recently experience knee pain which hurts walking, running, biking, surfing, etc...it's been on going for about 3 months. I stretch every day for all the muscles around the knee and have surfed a LOT less than normal, but to no avail. My shoulder pain has been on and off for probably 5 years, I understand this is probably due to volleyball and probably some kind of nerve thing but my doctor said it's tennis elbow and to buy a brace which I think they pulled out of nowhere. Recently this has been getting far worse. My shoulder hurts, my wrist hurts my hand hurts and my elbow hurts worst of all. Very sharp pain that I can push through but extreme discomfort. I have no idea what's going on. I'm 5'10 about 170 lbs with very very low body fat. I'm in shape still as I still workout and exercise when I'm not in too much pain. I've had injuries before and strained muscles but these are way longer and persistent than anything I've experienced. I'm open to ANY advice you might have, I will be trying accupuncture soon, next step will be some voodoo doctors from Madagascar (not really, but I'm getting desperate).  Thank you in advance and if there is any more info that would help you advise me, don't hesitate to ask."

I can still pick things up and brush my teeth, but holiding a pen causes considerable pain. I have already been to an orthopaedic and a rheumatologist, but they cannot figure out what is wrong.

I have pretty much quit while I've had this chest pain. I noticed when I would smoke, the chest pain would get worse. I have been to the doctor. My blood tests came back normal except I had elevated AST and ALT levels. They were both around 75. I had chest x-rays that came back normal, and a brain CT scan that also came back normal. My doctor has told me that she thinks I have pleurisy. However, I feel that if it was pleurisy I still wouldn't have a lingering discomfort. The pain is definitely better but it seems like it won't completely go away. This pain also causes me to have a shortness of breath. I took like 2 hits of cannabis a week ago, but I haven't since then. Could that be the cause of it still lingering? I am just worried and I feel like my doctor is misdiagnosing me. When I showed my blood tests to another doctor, she had said if i had inflammation, it would have showed up on one of the things they tested for in my blood test. So that makes me think it isn't pleurisy."

My mother has a problem that she can not get not over it. For three years she has been experiencing frequent urination problems (10 to 10 minutes often) and a terrible painful pain in the genital area. I've been to 3 gynecologists and 2 urologists, and nobody gives it to them. Uroculture it's ok, negative, has taken antibiotic for a long time believing that it is a cystitis, gynecologist blade, nothing, good papaya test, good intravaginal ultrasound, uterus is not down, took some egg from steaks for storms and nothing works . She has pain all the time, not just when she urinates. He has crash crises when she's sitting, she does not make any of the pains of pain. Make a summary of the urine, the pH is good, 5, 5. It made bathing sinks with bicarbonate water, with chamomile tea, nimik. Can anyone help me with an idea? I do not know what to do anymore, doctors are shrugging off at this crap, I do not know what to give them to calm down. Thank you very much!"

However now she's having a loss of sensation where the numbness was and now there is pain in her stomach (She said it's at least a 6 or 7 on a 1-10 pain scale with 10 being the highest). She also says it isn't gas related as she's having no issues there. She says the numbness has spread/grown severely, it started in her left thigh and has spread everywhere except for her toes, the top of her feet, her head, face, neck, shoulders, arms and hands. We're not entirely sure what this is, but the doctors said it was ""Paresthesias"" but this sounds FAR more severe than that. She also had Bariactric Surgery (Also known as the Gastric Sleeve) in december."

I was in a meeting in a conference room which was a little cool, around 65 degrees. I was wearing snug but comfortable sneakers. After sitting for about 2 hours, we took a break, I stepped outside for a smoke and started feeling a painful itching sensation in my left little toe on the way back to the conference room. The meeting lasted about another 1.5 hours and the sensation seemed to get a little worse over that time. After the meeting, I started to feel it worsen dramatically as I was walking. Upon arriving home and removing shoes and socks, I noticed that the toe was swollen and red. There was no blister evident at that time. Today in the shower I cleaned and massaged it slightly, feeling no pain while doing that. Afterwards the pain and redness returned. Throughout my day I did walk a bit, and by the time I was on my way home I was almost in tears with the pain. My walk has turned into an extreme limp, but I can still hobble around by favoring the inside of my foot. When I removed my footwear this evening, I realized that the swelling was extreme, it has become very painful to the touch, and there is a purple-ish blister in the crack on the underside of the toe (see pic). The entire toe feels quite hard to the touch and it is now a constant shooting and unbearable pain which almost feels like the toe wants to burst. I have been taking OTC Naproxen Sodium throughout the day to counteract which does dull, but does not eliminate the pain. I realize that I am likely going to have to see a professional to have the problem diagnosed, however I am short Medical Coverage and not financially able to cover medical bills which will ensue. I am hoping for a little guidance towards possible diagnoses and home remedies that might help to ease the pain and hopefully cure the problem. If anyone has any thoughts or ideas on this, your input would be greatly appreciated."

Until a couple of weeks after that ""wrick"", with the lumbar spine constantly sore, I felt pain radiating from my legs as I rose from the table after supper. I was scared and went to the hospital the next day. They dispatched me with painkillers and anti-inflammatories that I could barely take because they were causing me dizziness and tummy aches. I decided to go to a neurosurgeon who prescribed new medication (two painkillers, a stomach protection and a small dose of injectable cortisone) and asked me to do an MRI scan of the lumbar spine. As a result, the L5-SI disc was somewhat dehydrated and had a small herniation / protrusion touching the sciatic nerve, everything else was normal. The doctor said it was nothing special, that I might have occasional pains from now on, but that in time, after this accute phase, Ishould stay close to the state I was before this incident. He told me to avoid weights, bad postures and wait during some time. In this consultation I also complained of a feeling of pressure in the left arm (I was only able to subside this sensation if I pressed/made strength in the fist) that I started to have when taking the medication, but he did not care ... However, this sensation of pressure became a sensation of constant burning through the left arm (especially between the wrist and the elbow, the focus of pain sometimes moves to the lower arm, shoulder... it changes from time to time). Then the right arm joined the party, although this one only gives me intermittent. I do not feel any weakness, the pain is indifferent to the activity or resting of the arms. In the middle I began to experience facial and cervical pains due to temporomandibular dysfunction - the two discs of the joint go where they should not. I went to a specialist who made sure to reassure me after palpation and said that it is banal, that it is only due to dental malocclusion - she's almost sure using braces or a drip will solve the problem, I'm about to go to a doctor for that ... Due to the persistent pain in the left arm and the pain in the lumbar and legs not evolving, I decided to return to the neurosurgeon and to visit another one to have a second opinion (this one also did not find my magnetic resonance to the lumbar to be anything that serious) and he asked me to to perform an electromyography in order to detect irradiated cervical lesions to the arms, nervous system problems and an early degenerative tendency of multiple discs of the spine.

Primarily on the glans. They come and go but mostly stick around. I’ve put hydrocortisone cream 1% and it tends to go away.. but quickly comes back. It seems to get worse if I don’t put cream (more bumps, redder bumps, higher bumps). It’s not itchy, there’s no pain. I’ve also seen it on the inside of my foreskin. I’ve been meaning to see a doctor and I will soon. But I’m pretty concerned at the moment. It reminds me of chicken pox the way it’s spread out. Bumps are raised slightly but not much.

I don't know if that had anything to do with my problem now... but ever since then (2 days ago) my feet have been SO itchy. Not my heel though, it's across the balls of my feet, my toes and around the edges of that sort of area.  I can't help but rub them on carpet whenever I get a chance and I even rubbed them on the concrete outside just to relieve myself of the itch - however it never goes away.  I also feel as though they're swollen and as if the grip has gone, I slip on wooden floors if I'm not careful. Weird right??  They're so insanely itchy that I can't bear it anymore, does anyone have any idea what it is? Or what it could be??  It's not exactly pain, but it gets more tender the more it goes on. :( Any help would be so so so appreciated. Thankyou."

Before I had the surgery I received an epidural steroid injection. It did nothing for the pain I was experiencing. It was all sciatica and it was debilitating. I should have never been given the shot because my condition was so bad it required surgery to relieve the pain. The neurosurgeon performed my surgery in a surgery center about 3 weeks after the ESI. The procedure took about 4 hours and I was sent home the same day. The following day I woke up I was screaming in pain from not only my back but also my arm, specifically my right shoulder. The nurse called to check on me and when I asked what was done to my arm she said the Dr ordered a 120mg shot of Depo Medrol. I have a huge dent in my shoulder, complete muscle atrophy. I have had serious depression, massive weight gain, uncontrollable sweating and awful, awful pain throughout my entire body. I was told by my GP that my Divot will be permanent . What I haven't been told is WHY was a shot of Deep Medrol given to me directly into my deltoid muscle. Is this standard? I have been searching for weeks and can't find a single incident of a patient given such a high dose of steroid into the shoulder while undergoing open back surgery. I was never informed that I was going to be receiving this shot and I was NEVER told that it was administered until I asked. I have had almost every single adverse reaction possible. My surgeon only saw me 10 days after surgery to remove stitches. I guess $450,000 in fees isn't enough to get a straight answer as to why this was done to me. I would have never agreed!!!! I would like to hear of the possible reasons this was administered to me. I have already come to realize that it should never be given in the deltoid due to it's high probability of causing muscle atrophy especially when not administered properly. Has anyone had the same experience?"

Gone to the doctor, they do a urine test for gonorrhea and chlamydia and same day give a shot in the ass and two 500mg of Azithromycin pills to be taken all at once. The gonorrhea and chlamydia tests come back negative and two days later, same symptom. It'll let up after a couple days later but I would think sooner if attributable to the medications. Since it's white, I'm wondering if this is semen? I remember both times what preceded this is that I jacked off pretty hard. I'm able to summon a small drop in the morning but not really afterwards during the day but there's continued leakage as evidenced by the underpants."

So I went to another doctor today she also said it looks like Herpes. she said she wasn't quite sure though. But again the blood test was negative. Can someone please help me out. Im so confused on how she can say that when I even showed her my test results that say it was negative. Are those test often times wrong? Should i go get a full STD screening done? Just to make sure its a similar STD? Please Help.

I'm 51. I am fit but have hypertension that is controlled using 5 mg of bystolic daily. BP generally runs 120/77 but can be higher depending upon stress levels. My most recent physical showed healthy levels of cholesterol and blood sugars. I do however have anxiety issues. Until last Thursday, June 28, I generally woke once or twice each night with strong erections. On Wednesday, June 27, I had sex with my wife that morning and then masturbated later in the day. I woke up on Thursday with only weak morning erection. I wasn't too concerned but I noted it. (I have had a fear of ED since turning 50) Friday, I had weak morning erection and that night I had no real libido and when I tried to force the issue, I couldn't get an erection. I woke up Saturday morning with a moderate erection and was able to achieve 80 or 90 percent hardness and ejaculate. I was still concerned about not being doing so the night before. Sunday morning I awoke with a moderate morning erection and masturbated to 70 or 80 percent without ejaculation. Monday, there was no morning erection, but I was able to get to get myself fairly erect. Tuesday nothing. Wednesday, no morning erection but I could masturbate to about 70 percent. Thursday, no morning erection but I masturbated to about 70-80 and ejaculated. Each of these times the erection deflated fairly quickly once stimulation stopped. Last night, Thursday night, I was able to masturbate to about 80 percent without ejaculation. However, it deflated quickly again. No morning erection today. Throughout all of this, my libido has been subpar and my anxiety has been fairly high. As, I mentioned I have had a fear of ED. This came on so quickly, it has me very concerned. My question for you is, given what I am experiencing, do you think there is a physical cause of this or is it simply my anxiety about erectile dysfunction? Thank you"

I did have a bacterial infection and got antibiotics from my gyno and finished then. My boyfriend and I had sex after my medication was over and now my boyfriend has constant itching around his groin and burns sometimes and blames me. Can men get bacterial infections because my gyno said it is a non-transferable infection? If so what is the cause for his itching and burning?

When I was feeling a bit better my wife and I attempted being intimate and when I orgasmed I’ve never seen so much fluid come out of me. It was alarming. Multiple tablespoons worth if not more, and I had no control. It was almost comical. Beyond abstaining from sex for a couple of weeks what could have caused my body to produce all of this extra fluid? Nothing in my diet changed, is it possible increased blood flow to the area for healing caused extra fluid production?  I’m genuinely curious what happened."

Cleveland Clinic once spoke to me of one that said I was a poor risk for. Poor risk because of being on blood thinners fo blood clots in both legs. Bad blood clotting. Last ultra sound my right leg was blood clots from top to bottom. Left was not quite as bad. The procedure I speak of was electrical brain stemming. Inserts into both sides of brain with electrical shock going to them. They tried the spinal electrical shock stem. Went in from lower back and up. I wondered why not from top down. I've heard of a new medication out that works real well. Don't remember the name. They have talked of now having me try physiatrics and withdraw from all medications. I know I need something.

I went to the doctor about it and the told me tho whole RICE thing. The next day i went and walked on it and put weight on it and was honestly in sever pain. and continued to walk on it and jump around and wear heels for majority of last week. Yes i know it is my own fault for not staying off of it. But now it hurts even worse when i bend my toes and it also hurts more in the middle of my foot on the bottom. i can stand and put some weight on it but not a lot. I don't know if I should take a trip back to the doctor or just actually stay off of it while i'm on spring break and see how it goes. Any suggestions?

It was late in the game and I kept playing, but as the adrenaline wore off afterwards, I realized I had significant pain and limited mobility in my shoulder, as well as weakness in my arm. The top of my shoulder (above the collarbone) was bulging. I'm pretty certain there was no dislocation, unless it popped out and back in instantaneously without me noticing. I figured I'd had a light shoulder separation. I wore a sling and regularly iced and taped up the shoulder, giving it support. I returned to soccer a few weeks later after most of the pain had stopped, playing only with it heavily taped and supported. Over the next month or two, it gradually got better to the point where I barely noticed it and stopped using the sling, but the improvement seems to have stalled out since. I had planned to do some mobility/strengthening exercises to keep helping it along, but I read that you shouldn't do any such exercises until pain is completely gone, and I still haven't reached that point, now five months after the fall. Currently, any movement that opens the shoulder wide (reaching overhead or behind me, any throwing motion) brings some pain and shows my mobility is still limited. Putting weight on the hand or elbow to that side also brings some light pain, and it remains uncomfortable to lie down on that side. I can also feel tightness around the joint (front, back and side), and I still have a slight but noticeable bulge above the collarbone. I don't know what to do next to aid the healing process. Are there exercises, movements or massages I can try that would help? Should I be taking anti-inflammatories? Should I go back to icing heavily and keeping it immobile and in a sling at all times? If so, how would I even know when it's OK to stop using the sling? The injury never struck me as something significant enough that would require an MRI, let alone surgery, but now that the recovery has stalled, I'm worried that might be necessary. I would very much like to avoid surgery, both because of expense and the lengthy recovery that would come with it. I'm 25 and have never had a significant sports injury despite skiing and playing soccer my whole life. I did play baseball for a long time and I used to pitch, but I never had any major shoulder issue. Any guidance you can provide would be a huge help. Thanks!"

Last Nov 25, I had sore and lesions around my big nipples. Both of my nipples. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I EVER HAD THIS IN MY LIFE. A day before that, I made love to my husband. That was the last sex I had with him before this condition happened. We almost do this at least 3 times a week. He loved sucking my big nipples using his teeth and I had a feeling that's the reason why it got aggravated. Again, we have been doing this. On the 26th, I felt the pain more - like a stabbing pain. I suspected it got worse coz of my tight-fitting shirt and my bra. I decided to wear loose shirt and then apply bacitracin. Moreover, to soothe the pain, I cleaned it using water with apple cider vinegar and then apply some coconut oil because I suspected it to be a fungal/yeast infection caused by candida, or a nipple thrush, even if I'm not lactating (based on my research, possible to have it even for non-lactating women).  Then on the 27th, I felt better with the help of that coconut oil but the pain is still there and it's manageable. And then I noticed white bumps. One white bump on my left areola then 2 on my right areola. Pls note, this does not look like tiny blister in cluster forms. They looked like some sort of a hair follicle infection – well at least to me. You know, those dots around the areola? I believe that's an areolar gland. So, that's where the bumps are. Then on my left breast, it has some redness. I got panicked coz I began to think it could be breast inflammatory cancer or what so we decided to go the hospital on the 28th.  At the emergency, the doctor asked me for any symptoms. I don't feel any weirdness going on my body, like fatigue, loss of appetite or fever. I felt normal except this pain I have with my nipples and areola. The doctor could not say what this could be so she suggested me to have swab test on these bumps by breaking them. (Man, it hurt! I thought I have to undergo mammogram/MRI screening, etc. But nope!) One for herpes through viral culture test and the other one is for bacterial infection. Then, she gave me a prescription for a 4-mix cream, which includes anti-bacterial cream, desitin, chlotrimazole and hydrocortisone. I applied this twice a day and I could see the progress. A day after that, the ER doctor referred me to an infectious disease specialist while waiting for the results. Basically, she is also unaware about my condition and can't rule out yet. But she said it COULD NOT BE HERPES. So, I was glad to hear that. She prescribed me an oral antibacterial pills for 5 days. Again, I saw some progress. My nips and areola began to heal.  Then today, I felt like they are doing pretty well now but I still continued applying that 4-mix cream. My happiness subsided when I received a phone call from that specialist and told me that I have a positive result for HERPES TYPE1 and positive result on bacterial infection. Like WHAT?!!! I was so emotional and depressed. I have a prescription called acyclovir but I did not take it. Due to that, I wasn't able to ask these questions to my doctor. Appreciate if you could enlighten me this. And sorry for a long post. 1. Is it possible really to have herpes type 1 on your nipples and areola? Before this condition happened, I had an IgG blood test and it was negative for both types 1 and 2 last Jan 2016. I took this test coz my GYN told me to do so as I had some sort of a cut in my genital area. My husband also had a negative result. AND NOW, a positive result through viral culture test. HOW COULD THIS BE POSSIBLE? I only have a monogamous relationship. But my hubby got 2 other relationships before me. He did not notice any abnormalities like cold sores happened on his body throughout his life. 2. Herpes type 1 is not an STD-type of thing? 3. This is still unacceptable for me. For how long should I wait til I have that next IgG blood test again? I wanna ensure if these lab test results are accurate. 4. Speaking of accuracy, is the viral culture test reliable? Can it be a false positive? 5. Are there any other reliable tests to prove if one (who is not experiencing any symptoms) is positive or negative herpes aside from this viral culture test and blood test? I'm talking about after the outbreak. Like if you don't feel any symptoms, yet you want to know if there are herpes anti-bodies present. 6. How can you tell if it's herpes? Like I said, I felt tingling and painful sensation, a bit of redness only on my one breast, lesions around my nipples and some white bumps. But these white bumps are not in cluster form though…. With the help of the cream, it somehow worked. Now, they looked ok and normal to me. Do you think it really is herpes based on my description? 7. Lastly, we do kiss a lot too and even do oral sex. But no cold sores or whatsoever for both of us. Do you think this positive result viral culture test could be WRONG? 8. That Acyclovir, what is it for? And when will you apply it? Like once you feel the symptoms or if blisters are now appearing? Thank you!"

Last Nov 25, I had sore and lesions around my big nipples. Both of my nipples. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I EVER HAD THIS IN MY LIFE. A day before that, I made love to my husband. That was the last sex I had with him before this condition happened. We almost do this at least 3 times a week. He loved sucking my big nipples using his teeth and I had a feeling that's the reason why it got aggravated. Again, we have been doing this. On the 26th, I felt the pain more - like a stabbing pain. I suspected it got worse coz of my tight-fitting shirt and my bra. I decided to wear loose shirt and then apply bacitracin. Moreover, to soothe the pain, I cleaned it using water with apple cider vinegar and then apply some coconut oil because I suspected it to be a fungal/yeast infection caused by candida, or a nipple thrush, even if I'm not lactating (based on my research, possible to have it even for non-lactating women).  Then on the 27th, I felt better with the help of that coconut oil but the pain is still there and it's manageable. And then I noticed white bumps. One white bump on my left areola then 2 on my right areola. Pls note, this does not look like tiny blister in cluster forms. They looked like some sort of a hair follicle infection – well at least to me. You know, those dots around the areola? I believe that's an areolar gland. So, that's where the bumps are. Then on my left breast, it has some redness. I got panicked coz I began to think it could be breast inflammatory cancer or what so we decided to go the hospital on the 28th.  At the emergency, the doctor asked me for any symptoms. I don't feel any weirdness going on my body, like fatigue, loss of appetite or fever. I felt normal except this pain I have with my nipples and areola. The doctor could not say what this could be so she suggested me to have swab test on these bumps by breaking them. (Man, it hurt! I thought I have to undergo mammogram/MRI screening, etc. But nope!) One for herpes through viral culture test and the other one is for bacterial infection. Then, she gave me a prescription for a 4-mix cream, which includes anti-bacterial cream, desitin, chlotrimazole and hydrocortisone. I applied this twice a day and I could see the progress. A day after that, the ER doctor referred me to an infectious disease specialist while waiting for the results. Basically, she is also unaware about my condition and can't rule out yet. But she said it COULD NOT BE HERPES. So, I was glad to hear that. She prescribed me an oral antibacterial pills for 5 days. Again, I saw some progress. My nips and areola began to heal.  Then today, I felt like they are doing pretty well now but I still continued applying that 4-mix cream. My happiness subsided when I received a phone call from that specialist and told me that I have a positive result for HERPES TYPE1 and positive result on bacterial infection. Like WHAT?!!! I was so emotional and depressed. I have a prescription called acyclovir but I did not take it. Due to that, I wasn't able to ask these questions to my doctor. Appreciate if you could enlighten me this. And sorry for a long post. 1. Is it possible really to have herpes type 1 on your nipples and areola? Before this condition happened, I had an IgG blood test and it was negative for both types 1 and 2 last Jan 2016. I took this test coz my GYN told me to do so as I had some sort of a cut in my genital area. My husband also had a negative result. AND NOW, a positive result through viral culture test. HOW COULD THIS BE POSSIBLE? I only have a monogamous relationship. But my hubby got 2 other relationships before me. He did not notice any abnormalities like cold sores happened on his body throughout his life. 2. Herpes type 1 is not an STD-type of thing? 3. This is still unacceptable for me. For how long should I wait til I have that next IgG blood test again? I wanna ensure if these lab test results are accurate. 4. Speaking of accuracy, is the viral culture test reliable? Can it be a false positive? 5. Are there any other reliable tests to prove if one (who is not experiencing any symptoms) is positive or negative herpes aside from this viral culture test and blood test?

Then today, I felt like they are doing pretty well now but I still continued applying that 4-mix cream. My happiness subsided when I received a phone call from that specialist and told me that I have a positive result for HERPES TYPE1 and positive result on bacterial infection. Like WHAT?!!! I was so emotional and depressed. I have a prescription called acyclovir but I did not take it. Due to that, I wasn't able to ask these questions to my doctor. Appreciate if you could enlighten me this. And sorry for a long post. 1. Is it possible really to have herpes type 1 on your nipples and areola? Before this condition happened, I had an IgG blood test and it was negative for both types 1 and 2 last Jan 2016. I took this test coz my GYN told me to do so as I had some sort of a cut in my genital area. My husband also had a negative result. AND NOW, a positive result through viral culture test. HOW COULD THIS BE POSSIBLE? I only have a monogamous relationship. But my hubby got 2 other relationships before me. He did not notice any abnormalities like cold sores happened on his body throughout his life. 2. Herpes type 1 is not an STD-type of thing? 3. This is still unacceptable for me. For how long should I wait til I have that next IgG blood test again? I wanna ensure if these lab test results are accurate. 4. Speaking of accuracy, is the viral culture test reliable? Can it be a false positive? 5. Are there any other reliable tests to prove if one (who is not experiencing any symptoms) is positive or negative herpes aside from this viral culture test and blood test? I'm talking about after the outbreak. Like if you don't feel any symptoms, yet you want to know if there are herpes anti-bodies present. 6. How can you tell if it's herpes? Like I said, I felt tingling and painful sensation, a bit of redness only on my one breast, lesions around my nipples and some white bumps. But these white bumps are not in cluster form though…. With the help of the cream, it somehow worked. Now, they looked ok and normal to me. Do you think it really is herpes based on my description? 7. Lastly, we do kiss a lot too and even do oral sex. But no cold sores or whatsoever for both of us. Do you think this positive result viral culture test could be WRONG? 8. That Acyclovir, what is it for? And when will you apply it?

Last Nov 25, I had sore and lesions around my big nipples. Both of my nipples. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I EVER HAD THIS IN MY LIFE. A day before that, I made love to my husband.

He loved sucking my big nipples using his teeth and I had a feeling that's the reason why it got aggravated. Again, we have been doing this. On the 26th, I felt the pain more - like a stabbing pain. I suspected it got worse coz of my tight-fitting shirt and my bra. I decided to wear loose shirt and then apply bacitracin. Moreover, to soothe the pain, I cleaned it using water with apple cider vinegar and then apply some coconut oil because I suspected it to be a fungal/yeast infection caused by candida, or a nipple thrush, even if I'm not lactating (based on my research, possible to have it even for non-lactating women).  Then on the 27th, I felt better with the help of that coconut oil but the pain is still there and it's manageable. And then I noticed white bumps. One white bump on my left areola then 2 on my right areola. Pls note, this does not look like tiny blister in cluster forms. They looked like some sort of a hair follicle infection – well at least to me. You know, those dots around the areola? I believe that's an areolar gland. So, that's where the bumps are. Then on my left breast, it has some redness. I got panicked coz I began to think it could be breast inflammatory cancer or what so we decided to go the hospital on the 28th.

That day I started to look at the reasons why I would have this. The first and most noticeable diagnosis was BV. I have been with the same partner sexually for a while and I’ve never had this symptom happen until this last time we had sex. 2 days after to be exact is when the smell started to appear. I’ve made an appointment with my obgyn but the latest they can see me is 5 days from now. My question is, will it cause even worse infections if I don’t get it checked out and treated ASAP. I’ve read horror stories on how it causes infertility and I’m terrified. Should I just go into urgent care and get tested for it or will I be safe just waiting until my appointment.

It started as my tail bone when i fell really hard directly on it, this transitioned to lower back pain and at this point i began going to physio because my posture was terrible and i had to sit out a lot in basketball because it would hurt to walk. Once my lower back pain started to go away i began to get an achy pain on the left side of my chest around my third and forth rib but only when walking for long periods of time. When i would try and stretch out my rib cage it would feel extremely tight and tender. This pain then started to occur every day started about a year and a half ago so i went to the doctor and got and x ray and nothing was wrong. He said it was probably just a muscle strain and that i should just take muscle pain medications. 10 months after that i started seeing an active release therapist because the pain spread all around my chest and the middle of my back. Some times throughout the day i would get sharp stabbing pains in my chest and awful knots all in my shoulder blades and down my spin. And sometimes when i would run my chest muscles would randomly contract and i would be extremely short of breath and could only take short quick ones. The painful spot on my rips feels like a bruise to touch. Also, when i lean forwards and backwards slightly my ribs on the left side pop back and forth. I cant take a deep breath without my whole rib cage hurting and feeling restricted. Also when i suck my stomach in you can see that the left side sticks out more than the right. The active release therapist discovered that I had a rib out of place for about a year and all the muscles around it had adjusted to that position so apparently the muscles are all messed up around that spot. Sorry im all over the place I just have alot to say but if anyone has any answers or comments that would be great. From doing research on every single symptom that occurs, almost every result points to slipping rib syndrome but im not sure if that its way more serious than what im facing."

My foreskin covers my whole glans and I'm unable to pull it back when my penis is erect, I'm aware this is called phimosis.  I've been to the doctor and he almost immediately signed me up for circumcision, but I told him I wanted to test my options first, so I asked him to prescribe me a steroid cream, because maybe I could fix this ""manually"". He gave me Elocon, he told me to apply it once a day for 3 weeks, I did it for 2 weeks including stretches 20min per day, and it hasn't changed at all. I can feel the skin around the whole glans has loosened up a bit, but the ""ring"" at the end of my penis is still just as tight, there is no way to pull it back at all.  I've looked at youtube videos and read some articles here and there about circumcision, but there's always an agenda behind it, either they are trying to force it on people or they are saying by being circumcised your penis will look like a chewed up piece of gum and you'll lose a lot of sensitivity including the frenulum.  I want to ask for other options, maybe even an appointment with a urologist (I've been to a general doctor), because I want surgery to be my very last option, however I am pretty tired of this and I am growing impatient. I'd like to know if there are any other options, other than steroid creams or circumcision that I could consider.  And also, is it really true that circumcising your penis will cause it to look ""dried up""? Sincerely thank you in advance"

I have been having vaginal burning off and on for the last six months or so.  The history...I went to my obgyn about a year ago and requested to be “tested for everything.” She took a blood sample, and when I came in for results two weeks later she said “everything is totally fine, the only thing that came back positive is the herpes.” Threw paperwork in my hands and left the room. Needless to say I have found a new dr since. I was completely shocked because I did not suspect anything and was just going for my yearly screening in an attempt to be sexually responsible. Upon further review of my test results, I saw that My igm was positive for hsv2 (1:80) and my igg was negative for both hsv 1 and 2 (0.09) I spoke to a friend who is an obgyn in another state and she told me this was a useless test and in the absence of an outbreak, it meant nothing. I did not think I had ever had an outbreak, but once I thought about it, I remembered having what I thought was a yeast infection about 2 days after a one night stand with a questionable guy. I had the usual itching and burning and one bump-like area. It was basically swollen and red with a tiny Whitehead in the center, no bigger than a pin head. To me it looked like an inflamed hair follicle. I have had similar bumps with a yeast infection before and so I figured that’s what it was. It didn’t hurt at all. I treated for a yeast infection and the bump and symptoms went away in about 3 days. I spoke to my dr about this and she said it didn’t sound like an outbreak. We had sex one time and used a condom. This was the only new partner I had had since my last full panel the previous year, which was negative for everything. Also, I had been with this guy only about a month before the blood test, so I guess it’s not likely that it would have shown up yet. However, I worry that this is why only the igm was positive, and this raised my concern. I went ahead and told my boyfriend all of this, and he decided he loved me and didn’t care if I had it or not :-) He decided he wanted to continue to have unprotected sex. I continud with no symptoms we recognized as herpes, but I did have some occasional burning and one time was felt like diaper rash on my butt. It was a hot humid summer in New York, so this didn’t seem too strange. Any time I felt something weird, my boyfriend would get down there with a flashlight and check it out. He always decided things looked fine and he still wanted to have sex. After a few months my boyfriend got a blood test for hsv2 which was negative. We figured this meant I was probably negative since we had been having lots of unprotected sex, even when I had what felt like similar yeast infections. (I have always been very prone to them.) However, I have now been having burning in my vaginal area off and on for several months. There is no odor or discharge associated with this burning, and it is generalized over my entire vagina. The burning is worse after I pee, not on my urethra, but on my labia. Twice I went to my dr for this, the first time I was diagnosed with a uti, which I thought was strange since I get them all the time and this didn’t feel like one. The second time (new dr) she said everything looked totally normal. Most recently, I started to feel the burning again and I got out the mirror and flashlight. I found two tiny little white bumps that looked like the regular kinda “chicken skin” bumps that we have all over our genital skin, just slightly raised. Again, the size of a pinhead. No redness this time. This was on a Saturday, and I told myself I would go to the dr Monday, finally get a swab, and have some diffinitive answers. Although I wasn’t sure there was really anything to break open and swab. But by Monday the tiny bumps were gone, although the burning persisted. Tuesday I got my period. The burning is very mild now, but worse after I pee, and it hurts a little to put tampons in and take them out, mostly at the opening of my vagina. The pain and burning is not localized to any “spots” but generalized over my entire vagina. I had this kind of pain inserting my tampons during my period once a couple months ago as well. It feels similar to when my vagina is very dry. Could I be suffering from vaginal dryness? Or could this general burning and sensitivity be herpes outbreaks? Could these tiny bumps that I have noticed that lasted 2 days be herpes? I have considered getting the blood test again, but my dr says it won’t really tell us anything. It would be great to know my status definitively, but my real concern is knowing if/when I’m having an outbreak so that I don’t pass it to my partner. Also, if these are simply mild outbreaks, I can stop going to the dr and getting tested for a million things every time i have this burning. I have not experienced any tingling, numbness or itching, or noticed anything that I perceived as a “blister” or “lesion.” I’m not sure if I am being over or under cautious. I am a 34 y/o female with a history of utis and yeast infections."

I have not experienced any tingling, numbness or itching, or noticed anything that I perceived as a “blister” or “lesion.” I’m not sure if I am being over or under cautious. I am a 34 y/o female with a history of utis and yeast infections."

The two first times where infection so the doctor gave me antibiotics. Its been a year and recently i noticed my urine to be cloudy again so i went to doctor. Did a test again plus a sonography. He didn't give me antibiotics and suggested that i drink more water. Im just worried that maybe my urince getting cloudy/infection frequently has something to do with the skin to skin i had with that girl. I experience no symptoms of burning or unusual skin stuff on my penis. But im worried about the type of sti that doesn't have symptoms. Im 18 now and that girl was virgin when we did that. So do i need to take a blood test?"

I've seen many doctors in the States but haven't had much success regarding the daily pain. When I was traveling abroad recently, I decided to see a urologist there to see if anything different could be done for me. The doctor gave me a 30-day prescription for 2 medications: acetaminophen & tramadol. I learned that acetaminophen is the chemical name for Tylenol, but in the country I was in, a much stronger version of it was available via prescription. When taking both provided noticeable relief, I went to that doctor again right before I left the country and asked if prescription-level acetaminophen & tramadol can be taken long-term. He said yes. But when I saw my doctor here after returning to the States, he said they are not to be taken continuously for an extended period of time. I was devastated because I felt that I finally found a pain management system that really worked. So my question arises from these conflicting answers from the doctors. Can prescription-level acetaminophen & tramadol be taken continuously for an extended period of time (e.g., years)?"

Chances this is a UTI related to e coli or something else? Chances I did get an STI?  Thank you in advance. I’m awaiting the std panel results, I just wanted additional feedback.  J"

During those five days I still felt a burning and itchy sensation while urinating. Went to my primary care on Friday and she had a culture of my urine sent in, it came back negative. She referred me to a urologist but now I’m thinking that it could be a yeast infection.I felt okay on Friday. On Saturday, during the midday the urgency to use the restroom became unbearable and I had to go buy azo. I am Still having burning and itchinesses. I’ve been off of azo for 2 days so far and feeling alright. I’m not sure if i am mistaking the discomfort for urgency to go to the bathroom. I feel relief when wiping as if pressure is helping me. Also I’m noticing that the pain seems to be coming below my urethra. I don’t know what to do. Im afraid to call it one over the other. I’ve been drinking plenty of water as well. Today I have had a lot of period like cramps although it is not yet time for my menstral period. I’m at a loss. I have an appointment on Thursday with the urologist."

Would it be possible, mind ya, just possible for a nurse or doctor to measure my penis for me? I know that sounds rather filthy. But to be honest, I haven't a clue what size I am. My wife has told me that I'm above average. Nevertheless, I'm just not satisfied with that answer. Ya know. I hope you won't be offended by this question."

I had foot surgery and was incapacited with a foot cast. To get around I was given crutches and had used the crutches for 2 months before I graduated to the walking boot. Due to the cast, the uncomfortable posture, and sleeping in bed with a huge cast, my spine and whole body was mis-aligned. I first went to a chiropractor who manipulated and adjusted me into proper alignment. But I was having numbness in my left arm all the way down to the ring finger and little finger. Tingling, numbness in the arm, and a ""crick"" in the neck.  I went back to the chiropractor for a 2nd adjustment, and again it re-aligned my spine...but did not relieve the pain. I continued to read up on this condition, and thought it was ulnar nerve problems. I decided to see an Osteopathic physician which turned out great decision. He determined that the nerve which exits the C-6 to C-8 vertebrae area and passes thru the shoulder and down into the elbow was not ""pinched"" by the vertebrae, but constricted due to the muscles in the neck-shoulder area. Called Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. The Osteopathic physician's method of adjustment was tender and uses muscle resistance to re-align the area as compared to the Chiropracters violent and sudden movement. Plus the Osteopath took much more time to actually diagnose the problem.   It has taken a visit once a month for the past 3 months to resolve. And a nerve takes up to 5-6 months or possibly 1 year to re-generate the feeling. Also I lost strength in the forearm and dexterity in the fingers by about 75% so I am back at the gym lifting weights to strengthen the forearm. The strength and dexterity in each finger is tested by squeezing a blue racketball throughout the day until the grip strength returns.   Although this was not life-threatening, it would be un-forseeable to have known that the use of crutches would have caused so much mis-alignment of my body and these subsequent issue."

So... my boyfriend and I had sex last night, and there was an instance where he “missed” and hit my posterior fourchet pretty hard. I was a bit drunk so I didn’t notice until today, but I have a huge tear on that area. It’s about an inch long I think, and probably 1/4 inch wide. It really scares me because while I’m used to having small tears after sex, this one is quite big and worries me. I’m keeping it clean and protected, but I’m jut wondering if this is a serious problem... it’s not deep at all and doesn’t really hurt that much. It’s just pretty worrying for me...."

I am a 19 year old woman with no major health problems as far as I know. For a while - probably since I got my period? - my underwear has been getting stained light brownish-yellow. I'm honestly not sure why. It seems to be some kind of discharge, but doesn't match anything else. Sometimes it smells, but not always.  It seems to occur more often during my ovulation, but can occur before and after.  I also have no idea how to get it out of my underwear. It's ruining most of my underwear and it's quite frustrating. Panty liners are too expensive and too much of a hassle, especially since it doesn't actually happen every day."

For at least 8 years now I have had back pain that has gotten too much to bare. The main issue is my lower back and feels like a slipped disc pressing on a nerve, but it doesnt go down my leg. It feels like the left and right sides of the lowest part of my spine. It gets so bad sometimes that I have to lean my body to the left because I cant straighten it out without severe pain. This pain comes and goes and has no real rhyme or reason. Sometimes its when I first wake up, other times its in the middle of the day like right now. The other pain happens in the middle of my back and seems to come when I have been standing too long. This also is on the left and right of the spine in the middle of my back. This pain also comes and goes, but will almost always happen in I have done some sort of project where I have been standing for awhile. This one might have a lot to do with being out of shape. I am a 5'11"" male, 42 years old, and about 228 last time I was weighed. I am currently exercising and eating better to get this weight down in hopes it alleviates some of the pain, and just to be in better shape. But I doubt the disc issue will be resolved just by getting in shape, but might improve.   I dont have a primary doctor at the moment, but I have called the local orthopedic surgeons office in hopes of getting some help. I know I should have gotten some help for this a long time ago, but there is a reason why Id rather not get into. My question is this. If it is indeed a slipped/ herniated disc will it show up in an MRI if the disc isnt slipped when they do it? Is there some other sign that will show that the doctor will be able to verify? I am 99% sure its slipping based on the way it feels like its pinching a nerve, but have read that this usually also causes shooting pains down the leg, which is not the case with me.  Anyway I thought I would post here for any advice or info someone might have. Thank you in advance."

I never fully returned to my past levels of activity. But overall the surgery seems to have been a success. Example, I quit organized sports but could go about my daily business more or less. In the past two years I have been experiencing discomfort - more recently pain if I stand on it for too long. Even basic and low impact cardio workouts like the stationary bike seem to create discomfort.  I'm curious if others have had similar issues and how they've made out down the road after such an Injury? I am relatively young (40) and am frustrated that even light activities that promote healthfulness such as skipping rope or cycling are causing issues.  My goal is to stay healthy for myself and family but I can't seem to do much without aggravating my knee.  I am wondering if there are any people in the community that have had significant meniscal repairs done and if they have had similar challenges.  If so, what did you do?  Did you improve it through physical therapy?  Have you used supplements?  Did you have to get more surgery?  Did you develop arthritis?  I am also curious what my prospects are for the next hopefully 40 years? Am I definitely facing a knee replacement down the road? My doctor that did the original surgery did a fine job in my opinion but for follow up these days seems to think the repair is holding up (judging via x ray). He is super busy and I am considering a second opinion but wanted to hear from others how they have been coping. I am often down in the dumps that there is so little I can do without feeling set back - including playing w my kids.  Thanks,  AG"

Ever since for the past 5 months it has not fully gone away. Every morning it starts off very dull and thought out the day is varies on intensity, some days are worse than other and sometimes it remains very tolerable.  My first visit to my doctor was for a regular physical and some blood test, everything was good; the only thing was that my liver enzymes were a little elevated, but overall there was nothing alarming. The Doctor gave me ibuprofen to alleviate the pain, after taking them for 4 days I stopped since it was no working.  I took a CT SCAN w/o contrast to the brain, again nothing irregular, for most part of April, I went to two different chiropractors thinking it was my neck/back that was pinching a nerve causing pain to the head, they even worked on my jaw muscles to see if anything was wrong in that area. After the month of April was over I figured I had to find another explanation because nothing seen to make it better.  I went to the dentist and they recommended me to use a mouth guard since there were sings of teeth grinding and jaw clinching, to this day I use them every night but that seems to not be the cause. Also went to get my eyes checked, but everything was good, although I was told that my eyes were very dry, so they prescribed FLUOROMETHOLONE 0.1% drops to take care of that, again; no signs that it caused the pain. I took them for two weeks and then moved on. Went back to my doctor, had another blood test, only to have the same results. I went on to take an MRI w/o contrast to the brain, and a few weeks later went to a Neurologist 06/01/2016. The MRI showed some “abnormalities of the posterior right periventricular white matter, representing a small area of “encephalomalacia/gliosis. The sequel of periventricular leukomalacia would be one possible etiology.” Based on that he prescribed AMITRIPTYLINE HCL- 10 MG TABLET, and FLURBIPROFEN- 50MG, those were for muscle/mood relaxing, and inflammatory pain reliever. He also recommended for me to see an Ear, Nose and Throat doctor to see if the pain was caused by a possible sinusitis problem. As told; I went there, he he checked my mouth and inside my nostrils. There were no sign of any sinusitis and I was back to square one. Its been 5 moths now and I cant find any clue as to what can be causing this tension headaches. The pain varies as far as the location (sometimes is on top, side, back of the head). As far as the intensity of the pain, it is very random (some days are very intense and other are very mild/dull). On 07/07/2016 I had and appointment with my Neurologist again for a month check-up. He did not help at all. I then started to learn/practice trigger therapy, with little results. On 11/01/2016 went in for physical therapy, worked on strengthening my shoulders and neck area. After a month i was release by the doctor because I did not get better.

MRI came back okay, and so did extensive bloodwork. My GP believes I have Trigeminal Neuralgia, and prescribed me a low dose of Gabapentin that is not really helping.

I am 20 years old, and had periods since I was a teenager. For the past two years, I have always had regular periods (28days), and most periods started on the expected date, while some were early or late only be one or two days.  My (usual) PMS symptoms are: cramping, mood swings, and discharging of large amounts of fluid from the vagina. Also, usually during mensuration, I have cramping and mood swings.  However, since February, these things started to change: On February, my period was supposed to start on February 27th, but started on the 24th. Not only was the period 3 days early (which has almost never happened to me before), but I also did not have any PMS symptoms before menstruation (but still had extreme cramping during the menstruation).  Then, the next period, which should've started on March 24th, started on April 5th, almost 2 weeks late. This time, I experienced very little PMS symptoms, and during menstruation, had the same amount of extreme cramping. Lastly, my period is supposed to start on May 3rd, but it still isn't starting(meaning that my period is three days late), and I feel no cramping whatsoever. (no signs of PMS) However, I urinate more frequently, and the bottom part of my vagina hurts (it has a stinging sensation). Also, when I urinate or hold my urine, that stinging pain becomes more painful. Additionally, the left side of my pelvis feels like it’s being pressured (that pain increases when I lie down).  Also, regarding the fluid that is discharged from my vagina (which I have mentioned above) Usually, that fluid is mostly transparent and white, odorless, and is discharged in large amounts during menstruation. However, during the last couple of weeks, it has become yellow, form small chunks (like smashed tofu), and smells like fish. Also, instead of discharging lots of that fluid during menstruation, they were discharged in large amounts since two weeks ago (two weeks ‘before’ the expected period). They were discharged in very large amounts). Then once the expected period date arrived, they are almost not being discharged at all(but it still smells like fish). The length of mensturation remains the same (5 days)  When I was in 9th grade, because my cramping during and menstruation was so severe, I had an ultrasound test to check if the excessive amount of pain was due to any secondary causes (such as diseases). However, the ultrasound confirmed that I had no such diseases. (Although this test was done a few years ago, I am still bringing this up just in case it may help)  What could be causing these irregularities in the timing of my period and the change in the fluid in the vagina? I mean, for two whole years, my period and everything stayed relatively constant, then all of a sudden, the PMS symptoms are different, the days are not periodic, and the vaginal discharge has changed.  **Also, I had my first sex a weeks ago. Could this be the cause? Please don't be afraid to make guesses or ask questions, as I'm guessing that the information that I have posted enough may not be sufficient enough for a full examination.

The more things I did on the computer, the more painful doing everyday activities would get. So finally, I got an MRI done this summer that says there is scar tissue on one of the elbow tendons and it seems to be an old injury. I am now 25.  My MD is an acupuncturist and I love that about him. Although today I went ahead and began his treatment method... I have some doubts and fears about it.  His method involves injecting small doses of Vitamin B12 directly on the pain/injury site. He placed them in about 10 places that were giving me trouble/pain. He said it will help soften the adhesion I think..  Anything I should be worried about? It's just Vitamin B12. He said that this is not a method that is done in the states and that it's kind of new.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I have 2 more sessions of the doses. He said he normally does one, but because this isn't tendinitis and an actual injury of the tendon, he needs to do a few more doses than usual."

Just sitting on the toilet does not cause discomfort; only at the point that my stool begins to exit is when the discomfort occurs. My stool frequently comes out as pellets. The discomfort feels like a sharp muscle pain that runs from the top backside of my thigh to back of my knee. The pain is very severe and debilitating, it forces me to lay down for about 20 minutes. After 20 minutes the pain has fully subsided. This occurs everytime I have a bowel movement. Outside of the pass two weeks, this has never occured.

I don’t know if this is normal or I have a health problem. I’m asking here because I’ve looked it up and I’m not getting many helpful answers :( so maybe it would be better to describe my specific case: I would like to try having sex with my boyfriend. I have been masturbating for several years and can give myself an orgasm easily by stimulating the clitoris (it feels really nice and healthy for me and I would like to try and go the “whole way” as a change to see what that also feels like). However, we have never had actual penetrative sexual intercourse even though we have been trying for about 7 months - this is because it is so extremely painful for me whenever he attempts to enter me. I get a very painful sharp, stabbing kind of pain along with a burning feeling. It gets so bad that I have ended up screaming or crying a few times from how painful it is. It feels like I’m being torn in half. Some of these times I have urged him through tears to keep trying and push it in despite the pain but it just won’t go in. It feels sometimes like my body is rejecting having something inside it. The furthest he has ever got inside me was the tip of his penis.  I went to a doctor about it and:  I was asked, is there enough foreplay? Am I naturally lubricated enough? I think I am, and I have used artificial lubricant as well because it helps. I feel very ready and ‘in the mood’ before we try it, it’s just when it actually happens that the pain comes in. I don’t get the same “sandpaper” feeling some women get either.  I know I don’t have a sexually transmitted infection because my boyfriend has never had a sexual partner in any way before me and vice versa.  The doctor told me that if I can insert a tampon, I do not have a serious health issue like vaginismus. I had never used tampons before, but I tried it, and it went in fine, a bit of discomfort but no pain.   After this I tried using a toy since it is a bit bigger than a tampon (but still quite a bit smaller than the real thing). It went in fine, the same as the tampon, with a bit of discomfort but still no pain.  Although this is all fine, whenever I try with my boyfriend it is always the same - unbearably painful, and every time has started to feel like an ordeal even though I am the one asking him to try it. I feel really disheartened about the whole thing. I feel like I will never be able to have sex or enjoy it. I feel like I should just tell my boyfriend that I want to give up trying and just go without - but the idea of it is really disappointing, he and I wanted to experience this very normal and healthy part of adult life together.  Thank you for reading, if anyone has any idea about what could be wrong it is much appreciated! I am so stuck on what to do, and I want to know if I am normal!"

My boyfriend went to the doctor and he told him he didn’t have herpes and what he had on his penis was dermatitis. All my results have come back and my urine culture came back ambnoral and have Strep B and the herpes culture came back positive but can’t tell me if it’s 1 or 2.  My doctor does no have any bedside manor and can’t help me with any explanations. I’m left in the dark. I told my bf to get a blood tear. My igg blood test is negative so it must have been just transmitted. Everything does not make sense but I don’t understand why I can’t find out now which HSV I have. Can someone help me?"

I have some blood pressure issues and at times it used to shoot up to 160/130 and similar numbers. So my cardiologist put me on Diovan80 half dose.  The problem is, after visiting doctors frequently I started to feel mentally disturbed and always used to think that I am sick, my heart beat used to go up due to this and get palpitations. Due to which i consulted a psychiatrist and she put me on Cipralex and Rivotril (1/4th dose).  Now since I have started taking them, I have issues keeping an erection and masturbating. Previously my libido was perfect, like I used to masturbate twice a day. But now it makes it harder for me to do it just once. I take cipralex before sleeping, so what I did was masturbate before taking the medicine and it worked.  I just want to know if these side effects will go away when I'll stop using this medicine. My doctor said its nothing to worry about (maybe she wants to calm me down), but as I am an adult now, I do have a fear of not being able to function properly sexually. I have a whole life ahead, and I cant afford to have this disability for the rest of my life. I would appreciate an experienced doctor or individual to help me out on this issue!"

A little background information: My wife had surgery on her right rotator cuff over a year ago. She was given a nerve block to assist with the pain after surgery; however we believe something went seriously wrong. As it was being done by the anesthesiologist, she could hear the assistant saying it wasn’t working and they did not get the right spot before she was completely sedated for surgery.  She developed a lump on her sternum where the nerve block was done shortly after the surgery, and it is causing her considerable pain when moving her head and neck, reaching for items, etc. We returned to the orthopedic surgeon, and he was at a loss as to what it was. Physiotherapy was suggested, but it did not help; nor did several cortisone shots. However, the physiotherapist suggested it could be scar tissue. She had an MRI, however it was inconclusive.  We returned to the surgeon, and he now believes it is arthritis, and says it is common. It seems odd he was at a loss before, and can now make a diagnosis without any sort of image. Has anyone heard of this or had it happen to them? Any suggestions would be most appreciated. Many thanks."

The issue started after I had the most horrendous UTI in late January. The first antibiotics I was given did not work for my infection and the UTI started to become a kidney infection as well, so I went back to the doctor and got new antibiotics and everything started to clear up right away. However, ever since then I've been experiencing just some general vaginal discomfort. It ISN'T itchy, and I wouldn't necessarily classify it as a burning sensation either, it's just uncomfortable. It seems to be most prevalent first thing in the morning and then again in the evenings, with some normalization during mid-day. Other than this I don't seem to have any other vaginitis symptoms. I have used at home tests to test my ph, both urine and the actual vagina, and both are in normal range. Is it possible to have some sort of infection when your ph is in normal range? One other thing to note is that I don't tend to have symptoms when I have a yeast infection. The one time I was told I had a yeast infection by a doctor was when I went for a completely unrelated reason and they drew some blood and told me I had a yeast infection as well, even though I had ZERO symptoms. I've been scouring the internet like crazy, researching BV/Yeast infections/UTIs, hoping to find an answer as to what is wrong with me but can't find anything that is similar to my case. Really the only symptom is vaginal discomfort. It's made me weary about having sex with my husband and has been a real damper on our physical relationship. I'm stressed and he is worried about making anything worse.  I'm really hoping for some insight from the internet, and I know everyone is going to say ""Go to your doctor,"" but I can't because I don't have any insurance. Going to the clinic twice before for that UTI already hurt my wallet and I'm afraid if I go again and they check my ph that shows no sign of infection they're going to say nothing is wrong or at least nothing that they can see, and then I'll have to say goodbye to another $100. As soon as I have insurance I will be finding an OBGYN, but at this point it's not possible. But is just simple vaginal discomfort a sign of anything when you have no other symptoms and it's been going on for a couple months? Please Help! Thank you for taking the time to read this!"

I have been to my doctor and he gave me an antibiotic ( I had come off a flu) - but to no avail - Then a urologist gave me some cream and told me nothing was wrong with my penis but by then it had healed up pretty good.

Guess I'll start typing and when I get to it, I'll tell ya. It's rather embarrassing and awkward. I'm 39-year-old married guy, who has a very unusual sex life. I cannot emphasize this more. I was never sexually educated when I was younger. I used pornography as a sort of ""guide"". Genre pornography I find so fascinated are oral sex and manual stimulation. However, I can't seem to figure out why? Which has left me with many, unanswered questions, questions that anybody, without the exception of me of course, should know? Things like, what does foreplay involve besides kissing and caressing? How long am I expected to be down between my wife's legs? Why do I not get excited when I’m touching her? It is not linked to my wife, she finds having intercourse enjoyable, I do not. So the problem is not applied to her.  My wife like so many has occasionally performed Fellatio. I have heard so many guys, reading from forums that is, how much enjoyment they have from this. I do not. Mainly because I can't keep an erection when she does this. Weird, right? Nor can I ejaculate when this occurs. What is the correct response? All I do is stare at her like she is doing something wrong. I've tried several times to shut my eyes, you know like they do in ""dirty movies"", but still I can't find any enjoyment of this.  I have told her how this has occurred prior to getting married. Same problem. It's like some kind of sexual block. And no I had never been sexually abused. There are a lot of sexual activities I do not enjoy, for example, when she performs an oral sex act by (allowing) me to insert my testicles into her mouth. It is painful. Also, whenever I obtain an erection, my penis will swell and begin to pulsate very tensely. When this happens, it's indescribably painful. Do you suggest that sexual blockage would cause this kind of issue?"

Any Pain Med that doesn't cause Rebound Headaches?,"I have multiple pain issues; one ruptured disc, two herniated disc, stenosis, degenerative joint disease, arthritis, (all in the lower back). SI joint dysfunction, three mildly herniated in neck, chronic muscle spasms, all made worse by fibro and vice versa. I've been critically hypothyroid for three plus years. Now I'm slightly hyper (last two months) because I was put on NatureThroid. I go through periods of 80lb weight gain / loss in 6 weeks, (yes you read that right) for no obvious reason, for 20 years. But my thyroid's always good when it happens and that's good enough for the VA. No need to check anything else (of course, the head of the VA pain clinic is a sexual predator and they know it, so I'm not expecting much.) My problem, other than I have to get my medical treatment from a sub-par VA, is I also suffer from migraines and get rebound headaches. They're just as bad as migraines and I get them if I take more than three doses of pain meds per week (even just tylenol). I've been on (hydrocodone, naproxen, tylenol, toradol, motrin, asa; etc). Allergic to toradol, morphine, codiene, oxycodone (hydrocodone causes severe itching but it's what I use when it's that or eat a bullet.) When I get a rebound headache they can last for weeks, the longest has been a month. My question is there any pain medication that doesn't cause rebound HA's? I'm already on neurontin, nortriptyline, and a few other ""not actually"" pain medications and they are not cutting it. I also can't take anything herbal or that touts itself as being natural (because, believe me, that doesn't mean it's safe.) I do take Osteo-Biflex. It's getting to the point I can't do everyday activities like say, walk. I'm 45 and not going to be able to handle this much longer. Looking for any suggestions that aren't otc. I'm on some meds that wouldn't mix well with ""supplements"" and I tend to have a lot of allergies. Thanks"

I've been doing a pretty good job with the R.I.C.E. approach to it and have been popping some supplements to help build strength back up. I can bend my knee fine, straighten my leg out and raise it up and down. But there is still some MINOR discomfort and I'm probably at 70% with it.  I've been on the internet reading up and honestly I think it's just a bruised patella or bruised kneecap. Again I'm mobile (I even ran 5 miles last week) but it got kind of aggravated so I'm back to resting it until the discomfort goes away 100%.  Should I keep resting it or do you think I should go to the doctor and get an X-ray? I don't like doctors visits because they always end up hurting the wallet even when I am under United Healthcare.

My neck I numb to the point I feel as if I am choking which triggers my panic attacks and I feel like i'm having a heart attack. My left arm has a plate in it to hold the bone together. and my right foot was broke. They operated on my arm and put me in traction. Cause I was in a coma so they did nothing but make me comterble. They said I mightnot make it. so they called my family together. But with Gods help I made it though. for a year I went in a wheel chair and braces till they were sure my back was stable enough to operate. I was told there was only a small chance I would walk. again with Gods help I walk but the pain is unbarabe and the panic attacks were out of control. At first I was on 30 mil. gram and Xanax. Now I am at 15 mil. gram oxy and .5 Xanax. This I have been at for 4 or so years and it works I can shop, I can clean my house to a point, I can take care of my dieing husband and now my brother. I don't get the luxsury of not doing anything, just laying around on my ass. I only take my meds when needed. Now my Doctor took my Xanax saying I can't be on both cause of the new law. Now he has cut my oxy down from the 4 a day to 3 cause of the new law. Well I been reading up on this new law and I think he is doing this cause he handed out meds like candy. If I cod't have some real kind of help I will not be able to even get out of bed. So now they will have people who are in so much pain they can't get out of bed or they will kill there self, or will become a drug addict. believe me I seen it several times people getting drugs from the streets when there doctors don't help. there will be more home invastions , robberies, and deaths than before. and all because the doctors are now adding the ones like me that have a real reason to need help and get it and are being denied. This is a fix for those who don't need it cause once it is out of there system they are fine but people like me who live in hell from the pain will end up losing there life or looking else where and I don't want to end up doing either. I just want what was working for me and nothing more. It's a shame when a Doctor hands out meds to people who didn't need it and now take it out on people who do.."

My libido, which was outstanding prior to becoming sexually active, has been disappointingly low. I believe this is a symptom of my severe anxiety; however, I have recently been prescribes an SSRI (Celexa), and while it has assisted in treating my anxiety, I have not experienced an increase in sexual wellness; I did temporarily, but now I can only rarely even reach an erection, and when I do, it's only semi-erect. My partner is ridiculously understanding, but this causes dramatic insecurity for me within my own sex life. What can I do to fix this about myself? Is it safe to take an erectile dysfunction medication such as Sildenafil? I cannot let my Celexa prevent me from including sexual activity in my lifestyle."

I was diagnosed with spinal stenosis, severe multi-level degenerative disc disease, arthritis and my SI joint is a mess. Over the years I've had physio, acupuncture and chiropractic treatment. I've been on many medications and had to retire early from work. In January, 2015 I found an excellent massage therapist who got me back on my feet. I was taking 240 mg of morphine SR daily. I tried to come off this a couple of years ago with no success. However, over the last two years I've been able to slowly wean myself off it. It's one of the hardest things I've had to do. I cut down by 15 mg a month. As I decreased the withdrawal symptoms got more severe. Right now I am seven days free of any morphine and still suffering bad withdrawal. It's been the hardest week of my life. Is it worth it? Absolutely! I know this will get better. I still live with back pain but I'm managing through massage, exercises, Pilates and walking. I could barely walk the length of myself and on a good day now I can walk over an hour or more. I have to do stretches and alternate heat and ice but I'm so grateful to get back walking. I used to walk up to three hours years ago. Now I don't expect to get back to that but going for a walk now is my solace. Some days I can't go out at all. I have learned to live life on life's terms and take it one day at a time. Knowing what I know now I would never have gone on the morphine. At the time I felt I didn't have a choice. I just want to encourage others to never give up."

I went for a regular basketball workout and it went bad. After half an hour i start feeling pain in my heel, i still continued playing until it really started to hurt. After the workout i took off my shoe and my socks were really wet, so i took them off and saw a blister on both of my heels. It has been a week now, i still feel pain everytime i walk with shoes because the blister is quite deep and bleeds when going for intensive activities such as playing basketball. At first when i get my shoes on i feel pain but after my feet gets warm pain goes off a bit, but far not completely. Ive been training in pain for a week now and i stopped today, because i want it to heal. However ive been using some gel, sprays and plasters to cover/heal my blister but they didnt helped too much. Everytime i get back from college i see yellow fluid spots on my socks and im worried now because i need to heal it to continue my training. Everytime i walk in shoes i feel pain, i wear double socks, put on some plasters on the wound but they dont help too much. The blister gets covered in some yellow layer. I dont think i have infection in it because the wound around is not red, and hot either, plus theres no pus, its just covered in some yellow layer which (i think) pops when i walk and thats why i see yellow spots on my socks after getting back from college, however thats only my guess, so thats why i am here, to know what should i be aware of and how to heal it faster. Will be waiting for response, thanks."

I then started having back problems and arthritis wich I attribute to my fibromyalgia. my knee is now really starting to bother me and my doctor has told me I will probably need a replacement in 5 years or so. I have had the x rays and mri's and all of the tests. I am 53 years old and I understand I should have some problems but this pain is sometimes unbearable. I take hydrocodone along with my tramadol and it seems like they both have stopped working. I want to ask my doctor if I can take something a little stronger but I am afraid to because of all the people who have had a habit of taking narcotics for fun. they are ruining it for those of us who have actual pain and those of us who really need the pain meds. the doctors and government need to really take a look at this problem. most days I cannot get out of bed and do my daily chores. I cant work and I don't know how to get on disability. can anyone help me. I would be grateful.

A few years ago I fell down hard on my back and tried to break fall to stop from hitting my head on the ground. I immediately felt a sharp pain in my mid to upper back that caused my neck to feel as if I had whiplash. It went away after a week or so and to this day, it is still a problem. I have had X-Rays, MRIs, nothing shows anything.

Okay so 12 days ago i made the incredibly stupid decision to have sex with an escort, and probably sometime in between the last 2 minutes of the interaction the condom mustve broke. Didnt realize till ejaculation inside of her.  I ended up sleeping with my girlfriend unprotected the next day also.  Now i wasnt sure but i thought the next day i was feeling burning on my penis head but i couldnt tell you for sure if it was just nerves making me think i felt it. So on day 3 post exposure i went and got tested for HIV,Syphillis, chlamydia, gonorrhea and Hep C. All the test came back negative but i know its very early in the incubation period.I was told to come 3 weeks post exposure to be sure.  My girlfriend tells me today, 1 week post my exposure that she has a stomach ache. And i think i feel a little pain in my lower abdomen too. Which i am subtlety feeling too! The day after that she had somewhat of a fever and a headache which i also had the day after. Im very scared and dont know what to do. Also on day 2 i had loose stool and have had it ever since. Please let me know what to do! Do you think i have an std or even worse have given her one!? Also on my side, days 3-4 i thought i felt burning during ejaculation, it stopped afterwards. But last night during day 11 the burning came back slightly. There has been no TRUE discharge that i have noticed. Mainly just increased precum. I've talked to a doctor and nurse and they seem to think the chances i got anything are low but they want me to wait till about a week from now to retest."

I had a small rash on my lower back on the right side. It was itching and burning from time to time but the pain was not unbearable. I saw a dematologist few days later, and I was put on antivirus medication Acyclovir 800mg 5x, which I unfortunately started after one week of the rash appearing. Two more weeks and the rash started to heal and its now almost gone. The problem: after 4 weeks of the intitial symptoms, I now have a terrible itching feeling in all of my body (especially in the face and head) far from the rash area used to be. Could it be a shingles recurrence happening so soon? Should I expect a rash appearing on my face? Should I rush back into Acyclovir to prevent this from happening? The terrible itching feeling in the same area appeared suddenly without introduction after the rash on my lower back healed. I can also feel it a little bit in my arms and my feet. Its been going on for 3 days now, but no sign of new rash anywhere yet. Please advise me what to do. I'm confused. ​Walter"

It's a ""natural method"" of penis enlargement as I was very insecure of my size at the time. You basically use lube to ""milk"" the blood forward in the penis and trap it there. I followed all precautions but never the less, after only 3 weeks of doing it, I found that almost all of my sexual sensitivity was gone. I've seen many doctors and done endless research as I can't let myself quit. I've tried accepting it but I simply can't have any sort of healthy sex life if I don't find something as there is barely any sensitivity on my penis to generate an erection. FYI when I say pleasurable sensitivity, I mean the sexually pleasing sensitivity. I don't have any numbness where I can't feel my penis. Symptoms: -Spider veins in shaft that only show while erect. -White spots on glans (only show when flaccid) - Almost no pleasurable sensitivity on top or sides of shaft. Almost none on bottom until you get within an inch of the glans where it's about 30% what it used to be. - Glans are also 25-30% what they used to be except on right side where they're about 20%. glan and upper belly sensitivity go down to like 10% for a couple days if I masturbate then work their way back up (never used to happen, everything used to stay at 100%, I'd just be less horny.) -I have feeling in penis at all times, it has never gone completely numb but certainly has lost most of the sensitivity almost all of the pleasurable sensitivity in some areas. Just about every part of my body has more sensitivity than the bottom 3/4's of my shaft. - After injury, I masturbated every week or so to see if sexual feeling was getting better and a couple weeks in, I suddenly got a sharp pain on top left shaft very close to base while masturbating. It was while I was slightly pushing my erection downwards to make a 90 degree angle (which I had done a million times before). To relieve it, I had to pull erection to belly. After this happened twice, I quit masturbating for months. -If I do cobra pose to stretch abs/stomach, I get dull ache at top and sides of base of penis for awhile (didn't ever happen before injury). -I have 1 hard vein since injury. Not the largest main vein but probably equal to the 2nd largest. It's slightly buried under the skin and runs all the way from top center at base down to the top left base of glans. My guess is it's a dorsal artery.  After I quit masturbating like 2 months in, I think I made it like 3 months without it. Then after another week or 2, I stopped and probably made it like 6 months, then recently went 9 months and just started doing it again as my new Pelvic Floor therapist has instructed me to. She told me to keep everything in a comfortable position when doing it but after 9 months, anything that wants to heal would've and I should stimulate the nerves that are working. I've seen 3 urologists, all no help. They said they've never seen anything like it and let it heal itself. What I'd like to try and find out is if there's any tests or even new technologies anyone here might recommend I try. Stuff like Nerve growth factor or stem cells? Any tests that could actually locate or diagnose the problem. You know, tell me whether I have scar tissue, a partially torn ligament, compressed nerve, damaged nerve, etc. I'd like to pinpoint something because what if it is fixable? What if I could've been using some essential oil or vitamin this whole time to give a chance at healing? I can easily see a new urologist but if I do, I'd like to be prepared with a game plan on what tests I should get and why in case he's anything like the other 3 I've seen.  Also something I will mentioned real quick as a lot of people like to jump to this. This is not something that stays on my mind. This is not something that consumes me or has me depressed.

We are both completely healthy with no std history. In the last 6 months I have gone outside the relationship and have had isolated encounters with two women with unknown history, one in August 2017, the other, early January 2018. These were both protected vaginal intercourse encounters (condoms used). Early last month, I discovered a small, firm bump on my scrotum skin (like a small pea) which caused no pain but was slightly itchy (I do shave/manscape that area regularly). I became concerned and checked the web for some answers. I read that Apple cider vinegar applied to the area may turn colour on the case of HPV so I did so by dipping a Qtip in the vinegar then held on the area for a few minutes. The bump turned whitish, became inflamed then turned a dark red, probably burned due to the vinegar. A day later it grew to become a whitehead and I popped it in the shower (clearish coloured puss then blood). I became concerned over this and went to a clinic the next day for anonymous STI testing. They took a herpes swab of the sore (which was already scabbing) and did a full blood and urine test. The nurse told me she thought it looked like a cyst (but I've never had cysts before). As I was waiting for the results in early Feb I was also going through a bout of the flu (coughing, chills, muscle aches). I called two weeks ago and the results were negative - note 25 days had passed since the last sexual encounter and the test. They told me while results were negative they do NOT test for HPV/herpes in the blood - just the swab. A small comfort but I'm still concerned.

In the early years I used mostly over the counter pain killers, such as aspirin and Tylenol. Until the day, because of way too many Aspirins I developed an ulcer which went through my artery and I bled out without knowing it. Until I couldn't take it anymore and had lost 6 units of blood. I am thankful to be alive, after emergency surgery. After this I went on many different prescriptions meds, with many side effects. And years later settled on both Gabapentin and Tramacet which both have worked well for me for years. Yes I still have nerve pain shooting throughout my body, as well as muscle pain, but I can manage most of it. I do keep going as I don't sit very easily, I do keep busy. One more thing, as nerves travel throughout our bodies they can act up anywhere. For the last two months I have severe burning, itching on my Face and Neck. Scratching all the time. My Pharmacist one day suggested a product called Neuragen, it is meant for nerve pain. While it has a strong smell, it gives me at least 80% relief. Costly product here in BC, Canada. $60.00Cdn. for a 15ml Bottle, about 5oz.  All hard to live with at times, but my best advice is keep going, don't let it stop you."

It actually gets worse. It's essentially so painful I can barely breathe. It's definitely without a doubt NOT my lungs. I'm all too familiar with that pain, but this pain starts in the dead center of the middle of my back. It's been so intolerable that I almost called for an ambulance.......The pain doesn't even start until I lay down. About 2 hours after I wake the pain has slowly subsided & I go through the rest of the day virtually pain-free. Forget about that ""morning bathroom visit"" because I can't move (turn) to reach to wipe. It's become impossible to get a full night's sleep. I have tried the orthopedic and lumbar support pillows in the arch of my back and in between my knees to help level my spine with no relief whatsoever. I know something is wrong because I am very tall and grew too fast which I've been told can cause some back and/or knee pain. I have dealt with both since I was a preteen. However, this is a whole different issue. A completely different type of pain like I've never experienced. All that I've researched point to degenerative discs for the most part. Being only 27 years old with no children or injuries, I'm concerned this may be something worse. I'm not asking for a professional's diagnosis. I'm simply needing a personal opinion on if this will pass or, as my gut tells me, is something more serious that requires professional help."

I already take 80mg aspirin daily. I have used Biofreeze also to no effect. The area is so large that I can't zero in on ice packs or heating pads, but I do stand in the shower and run hot/cold water on the area. Again, no effect. My doc recommends physical therapy. I am already doing pulmonary therapy which includes light arm therapy. I have had massage therapy but again, I think I would have to have it every day to be effective.

In order to receive the MRI I will need to straighten BOTH my legs for upwards of FORTY minutes. I told the doctor this was NOT possible unless he wants to consciously sedate me. He refuses to do this, so I am stuck waiting on the couch.

The best for pounding headaches has been imitrex shots, the pills don't seem to give any relief. The next best thing is Hydrocodone and Extra Strength BC powers for milder ones.   My main question is: We have started living in Colorado in the summers now for the past 2 years. We live at 8500ft elevation. I seem to have fewer headaches at this altitude. We came home October 1st and my headaches have been almost continious the past 4 weeks. This was the the same thing that happened last year. I thought maybe it was a fluke but now really believe that I tend to have a less frequency of headaches at the higher altitude.  I've read where most people tend to have a greater frequency of headaches at higher altitudes and I just seem to be the opposite. Is this a possibility ??? Have others experienced this ?  Thanks"
