Last few months I'm having some issues/problems at works also with my wife. Its seems like all of sudden I've been burdens with all the issues at the same time and its feels likes I'm can't take it anymore. Previously.. i am a man that always find a way out to any problems comes in my life.. i always have a solutions for any of it.  But this time i don't know and I feels like helpless. I'm clueless and I'm kept thinking of it through days and night even i can't sleep well. It's made me feel so depressed stress and tension at the same time. In result of it.. im absence going to works for days and weeks .. im rather being alone than be with my kid and wife.. at some points I left my family for four days without any news..  During the time when I'm alone, i kept thinking about the problems and issues i am having and its tear me down. Some times I stare to the mirror and surprisingly I've been sitting front of it almost for two hours without knowing how the times fly and its just an empty gaze. I can't recall what I've been thinking about back then.. Lately i found that when I'm starred at the mirror i saw like the reflections of my face slowly disappeared and im gone with it.. (what I'm hope for) That stress and depression turns me to someone that totally different from what who i am before. I can't control my temper and now I've been irresponsible towards my works and family. I just want to let go everything and free from all of it. Part of me feel like I don't want to be end like this. Other part me says just let it go and wait and see how far this thing can go..  Thus my health recently turns up side down. I feel numb on my right calf to my toes. The numbness now been almost 3 weeks. Daily I've struggled to eased my headache.. my chest pains constantly... i lost my appetite.. i can't think of work because every times when i try to going to works or just thinking about it my head feels like to explode and the headache pain is unbearable for me.. then I sweating like a pig..  I don't know what to do anymore.. now i live my life daily with emptiness.. I felt like i am a walking zombie. I don't know what is happening to me. I always asking that question to myself. I'm clueless.  Its hurts me. I feels down. I think this is may the end of me. I am such a ungrateful son. Husband. Father. Brothers.  I'm sorry for it. P.s : also sorry for the English. Not my mother tongue."

She has depression and when we first started dating it was obvious that she didn’t like her appearance but as we progressed in our relationship she would get very down on herself and get into episodes of bad depression. She didn’t start cutting until the third time she had an “episode” and when that happened I immediately informed her sister who is very close with her both in age and friendship. She tried breaking up with me two times because she felt as if she wasn’t good enough and that I deserved better. I forgot to put this in sooner but this is caused because her dad, before he passed, was abusive and praised her sister and treated her like nothing. In late February of 2018 she once again tried breaking up with me and did because normally I could tell when it was an “episode” but it didn’t seem like one at that point. Later that night I got home from practice for my sport at 10 pm and I saw that she had sent me pictures on Snapchat. The pictures were her arms covered in blood so I told her sister what she had done but before her sister had seen the text my girlfriend sent me another picture with the caption “I finally got a deep cut” so I freaked out thinking she was bleeding terribly and text her sister in a panic basically telling them to get her to a hospital. Little did I know that this would keep her in a psychiatric hospital for about two weeks. When she got out she apologized and we were back together because we shouldn’t have been separated in the first place. She seems like she is doing well for a little bit and then she has to start day treatment which was like a group meeting for people similar to her. She got upset a few times during these three weeks because she felt like a crazy outcast. 2 weeks later and we are in the middle of April and every once in a while she says that she “feels numb” to where she doesn’t feel emotion which causes her to cut to feel pain so it isn’t as numb. As we get into late April and now May 4th 2018 she gets worse and worse. From today, May 4th, she has been numb for about 6-8 days straight and it is so bad that she doesn’t even have energy to do anything anymore. No energy to talk, walk, move and zero motivation for everything. Her self-hatred is at an all time high and her antidepressants and other medications don’t help her at all, she had a plan to commit suicide in the summer but her mom, her sister and I have figured out ways to prevent this. I love my girlfriend so much and I’ve been through so much with her but I have no idea where to turn to next, she is getting worse and worse and I just wanna see her happy again so I turn to this to try and get answers or suggestions from anybody that has gone through something similar. P.S on the day before making this post, May 3rd, she had tried to sell her body and give a random guy her address just so she could get people to stop caring, this obviously didn’t work and the only people that know about how bad her depression is, is her family, a few of her friends and me."

I don't have diabetes that I'm aware of. Last blood work was ok. But in last couple weeks I have noticed a odor coming from my hands and arms. It actually smells like diesel fuel. I am a truck driver and do haul diesel and gas but it's not from any spills. I take a HOT shower and scrub with soap and 5 minutes after shower I can smell it from my arms and hands and even my sweat. Any ideas from anyone??? Do have a Dr appt coming up but wanted to see if any Dr or anybody has ever heard of this. Thanks.

It has been difficult reading many of your responses; particularly those regarding marijuana and other medications. I applaud you for completing the NAMI courses and taking time to educate others, but those courses don't replace medical school. As someone who has covered the Nami information and then some I can say you are wrong on so many levels. Your responses to medications in particular are usually inaccurate. Additionally, I'm pretty sure that Nami advises against doling out that kind of advice specifically because you don't have the knowledge or expertise.  Regarding the cannabis...you sound like a D.A.R.E. mom from the 80's and I just hope that you realize it is a lifesaver for some. You are wrong about the lack of research. There is enough research out to encourage further investigation as it has already been applied successfully to so many illnesses. Sometimes you present statements that aren't facts so I implore you to cite your information more frequently. Considering around half of mentally ill patients have a substance abuse issue I'm surprised you crap so freely on your counterparts. I've tried really hard not to be mean or chew you out by citing specifics but I will say it is disgusting to see someone with a mental illness who has suffered stigmatization encouraging the stigmatization of anyone who uses cannabis to seek relief from the plethora of ailments it can address when used properly. Mine was prescribed by a doctor and it has reduced the number of psychotropic medications I need.  Lastly, back to the pharmacology of disorders...some people with severe mental illness need to be heavily medicated because when they are not they are a danger to themselves or others. You do not seem to get this? Some don't have the luxury of a beautiful turnout.  So in closing stop playing doctor and give advice that you can relate to. It sounds more genuine. For example if someone wanted to know about different psych wards, restraints, psychosis, delusions, encounters with police when manic, ect's, approximately 100 different psychotropic medications, talk therapy, group therapy, medical cannabis, I'd do that because it comes from experience. You sound and again no offense like you completed a NAMI class and an abnormal psych course at a community college. Stick to what NAMI teaches because it works for 80%."

25,C4522181,Brachial Amyotrophic Diplegia,C2364135,Discomfort,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/50436/anxiety-as-a-useful-natural-bodliy-response,Anxiety as a Useful Natural Bodliy Response,"Normal anxiety is part of the body’s natural defense system. It's an alert to a threat that is unknown, vague, or comes from your own internal fears. While you’re in this state, your feelings can range from a vague sense of worry to physical sensations such as a pounding heartbeat. These feelings make you want to react to the threat. An anxiety response is normal in many situations. Anxiety is a signal from your brain that warns you of a threat and is a normal response to help you prevent something or decrease the bad effects of something you can't control. If you did not have this natural response to harmful situations, you would be unable to prevent harm from entering your life.  When you feel anxiety, you first response should not be, ""How to I get rid of this feeling?"" but ""What is wrong in my life or environment that my mind is signaling my body with discomfort so that I move away from or change my circumstances or environment."" Much as stress is a natural response to allow you to fight, flee or cope with a sensory overload of emotions, workload, or situations to deal with, anxiety is your mind signalling your body to be afraid of some sensed danger. Before taking meds or substances to mask you body's natural defense system, look to understand what realities in your life may need to be dropped, handled or coped with by actual action."

It starts at my foot. My toes will curl then my ankle bends inward. My hip juts out and then my wrist curls inward and my fingers spread apart and they curl. Then my left cheek will tighten as if I am snarling and my eye will twitch.My leg stiffen and my arm bends as if i was retarded. No offence. It only lasts for about 10 seconds but it is very embarrassing in public. I have learned that if I stand up and then stay in place for a few seconds it wont happen. I can feel it “flaring up” and then it passes. If it goes to the full contortion and I try to walk it off it’s worse and my arm will kind of flap around. And if I try to speak my speech is slurred. Keep in mind that this is the only symptom and everything else is normal in my body. If you have any questions please feel free to ask."

I'm 16, about to turn 17 in approximately 2 weeks. A year ago I was experiencing sudden thoughts of suicide, a strong depression, I also smoked a lot, drank a lot, went out to a lot of parties, felt hollow, senseless and experienced depersonalization frequently. I didn't live with my parents and nobody really supervised me, it was easy to trick my parents from a distance. I got deep into alcohol and probably risked my life in some situations. I saw myself while standing in the sidewalks throwing my body to the cars rushing by, the thoughts of suicide got stronger and stronger and everyday I was at the border of it but never got to hurt myself because I saw it as being weak and I didn't want to call attention. One time it got really bad and was close to kill myself, it was a discussion with myself. I've tried to kill myself twice I think, the first time was when I was 10. I've always felt depressed with moments of happiness but never gotten out of that hole. I moved on the alcohol and smoking after 3-4 months of all that. When my parents finally moved to the city they took me with a neurologist because I couldn't sleep, a few weeks before that aid started smoking weed to solve my sleeping problems, I never did it with the intention to get high or fit in. When the neurologist asked me if I had ever smoked weed or tried drugs said yes, my parents were shocked but I told them it was normal, the neurologist told them so but warned them of some things. My dad is a cop...so...yeah... After that everything went south. By that point in my life I started to experience hallucinations and hear voices before sleeping, that was what was not letting me sleep. All that happened to me before smoking weed. I didn't experience the voices getting worse or the hallucinations getting worse after smoking it. But my parents went crazy with knowing I had smoked weed, they didn't know I was currently smoking it. In summary they wanted to get me out of school and a lot of very drastic stuff. My life was *** at that point I was feeling detached from reality and a feeling of not being real. I only heard the voices before sleeping and could really differentiate what they said except for some vague words. When I told that my parents they didn't believe me and told me everything was in my head and I had the power to control it...well various nights I tried to shut those voices and they didn't stop, my parents didn't support me with that and I don't believe they will. Now my life is different from a year ago, I've been more than 6 months sober and 8 without smoking. Those things before were as background in case it is connected with the recent stuff. In September of 2017 I had a terrible experience, I don't know how to call it so I would like you to help me put it a name if there even is one. I felt depersonalization and a crushing fear someone was coming after me, I saw silhouettes and shadows rushing by and coming to me. The fear I felt was immense, I couldn't even move, I started crying and holding my head which I felt light, very very light and hollow. I sat on a couch in the living room with the lights off and saw myself in the mirror, the mirror didn't follow my movements and the fear kept getting worse and worse, the mirror started talking to me. I noticed that my face in the mirror was deformed and couldn't differentiate who's face was it, but I could tell it wasn't mine. I started having a conversation with the mirror. When the fear was gone I went to my room and went to sleep, like nothing happened. That same month I was in my room and started feeling lightheaded and something felt wrong, so so wrong, I couldn't tell what it was. Then I saw a big mirror in my room and stared at myself, I saw my face and started giggling uncontrollably, then tears started rushing from my face, the mirror started to talk to me and offered me to tell me the truth. I'm a person of science and really like to get to the bottom of things, investigate what causes things and it's consequences. That really caught my attention and started to talk to the mirror, he told me that he would show me things that no one has ever seen and a truth that no man knows, that he would take me to a place where no man has been. He told me that in exchange for that I had to give him my body, full and absolute control of my body. I argued a little with him for why that was necessary but he didn't convinced me, the conversation ended up in that he would demonstrate me that truth and I would give him my body. At the end of that month I felt that lightheadedness again, a sudden boost of energy, my heart beat raised to 160 at rest, I felt very dizzy and my head hurt a lot. I went to my room and looked at myself in the mirror, when I realized I was speaking to the mirror again, but this time he was being aggressive and made me feel bad, I cried a lot, felt weak, I was texting with my girlfriend who knew of all of this. The mirror told me that I had to get rid of her, that she was just standing in my way and nanotubes letting me see the truth, I argued with him and begged him that he didn't take her away from me. He was very rude and kept screaming at me. I ended up crying and felt to the floor, he didn't let me stand up. While all of this was happening I told my girlfriend through texts. I don't remember the rest Other things like this happened but there was one time I started to feel weird, odd, lightheaded, in a state of alert, with a lot of energy and powerful. I saw a silhouette that was going around the house and it told me to follow it so I did, we only went in circles for a bit until we reached the roof and told me to look at my shadow and listen to it so I listened to my shadow, which then told me that he would demonstrate me what I'm really capable of, after that I didn't have control of my body and just laid my back on the floor while looking to the stars and the voice told me to look to a particular star, then the star suddenly disappeared so I was amazed, then the voice started to disappear stars and appear stars like crazy. Then he told me to do the same, to see what I was really capable of, so I was disappearing stars at will and creating others, it was amazing. Then he told me that everything that I saw was a lie, that everyone was living a lie and I had to show everyone the truth. Then He told me to look at the sky and look closely, then I saw like if the earth was in some kind of dome, like if it was in a glass globe and made me see how fragile and small we truly are, it was an amazing and indescriptible experience. After that I went to my room and laid in my bed, after some moments my body felt hollow, and light, then I saw my own body face to face, like if I was floating, then went floating at a high speed and saw the city from above, my house and everything. My brother noticed something in me but I didn't tell him anything because he didn't believe me in the past with things like that. After that the mirror has shown me a place that looks kind of mystical and told me it's called the red dimension, it sound like a fantasy game thing but I've seen it. As time went by these experiences have decreased and I don't remember anymore what the mirror tells me. Now I've noticed that my behavior has been erratic, I've had fits of anger, irritability detachment from friends, my girlfriend told me I've been distant (very rare in me), paranoid, anxiety is crushing me everyday, I feel fear at nights, I can't sleep because of this, I have a sensation something is coming for me or is reaching for me, I have a lot of difficulties to concentrate which are to the point of interfering with my everyday life, I have to read something several times to get a grasp of it, I normally read a lot of scientific texts and I'm used to read long texts with unfamiliar words but now I can't even read a paragraph and get it's content, I have difficulty finding words, my speech has been hard to understand to people which it hasn't been in the past, then has been moments when I stand up not that fast and start feeling very dizzy, and my vision gets noisy and black, then I fall to the floor, it takes me a few seconds to regain consciousness. Among other things The main thing that I'm concerned about is that now I hear voices, but this time is different. The voices speak to me at all times and say random things to me, sometimes they say really really bad things. They make me doubt of my family and people in general. My brother noticed something was wrong with me and the voices told me that he wanted to know my secrets and that I should kill him before he knew all that is happening to me because he would tell my family and they would lock me up in some kind of mental hospital. I argued with the voices about that being very drastic and if there was no other way to avoid that but I can't remember what we concluded. What the voices tell me makes sense to me, when I tell my girlfriend about what they tell me or a friend they tell me that those things aren't real and don't make sense and that I need help. Sometimes I really feel I need help and believe something is wrong with me, but other times I think nothing's wrong with me and I'm normal. Now I'm worried I will hurt my self or others because of the these thing that are happening to me. The voices also repeat random words in my head, they say random things and repeat them on and on or sometimes phrases and then I realize I'm repeating them too. My native language is Spanish and I'm living in México, but the voices talk to me in English, the mirror talked to me in English, every time I've talked to something that isn't real has been in English and that's how I know it isn't real. I sometimes find myself talking to me and then think I'm crazy and the voices tell me that I'm just having a conversation with myself and there's nothing wrong about it. Then I asked a friend if somethings also happened to her but she said no to everything and was very weirded out about everything. Then I told her about everything and she told me I needed help. Every night I can't sleep, the voices get loud and don't let me sleep, the anxiety gets heavier and my thoughts just rush and I feel a crippling fear. Every morning the voices wake me up, they get loud and just wake me of my sleep, thoughts rush and I am just not sleeping anymore. Now I rarely eat and my personal hygiene has deteriorated a lot, I have not taken care of myself lately like I used to. I have also had a lot of tics and been kind of on alert at every moment, but when some people talk to me they have to repeat themselves because I'm just gone, talking with the voices and zoned out. I realized that things that I believed were actually delusions, like I thought a teacher was trying to abuse of me, when in reality he was instructed by the principal to closely look at my behavior because they knew about the weed. I have a lot of thinkings like this and even though I make sense out of it and look at the ""truth"" I get back at what I initially believed and get all paranoid and doubt of everyone and myself. My memory is getting even worse now, I can't remember things that happened 5 minutes ago or even seconds, as well as events from years ago, weeks or months very clearly. But there's moments when I feel ""enlightened"" and remember a lot of things and can clearly talk and write down my symptoms and things that happened to me, like I did with this text. I was diagnosed with epilepsy (it is not a serious type of epilepsy, my left hand just shakes) and migraine approximately two weeks ago, since then I have taken Topamax, I don't think it has had a big impact on me to show these symptoms. I started to worry when I put all my symptoms in the symptom checker by WebMD and the top result was Schizophrenia.

I'm 16, about to turn 17 in approximately 2 weeks. A year ago I was experiencing sudden thoughts of suicide, a strong depression, I also smoked a lot, drank a lot, went out to a lot of parties, felt hollow, senseless and experienced depersonalization frequently. I didn't live with my parents and nobody really supervised me, it was easy to trick my parents from a distance. I got deep into alcohol and probably risked my life in some situations. I saw myself while standing in the sidewalks throwing my body to the cars rushing by, the thoughts of suicide got stronger and stronger and everyday I was at the border of it but never got to hurt myself because I saw it as being weak and I didn't want to call attention. One time it got really bad and was close to kill myself, it was a discussion with myself. I've tried to kill myself twice I think, the first time was when I was 10. I've always felt depressed with moments of happiness but never gotten out of that hole. I moved on the alcohol and smoking after 3-4 months of all that. When my parents finally moved to the city they took me with a neurologist because I couldn't sleep, a few weeks before that aid started smoking weed to solve my sleeping problems, I never did it with the intention to get high or fit in. When the neurologist asked me if I had ever smoked weed or tried drugs said yes, my parents were shocked but I told them it was normal, the neurologist told them so but warned them of some things. My dad is a cop...so...yeah... After that everything went south. By that point in my life I started to experience hallucinations and hear voices before sleeping, that was what was not letting me sleep. All that happened to me before smoking weed. I didn't experience the voices getting worse or the hallucinations getting worse after smoking it. But my parents went crazy with knowing I had smoked weed, they didn't know I was currently smoking it. In summary they wanted to get me out of school and a lot of very drastic stuff. My life was *** at that point I was feeling detached from reality and a feeling of not being real. I only heard the voices before sleeping and could really differentiate what they said except for some vague words. When I told that my parents they didn't believe me and told me everything was in my head and I had the power to control it...well various nights I tried to shut those voices and they didn't stop, my parents didn't support me with that and I don't believe they will. Now my life is different from a year ago, I've been more than 6 months sober and 8 without smoking. Those things before were as background in case it is connected with the recent stuff. In September of 2017 I had a terrible experience, I don't know how to call it so I would like you to help me put it a name if there even is one. I felt depersonalization and a crushing fear someone was coming after me, I saw silhouettes and shadows rushing by and coming to me. The fear I felt was immense, I couldn't even move, I started crying and holding my head which I felt light, very very light and hollow. I sat on a couch in the living room with the lights off and saw myself in the mirror, the mirror didn't follow my movements and the fear kept getting worse and worse, the mirror started talking to me. I noticed that my face in the mirror was deformed and couldn't differentiate who's face was it, but I could tell it wasn't mine. I started having a conversation with the mirror. When the fear was gone I went to my room and went to sleep, like nothing happened. That same month I was in my room and started feeling lightheaded and something felt wrong, so so wrong, I couldn't tell what it was. Then I saw a big mirror in my room and stared at myself, I saw my face and started giggling uncontrollably, then tears started rushing from my face, the mirror started to talk to me and offered me to tell me the truth. I'm a person of science and really like to get to the bottom of things, investigate what causes things and it's consequences. That really caught my attention and started to talk to the mirror, he told me that he would show me things that no one has ever seen and a truth that no man knows, that he would take me to a place where no man has been. He told me that in exchange for that I had to give him my body, full and absolute control of my body. I argued a little with him for why that was necessary but he didn't convinced me, the conversation ended up in that he would demonstrate me that truth and I would give him my body. At the end of that month I felt that lightheadedness again, a sudden boost of energy, my heart beat raised to 160 at rest, I felt very dizzy and my head hurt a lot. I went to my room and looked at myself in the mirror, when I realized I was speaking to the mirror again, but this time he was being aggressive and made me feel bad, I cried a lot, felt weak, I was texting with my girlfriend who knew of all of this. The mirror told me that I had to get rid of her, that she was just standing in my way and nanotubes letting me see the truth, I argued with him and begged him that he didn't take her away from me. He was very rude and kept screaming at me. I ended up crying and felt to the floor, he didn't let me stand up. While all of this was happening I told my girlfriend through texts.

I'm 16, about to turn 17 in approximately 2 weeks. A year ago I was experiencing sudden thoughts of suicide, a strong depression, I also smoked a lot, drank a lot, went out to a lot of parties, felt hollow, senseless and experienced depersonalization frequently. I didn't live with my parents and nobody really supervised me, it was easy to trick my parents from a distance. I got deep into alcohol and probably risked my life in some situations. I saw myself while standing in the sidewalks throwing my body to the cars rushing by, the thoughts of suicide got stronger and stronger and everyday I was at the border of it but never got to hurt myself because I saw it as being weak and I didn't want to call attention. One time it got really bad and was close to kill myself, it was a discussion with myself. I've tried to kill myself twice I think, the first time was when I was 10. I've always felt depressed with moments of happiness but never gotten out of that hole. I moved on the alcohol and smoking after 3-4 months of all that. When my parents finally moved to the city they took me with a neurologist because I couldn't sleep, a few weeks before that aid started smoking weed to solve my sleeping problems, I never did it with the intention to get high or fit in. When the neurologist asked me if I had ever smoked weed or tried drugs said yes, my parents were shocked but I told them it was normal, the neurologist told them so but warned them of some things. My dad is a cop...so...yeah... After that everything went south. By that point in my life I started to experience hallucinations and hear voices before sleeping, that was what was not letting me sleep. All that happened to me before smoking weed. I didn't experience the voices getting worse or the hallucinations getting worse after smoking it. But my parents went crazy with knowing I had smoked weed, they didn't know I was currently smoking it. In summary they wanted to get me out of school and a lot of very drastic stuff. My life was *** at that point I was feeling detached from reality and a feeling of not being real. I only heard the voices before sleeping and could really differentiate what they said except for some vague words. When I told that my parents they didn't believe me and told me everything was in my head and I had the power to control it...well various nights I tried to shut those voices and they didn't stop, my parents didn't support me with that and I don't believe they will. Now my life is different from a year ago, I've been more than 6 months sober and 8 without smoking. Those things before were as background in case it is connected with the recent stuff. In September of 2017 I had a terrible experience, I don't know how to call it so I would like you to help me put it a name if there even is one. I felt depersonalization and a crushing fear someone was coming after me, I saw silhouettes and shadows rushing by and coming to me. The fear I felt was immense, I couldn't even move, I started crying and holding my head which I felt light, very very light and hollow. I sat on a couch in the living room with the lights off and saw myself in the mirror, the mirror didn't follow my movements and the fear kept getting worse and worse, the mirror started talking to me. I noticed that my face in the mirror was deformed and couldn't differentiate who's face was it, but I could tell it wasn't mine. I started having a conversation with the mirror. When the fear was gone I went to my room and went to sleep, like nothing happened. That same month I was in my room and started feeling lightheaded and something felt wrong, so so wrong, I couldn't tell what it was. Then I saw a big mirror in my room and stared at myself, I saw my face and started giggling uncontrollably, then tears started rushing from my face, the mirror started to talk to me and offered me to tell me the truth. I'm a person of science and really like to get to the bottom of things, investigate what causes things and it's consequences. That really caught my attention and started to talk to the mirror, he told me that he would show me things that no one has ever seen and a truth that no man knows, that he would take me to a place where no man has been. He told me that in exchange for that I had to give him my body, full and absolute control of my body. I argued a little with him for why that was necessary but he didn't convinced me, the conversation ended up in that he would demonstrate me that truth and I would give him my body. At the end of that month I felt that lightheadedness again, a sudden boost of energy, my heart beat raised to 160 at rest, I felt very dizzy and my head hurt a lot. I went to my room and looked at myself in the mirror, when I realized I was speaking to the mirror again, but this time he was being aggressive and made me feel bad, I cried a lot, felt weak, I was texting with my girlfriend who knew of all of this. The mirror told me that I had to get rid of her, that she was just standing in my way and nanotubes letting me see the truth, I argued with him and begged him that he didn't take her away from me. He was very rude and kept screaming at me. I ended up crying and felt to the floor, he didn't let me stand up. While all of this was happening I told my girlfriend through texts. I don't remember the rest Other things like this happened but there was one time I started to feel weird, odd, lightheaded, in a state of alert, with a lot of energy and powerful. I saw a silhouette that was going around the house and it told me to follow it so I did, we only went in circles for a bit until we reached the roof and told me to look at my shadow and listen to it so I listened to my shadow, which then told me that he would demonstrate me what I'm really capable of, after that I didn't have control of my body and just laid my back on the floor while looking to the stars and the voice told me to look to a particular star, then the star suddenly disappeared so I was amazed, then the voice started to disappear stars and appear stars like crazy. Then he told me to do the same, to see what I was really capable of, so I was disappearing stars at will and creating others, it was amazing. Then he told me that everything that I saw was a lie, that everyone was living a lie and I had to show everyone the truth. Then He told me to look at the sky and look closely, then I saw like if the earth was in some kind of dome, like if it was in a glass globe and made me see how fragile and small we truly are, it was an amazing and indescriptible experience. After that I went to my room and laid in my bed, after some moments my body felt hollow, and light, then I saw my own body face to face, like if I was floating, then went floating at a high speed and saw the city from above, my house and everything. My brother noticed something in me but I didn't tell him anything because he didn't believe me in the past with things like that. After that the mirror has shown me a place that looks kind of mystical and told me it's called the red dimension, it sound like a fantasy game thing but I've seen it. As time went by these experiences have decreased and I don't remember anymore what the mirror tells me. Now I've noticed that my behavior has been erratic, I've had fits of anger, irritability detachment from friends, my girlfriend told me I've been distant (very rare in me), paranoid, anxiety is crushing me everyday, I feel fear at nights, I can't sleep because of this, I have a sensation something is coming for me or is reaching for me, I have a lot of difficulties to concentrate which are to the point of interfering with my everyday life, I have to read something several times to get a grasp of it, I normally read a lot of scientific texts and I'm used to read long texts with unfamiliar words but now I can't even read a paragraph and get it's content, I have difficulty finding words, my speech has been hard to understand to people which it hasn't been in the past, then has been moments when I stand up not that fast and start feeling very dizzy, and my vision gets noisy and black, then I fall to the floor, it takes me a few seconds to regain consciousness. Among other things The main thing that I'm concerned about is that now I hear voices, but this time is different. The voices speak to me at all times and say random things to me, sometimes they say really really bad things. They make me doubt of my family and people in general. My brother noticed something was wrong with me and the voices told me that he wanted to know my secrets and that I should kill him before he knew all that is happening to me because he would tell my family and they would lock me up in some kind of mental hospital. I argued with the voices about that being very drastic and if there was no other way to avoid that but I can't remember what we concluded. What the voices tell me makes sense to me, when I tell my girlfriend about what they tell me or a friend they tell me that those things aren't real and don't make sense and that I need help. Sometimes I really feel I need help and believe something is wrong with me, but other times I think nothing's wrong with me and I'm normal. Now I'm worried I will hurt my self or others because of the these thing that are happening to me. The voices also repeat random words in my head, they say random things and repeat them on and on or sometimes phrases and then I realize I'm repeating them too. My native language is Spanish and I'm living in México, but the voices talk to me in English, the mirror talked to me in English, every time I've talked to something that isn't real has been in English and that's how I know it isn't real. I sometimes find myself talking to me and then think I'm crazy and the voices tell me that I'm just having a conversation with myself and there's nothing wrong about it. Then I asked a friend if somethings also happened to her but she said no to everything and was very weirded out about everything. Then I told her about everything and she told me I needed help. Every night I can't sleep, the voices get loud and don't let me sleep, the anxiety gets heavier and my thoughts just rush and I feel a crippling fear. Every morning the voices wake me up, they get loud and just wake me of my sleep, thoughts rush and I am just not sleeping anymore. Now I rarely eat and my personal hygiene has deteriorated a lot, I have not taken care of myself lately like I used to. I have also had a lot of tics and been kind of on alert at every moment, but when some people talk to me they have to repeat themselves because I'm just gone, talking with the voices and zoned out. I realized that things that I believed were actually delusions, like I thought a teacher was trying to abuse of me, when in reality he was instructed by the principal to closely look at my behavior because they knew about the weed. I have a lot of thinkings like this and even though I make sense out of it and look at the ""truth"" I get back at what I initially believed and get all paranoid and doubt of everyone and myself. My memory is getting even worse now, I can't remember things that happened 5 minutes ago or even seconds, as well as events from years ago, weeks or months very clearly. But there's moments when I feel ""enlightened"" and remember a lot of things and can clearly talk and write down my symptoms and things that happened to me, like I did with this text. I was diagnosed with epilepsy (it is not a serious type of epilepsy, my left hand just shakes) and migraine approximately two weeks ago, since then I have taken Topamax, I don't think it has had a big impact on me to show these symptoms. I started to worry when I put all my symptoms in the symptom checker by WebMD and the top result was Schizophrenia. I know it's a beta but it got me worried by how a lot of things matched when I did some research. My parents basically don't really believed psychologists and I don't think they'll take me to one so I'm on my own, I don't know what to do and everyday is getting harder. The constant fight with myself and the voices is just exhausting, I don't like myself or my mind. I need help but don't know what to do since I'm not independent."

Until recently, nocturia was thought to be caused by a full bladder, but it is also a symptom of obstructive sleep apnea..."" Here's the significance of the, above, fact: 1. If you have (A.) Sleep Apnea and (2.) Over-Active-Bladder and you do nothing to treat these two conditions, forget it.  You're a ""goner"". Get your affairs in order because you aint gonna be around much longer.  2. If you have an Over-Active-Bladder and you wake up multiple times at night (Nocturia) &/or bed wet, forget it... Once again, get your affairs in order because you aint gonna be around much longer.  The most important thing to a diabetic if they hope to remain healthy and stop their disease from progressing is a good night's sleep. Everybody knows about Sleep Apnea, by, now. They know it is toxic to the human body!  What they don't know and this is never discussed, here, is Nocturia, frequent urination at night. Just as does sleep apnea, nocturia destroys sleep quality and without plenty of sleep, you cannot control blood sugar and stop inflammation.  Once diagnosed for sleep apnea, my dad used his CPAP machine, every night, for 15 years. It's been 8 years since his passing but I still wondered, ""Why did my dad's Type 2 Diabetes keep progressing?"", despite:  ...eating a strict, ultra-clean, low sugar-low carb diet,   ...40 mins on a paddle board in the pool, everyday,   ...Maintained a BMI under 20  Today, I wonder no more. It was the O.A.B. (at the end, he would wake 6-7 times a night to pee).  The point is this: Any thing that prevents you from getting a good night's sleep will, essentially, kill you.  Stress, GERD, IBS, nausea, menopause, drug-alcohol abuse, back pain, neuropathy...ANYTHING! It will kill you! Diabetes will be the least of your worries, truly!  The average ""Joe"" walking the streets in this country has no idea how vital sleep is to staying healthy (especially, obesity).  PS: Vets are making a killing over this one little secret. O.A.B., IBS, uterine tract infections, rotten teeth, cancer and diabetes often stem from problems their animals have sleeping. Dog and cat owners are spending $000's on their pets because they simply have no inkling how important nocturnal sleep is for an animal.  If your animal is obese or has fleas, these are 2 major reasons for poor sleep.

Until recently, nocturia was thought to be caused by a full bladder, but it is also a symptom of obstructive sleep apnea..."" Here's the significance of the, above, fact: 1. If you have (A.) Sleep Apnea and (2.) Over-Active-Bladder and you do nothing to treat these two conditions, forget it.  You're a ""goner"". Get your affairs in order because you aint gonna be around much longer.  2. If you have an Over-Active-Bladder and you wake up multiple times at night (Nocturia) &/or bed wet, forget it... Once again, get your affairs in order because you aint gonna be around much longer.  The most important thing to a diabetic if they hope to remain healthy and stop their disease from progressing is a good night's sleep. Everybody knows about Sleep Apnea, by, now. They know it is toxic to the human body!  What they don't know and this is never discussed, here, is Nocturia, frequent urination at night. Just as does sleep apnea, nocturia destroys sleep quality and without plenty of sleep, you cannot control blood sugar and stop inflammation.  Once diagnosed for sleep apnea, my dad used his CPAP machine, every night, for 15 years. It's been 8 years since his passing but I still wondered, ""Why did my dad's Type 2 Diabetes keep progressing?"", despite:  ...eating a strict, ultra-clean, low sugar-low carb diet,   ...40 mins on a paddle board in the pool, everyday,   ...Maintained a BMI under 20  Today, I wonder no more. It was the O.A.B. (at the end, he would wake 6-7 times a night to pee).  The point is this: Any thing that prevents you from getting a good night's sleep will, essentially, kill you.  Stress, GERD, IBS, nausea, menopause, drug-alcohol abuse, back pain, neuropathy...ANYTHING! It will kill you! Diabetes will be the least of your worries, truly!  The average ""Joe"" walking the streets in this country has no idea how vital sleep is to staying healthy (especially, obesity).  PS: Vets are making a killing over this one little secret.

At first, the doctors assumed it was the result of the tylenol 3's I was on for a previous condition, so I dropped those and still the dizziness continued. I went to an eye doctor and was given a clean bill of health, then to the emergency room again; they did blood work, which came back normal. I've since had an MRI, went to an ENT which ruled out any kind of vertigo, and worn a holter monitor which confirmed my health is in normal working order.  I've tried just about everything possible when it comes to determining the cause of my chronic dizziness, and I'm still just as clueless as I was when this all started. During the last two months of doctor's visits I've had two panic attacks and been to the ER six times. I'm desperate for any information/answers."

My friends also notice I tend to randomly stop listening and just enter my thought in the middle of conversations and I kind of hear them put I don’t really think to respond until they touch me or something •I often am anxious and restless and tend to be really fidgety sometimes •I never really have the motivation to do most things like clean, go out, meet up with friend and all kinds of stuff when I don’t need to •I sometimes feel hopeless  •I find it hard to fall asleep •I often have very negative or degrading thought about myself •I have been having problems remembering things. •I started to try to restrict what I eat to loose weight •I am not really sad all the time put I sometimes cry at night and sometimes am almost about to cry but stop it because I don’t want my friends to know I’m hurting, I mostly just feel numb/apathetic. My friend was more excited about my birthday then me (I am 13 so it’s not that I hate getting older or anything) I am also strangely not that excited for a trip to London I am going to with my mom on Easter. •I often feel guilt about feeling this way or guilty that I don’t do more productive stuff •I am really apologetic, I am always apologizing for everything. •I fake happiness when I really feel numb or sad. I pretend to be happy and cheerful and try to do it everyday because it really doesn’t matter. •I am often very tired or have low energy but can’t sleep and still feel it after a good rest I doubt that I have depression because I don’t feel sad too often, maybe like a short sad period every day or crying every other day.  Is it depression when sadness is fairly limited and it’s more like worthlessness or apathy?  Am I just being dramatic? I just don't know because I have most of the symptoms but I don't really feel any that sad and I don't really cry that often  Anyway I would appreciate it if you took the time to leave your opinion in the comments and sorry that this was so long ^~^"

Over the past eight weeks, she has been hospitalized seven times, sometimes in ICU. A few of those times, she was in DKA...one time, it was almost fatal. Her symptoms always start with intense, uncontrollable vomiting. The doctors' diagnosis is always ""diabetes mismanagement."" But her A1C is always good. She has had to drop out of school and move back home, where we have been monitoring her diet, sugar levels and insulin, and all are in compliance. Still, the cycle continues. The hospital stabilizes her, sends her home with the same instructions, then within a matter of days, we have to take her back to the ER. She has been diagnosed with mild gastroperesis, told to eat six small meals during the day rather then three large ones, and was prescribed Reglan...all to no avail. As I write this, I am preparing to take her to the ER again. Advice from anyone who has experienced this uncontrollable cycle would be greatly appreciated."

But here goes.  Since 2005 I started to itch, not all over my body but the itch is localized to my right arm. The itching likes to travel up and down the arm for some strange reason.  There are no rashes, bumps bites or anything. The problem goes away sometimes for months at a time then suddenly comes back in full force. Just lastnight I was awoken out of a dead sleep and it got so bad I started scratching with a kitchen fork in desparation to make it stop. Naturally there was considerable blood so I cleaned the wounds and bandaged myself for the night. I dont know why this is happening to me. I checked with a doctor and he's got nothing. Now niether do I. Thiz is the second flair up in a year now. My God please make it stop!"

I am 28 years old and my grandfather is 72. He recently has been exhibiting memory problems.  Examples include: asking me a question and starting a conversation with me and then asking the same question again 2 more times by the end of the day, going to the grocery store and not remembering what he needed (my grandma gave him a list, he went to the store, was gone for over an hour, then returned with a pound of deli meat and told my grandma that he lost the list and couldn't remember what he was doing at the store), calling Best Buy (Geek Squad) to fix the computer and then forgetting what company he called to come fix it (he had spoken to Best Buy on the phone about 3 times that day, but couldn't remember who he called), he tried to drive to the Department of Motor Vehicles following verbal directions my grandmother gave him but he forgot where he was going and spent hours driving around before coming home (the next day my grandmother gave him written directions but he lost them and returned home again saying that he couldn't remember where to go - he has been to this DMV before) ...  These behaviors are simply NOT like him. He is usually very sharp and even witty during conversations. My grandfather has not seen a doctor more than twice in the 28 years I've been alive. He hates doctors and tells us that if he ever needs a doctor for anything to just let him die. Due to this fear of doctors, he has not and will not see a doctor for his memory problems. He admits that he is having memory issues, and seems concerned, but will not take steps to figure out the cause.  My grandfather has been an alcoholic since before I was born and is a daily marijuana smoker. I though that maybe these were to blame, but my mom told me yesterday that both of my grandfather's parents exhibited similar symptoms leading up to the day they died. We don't know the exact cause of their deaths and my family often says ""they got old, their bodies began to shut down, and they died in the hospital"".  I'd like to know what these memory loss symptoms could be. I really wish he would see a doctor, but he simply won't. Does anybody recognize these symptoms?"

We don't pull any part of the hair of the head and usually hair pullers don't pull other areas of the body we don't just pull anywhere.It it starts with a throb or pounding in the center of our brain and it hurts a lot and there's no pill to stop the pounding that hurts so bad our head is pounding inside and it just builds up more and more and it creates a horrible pain deep within the brain and the only way to stop the pain is to relieve some of that hair that we pull which is just a temporary fix but really it's deep within the brain that hurts us it's not the hair. When we pull one strand at a time it's releasing some chemical within the brain which we feel we can actually feel the chemical release. And we the suffers all experience the same exact symptoms so it's not in our head we all understand that but the psychiatrist that like to make money off this horrible disorder that's genetic and proven to be genetic and the only cure that they found was a bone marrow transplant which they will not do for trichotillomania too dangerous. this is why I know it has nothing to do with people that pull their eyelashes or pick their skin or bite their nails it's a totally different disorder because we feel pain inside the brain and that is what's causing us to pick the hair not from anxiety it's just a horrible pain that just comes out of nowhere it could be anytime it's just there's just no quick fix for it and it just the only way to do it is to pick some of the hair out of there and stops it just the pounding stops. again we don't pull any part of the head of a hairs we only pull certain areas that calm the center of the brain to stop pounding. We don't' eat our hair it's very rare case that anyone would want to put that back in their body . I also find that it's odd to have this really thick paste at the root of every hair that we pick out. Maybe someone should look at the hairs at work picking out under a microscope to find out what is this paste find out where it's starting from where it's coming from maybe where our brain is over making this paste and that's all we need is a pill to get it moderated. maybe they can Botox that middle center of the brain so we don't have to feel this pain to cause us to pull the hair. I mean I'm hurting right now I'm hurting so bad and nothing could have done for me . I feel my life is been robbed because of this disorder you have no idea. It's not anxiety or mental disorder .

I lost all my baby weight after my last baby was born a year ago but then I had to have a surgery that has taken forever to heal and hurts from time to time. This has made me emotional AND I gained ALL my weight back. I have joined a group with my Dr for 15 weeks to a healthier life. I am suppose to journal. I am suppose to take my antidepressant. I am suppose to eat better. I am suppose to fit in exercise. I start out great but the longest I can stay on track and do what I am suppose to is 4 days! I have no motivation to continue after I fall off track. Should I get my antidepressant adjusted? Is this related to depression or something else? I am so frustrated and feel bad about myself.

But I have not been diagnosed, we found this therapist that I have seen twice, but I feel that 1: Do not believe, and second, do not listen to me. She does not handle the psychiatric part and the psychoterpeutic tests that I have to perform, so we have to find the right place for it a clinic. I also have several learning and Cognitive problems, and I also have to do the tests for that. My therapist believes that is not truth and that ""it is only my fear to fail ... But: In school I did not do well because I could not concentrate, I could not process texts, understand big concepts and small, develop and create bridges of development , thoughts and molds, I could not relate things, I have many problems at the time of reading and I do not understand math, yes, until this day. Iconfuse words, I have a bad memory, in short: I am the stupidest person to have stepped on the planet. This has prevented me from getting jobs (and no been able to keep uo for the ones that i actually get) has kept me from continuing in college. Above all of this problms, there are these symptoms: The first is a huge sadness that is always there, and every day. Is bad. So I try to see the positive side and always be as positive as posible and I tell myself that is okay and life is beautiful and everything but still feels like a huge pain and pressure in the chest. I have: A lot of appetite or super little and i barely eat anything. I lost interest in everything, I'm tired all the time, i sleep to much or not at all and yet i woke up tired. it's like my brain is rotting. The second thing is that I'm always super nervous, I tremble horrible my system and heary is at 100%, always. Talking to people is super heavy and difficult for me, to the point that it simply interferes with everything. Usually I have hot flushes, I start to over-analyze. I feel that everyone hates me and that I am unbearable. and in general I have like ... Anxiety ??? I am in my house and I am terrified. And that brings me to my next point and it's the panic attacks that usually last between 10-15 minutes but then I feel terrible. It feels fatal, I can not breathe and I try to breathe more and it's as if I could not breathe, the more I try the worse. I start to shake super horrible, I start to sweat, my heart is all over, everything hurts, everything scares me.This brings me to my next point and it is: I feel like I'm not there. When I look in the mirror I do not recognize myself it's like looking at my dad, my body changes. Everything feels like in a dream, the sound, the atmosphere, the shapes and colors everything is distort and become as if i where on a dream, and when I see myself in the mirror it is like looking at me as if someone from outside is watching and I am not even there.The last symptoms: delirium that someone did or planned something bad against my bet. delirium of persecution that someone wants to hurt me or watches over me. and that I think is manifesting differently now and it is: I see scenes, people, things that are not there, simply not. and they are usually aggressive and scary and try to hurt me. Another is like microalucinations that last like a super fast and spontaneous minutes where everything changes suddenly and everything is horrendous. and then I'm back where I was. I listen to voices, as if I were in an auditorium and they are many, evil and heavy and cruel. I see colors that are not there, and flavors. and finally, I always want to commit suicide and or seriously hurt me... and I'm tired. I can not help mu self anymore and I'm scared, but the place where I have to go will not be until next month and I do not see my therapist who thinks I'm fine and everything is about a slightly negative person. But I'm not fine, I do not have friends and I need to talk to someone."

Please see the symptoms listed below and take a guess on what she may have: 1. She gained over 200 lbs. 2. She puts on really ugly make up, her eyeliners are 2 inches wide.  3. She talks to herself. 4. She seems fixated on a girl, she keeps on talking about someone named “Ashley” but in a way that doesn’t make sense. 5. Her Facebook is covered with pictures at random, almost in bursts every few days for an he hour straight.  6. She posts very sexual images and says lewd things.  7. She giggles by herself. 8. She doesn’t seem to have a grasp on her finances.  9. Sometimes she cries by herself, and then starts giggling. 10. Her fb profile pics are that of random celebrities. 11. She’s obsessed with guys.  12. She talks about God, Satan and Angels. 13. She will still answer me if I call her name a few times. 14. She avoids meeting my eye. 15. She makes up pasts and people in her life. she seem to have her good days and bad days. She was such a sweet girl growing up. But her dad passed away from a rare illness and her sister had a psychotic break and the whole family has fallen apart. I talked to her about going to See a psychiatrist for help but to be honest, she scares me a bit. If I knew what she is probably dealing with, I feel like I won’t be so afraid of being alone with her. Thanks"

She has been manic for a couple weeks with the past 3 days requiring ER visits because my Dad doesn't feel he has any other option than to take her for exagerrated, and sometimes dilusional, ailments.

My biggest problem deals with my oldest daughter and her step-mother (my wife). My daughter is in her mid 30's and is a single mother of 2 girls. My wife and I have been married 13 years now. After I divorced my daughter's mom, I was single for over 10 years and had custody of both of my daughters. My wife feels like my daughter does not respect her-either as a person, step mother, etc. My daughter feels like the comments my wife has made to her has offended her and no longer wants her step-mom in her or the granddaugther's lives. My daughter has told me that my wife is not welcome in her house. My daughter has also told me that the granddaughter's are afraid of my wife based on the comments that my wife has made to my daughter. I can't visit my daughter or granddaughter's because I feel like I will say the wrong thing and upset everyone. I haven't seen my daughter or granddaughter since before Thanksgiving 2017.  I have went to clinical counseling; the only suggestion was for me to get to a point where I can visit my daughter and not feel bad about it. That is not an answer for me. I have asked my daughter several times to sit down with me and her step-mom. We did once--but it turned into a yelling match and made things worse. The other issue I have that I am dealing with is the loss of my dog. We had to put him to sleep. He was over 16 years old; we had him over 10 years (we had adopted him from a rescue group). He was the most loyal dog I have every had. There was a period of time that I was at home while recovering from multiple surgeries. He would sit beside the chair, bed, etc and put his chin on the edge. It was as if he knew I was not doing well and that he was taking care of me in his own way. He had developed several issues the past few months, and the vet had told us that it would take several surgeries and medications and that he still could not guarantee that our dog would get back to ""his old self"". Putting him to sleep was the most difficult thing. I keep seeing him or thinking about him. Every night when I go to bed, I think I have to take him out. It has been about a week since we put him to sleep. I know he is no longer in pain and that our decision was the right one, but it is very difficult at this point whenever I think of him."

It is a long description but I think it was important to include.  I have tried to make it as readable as possible.  My father who is 70 years old has been experiencing continuous hiccups for a year now.  This is obviously very painful as he is unable to eat or even sleep properly. After testing countless home remedies, we got him checked by medical experts about 6 months ago.  Almost all of them informed us it is due to prolonged stress, which might be true due to certain events in our lives. ********** BACKGROUND INFO ********** Age = 70 years. Ethnicity = South Asian. He has had high blood pressure and high cholesterol for more than 25 years, has been gout patient too for that amount of time. He has been obese as well for 25+ years, current weight = 245 lb, height = almost 6 feet. He also had type 2 diabetes probably for 15+ years. He can barely walk and is not active at all, mostly due to back and joint pains. He has avoided almost all meat products for 10+ years, but I think he gained weight due to more consumption of carbohydrates, specifically white flour and rice. No smoking/drinking or recreational drugs habits thankfully. He has also been experiencing cough and weakness and loss of appetite for the last 20 days or so. None of the doctors were 100% sure about the solution and prescribed the following tests and medications:  ********** TESTS DONE ********** All information is within 3 months range. -Uric Acid = 7 [normal] -All Cholesterols Total/HDL/LDL within range -Triglycerides 10-20% above normal range -ALT normal -Blood sugar controlled by 2 medicines, Glucophage and Glucobay -His ultrasound was i think normal too. -In a very recent test, it was shown his heart walls have become thick due to prolonged stress and cholesterol.  ********** DOCTORS CURRENT CONSENSUS ********** Out of the 5 doctors consulted, 2 are Cardiologists, 2 General Practitioner and a very recent one is Neurologist. Should I also consult Gastroenterologist? -Doctors ruled out existence of tumors or cancers etc based on ultrasound and long history of hiccups. Few doctors also suggested it might be GERD or acid reflux but he does not have all the symptoms. ********** ANY OTHER TESTS NEEDED? ********** I wonder now why no doctor asked to check his ""cortisol"" range? Is it not important to test to measure stress? Any other important factors to test for his stress levels? Is ENDOSCOPY really needed? No doctor so far suggested it but after researching online it seems very important? **********RECENT MEDICATIONS FOR HICCUPS********** Medications for hiccups he has been using regularly since the past 3-4 months -Motilium tablet [4 months][1+1+1 before each meal] -Nexum capsule [3 months][1+0+1 before each meal] -Gaviscon syrup [3 months] [1+0+1, 1 tbsp after each meal]  -Motival tablet [1 month][1, in the night] for stress/anxiety -RIVOTRIL for stress management prescribed by a neurologist for 3 weeks. ******OTHER DAILY LONGTERM MEDICATIONS HE TAKES REGULARLY******* These are additional medications he has to take daily for heart, blood pressure, sugar, uric acid and pain killers etc. -COEZIDAY 100mg 1x  -CAPOTIN 50mg 2x [0.25+0.25mg] -GLUCOPHANGE 500mg 1x -GLUCOBAY 50mg 1x -DISPIRIN 300mg 1x -ZYLORIC 100mg [URIC ACID] **********THE ONLY TEMPORARY REMEDY THAT WORKS********** A very temporary cure [30 minutes to 1 hour] is drinking any cola [higher the carbonation, better] while standing and bending low. Drinking warm water helps a little bit as well. Please tell me what can we do about it? This has been very painful not only to the patient but for all family members as well. I can of course provide more info if needed.  Any help will be highly appreciated. Thank you very much again."

It is a long description but I think it was important to include.  I have tried to make it as readable as possible.  My father who is 70 years old has been experiencing continuous hiccups for a year now.  This is obviously very painful as he is unable to eat or even sleep properly. After testing countless home remedies, we got him checked by medical experts about 6 months ago.  Almost all of them informed us it is due to prolonged stress, which might be true due to certain events in our lives. ********** BACKGROUND INFO ********** Age = 70 years. Ethnicity = South Asian. He has had high blood pressure and high cholesterol for more than 25 years, has been gout patient too for that amount of time. He has been obese as well for 25+ years, current weight = 245 lb, height = almost 6 feet. He also had type 2 diabetes probably for 15+ years. He can barely walk and is not active at all, mostly due to back and joint pains. He has avoided almost all meat products for 10+ years, but I think he gained weight due to more consumption of carbohydrates, specifically white flour and rice. No smoking/drinking or recreational drugs habits thankfully. He has also been experiencing cough and weakness and loss of appetite for the last 20 days or so. None of the doctors were 100% sure about the solution and prescribed the following tests and medications:  ********** TESTS DONE ********** All information is within 3 months range. -Uric Acid = 7 [normal] -All Cholesterols Total/HDL/LDL within range -Triglycerides 10-20% above normal range -ALT normal -Blood sugar controlled by 2 medicines, Glucophage and Glucobay -His ultrasound was i think normal too. -In a very recent test, it was shown his heart walls have become thick due to prolonged stress and cholesterol.  ********** DOCTORS CURRENT CONSENSUS ********** Out of the 5 doctors consulted, 2 are Cardiologists, 2 General Practitioner and a very recent one is Neurologist. Should I also consult Gastroenterologist? -Doctors ruled out existence of tumors or cancers etc based on ultrasound and long history of hiccups.

I have reactive hyoglycemia, so I can't eat rice, pasta, or other meals high in carbs, otherwise I crash soon after. I need to eat about every 2-3 hours, and need some balance there as well (a quality protein bar is a decent snack, but even with that I crash -- real food, with meat, is the only thing that truly holds me). At home, I always keep 2 snacks with me, and if I'm walking around a lot, like at the mall or a hike, I take something like Vitamin Water with me, which, while I typically avoid sugary drinks, it seems to help to sip it. Coming up soon I'm traveling to Asia for two weeks, including an area of China that's outside any major city. I'm wondering if anyone has tips for this. I'm told to expect limited restaurant choices in these areas (I'm also traveling with a group tour, so I can't choose my own stops), and that sometimes restaurants only have rice/pasta dishes (with a small bit of meat on top). I can eat about 1/4 cup of white rice before it's too much... I'm also told that stores there do not sell protein bars, beef jerky, or anything like Vitamin Water. (I'm told they have dried squid, etc, but not jerky as I know it, and other types of bars, but not decent/any protein bars). I'm really not sure what I'm going to do, and am pretty much expecting to get sugar sick a couple times... Also, anyone know of a powdered drink mix that you can pour into water that has a bit of sugar and other nutrients? I can't seem to find any. I thought about bringing sugar packets..."

Then sometimes I feel the need to go again minutes after I just went. Should I mention to my doctor or is it probably just the pain meds?

I am presently trying to lower my dosage so maybe it will get better as I take less per day, then I will know for sure it was the meds. As for my health other than this, I am in pretty good shape but having to try to get my cholesterol and sugar levels down or the doc says she is going to put me on meds for that.

I have severe shortness of breath and irregular breathing for about 80% (sometimes more, sometimes less) of my waking day. Sometimes I breath in so deep and so hard that my ears pop and unpop, and I can continue in that state for an hour or more trying to regulate my breathing and unpop my ears permanently. Sometimes my breathing is so messed a whole hand or side of my body will go numb like I’m having a stroke. Sometimes my chest gets very tight and I feel I really won’t be able to catch my breath. I often think I’m going to pass out or choke but I never do. When I was pregnant the lack of breathing manifested itself in a dry cough which I had for 6months straight which was literally just a cough from lack of breath.  It affects my life as I can be rude or snappy to people when I’m trying to regulate my breathing, and I’m often not present in what’s going on. Plus all the hard deep breathing is causing pain in my back. I have been to three different doctors and all of them have diagnosed anxiety (something I have struggled with in different forms for 11years). They think it’s this because i seem to be fine when I sleep and for the first 10 minutes when I wake from sleeping, and if I am very preoccupied (in some situations). I have been diagnosed escitocitalopram 20mg for the anxiety. I’ve been on it for around 10 months (or longer) with no success. In my country you only qualify for free/subsidised non-medical counselling help if you are depressed and on the verge of suicide. Other than my days being hard work because I can’t breathe I have a happy life and am not depressed hence why I cannot get counselling. In my country doctors are extremely overworked and I’m concerned they have overlooked something hence why after 13 months I am still struggling. I can’t do another year of this, please help !"

I was never treated as the baby of the family so I led a very lonely life even with siblings - to make matters worse my mom lied to me about who my father was until i saw a death certificate of my siblings' father and realised there was an age gap. One of my sisters also told me that i was not her real sister and not in a good way to a 7 year old. When I was 8 years old my mom allowed a step-dad to chase me out of his house while she remained and she asked for me to stay at a friends' house and for a full year I got sexually molested. I later changed living places when my mom separated with that man and found another man in another region far from where I was schooling and once again I had to live with relatives and my mother never brought money or came to visit or clean my washing - I was ill treated because of my mother's irresponsibilities. Another year passed and I had to go live with my mom and the new stepdad and they never took notice of me and I was in a new school new friends new region and still kept the secret to myself - I got molested again at age 11 by one of my brothers' friends but I still went to visit that house just because there was food, tv, goodies to eat which an 11 year old wanted - so once again I kept the secret. At age 17, after 2 primary schools, 1 middle school and 2 high schools later I finished my matric. I had always felt like an outcast all my life and battled with trusting people and relationships and finding myself in society. I learnt that something called depression is what I have and have had that's why I felt always on the down low - low self esteem - self hatred and wanted to be loved. At age 27 I had my 1st born who is now 10. I told my mom about the sexual abuse after the age of 21 but I still did not have a relationship with her - I longed for her affection and never got it - so i did all kihnds of self-destructive behaviors you can think of - in order to ease the depression and i blamed her for how my life turned out - when I asked for an apology I got a ""I said I was sorry"" from my mom. Now im 37 years old - went through 15 years of intense therapy and on the road to healing - I just a huge problem. When I had my son I guess my mom felt bad for her absence during my childhood and she made up for it by giving it to my son. They have a strong bond and I am grateful for that please don't get me wrong - maybe its her way of fixing her mistakes - but I still jealous of my son's love for her. I now have a live in partner, and we both live with my son. We try to make him happy and be the best of parents to the best of our knowledge but whenever we fetch my son after school holidays from my mom's house - he will sulk for a full week saying that he misses my mom. I have shared my life's experience with my son and explained to him what happened to me and taught him about forgiveness but I feel like a coward because I still battle to forgive my mom - whenever she wants to mother my son - I always have these negative feelings - and I don't tell her but my son knows that I get jealous - someone please help me to forgive my mother and enjoy her while she is still alive - I don't want that one day to have past regrets when she is no longer on earth and wish that I had forgiven her - other people don't have moms wish their moms were still alive but im battling with this anger I have towards her only because she never took time to ask me about my abuse and give me a hug and let me tell her everything that happened word for word - when I raise the subjects I can see the shame in her eyes towards herself and she does not think that its not about her its about me - but now I seem think that its no longer about me - I must find a way to forgive her - its now about my son and I don't want my son to think I don't have forgiveness because the circle of life turns and one day it will be me - wanting my son's forgiveness and he will be battling remembering how I used to feel about his granny.

I'm looking for some help please. I used to be on an insulin pump but now I cannot afford the pump supplies nor the insulin that always worked for me. I've started using Walmart's ReliOn 70/30 insulin with syringes. However, recently it seems that my heart goes crazy every time I take a larger dose of insulin - 10 units or higher to keep my numbers down. This is why I went to the insulin pump. I have had cardiac ablation therapy for atrial flutter, and I'm worried this recent heart problems will cause me to have to have more surgery. Has anyone else experienced changes in their heart rhythms when they take an insulin shot? I'm trying to figure out whether or not to stay on the insulin or just give it up to prevent more heart problems. Thank you for anything you can share."

I'm concerned I have some kind of mental illness. At first I thought it was depression, but I dont feel depressed and it keeps getting worse. Please understand that I'm aware I can't get a diagnosis here, and I am seeing a doctor soon, I just can't right this second. I want some opinions because I want to know what to be ready for. I am currently 18 years old and living with my grandfather. My most notable probelms are as follows: -I'm barely emotional. I hardly cry or get angry. I'm told I'm dull or selfish (because I don't have a lot of empathy, which caused difficulties between my mom and I. I understand other people's feelings, I just oftentimes don't have the drive to care as much as I should. Apathy.) often and I have a hard time showing or accepting intense emotion. I can get my feelings hurt relatively easily, though. - Easily bored, few activities, low motivation. I spend all of my days in bed. Sometimes I might play video games, but I don't stay invested long. I don't really do anything because I just don't really feel like it. I stopped trying in or caring about school my freshman year of high school. I used to be a straight A student. I've even lost motivation to keep clean. I used to clean myself excessively, now it's always an afterthought and I have a very difficult time caring or motivating myself to do it. Sometimes I have problems with instructions, especially if it's a set of them. (Ex. My grandpa was cleaning the oven and told me it smelled really weird. He told me to open the door and check (meaning the oven door). I went to the front door of the house and opened it, maybe thinking he was telling me to get a breath of fresh air and then see how the house smells different. I understood when he corrected me and elaborated. This happens frequently and causes me to get overwhelmed when the directions are long or complex.) - Isolation and withdrawal. I no longer have any friends because of my stubbornness and apathy and also because I lost interest in socializing. I haven't talked to anyone outside of my family (not including my girlfriend, long distance) or left the house in months. If my grandpa's home, I don't leave my room except to eat and use the restroom. I have a very low sex drive and often no sex drive at all. Sometimes I lose the energy and motivation to speak, so I don't. I'm known for being quiet. - Talking to myself? I've had a difficult time assessing whether this is an actual symptom of an illness, or just a sort of myth. I talk to myself often as if I'm talking to someone else. I may refer to myself by my name and as 'you' out loud, or often the same way in my head. When I think sometimes the thoughts feel very loud or 'intense', sometimes almost to the point where it feels real enough that I'll kind of move my tongue along with it. I feel like I'm reading a lot into that one, though. I'll also talk to myself by sometimes repeating how a conversation went or 'practicing' for one I haven't had yet, either out loud or in my head. - Paranoid thoughts and existential anxiety. These are the symptoms that have caused me considerable distress and are the most recent to appear, along with being the reason for my suspicions to begin with. The paranoia started about six or seven months ago after I tried LSD once (I was a drug user for a while, this is what made me cut down/eventually stop). A few days after the trip, I started having mild depression (which is better now). Then I started having really intense and overwhelming unprovoked fears of being murdered. This got so difficult to deal with that it became a ritual to find and secure every possible entry point to the house, I would always carry a knife around and put one under my pillow at night, and I oftentimes couldn't sleep or relax. I once saw three young boys outside my house and was convinced they were scoping me out to rob me. I would also regularly worry that my grandpa had placed audio devices or cameras in the house before he left for work, or that he only pretended to leave for work to trick me and was secretly in the house still watching me, both because he thought I was doing something bad. Those thoughts weren't as intense and I was able to reassure myself. I would also become extremely concerned that the police were after me, or that neighbors knew I had done drugs and were watching me or preparing to contact the police. Anytime I saw a police car or heard sirens, I would be completely silent and wait in my room in the dark watching through the windows to see if they were coming for me. I'm so on edge sometimes that I may accidentally mistake other sounds for sirens. For example, a rooster call a few days ago. If a car was parked even several houses away from me with the headlights on, I would worry they knew and were watching me, waiting for me to do something illegal so they could call the police. I also at one time expressed concern to my girlfriend that my neighbors were watching me through my window because I saw one drive by twice in a short span of time. Anytime I have my window open and someone exits their house, I think they're watching me. I had a dispute with my mom throught text online once, and for a while I was very worried she would come over to my grandpa's house with her boyfriend to kill or kidnap me. I still have these episodes and I didn't even notice they were strange until my girlfriend mentioned it. They seem a little silly in hindsight, but they always feel real in my mind while it occurs. Also, the symptom that led to me noticing something was wrong, existential thoughts and thoughts about death and life's meaning are always on my mind and almost intrusive. This became gradually more severe until recently I had a bad panic attack because I don't understand what consciousness means or where it comes from, where it goes, or how it can logically exist. I just get so hyper self-aware that it's almost debilitating. This terrifies me to think about and I often try to keep myself preoccupied to avoid these thoughts. Though, even if I'm not panicking, they're always there. - Possible dissociation? This started occurring after my existential panic. I now go through phases where I feel like I'm dreaming or I don't exist, I don't do a lot or move much because I feel light and like I'm not taking up any space, almost ghostly. My emotions feel distant and I feel empty, unable to relate to anyone or anything.  Those are the ones that have been the most concerning for me and those close to me. Does this sound like the onset of any kind of illness? It started about three years ago with my increased isolation and has gradually gotten worse. Thank you in advance for any help you can offer."

My life was never athletic and I sat at a computer most of the day. Recently (just starting college) I'll attend the gym 3-4 times a week and do standard weight training (focus a different body part each day) with nothing super intensive. I'm pretty much primarily focusing on upper body. It seems, however, right after I come home I'm crazy insulin sensitive. There will be periods where I'll give half the recommended amount of insulin and I'll still drop from 300 to 60 (if my blood sugar for some reason got high right afterwards). I feel very tired right afterwards (like a physical tired, not necessarily sleepy) and I get very anxious. The few days after I go to the gym I'll still feel this effect where insulin is much more sensitive. I'm getting a little annoyed/scared because I'll sometimes take my blood sugar at 9:00 PM (after going to the gym around 3:00 PM) and I'll be 250, I give a shot, then it'll drop really quickly/too much and I have to have snacks periodically to get it go to back up. Is this common? I know that working out will obviously make you drop directly afterwards but are there ever cases where it will make you THIS insulin sensitive? I've only been working out for maybe ~2 months. My diet is really sparse recently which I feel may be a leading factor in this. I'll wake up, grab a granola bar or something, then wait until later in the day to eat a full meal. Please let me know if you need any other information! Best wishes, Samuel"

May not be for people familiar with food allergy treatment. Peanut protein patch applied to HEALTHY skin is a treatment for peanut allergy. One of the ways peanut protein applied to skin works, is the generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) specific to peanut. Tregs regulate/moderate the immune system's reaction to peanut exposure.

Basically over a year ago I was sick and was coughing up a lot of green mucus that lasted for months and it finally got better not long after that I started having breathing issues. I can breath but I either have to take deep breaths or yawn A lot i don't know what's wrong but I'm scared and in need of help. I have had so many test done but none of them come up with anything. I had a plaminary test done that was all good. I had my thyroid and blood count checked that was good too. I have headaches/migraines random pains in my arms and shoulder blades sometimes in my breast of course trouble breathing and anxiety. I was on Fluxoitine but that wasn't working anymore so I'm now on Lexapo and that was working great every time I was starting to have trouble breathing I'd take it and be able to relax went to see the doc after a month of using it and since then I've started having trouble again.... seems a little worse now. I know I am freaking out about the new year coming up but I keep feeling sick to my stomach a little dizzy and having trouble sleeping and breathing and nothing I've done is helping. Can someone please help me. I will be making an appointment with my doc this week as well.

She was admitted to the hospital 4 days ago by force with auditory grandeur hallucinations from God telling her she is an Arc Angel sent to Earth to fight the demons she accused family members, including their children, to have. Including God, her auditory hallucinations include passed family members speaking in “tongues”. She can’t understand them, yet feels compelled to write down everything “they” tell her.  She took Effexor for 1 month but was taken off at the hospital. No other medication, however, long time cannabis consumer. Her symptoms as of last month: Auditory hallucinations, Dementia, Extreme mood swings Her symptoms as of last year: Weight loss, hair loss After 3 days, she was released after reporting her hallucinations stopped. However, after she got home her hallucinations returned and she is angry and miserable and is tormenting our family believing she’s doing gods work of killing the demons. We are tired and scared and know the laws for forced care surrounding mental health in MN are strict, so just any advice would help beyond words. Thanks"

I was just tired of feeling numb so I cut my arm one time. And it felt good. So I started cutting everyday. Then a couple of weeks ago my parents found out and they told me only crazy people did that and that they were very disapointed with me. So I stopped cutting my arm and starded cutting my legs. I take a lot of time to fall asleep and I sleep for like 10 hours. I shouldnt feel this way. Im only 18. I finished school last year and decided to take a year off. I am learning how to drive so I should be happy. When I was a kid I was bullied by my best friends. It went on for years and the worst is I didnt realized it. I thought it was normal. Then when it got phisical my parents found out and moved me to another school. I made new friend and they were really good to me. Thatt when I realized that what happend was wrong. I felt so stupid! And so angry with them for mocking me and hurting me, with my parents for not noticing and with me for letting it happen. I felt so lost. I took half a year of school and moved to my grandparents home. I barely left the bed. My family wanted to take to a psychologist but I didnt wanted to talk about it. I just wanted to forget it. So I did. I pulled myself up. I started going to school again and I managed to pass the year. Then a few years later, two years ago my mom found out she had cancer. It was a very difficult time. She has severe depression and then she got really worse. She wanted to die. We were praying for it to be benign and she was praying for it to be malignant. A few months later we got the news. It was benign. She was going to be fine. Today she still has severe depression but she starded seeig a psychiatrist and taking medication so she is a lot better. So back to me. I dont really understand why I feel the way I feel. I mean. why now? Now everything is fine. Im just starting my life. Im thinking about going to college next year. Or at least I think I am. There are day when I feel fine. Happy even. On this days I think about my future and I see one. I will go to college. The get a job. A house. And I'll live. But then I realize that those are just dreams. That in reality I will never be able to do it. I will fail. And so I even want that life? I dont! I dont want to go to college!

I know the bottom number is good, but the top number is not. However I am always extremely nervous when I take my blood pressure. 2- I am ALWAYS aware of my heartbeat it seems like, and I’m constantly checking my pulse. It’s the worse when I lay down on my bike. I had a major panic attack back in feb 2017, where I felt like I was dying and I couldn’t catch my breath. I think it’s important to point out that I was taking adderall (prescribed not recreational) 20G extended release during this time. And I was convinced to smoke some weed (I know, stupid) and that’s when the panic attack happened. It was horrible, and I’ve had major anxiety ever since. I had no chest pain during this attack, however my pulse was through the roof, my limbs and face were tingling and I couldn’t breathe. I did not pass out though. What I want to know is this. How can I treat this? I have not taken any adderall since that day, barely drank any alcohol, and I’m never touching weed again. But I need some help, it still feels like I have some underlying heart issue. By the way, I am a 24 year old male in great shape. Work out almost everyday. I use to be a competitive swimmer for 12+ years if that has anything tp do with it. My family has no history of heart disease, but my mom does have anxiety.

Just to let you know something about myself: I'm 24 years old, I work as a computer programmer and I tend to overwork myself A LOT. Needless to say, I don't do much sports but I am not overweight. Had problems with candida (back in 2015) which caused similiar simpthoms as described below but not that strong. So, to the problem at hand... One year ago (last November) I started experiencing more and more anxiety each day (I am prone to anxiety but not to this extent). Shortly after, panic attacks started happening out of nowhere. I noticed that the panic attacks tend to happen when I stay in front of the computer for a longer period of time, but they were not limited to just this. When I enter this ""panic state"" all my senses feel overwhelmed and fast moving objects in front of my eyes cause irritation in my nerve system (I feel something like a surge or an impulse of some sort). It seems like everything originates from my Vagus nerve. This happened almost every day and it was very unpleasant... In time I kinda got used to it and managed to keep it less intense with will power I guess. Still pretty unpleasant. Anyway... When summer came, I had a problem with some weird cough that occurred very randomly throughout the day. I would cough in the mornings or in the evenings, but sometimes in the middle of the day too. It was intense for like 5-10 minutes and then it would fade away. It was caused by saliva or something behind my nose I guess, that went down the throat and caused the cough. I ignored it for quite a while but then decided to go to the doctor and she thought it was an allergy (I usually have allergies in the spring when certain trees blossom). She gave me a shot of some medicine, not sure what, that was supposed to deal with that ""allergy"". Needless to say, it did not help. Actually, it became far worse after the shot. I went to a lab in my town and gave samples of saliva from my throat. In the results it turned out to be a massive candida infection. It was probably a candida infection to begin with but it grew even more after that shot (I think it suppresses the immune system to battle allergies?). I was anxious and panicked ALL THE TIME at that point. When I gave the results to the doctor and she prescribed medicine to battle the candida (Itroconazole) things got much better. I stopped eating sweet things and limited my sugar intake as much as possible, as I read that candida thrives on sweet things. I started feeling great for a time. No coughing, anxiety/panic level was minimal with panic states happening rarely (but still there). Something very strange I noticed was, whenever I would eat chocolate or something sweet or consume milk, I would enter panic states after a couple of hours of consumption. I gave more samples to the lab after a while, to see if the candida has been dealt with... and it was. However, this time a significant amount of ""Haemophilus parainfluenzae"" was isolated from the samples. I went to the doctor again, she prescribed antibiotics. After 7 days of taking them everything was gone. No anxiety, no panic attacks. Nothing. It was great! However, a month and a half later I began to gradually experience more and more anxiety and the panic states returned shortly after that. I went to the lab yet again... Small amount of candida and again, a significant amount of haemophilus parainfluenzae. I started taking antibiotics again... after 7 days of them and another 5 so my organism can clear them off a bit, I gave more samples to the lab. No candida, significant amount of haemophiuls influenzae (without the ""para"" this time). Went to my doctor again, she said that was good for some reason. Gave me another antibiotic (weaker I think) and told me to take it for 10 days. And I finished it a couple of days ago. I will soon go to the lab again and see what happens... So, what do you guys think? Is this anxiety/nervousness/panic state caused by candida, by bacterial infection, by overworking and staying on the computer too long? Is it just a mental problem? Is it a combination of all these things? I really want to return to my normal state before all that."

It was probably a candida infection to begin with but it grew even more after that shot (I think it suppresses the immune system to battle allergies?). I was anxious and panicked ALL THE TIME at that point. When I gave the results to the doctor and she prescribed medicine to battle the candida (Itroconazole) things got much better. I stopped eating sweet things and limited my sugar intake as much as possible, as I read that candida thrives on sweet things. I started feeling great for a time. No coughing, anxiety/panic level was minimal with panic states happening rarely (but still there). Something very strange I noticed was, whenever I would eat chocolate or something sweet or consume milk, I would enter panic states after a couple of hours of consumption. I gave more samples to the lab after a while, to see if the candida has been dealt with... and it was. However, this time a significant amount of ""Haemophilus parainfluenzae"" was isolated from the samples. I went to the doctor again, she prescribed antibiotics. After 7 days of taking them everything was gone. No anxiety, no panic attacks. Nothing. It was great! However, a month and a half later I began to gradually experience more and more anxiety and the panic states returned shortly after that. I went to the lab yet again... Small amount of candida and again, a significant amount of haemophilus parainfluenzae. I started taking antibiotics again... after 7 days of them and another 5 so my organism can clear them off a bit, I gave more samples to the lab. No candida, significant amount of haemophiuls influenzae (without the ""para"" this time). Went to my doctor again, she said that was good for some reason. Gave me another antibiotic (weaker I think) and told me to take it for 10 days. And I finished it a couple of days ago. I will soon go to the lab again and see what happens... So, what do you guys think? Is this anxiety/nervousness/panic state caused by candida, by bacterial infection, by overworking and staying on the computer too long? Is it just a mental problem? Is it a combination of all these things? I really want to return to my normal state before all that."

Several years later I was told my blood sugar is normal and everything looks great, yet I never changed anything, my diet, never exercised much and never took any type of medication. To me diabetes is a medical condition that affects people differently. While I was in the hospital I was told that I had to do this and change that but I didn't and now magically I have no more diabetes. I got tired of doctors saying you are fine, there's no problem and everything looks good so I just tell people diabetes is a temporary thing for me, I had it for the moment. If anybody says diabetes can't be reversed they are in denial or have come to accept the fact that this controllable reversible condition is uncontrollable and irreversible.

Today I forgot to take them and took them several hours later and I feel a bit strange and am wondering if it’s because my body is used to taking them earlier. I am feeling very jittery and having bad stomach problems as well as fatigue. Could this be due to not taking my medication at the normal time? I just feel very strange and am unsure why and I don’t know when these symptoms will subside.

However, I noticed that right before I started to feel this way I became particularly afraid of developing diabetes. It started off with slight numbness in my feet. At first I assumed it was only a placebo effect causing the sudden numbness. And then the numbness disappeared and it turned into a weird feeling in my calf, not a pins and needles sensation but just a strange feeling. Shortly after, I noticed that I started to feel generally unwell, like I had a bad cold. I noticed that I would get chills at random times. However, right before all of these symptoms started I just felt generally less hungry and I wasn't eating much, maybe about one meal a day. At first I assumed that perhaps it was caused by me not eating much. Then I noticed that I felt an increased need to urinate. I found that I felt the increased need the most when I was worrying about diabetes. However whenever I urinated only a little would come out and it usually had a strong scent of ammonia. Also I'll occasionally get these weird on and off feelings of being very drowsy. I noticed they usually occurred around 9 pm until usually midnight. I found it strange that eating usually made the fatigue go away temporarily. I would assume that eating would usually make it worst so this adds onto my doubts. The weird leg sensation has also been on and off as well and it usually goes away temporarily while I'm being physically active. If I now think about it, this illness has been kinda on and off. One minute I'll feel almost completely healthy then next minute I feel as if I didn't sleep at all the previous night. Also, I checked my weight and I haven't gain nor lost any at all.

I'm scared to tell my family?,"Hello. I'm a 16 year old female and the last couple of days I haven't been feeling the best. However, I noticed that right before I started to feel this way I became particularly afraid of developing diabetes. It started off with slight numbness in my feet. At first I assumed it was only a placebo effect causing the sudden numbness. And then the numbness disappeared and it turned into a weird feeling in my calf, not a pins and needles sensation but just a strange feeling. Shortly after, I noticed that I started to feel generally unwell, like I had a bad cold. I noticed that I would get chills at random times. However, right before all of these symptoms started I just felt generally less hungry and I wasn't eating much, maybe about one meal a day. At first I assumed that perhaps it was caused by me not eating much. Then I noticed that I felt an increased need to urinate. I found that I felt the increased need the most when I was worrying about diabetes. However whenever I urinated only a little would come out and it usually had a strong scent of ammonia. Also I'll occasionally get these weird on and off feelings of being very drowsy. I noticed they usually occurred around 9 pm until usually midnight. I found it strange that eating usually made the fatigue go away temporarily. I would assume that eating would usually make it worst so this adds onto my doubts. The weird leg sensation has also been on and off as well and it usually goes away temporarily while I'm being physically active. If I now think about it, this illness has been kinda on and off. One minute I'll feel almost completely healthy then next minute I feel as if I didn't sleep at all the previous night. Also, I checked my weight and I haven't gain nor lost any at all. Also I've been feeling feverish so I assume it might be an infection that mimics the symptoms of diabetes. I've been feeling this way for about 4 days now. Right before this I felt perfectly healthy.  I'm from a low income family so I kinda grew up eating crap and I still kinda do.

There are times, when I go to use the restroom, and suddenly there is nothing. No urge to go anymore, nothing.  And even trying to force a urination/bowel movement does not do anything. Within 5 minutes of leaving the bathroom....it hits me even harder. Back to the bathroom, and absolutely nothing.  It eventually hits the breaking point and I end up wetting/messing my pants.  I am pushing 40 now, with no hope really of finding a permanent solution.  Dr's I have seen say there is no clear sign of medical anything wrong.  I have even seen some physiologists/psychiatrists on the issue. Only one gave a suggestion that it might be subconscious. At that point she said it might never be curable.  I am tired of these times happening, and tired of adult diapers. Tired of worrying about having an accident in my pants in public, when this happens to me.  Does anyone else in the world have this kind of issue? I am looking for answers to help end this cycle."

There is a lot of detail to cover, but I will try to be as brief as possible: Background facts: 1)	Father was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, paranoid-type 27 years ago, a few months prior to my birth; his brother had already been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and committed suicide roughly 20 years ago; their mother also had an indeterminate psychological disorder (since whatever she had probably pre-dated the classification of many psychological disorders) 2)	I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child, and up until the event that occurred two years ago (which I will explain shortly), I was medicated with various ADHD drugs (first Ritalin, then Adderall, then Concerta), and I believe I was misdiagnosed in the first place, and that I instead had (and have) an anxiety disorder (which I have an appointment for), in addition to possibly being on the autism spectrum Here is the story (from the beginning): Early 2015, my father experienced back-to-back psychotic breaks, a few weeks apart. His medication (Zyprexa) stopped working, but his doctor was unconcerned and figured these were isolated incidents (since this was the first psychotic break he had since his initial diagnosis). He gradually began to deteriorate; as recent as a few months prior, he was totally stable aside from occasionally hearing voices, but by March or April of 2015, he was having active visual and auditory hallucinations, and was regularly unable to distinguish reality from perception. It started out manageable. At nights he would wander the streets without shoes or socks; he would wake up my mother in the middle of the night telling her he has somewhere to go; he would wake me up to tell me my mother is dead, even though she wasn’t. We got used to this, but within months he got much worse. He refused to shower, stating that he is allergic to water (at one point he hasn’t showered for 6 months). He began talking to himself, exhibiting huge shifts in mood and personality, occasionally screaming at walls and trying to climb through windows. We told the doctor, who didn’t seem particularly concerned by the situation. So we had to take measures into our own hands. We didn’t feel safe having him live upstairs, so we convinced him that he had to live in the basement in a spare room, which solved our anxieties briefly. Within a week however, he was regularly screaming “leave me alone!” He began punching walls. He would continue wandering in the night, so we had to install cameras to regularly monitor his location. After a few more times of him coming upstairs to wake me up and tell me that my mother is dead, we decided that the basement door had to be locked overnight for our safety, and for us to be able to even sleep or feel safe. Things continued to get worse. He communicated that he wanted to burn the house down and kill the dog, so we called an ambulance. He was determined to be sound of mind and stable, and was released home within two days. Within hours of being home, he reverted back to his previous behavior, but worse. We would wake up to the sound of him punching the windows on our floor to get in. Or, if we were lucky, he would only attempt to open the basement door every 5 minutes, frequently banging on the door and screaming to get in throughout the night. He began punching the walls in the basement and acting very irregular, so out of fear that he may start the house on fire or hurt himself, we called an ambulance again. And again he was released back home within two days. By this point, I had begun smoking copious amounts of marijuana just to cope with the stress (in addition to taking my prescribed Concerta for ADHD, which I needed to help focus as a logistics analyst). For the latter months, I took it upon myself to regularly check the basement camera throughout the night to make sure he is still in his room, occasionally being able to sleep through the sounds of him screaming and banging on the door. (For the record, whenever we would open the door to see why he is screaming and banging, he would always have a confused look on his face, turn around and return to his room, before repeating the previous behavior minutes later.) I was getting very little sleep, and even during my waking hours, at work, on the train to and from work, in my free time, I was almost constantly in a state of fear that at any moment, my father would murder my mother or burn the house down. This is why I was (during every waking hour) checking the cameras regularly. I would be lucky if I averaged 2-3 hours of sleep for the latter months before my own incident. On top of this, we hadn’t had insurance for many months, and all of the medical bills for all of his hospital stays began piling up, with regular phone calls from hospitals, and new bills in the mail every single day. It had reached a point where the scariest part of some days was just checking the mail (at this point, mom and I were in a constant state of high anxiety). I also needed to take lots of time off work, which filled me with additional fear of losing my job (since at this point, my mother relied entirely on my income). This all eventually escalated to my father attempting to grab a knife after the 7th time we ultimately had to call the police. This was deeply traumatic for mom and I. We were emotionless zombies at this point, and by then the fear of my mom having a nervous breakdown weighed heavily as well, on top of my fear of him returning home. About two days later, he was still hospitalized, and we had brief moments of comfort, but they were often interrupted by the impending fear that he will soon be released home, again, as he was the previous 6 times. During the first weekend after his 7th hospitalization that year (mid-October 2015), I wanted to relax and distract myself from the almost paralyzing fear that dad will be released home, so I had what can only be described as a tremendous amount of marijuana, plus my usual dose of Concerta, after several days of still not sleeping more than 2-3 hours per night (since occasionally, dad would be released and dropped off in a cab in the middle of the night). And after a few hours of chain-smoking marijuana, I “had an epiphany” and almost instantly became manic. I began writing essays on the history of gladiators, detailed and sourced, dozens of pages long. I began reading the works of Socrates. I began thinking that I would write a book that would change the world. I was suddenly very happy, and also extremely hyper. At the time I was 380lbs and sedentary, but suddenly I wanted to jog, which I did for a while. During the following 7 days, I continued to smoke marijuana heavily, in addition to taking Concerta. I was sleeping even less now, spending much of my free time reading philosophy and writing the outline of my treatise that would change the world. Then on the 7th day, I experienced my first hallucination, at work. I observed myself getting a candy bar out of a vending machine without quarters, and concluded that I must be able to control the vending machine with my mind. Luckily I am extremely skeptical by nature, so I reasoned that the only logical conclusion was that I hallucinated, since telekinesis is impossible. The next morning I went to the emergency room, and they promptly diagnosed me with bipolar and hospitalized me for 7 days, after which I was released back into the world. The drug they prescribed me with (Depakote) gave me intense anxiety, where I would have panic attacks if the phone rang. This intense anxiety eventually led to job loss. Luckily, after the 7th time of calling the police on dad, the hospital finally determined that he is not safe to live with us, so he was (and continues to be) permanently institutionalized at a state facility. I was able to get both of my parents on Medicaid, and luckily they were able to cover all of his medical bills retroactively. I eventually overcame the anxiety after I stopped taking medication, and since then (two years later) I am entirely back to normal. I also stopped taking medication for my ADHD, and discovered that I didn’t really need it, and that I may have simply been slightly addicted to it. As was the case before my dad’s psychotic breaks, I am very emotionally stable. I don’t have mood swings. I never experience anger, for the most part. I cry and laugh at appropriate moments. Other than the occasional blues, I have always been (and continue to be) emotionally stable. So here is my question: is it possible that I am not bipolar, and that I simple experienced an isolated manic episode caused by incredible stress, sleep deprivation, extremely heavy drug use, and trauma? Everyone who knows me cannot believe that I am bipolar, myself included. Is there any evidence of manic episodes happening without being bipolar? If so, does this seem like a circumstance that could result in a manic episode without bipolarity? At this point, is it possible to be diagnosed as not bipolar? Thanks in advance if you have made it this far! Hoping that some consensus can be made here."

Obesity can lead to insulin resistance - usually a precursor to the development of type 2 diabetes. Damage will stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin, but the final pancreas can not be enough to prevent blood sugar levels rise too high.

Obesity and weight gain are important factors that lead to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, which play an important role in genetics, eating habits, exercise and lifestyle. The effect of body fat on insulin and glucose metabolism is hormonal.

About her: 17 years old, 2 parent household, goes to a public school, has 2 brothers that are older and are in college away from home. Heres her story... So about 2 years ago (give or take) she went through a bad breakup and got out of a somewhat abusive relationship where all the guy wanted was sex and once he figure out that she didn't want to have it he broke up with her and treated her badly even after they broke up.  So for the past few years she has been struggling with anxiety and depression. She has gone through spells where she can eat because her stomach hurts too bad because she is over thinking or where she can't sleep because her brain is just too active. The past year that we have been dating I have been someone for her to count on and put trust in so that she has someone there for her. But she still struggles to live day to day because anxiety and depression just affect her and her ability to make friends and just function in daily life in general. She doesn't act suicidal and hasn't self harmed yet but she knows that this is affecting her daily day to day life. The biggest problem with this whole situation is her parents. Her parents don't believe that ""mental health problems are a real medical problem"" and this is a problem because they wont take her to get treatment in any way shape or form. ( To put this into perspective, her father wouldn't let her brother take ADHD meds when he was young because he didn't believe that anything was wrong even though there clearly was because he was having serious trouble in school.) She has asked them for help and all they do is put her on simple vitamins because they just shrug it off as a vitamin deficiency or some other insignificant problem. She is aware that these thing are affecting her life and asks me for help because she doesn't know what to do... So, heres what i'm asking... 1. How do I help her and what steps can I take to help her in any way possible? 2. How could I convince her parents to get her help? 3. What to do, I feel really bad that I can't help her? 4. What free resources might be available to help? 5. Anything that could make a difference. My mother knows about this issue but doesn't know what to do or how to approach this situation either."

For me, the weekend was one of my best - I only binged and purged once (after everyone had gone to bed), I drank but not to oblivion, I played with the kids and joked around, I didn't hurt myself, and I had so many happy memories. Her words cut so deep that I don't know how I can get past this - I have had multiple suicide attempts, struggle with anorexia and bulimia, depression, self harm, anxiety...family is that one thing that makes it all worth it. But most of all, I am mortified and SO ashamed. I never want to hurt the ones I love, and it seems like no matter how hard I try I end up causing pain anyway.

I live with my parents in a house full of people (6 adults and 3 children in a 4 bedroom house).  My mom has bad depression. It has affected me since I was 12. She would be in the psychward off and on for most of high school. I'd walk on eggshells and wonder why my mom didn't love me enough to want to live. She would use her depression to win fights. ""Well I'm just going to kill myself then."" Or with my dad it would be, ""maybe we should just get a divorce."" I love my mom because she's my mom, but I don't like her as a person. She's manipulative. She's a bully. She talks down to people and tries to control everyone. If you try to stand up for yourself or call her on what she's doing she turns into a victim and acts like everyone gangs up on her. We'll sit here all week doing nothing and the minute I want to clean my room or go do something she suddenly needs me to do something for her.  I planned a cruise for my daughter and I next year, but the catch is that its over the weekend that is my boyfriend's birthday and my parents anniversary. My boyfriend offered to drive me from Oregon to California ON HIS BIRTHDAY and she complained that I wouldn't be here to watch my niece and nephew for her anniversary (""I guess we won't celebrate our anniversary."") that is 10 months away. She gets jealous if anyone is enjoying their life. When a big event happens (wedding, birthday, pregnancy) she ends up in the psychward. She constantly flips out about little things and yells at everyone and then accuses us of disrespecting her. My parents have martial problems (they split for a few years and got remarried last year) and out of nowhere she'll bring up the past.  So yes my mom has depression and yes I have it to, but the difference is I WANT TO GET BETTER. I WANT TO ENJOY MY LIFE AND BE HAPPY."

For a country that is drowning in fresh, clean drinking water, such a large percentage of the population doesn't drink enough of it. At least 50% of the doctor visits for women end with the physician reminding the patient to drink more (freakin') water. Infections, constipation, muscle & joint pain, headaches, severe menstrual cramps, gout, insomnia, skin disorders, gum disease, chronic fatigue and, of course, Type Diabetes can be exacerbated by lack of fluid in-take. You can eat the healthiest diet in the world & exercise for hours...it will be all for nothing without enough water. The countries with the least amount of available fresh drinking water suffer the greatest health threats. Lack of water is the most insidious and destructive form of malnutrition. People come to this board complaining of chronic, unrelenting symptoms. They've tried ""everything"". Everything, that is, except drink more water!  75% of seniors over the age of 65 suffer from dehydration. Billions could be saved...BILLIONS!!!!!!!!!!!...if these people could simply drink more water. It's absolutely pathetic! If a medical equipment manufacturer could design a simple & easy device allowing seniors to receive intravenous fluid replenishment while watching Judge Judy, every afternoon, we could cut our taxes a huge amount. We seldom miss ""Happy Hour"" and, never, our morning Starbucks. But, we can't remind ourselves to drink a cup of water every couple hours.

Just when I think she has to go to a dr the symptom will go away and she will have an excuse for it. Here is what has been going on for a year: Heartburn (takes several different antacids daily) starting to complain that they need to be stronger because they're not working as well. Hot flashes  Cold sweats Bouts of nausea  Has had pains in back, neck, arms, jaw, teeth, knees, feet (sometimes in combo with sweats and nausea, but eventually it goes away) Itchy skin ( extremely dry itchy scalp, red itchy spots on upper arms, peeling hands) White spots in throat, difficulty swallowing ( gone in one week) Restlessness (complains of inability to sleep)  Episodes of heart racing (especially at night, but goes away)  Has had headaches daily for at least a month strait ( must be dull because she was still able to function) that symptom seems to have gone away since the weather has gotten warmer.  Her hands and feet seemed to get colder than normal during winter months (almost painful) Has complained once of foamy urine One ankle swells occasionally Watery eyes, feeling like stye (went away) Tired and yawns a lot during day ( but she is still out and about) Hardly ever urinates (despite drinking a large coffee daily) That's it in a nutshell.. just when I think she will have to go to the dr her symptoms go away and she's fine for a few days until the next time she complains. She is at least 100 lb overweight mostly belly and neck fat.  I'd like to hear what you think might be going on inside her body, no one in her family seems to care or insist she see a dr. I feel like I would be overstepping my boundaries.. I'm confused.. help"

I am a 73 yr old, 20 year diabetic. When I finally retired and was able to eat what I wanted to, I lost weight and my blood sugar readings dropped and stayed low. I eat good foods. I buy blueberries and other 'healthy' foods. When I get hunger or 'tasty', I simply  eat something good from my pantry. Since I like all the things I buy (for the most part), My hunger is satisfied. When I go out, I eat basically anything I want; although most of what I choose is good for me. Now, having done this for awhile, I am 40+ pounds lighter, my AIC in the 6.3 area. What I am trying to say is that by surrounding myself with quality good foods and eating foods FOR the goodness they contain, I have brought my diabetes in check. For breakfast today I'll have oatmeal with blueberries and raisins. Later, I'll eat a small tomato and two apricots (the tomato because I know it is good and the apricots before they go bad). I brought an avocato because of it's good fat, I''ll eat it later or tomorrow for sure.  Simply put I buy and eat foods that are listed as good for diabetics and then eat them because I need the nutrients. I may grab a few dates and a tomato. Later I will eat celery and peanut butter. Later still I will take my delicious $5 loaf of 9 grain and make a sandwich of chicken with loads of veggies. When I go out, I basically eat anything I want; very seldom is it a hot greasy cheeseburger.I only buy nutrious things. No chips, no soft drinks, rarely ice cream, good choices of meat (the -loins, etc. and not much), only healthy cereals, always guided by nutritious values. My diet is a way of life for me. I am aware that I choose the things I eat for health reasons not necessarily taste. But the truth is there are many things that are good for you and filling yourself with what you should eat is easier than you imagine. Try it, for the next week eat only 'good stuff'. Two eggs and great bread with juice. Later eat a raw tomato and some grapes. Keep eating good stuff all week- force yourself. If you can focus on the nutrients when you shop, it follows that you will eat them if available. Soon this will be the way you eat. It is a small difference, but it could change your life. You will learn to eat many small items over the day and rarely overeat. Simply put, By filling your shelves with 'good' foods and forcing yourself to eat them, you'll just naturally become slim and healthy, diabetic or not."

If the treatment of insulin resistance is through ""LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS"", and, it has been ridiculously well established, now, how utterly vital it is to NOT TO BE INSULIN RESISTANT... then, why be vague about the treatment of INSULIN RESISTANCE? Why doesn't the medical profession spell it out for everyone, when your doctor talks about ""Lifestyle Modifications""? Don't you think it's a wee bit odd, every single post, here, ends with the question, ""Should I be worried...?"" They are worried because they are CLUELESS. They are worried because they have no idea how to properly treat Type 2 Diabetes (aka, insulin resistance)... The truth is, nobody knows what ""insulin resistance"" is because nobody cares! But, when your lower legs and feet feel like they're on ""fire"", when you start to lose sight in an eye and, worst but not least, when you accuse your spouse of hiding your car keys or glasses, that's the time we should learn about ""insulin resistance""?  Obamacare or Trumpcare; what difference does it make? No insurance can possibly ""cover"" what insulin resistance does to the human body. Not one word in any medical insurance coverage addresses the prevention of ""insulin resistance"". And, the treatment of insulin resistance, now, represents 8% of our entire Gross National Product! Gee, if we could understand what ""lifestyle modifications"" meant, what could we do with almost a trillion dollars?  If any disease ""progresses"", that means it getting WORSE. If you're doctor is having to increase the dosage of drugs, prescribed, that means it's getting worse. Of course, it's every patient's ""fault"" their disease is ""worsening"". They're the ones not following ""instructions"". They're the ones, not losing weight! We are know, patients are ""weak"" and without ""discipline""... So, why be vague? If the treatment for insulin resistance is ""Lifestyle Modifications"", why not spell it out like we're 5 year olds? Why must people be ""worried"" about Type 2 Diabetes? Answer: Because. Nobody cares enough (to demand the madness stop). On your next doctor appointment, tell your doctor, ""I don't want to be Type 2 Diabetic, anymore. Tell me what I need to do to ""reverse"" my diabetes."" Just do it!"

The minute I learn he needs to dump his life on me again I start to panic. I have trouble sleeping, my heartbeat elevates and I struggle to breathe at times like I feel suffocated.  I feel bad because I want to help him but at the same time I feel my life and private home has been invaded.  I love living in my home all by myself. I feel like its my sanctuary. I like doing what I want and when I want and I don't want to interact with anyone or feel any pressure . I don't know if its that I feel some sort of responsibility to have to provide for this other person even though its my own son, but I would feel the same way with anyone else whether its someone I know or a stranger. I just don't want anyone living with me in my house. What could possibly be my problem? I feel so strongly about this but yet Its embarrassing and I feel so bad for treating my son like he's a thorn in my side. Could someone help me understand what is going on with me and why I feel this way and what I could do to eliminate this problem. Many thanks. Bess"

If there is something wrong, I have always tried to hide it. So very recently I have become suspicious of myself and looked online for symptoms and tests for depression. All the tests tell me that I am not severe but at a good risk— but I feel that I have a certain type of depression because I do not feel it all of the time. So I'm going to list what I feel and would like if someone knows what it is? I don't feel 'down' all the time. I am usually ok in the morning and middle of day. After the first class at school (orchestra), as I am walking to next class, I get a clench in my throat, the preasure behind my eyes. I feel bad; i can't describe it. I believe this is because i feel so helpless in that class. The music is very difficult and there is so much I have at once to work on. I used to love it, but now, when I know I should practice, I often am too afraid to start because of how overwhelming it is. So at certain times in the day I think of this, my inability to play my instrument like I used to and I feel that grief and guilt.   When I am in public and feel that sadness, I put my shoulders back, hold my head up, and remind myself no one should know my thoughts or see anything wrong. Thats another irrational fear. People knowing my thoughts. This happens one to three times a day during the school hours of a day the evening. Other than that and in between these times, I feel perfectly fine and normal. Maybe once a week I don't have a sad moment at all that day. Thrice to four times a week, the evenings are not good. I never show infront of my family, but sometimes in the shower I cant stand it. I can't describe the feeling— its like sad but more. I silent cry, crouched at the bottem of the shower. Sometimes when it is not shower time, I silently cry in my room. Also, I don't know if this is anything, but my hunger has become irratic. I have never been one to eat at certain times, but recently my hunger has reduced to very little a day. I am only really hungry about once or twice a day. But when I am hungry, I suddenly crave breads, carbs, sweets, fruits, and very little vegetables. And when I am hungry, I eat everything and a lot of foid. I know it is unhealthy and I should eat balanced meals regularly, but oftentimes I can't help it. And on the weekends I stay in bed or ly around mist of the time. Sometimes I think that if I didn't have to go to school, I would never do anything because I often have trouble convincing myself to do something. Another thing is I am constantly being irritated. My mother constantly nagging me; my brother picking at me; having to repeat myself more than twice; the way the people in my family call my name, dragging the syllables out in a whiny voice as if I were a small, stupid child.

I think he fell depressed after his mom died almost 14 years ago. He's basically been drinking by himself in the basement since. Last week he thought the bathtub was his bed, and in a drunken state, fell into it. My mom is currently on vacation until the 27th, so my aunt and uncle kicked down the door to have him hospitalized after they couldn't get a hold of him for ~12 hours. He forced his discharge and went home. No medication was prescribed, just recommendation for multi-vitamins and thiamin. I flew home to take care of him at this point. Since then, he hasn't showered and has had bathroom breaks every 30 minutes, including at night. He doesn't actually pee much every time, but he is unable to sleep due to this urination schedule. He is severely sleep deprived. He has also been constipated although he did poop in his bed one night. He hasn't been drinking any alcohol, barely eats (maybe 1-2 pieces of bread every day) and no water as he doesn't want to pee even more. His mobility is also affected by the bathtub incident; he ""walks"" slower (it's more of a shuffle) and can't get himself out of his reclining chair 80% of the time (he says he hurt his left hip when he fell). He also can't bend over or pull up his pants. He is always wheezing for air as he is overweight and never ever exercises or even walks anywhere!  This morning I asked him how he's doing and he gave me the usual ""just fine."" I asked him if he slept and he said no. I asked him, ""can you please go to see a doctor today?"" He got angry with me and told me to leave if I was going to keep nagging him. I was angry.  Shortly after, he started hallucinating. He said there were two children with big red noses smoking acid type stuff. He also said there is white powder all over the floor and yellow bugs all over it. But in my eyes, none of this is happening. He puts on his shoes and starts to walk out the door in his underwear thinking he's going to find his pants out there. After his intense hallucinations today, I called 911. I stood outside as the police, firemen and paramedics went inside. They later told me that they were in a dilly of a pickle; they asked him a bunch of questions and he was able to answer them correctly and coherently. They checked all his vitals and he seems fine. He wasn't happy with them being there but he cooperated. He denied seeing children smoking in the house, but did point out dead cockroaches on the floor (the cop said they were not actually there.) They said they weren't legally able to take him to the hospital or detain him; he was still able to take care of himself. They confirmed that he hasn't gone to a GP for 5 years and they think he really needs to see a doctor as there is definitely something wrong with him. The problem is, he won't go. He refuses help from anyone. So, until he hurts himself again or finally decides to go to a doctor, I can't do anything for him apparently. However... I am noticing interesting behaviours that make me think something is really going on here and I can't quite give up. He's my dad and I love him.  Scared about how he was going to react after the police/ambulance visit, I walked in to find him sleeping at the kitchen table. He later walked to bed and was in there for maybe 30 minutes, sleeping presumably. After his nap (I've never seen him nap before) he found 2 beers, drank them, and suddenly became a lot more normal. He was joking around and laughing like his old self. He even ate! All night long he didn't even mention the police or paramedics and it makes me wonder if he even remembers or if he can't tell what's real and what isn't anymore. He did have some minor hallucinations again; the boy who was smoking but he didn't spend too much time on it when I told him to ignore the boy. He eventually fell asleep in his chair, mumbling in his sleep as he usual does. Part of me thinks he's a better person when he has a couple beers and maybe when he drinks, it hides his true medical condition. Is there a diagnosis for what is going on? How can I help? My main worry is how my mom is going to work 7 days a week and be his caregiver since he really can't take care of himself anymore, despite what authorities say. He's constantly pant less because he can't put them on, can't do laundry, everything hurts to lift, etc... Ahh... help!! Thank you :) - Karoline"

I am on Lithium which has helped tremendously. My anxiety has been quite bad however as has my depression. I called my dr and she changed one of my meds a bit. My Vistarill was to be taken at night 1 to 2 as needed. She now wants me to take two at night and then one in the morning and in the afternoon. I am frustrated by this because I have to work and I can not do so if I am taking that much Vistarill. I know I need it but I also need my job or I will lose my home. Right now if I don't take the meds I am in constant panic attach mode which isn't good. I was not able to let her know my depression is bad too. I don't want to do anything eat, sleep, or get up for work. I do not want to harm my self or others but the depression is affecting my daily life. I also need individual couseling that my current provider is unable to provide. I had tried one person and she was nice but not what I needed.

I know help is there if I as and it may mean a hospital stay but I am stuborn and I don't want any one to really know how bad I really feel. I have gone from a manic episoned for about two weeks which wasn't the greatest on my pocket to now being depressed and feeling done with all this mess. I don't know what to do or anything right now. Any advice would be helpful."

Then I developed severe sciatic pain from my back to foot. Neurologist ordered an MRI and it showed 2 bulging discs and a herniated disc which is pinching my sciatic nerve. It causes pain from the lower back, hip down to my foot.  When i stand i get pins and needles up from the foot up my leg to my lower back.  My Neurologist would not prescribe me any pain medication. I asked for simple Toridol not Norcos.  He said my psychiatrist would need to prescribe them. They refused. Is there any pain med i can take with Serequil, Effexor, Buspar and Kolonipin?"

Been years since ive been on this post I was off all meds and doing great last ten years. Now 39 and 40 right around corner I blame it on menopause :) .

Then the old panic attacks returned and now at times I feel like I'm one big panic attack all day and night. I have not slept hardly anything for the past week. And my body is so tired but my brain wont let it cause I'm constantly thinking ""please let me get sleep tonight "" does anyone else get like this? Was just put on celexa 10mg three days ago. And Dr switched my Xanax .5 to ativan twice a day. Was diaganoed with ""doesnt like change depression/anxiety. I cant think of the real name Dr said lol. Anyone else have this?"

Diabetes is a disease triggered when blood glucose levels rise above normal limits and its implications and complications are severe and need to be taken seriously.  These complications occur faster and more often in those who neglect their illness and which have long episodes of hyperglycemia in their disease. It is well to remember that glucose is not causing organ damage but the products of abnormal processes in which the glucose enters – processes which grow proportional to the level of blood sugar.  The severe complications of diabetes are:  1. Cardiovascular diseases – people with diabetes have a double risk of developing atherosclerosis, expressed by major cardiovascular events: myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death.  Diabetes accelerates the deposition of fats in large vessels and especially in the small ones, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The diabetic patient must regularly check his blood pressure, which must be maintained below 130/80 mmHg. Diabetes frequently registers blood fat abnormalities (dyslipidemia). These defects grow still further the risk of cardiovascular disease.  2. Eye disease – diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes in which consists in the illness of small vessels in the retina, the lining of the eye responsible for sight.  The appearance of retinopathy is signaled by a decrease in vision. This can go up to a total loss of vision – blindness. Therefore, in an annual eye exam, it is required.  3. Renal diseases  Diabetic Nephropathy means kidney failure due to diabetes. If it remains untreated in time, it leads to kidney failure when a significant portion of the kidney is destroyed. The final stage of the renal failure is uremia, in which the patient must do dialysis or kidney transplantation to survive.  Diabetic nephropathy has no symptoms, so it is necessary to detect it early with the help of annual albuminuria determination. The prevention of rapid progression of nephropathy requires a very good glycemic control.  4. The diabetic foot – it refers to all modifications due to diabetes at the feet levels. In advanced stages of diabetes, the gangrene is reached, and it is most often located in one or more fingers, but it can extend to the entire foot.  Diabetic arterial disease manifest itself at first by a sensation of cold feet, then as a feeling of “bite” at the pulp level which appears when moving and which it ceases at rest. Pain will occur more and more often and eventually even when resting.  When the blood vessels are clogged, some areas of the foot die and gangrene occurs. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy manifests through pain in the legs (more intense at night), numbness and tingling legs, feeling “restless legs”. The diabetic foot patient has to take care of this problem and to respect some rules: o	Washing the feet daily with soap and warm water; the dry needs to be made by dabbing, especially the area between the toes with a clean towel;  o	Nails will be cut straight, no corners;  o	The socks need to be changed daily – use cotton stockings in the summer over which wool socks can be put in winter;  o	Must wear comfortable shoes;  o	Any injury to the leg must be treated immediately and if necessary resort to a surgeon;  o	Extreme temperatures (heat-cold) must be avoided;  o	Heating pads are not to be used by people with diabetes;  o	Hot water bottles or ice packs at the level of the foot need to be avoided; o	Diabetic patients must not smoke because smoking decreases the blood flow in the legs;  o	The feet need to be examined daily using a mirror;  o	Tight socks must not be worn.  Emergencies in diabetes  	 1. Ketoacidosis occurs when there is not enough insulin in the blood, and the body begins to use fat instead of carbohydrates (sugar) for energy. The symptoms of ketoacidosis are nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, breath with the smell of acetone or “rotten apples”.  2. Hypoglycemia – marked by the decrease in blood glucose.   The symptoms of hypoglycemia are: sweating, tremors, fatigue, feeling cold, irritability, hunger, headache, visual disturbances.  These symptoms usually appear before meals or after a strenuous exercise. 	 Some complications can be kept under control and there are some things that can be done in order to decrease their complications but there are some cases – the emergencies – when the patient must see a doctor immediately.

Diabetes is a disease triggered when blood glucose levels rise above normal limits and its implications and complications are severe and need to be taken seriously.  These complications occur faster and more often in those who neglect their illness and which have long episodes of hyperglycemia in their disease. It is well to remember that glucose is not causing organ damage but the products of abnormal processes in which the glucose enters – processes which grow proportional to the level of blood sugar.  The severe complications of diabetes are:  1. Cardiovascular diseases – people with diabetes have a double risk of developing atherosclerosis, expressed by major cardiovascular events: myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death.  Diabetes accelerates the deposition of fats in large vessels and especially in the small ones, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The diabetic patient must regularly check his blood pressure, which must be maintained below 130/80 mmHg. Diabetes frequently registers blood fat abnormalities (dyslipidemia). These defects grow still further the risk of cardiovascular disease.  2. Eye disease – diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes in which consists in the illness of small vessels in the retina, the lining of the eye responsible for sight.  The appearance of retinopathy is signaled by a decrease in vision. This can go up to a total loss of vision – blindness. Therefore, in an annual eye exam, it is required.  3. Renal diseases  Diabetic Nephropathy means kidney failure due to diabetes. If it remains untreated in time, it leads to kidney failure when a significant portion of the kidney is destroyed. The final stage of the renal failure is uremia, in which the patient must do dialysis or kidney transplantation to survive.  Diabetic nephropathy has no symptoms, so it is necessary to detect it early with the help of annual albuminuria determination. The prevention of rapid progression of nephropathy requires a very good glycemic control.  4. The diabetic foot – it refers to all modifications due to diabetes at the feet levels. In advanced stages of diabetes, the gangrene is reached, and it is most often located in one or more fingers, but it can extend to the entire foot.  Diabetic arterial disease manifest itself at first by a sensation of cold feet, then as a feeling of “bite” at the pulp level which appears when moving and which it ceases at rest. Pain will occur more and more often and eventually even when resting.  When the blood vessels are clogged, some areas of the foot die and gangrene occurs. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy manifests through pain in the legs (more intense at night), numbness and tingling legs, feeling “restless legs”. The diabetic foot patient has to take care of this problem and to respect some rules: o	Washing the feet daily with soap and warm water; the dry needs to be made by dabbing, especially the area between the toes with a clean towel;  o	Nails will be cut straight, no corners;  o	The socks need to be changed daily – use cotton stockings in the summer over which wool socks can be put in winter;  o	Must wear comfortable shoes;  o	Any injury to the leg must be treated immediately and if necessary resort to a surgeon;  o	Extreme temperatures (heat-cold) must be avoided;  o	Heating pads are not to be used by people with diabetes;  o	Hot water bottles or ice packs at the level of the foot need to be avoided; o	Diabetic patients must not smoke because smoking decreases the blood flow in the legs;  o	The feet need to be examined daily using a mirror;  o	Tight socks must not be worn.  Emergencies in diabetes  	 1. Ketoacidosis occurs when there is not enough insulin in the blood, and the body begins to use fat instead of carbohydrates (sugar) for energy. The symptoms of ketoacidosis are nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, breath with the smell of acetone or “rotten apples”.  2. Hypoglycemia – marked by the decrease in blood glucose.   The symptoms of hypoglycemia are: sweating, tremors, fatigue, feeling cold, irritability, hunger, headache, visual disturbances.  These symptoms usually appear before meals or after a strenuous exercise. 	 Some complications can be kept under control and there are some things that can be done in order to decrease their complications but there are some cases – the emergencies – when the patient must see a doctor immediately.

The diabetic foot patient has to take care of this problem and to respect some rules: o	Washing the feet daily with soap and warm water; the dry needs to be made by dabbing, especially the area between the toes with a clean towel;  o	Nails will be cut straight, no corners;  o	The socks need to be changed daily – use cotton stockings in the summer over which wool socks can be put in winter;  o	Must wear comfortable shoes;  o	Any injury to the leg must be treated immediately and if necessary resort to a surgeon;  o	Extreme temperatures (heat-cold) must be avoided;  o	Heating pads are not to be used by people with diabetes;  o	Hot water bottles or ice packs at the level of the foot need to be avoided; o	Diabetic patients must not smoke because smoking decreases the blood flow in the legs;  o	The feet need to be examined daily using a mirror;  o	Tight socks must not be worn.  Emergencies in diabetes  	 1. Ketoacidosis occurs when there is not enough insulin in the blood, and the body begins to use fat instead of carbohydrates (sugar) for energy. The symptoms of ketoacidosis are nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, breath with the smell of acetone or “rotten apples”.  2. Hypoglycemia – marked by the decrease in blood glucose.   The symptoms of hypoglycemia are: sweating, tremors, fatigue, feeling cold, irritability, hunger, headache, visual disturbances.  These symptoms usually appear before meals or after a strenuous exercise. 	 Some complications can be kept under control and there are some things that can be done in order to decrease their complications but there are some cases – the emergencies – when the patient must see a doctor immediately.

Diabetes is a disease triggered when blood glucose levels rise above normal limits and its implications and complications are severe and need to be taken seriously.  These complications occur faster and more often in those who neglect their illness and which have long episodes of hyperglycemia in their disease. It is well to remember that glucose is not causing organ damage but the products of abnormal processes in which the glucose enters – processes which grow proportional to the level of blood sugar.  The severe complications of diabetes are:  1. Cardiovascular diseases – people with diabetes have a double risk of developing atherosclerosis, expressed by major cardiovascular events: myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death.  Diabetes accelerates the deposition of fats in large vessels and especially in the small ones, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The diabetic patient must regularly check his blood pressure, which must be maintained below 130/80 mmHg. Diabetes frequently registers blood fat abnormalities (dyslipidemia). These defects grow still further the risk of cardiovascular disease.  2. Eye disease – diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes in which consists in the illness of small vessels in the retina, the lining of the eye responsible for sight.  The appearance of retinopathy is signaled by a decrease in vision. This can go up to a total loss of vision – blindness. Therefore, in an annual eye exam, it is required.  3. Renal diseases  Diabetic Nephropathy means kidney failure due to diabetes. If it remains untreated in time, it leads to kidney failure when a significant portion of the kidney is destroyed. The final stage of the renal failure is uremia, in which the patient must do dialysis or kidney transplantation to survive.  Diabetic nephropathy has no symptoms, so it is necessary to detect it early with the help of annual albuminuria determination. The prevention of rapid progression of nephropathy requires a very good glycemic control.  4. The diabetic foot – it refers to all modifications due to diabetes at the feet levels. In advanced stages of diabetes, the gangrene is reached, and it is most often located in one or more fingers, but it can extend to the entire foot.  Diabetic arterial disease manifest itself at first by a sensation of cold feet, then as a feeling of “bite” at the pulp level which appears when moving and which it ceases at rest. Pain will occur more and more often and eventually even when resting.  When the blood vessels are clogged, some areas of the foot die and gangrene occurs.

Diabetic nephropathy has no symptoms, so it is necessary to detect it early with the help of annual albuminuria determination. The prevention of rapid progression of nephropathy requires a very good glycemic control.  4. The diabetic foot – it refers to all modifications due to diabetes at the feet levels. In advanced stages of diabetes, the gangrene is reached, and it is most often located in one or more fingers, but it can extend to the entire foot.  Diabetic arterial disease manifest itself at first by a sensation of cold feet, then as a feeling of “bite” at the pulp level which appears when moving and which it ceases at rest. Pain will occur more and more often and eventually even when resting.  When the blood vessels are clogged, some areas of the foot die and gangrene occurs. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy manifests through pain in the legs (more intense at night), numbness and tingling legs, feeling “restless legs”. The diabetic foot patient has to take care of this problem and to respect some rules: o	Washing the feet daily with soap and warm water; the dry needs to be made by dabbing, especially the area between the toes with a clean towel;  o	Nails will be cut straight, no corners;  o	The socks need to be changed daily – use cotton stockings in the summer over which wool socks can be put in winter;  o	Must wear comfortable shoes;  o	Any injury to the leg must be treated immediately and if necessary resort to a surgeon;  o	Extreme temperatures (heat-cold) must be avoided;  o	Heating pads are not to be used by people with diabetes;  o	Hot water bottles or ice packs at the level of the foot need to be avoided; o	Diabetic patients must not smoke because smoking decreases the blood flow in the legs;  o	The feet need to be examined daily using a mirror;  o	Tight socks must not be worn.  Emergencies in diabetes  	 1. Ketoacidosis occurs when there is not enough insulin in the blood, and the body begins to use fat instead of carbohydrates (sugar) for energy. The symptoms of ketoacidosis are nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, breath with the smell of acetone or “rotten apples”.  2. Hypoglycemia – marked by the decrease in blood glucose.   The symptoms of hypoglycemia are: sweating, tremors, fatigue, feeling cold, irritability, hunger, headache, visual disturbances.  These symptoms usually appear before meals or after a strenuous exercise. 	 Some complications can be kept under control and there are some things that can be done in order to decrease their complications but there are some cases – the emergencies – when the patient must see a doctor immediately.

Diabetes is a disease triggered when blood glucose levels rise above normal limits and its implications and complications are severe and need to be taken seriously.  These complications occur faster and more often in those who neglect their illness and which have long episodes of hyperglycemia in their disease. It is well to remember that glucose is not causing organ damage but the products of abnormal processes in which the glucose enters – processes which grow proportional to the level of blood sugar.  The severe complications of diabetes are:  1. Cardiovascular diseases – people with diabetes have a double risk of developing atherosclerosis, expressed by major cardiovascular events: myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death.  Diabetes accelerates the deposition of fats in large vessels and especially in the small ones, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The diabetic patient must regularly check his blood pressure, which must be maintained below 130/80 mmHg. Diabetes frequently registers blood fat abnormalities (dyslipidemia). These defects grow still further the risk of cardiovascular disease.  2. Eye disease – diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes in which consists in the illness of small vessels in the retina, the lining of the eye responsible for sight.  The appearance of retinopathy is signaled by a decrease in vision. This can go up to a total loss of vision – blindness. Therefore, in an annual eye exam, it is required.  3.

Diabetes accelerates the deposition of fats in large vessels and especially in the small ones, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The diabetic patient must regularly check his blood pressure, which must be maintained below 130/80 mmHg. Diabetes frequently registers blood fat abnormalities (dyslipidemia). These defects grow still further the risk of cardiovascular disease.  2. Eye disease – diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes in which consists in the illness of small vessels in the retina, the lining of the eye responsible for sight.  The appearance of retinopathy is signaled by a decrease in vision. This can go up to a total loss of vision – blindness. Therefore, in an annual eye exam, it is required.  3. Renal diseases  Diabetic Nephropathy means kidney failure due to diabetes. If it remains untreated in time, it leads to kidney failure when a significant portion of the kidney is destroyed. The final stage of the renal failure is uremia, in which the patient must do dialysis or kidney transplantation to survive.  Diabetic nephropathy has no symptoms, so it is necessary to detect it early with the help of annual albuminuria determination. The prevention of rapid progression of nephropathy requires a very good glycemic control.  4. The diabetic foot – it refers to all modifications due to diabetes at the feet levels. In advanced stages of diabetes, the gangrene is reached, and it is most often located in one or more fingers, but it can extend to the entire foot.  Diabetic arterial disease manifest itself at first by a sensation of cold feet, then as a feeling of “bite” at the pulp level which appears when moving and which it ceases at rest. Pain will occur more and more often and eventually even when resting.  When the blood vessels are clogged, some areas of the foot die and gangrene occurs. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy manifests through pain in the legs (more intense at night), numbness and tingling legs, feeling “restless legs”. The diabetic foot patient has to take care of this problem and to respect some rules: o	Washing the feet daily with soap and warm water; the dry needs to be made by dabbing, especially the area between the toes with a clean towel;  o	Nails will be cut straight, no corners;  o	The socks need to be changed daily – use cotton stockings in the summer over which wool socks can be put in winter;  o	Must wear comfortable shoes;  o	Any injury to the leg must be treated immediately and if necessary resort to a surgeon;  o	Extreme temperatures (heat-cold) must be avoided;  o	Heating pads are not to be used by people with diabetes;  o	Hot water bottles or ice packs at the level of the foot need to be avoided; o	Diabetic patients must not smoke because smoking decreases the blood flow in the legs;  o	The feet need to be examined daily using a mirror;  o	Tight socks must not be worn.  Emergencies in diabetes  	 1. Ketoacidosis occurs when there is not enough insulin in the blood, and the body begins to use fat instead of carbohydrates (sugar) for energy. The symptoms of ketoacidosis are nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, breath with the smell of acetone or “rotten apples”.  2. Hypoglycemia – marked by the decrease in blood glucose.   The symptoms of hypoglycemia are: sweating, tremors, fatigue, feeling cold, irritability, hunger, headache, visual disturbances.  These symptoms usually appear before meals or after a strenuous exercise. 	 Some complications can be kept under control and there are some things that can be done in order to decrease their complications but there are some cases – the emergencies – when the patient must see a doctor immediately.

She pulled up a gardening blog that was talking about potting soil. She thought me and her were going to get arrested or killed if we went outside, that there were people looking for us. She did not sleep for 3 nights in a row, had poverty of speech and a thousand yard stare at some points in time.

My daughter has shown glimpses of depression for many years, but has always done well in school. She has had a slightly challenging social time, but has managed ok. She's now a sophomore in HS. A few weeks ago, she told us of her suicidal plan (after taking her to see a pyschiatrist and psychologist)...she was depressed. We took her to the hospital which led to the ten day stay at the psych ward 45 mins from home. She was so happy to be released (although when we were being released, a boy from her ""friend group"" tried to escape, that was disturbing). She was grateful for freedom and to get back to life. Here we are, only 11 days later and her voices are back and she is feeling unsafe. My husband is in her room again on an air mattress sleeping. We have an appt with her psychiatrist (not from the hospital but from before the hospital).  I am looking for some support, where can parents go for support? I want her to get better...I thought she was doing well...then this happened this am...she talks of going to the garage with the car and turning it on to do it so I have hidden all keys...sigh. I love my girl and want her to be happy...or content...just calm...and peaceful."

Most diabetics first response is, ""What does this have to do with me?"" Everything!  The key thing that I learned a long time ago: Diet Matters The key thing that I want to convey to every visitor of this board: Your blood pressure, your triglycerides, your blood sugar and your waistline are ""measuring sticks"". If they remain high (&, if your T2 Diabetes is worsening) then you can be sure of one thing. Despite all the advise, despite all the drugs, despite all the exercise, despite all the frustration and worry, one thing is clear. You still believe, ""Diet does not matter"".  Here's an excerpt that is the most revealing ""take-away"" from this article:  ""...But how did we eat before then? Actually 'not that poorly'. At least not if you consider what we thought was healthy... ...So we had a pretty 'normal' diet, and I think, better than most people..."" I believe this is how most Type 2 Diabetics think...that they eat ""pretty healthy"". When you think about it, what mother would attest, otherwise??? What mother would subject all 5 of her kids to such unspeakable pain and suffering? Clearly, this woman is well educated and loves all her children dearly. So, why doesn't her story reconcile? How could every one of her kids suffer suicidal mental health issues yet still be a ""good"" mother? She IS a GOOD mother! &, her mother was a GOOD mother, too! Their only ""mistake"" was simple. What they believed was ""healthy"" and ""nutritious"" was not!!! That, diet did not matter."

I've seeked counselling but in my area there aren't many therapists that I'm comfortable talking with.  My immediate problem is my depression. I've entered a slump and can't seem to shake it. As I am getting older I'm feeling a lot of pressure to start my life, so I can be independent. But with my symptoms and my depression I'm finding it extremely difficult to begin. I need a job, I need to go to school and I don't even know where to begin in all honesty.  I am afraid of failure, I am afraid of being vulnerable, I am afraid of dying, and I am afraid it will all be wasted on me.  I don't know what to do anymore. Traditional counselling isn't working and I don't have a support system. To be honest, I don't even know how to ask for help. But on here I have anonymity, so I feel somewhat comfortable."

Well my anxiety and depression have been crushing since I started school. I cut, I'm having panic attacks, thoughts of suicide, and cry at the drop of a hat. My therapist decided that I need to cut back my hours at work to 36 hours (I have been working 52 hours or more a week.) Ever since that my best friend has been nasty. She called me a brat and spoiled. She says she feels sad too but she toughs it out. She makes rude remarks and just nit picks at me. She says I've always had this so she thinks I'm just using my illness to get out of work. I already feel bad enough, but she makes me feel worse. I am used to people telling me this usual stuff, I've heard it for years. But hearing these things from your best friend just feels different.

Before I was diagnosed it'd be almost every single hour. When I first went to the hospital after being in keto(sp?)acidosis I would wake up maybe 1 time overnight...then over time the number kept rising and rising...this is odd to me as my sugar is pretty good now (relatively speaking). I'm not drinking crazy amounts of liquids before bed, I'm eating ~95% diabetic healthy things...why am I still peeing so much? Long story short...why am I peeing this much? and what can I do about it? Medication? OTC? Prescription? Please, anything would help...I'm perpetually grumpy and it's ruining my life!"

I am and always have been a very anxious and nervous person so that part made sense to me. However in the past I've tried a large variety of different medications and therapy techniques to help alleviate the anxiety but nothing has really worked. I felt for me it was best to handle it on my own with quite a bit of introspective thought.

Small tics when young, now more frequent and pronounced facial twitches, to the point where it is affecting marriage. Tend to disappear when concentrating but get stronger before and after social situations. ------------------- I'm a 34 year old male, have a history of social anxiety and depression for which I have been medicated at various times. I don't get a lot of exercise but my diet is reasonable, I have one caffeinated drink a day on average, and have never smoked or done drugs. Now that I think back to my childhoood I realise I have always had tics of some sort, for want of a better word. When I was much younger I would make tiny grunting noises (not audible to those around me) and when I was older I developed a habit of clearing my throat, again very quietly so no one would notice. It never occurred to me to do anything about them as they didn't bother me or anyone else. A few years ago I noticed (as did a work colleague) that I had started squinting a lot. This disappeared after about a week, and resurfaced from time to time.  But it has started coming back more regularly and the squint has become a contortion of the entire right side of my face. It's extremely difficult to stop these rapid-fire twitches once they get going, but sometimes I can slow them down by taking deep breaths. It has reached the point where my wife is understandably embarrassed to be seen with me, so our marriage feels very shaky at the minute. Observations: * It tends to disappear when I'm concentrating on something, like drawing or trying to solve a problem at work.  * I can mostly keep it under control in social situations but will twitch like crazy before or after * I tend to always have some kind of tic, somewhere.

Small tics when young, now more frequent and pronounced facial twitches, to the point where it is affecting marriage. Tend to disappear when concentrating but get stronger before and after social situations. ------------------- I'm a 34 year old male, have a history of social anxiety and depression for which I have been medicated at various times. I don't get a lot of exercise but my diet is reasonable, I have one caffeinated drink a day on average, and have never smoked or done drugs. Now that I think back to my childhoood I realise I have always had tics of some sort, for want of a better word. When I was much younger I would make tiny grunting noises (not audible to those around me) and when I was older I developed a habit of clearing my throat, again very quietly so no one would notice. It never occurred to me to do anything about them as they didn't bother me or anyone else. A few years ago I noticed (as did a work colleague) that I had started squinting a lot. This disappeared after about a week, and resurfaced from time to time.  But it has started coming back more regularly and the squint has become a contortion of the entire right side of my face. It's extremely difficult to stop these rapid-fire twitches once they get going, but sometimes I can slow them down by taking deep breaths. It has reached the point where my wife is understandably embarrassed to be seen with me, so our marriage feels very shaky at the minute. Observations: * It tends to disappear when I'm concentrating on something, like drawing or trying to solve a problem at work.  * I can mostly keep it under control in social situations but will twitch like crazy before or after * I tend to always have some kind of tic, somewhere. When the twitching disappears it is normally replaced by some other compulsion, usually a slight throat-clearing, which has its own problems but I won't go into that here. * I tend to do it more at home than anywhere else * It tends to be worse in the afternoon and evening My doctor has put me on Nortriptyline 10mg, and I'm supposed to report back after a couple of weeks.

( it had cause some very serious side effects in my high school years) I've been on it Now in my 30's for about just over a month. My depression has lessoned to some degree but, I still feel agitated and, still have severe waves of anxiety... anyway. I wondered if tiny little blisters on my hands , fingers and other joints might possibly be a side effect as this is adding to my anxiety. There are no bites from spiders or bugs nor a site on my skin where it seems to originate from in general and I have never before had symptoms like this until recently starting this Drug again. I would be grateful to get some assistance,or confirmation that this IS a side effect and that maybe there is an antihistamine or something that can get rid of this? I have sent a message to my primary NP but it's good to have a little extra advice.  Note: attached are the most visible photos, they itch there is no puss or redness (despite what the photo may look like) just little watery blisters! It's the most irritating on my hands but it shows up around my clavicle, elbows, knees, and wrists."

My mother decided to have knee replacement surgery later this year (I've been after her for 2 years to get this done), and I think I'm becoming menopausal. While I have been rolling with the punches, I feel depressed. I find myself using all of my coping techniques more and more. Things I should be able to shake off and I can't.

It became another kind of challenge after she was diagnosed with dementia -- before that she knew what was and wasn't good for her to eat when, how it may affect her, and the correct portion sizes. After, we had to closely monitor everything that she ate, and we basically had to start from scratch.

Two years ago, I started having panic attacks. I started therapy to help manage them, but also recognized I needed to address the big issue in my life, that I'm unhappy in my marriage. I have been for a while (for different reasons), but was always too afraid to say anything and hurt my husband. But, two years ago, I told him I want a divorce, but haven't left (we've done counseling twice). Each time I try, he tells me how selfish and evil I am, I'm a bad mother, I never loved him, he accuses my friends of influencing me (even though they have no idea what's going on). Lots of emotional blackmail that paralyzes me with guilt. Increasingly, I feel trapped. I avoid social activities, I don't engage as much with my kids to not be around him, I've become less caring towards him, which makes me feel worse. I'm always on edge. But, I push myself to do everything that needs to get done at work and home, with a painted on smile and an ""I'm fine"" attitude. The more I learn about high-functioning depression, the more I see myself. And, it's scary, because I feel myself sinking more, and I don't know how to shake it. I feel like, yes, if I found the courage to move forward with my divorce, I'd have the emotional strength for everything else. But, as long as I care more about his feelings than mine, I'll be stuck here. So, how so I shake the growing depression?"

Long story short, I have gotten myself into a huge problem: After moving out of my parent's house at 18, which was emotionally traumatizing, I was really depressed. I would feel okay some days, but would get depressed easily and would be irritable too. It was an emotional roller coaster, so as a young and naive 18 yr old, I started seeking answers of what could be wrong, disregarding the fact that it was a normal response to the circumstances I was experiencing.  But in this search I came across bipolar disorder, and being someone who had no idea the severity of what ""mania"" and ""hypomania"" were, it made sense and seemed to explain what I was feeling. So at 19, a little over a year after moving out of my parents house, I moved to a different state for college and I began seeing a psychiatrist for my possible problem that I pretty much originally self-diagnosed. I told her my concerns and she went with it, diagnosing me within five minutes. At the time it made so much sense and it gave me an explanation for what I was feeling and what had happened to me. Now fast forward to today, I am over 20 yrs old and know that I do NOT have bipolar disorder. I was 18, hurt, and confused. I wanted answers and tried to answer them in a very damaging way. The predicament I am in now is I have absolutely no idea how to fix this. I am no longer seeing the original psychiatrist because of insurance issues, my second psychiatrist moved practice, and I have yet to see the third. I also have a year of mental health issues on my records which DRASTICALLY impedes the job I want. I also am terrified of what will happen because of my records and the only medical issues I know are 100% accurate is ADD and poor diet/exercise. I don't know how to approach someone to fix this without appearing like I just want off my meds/manic and have something bad added to my ""psychotherapy notes."" The most important thing is I just want to be able to move forward with my life. Please, if anyone has advice I would really appreciate it. I do have access to lawyers if necessary. Please do not berate me, I understand that I really messed up, but I was put into a very horrible predicament for an 18 yr old."

I associate the sicknessim feeling from lack of food with being sick from the small amount of food that I do eat. I'm worried that I'm going to cause myself to obtain an eating disorder especially because as the summer progresses I have been eating less and less, sometimes only cereal. I know that i don't want to lose weight and my eating less has nothing to do with an unhealthy diet plan, but my family simply does not understand that I'm scared of getting sick when i eat, especially because I was fine during the school year. I wasn't too worried when this first started happening but now that i've lost 10lbs (which fluctuates dramatically almost daily) I'm worried that this is going to really hurt my body. I think whats worrying me the most is that i know my eating habits are unhealthy but i still don't do anything to help it."

Each year, more than 41 million Americans experience some form of mental illness according to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SHRM, 2018). Negative attitudes, unfair treatment, and stereotypes are placed on those who suffer from such a horrible disease. Because of not knowing the how’s and why’s of mental illness, it can often cause society to misinterpret mental behavior for menace to society behavior. In 2016, an Albuquerque Police Department became the first law enforcement agency in the nation to train its officers through videoconferencing with psychiatrists to get a better understanding of mental health issues and how to differentiate jail behavior and psychiatric behavior. Crisis Intervention Training Albuquerque Police Department decided to train its officers through videoconferencing in what was called Project Echo. Project Echo allowed the officers to refer more people who displayed mental instability for mental evaluations rather than taking them to jail and not receiving the care that they so needed. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, people are more likely to encounter police officers than to get medical help and because of that, over two million people with mental disorders are booked into a jail each year (2018).  Project Echo was also an aide for the police department in that it was a reliable resource to teach the officers the signs and symptoms of many other disorders such as bipolar disorder, autism, substance abuse, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Because of the crisis intervention training with board certified psychiatrist, the police officers would be more apt to know how to handle such disorders if they were encountered on a patrol call. . Crisis Intervention Beneficial to the Workplace Crisis Intervention with the Albuquerque Police Department can open doors for other workplace establishments to be more sympathetic, patient, and understanding to the mental illness disorders that many of its employees face daily.

The Project Echo of Crisis Intervention by a police department who truly wanted to make a difference in the lives of those who fight with themselves on a constant basis should stand as a platform for other agencies to do the same.

My father molested his older brother about 23 years ago about one or two times. Our older son told us what happened a few years afterwards, and we did what was needed legally and that son received counseling and we had family counseling for several years. The younger son was about 2 years old at the time. I had cut all contacts with my father after that. In 2011 I got a call from his sister-in-law that lived close that he had fallen, was in the hospital and diagnosed with a concussion and dementia. I had to unfortunately reconnect with my father (I am his only child and my mother passed away in 2000) and get him into an assisted living facility and ultimately a VA nursing home where he died in December 2014. We as a family would occasionally visit him and take him on outings until the dementia became worse. This renewed contact with my father brought up repressed memories in our younger son that he was forced to watch what my father did to our older son, hit the younger son with a belt and told him he was ugly. Our younger son has since been hospitalized for suicidal depression and severe anxiety 3 times, is on multiple medications and is getting therapy. About once per week he will have nightmares and flashbacks that are really bad. He has not been able to work for the past 2 years, has no money, (applied for SSD in 2015 through an attorney but was denied and waiting for a hearing) so begs us to buy him 4 Lokos, which is a drink with 14% alcohol. He says that is the only way he gets through the after affects of these episodes as the medications (Xanax, clonodine, prozak and hydroxezine) do not help. We have all his medications in a locked safe and he does not know the combination. We put out the proper doses of his meds at the proper times. When he has the alcohol, he does not get and knows he should not have the xanax. I am sorry for the long dramatic post, but need to ask a question. Are we helping him through this difficult period in his life and these serious flashbacks and nightmares by buying him the alcohol? We have been afraid to tell his psychiatrist for fear no more controlled substances will be prescribed. His current medications seem to be helping most of the time, except when he has these flashback and nightmares. His psychiatrist has increased doses several times but they continue. He has started a new therapy called EMDR with his counselor and we are praying that will help. After the flashbacks and nightmares he is obviously very upset - shaking, sweating, depressed, etc. He claims the coping skills he has been taught do not help at these times. I am just looking for some support and opinions on members who may have experienced similar experiences. Thank you very much."

I had to unfortunately reconnect with my father (I am his only child and my mother passed away in 2000) and get him into an assisted living facility and ultimately a VA nursing home where he died in December 2014. We as a family would occasionally visit him and take him on outings until the dementia became worse. This renewed contact with my father brought up repressed memories in our younger son that he was forced to watch what my father did to our older son, hit the younger son with a belt and told him he was ugly. Our younger son has since been hospitalized for suicidal depression and severe anxiety 3 times, is on multiple medications and is getting therapy. About once per week he will have nightmares and flashbacks that are really bad. He has not been able to work for the past 2 years, has no money, (applied for SSD in 2015 through an attorney but was denied and waiting for a hearing) so begs us to buy him 4 Lokos, which is a drink with 14% alcohol. He says that is the only way he gets through the after affects of these episodes as the medications (Xanax, clonodine, prozak and hydroxezine) do not help. We have all his medications in a locked safe and he does not know the combination. We put out the proper doses of his meds at the proper times. When he has the alcohol, he does not get and knows he should not have the xanax. I am sorry for the long dramatic post, but need to ask a question. Are we helping him through this difficult period in his life and these serious flashbacks and nightmares by buying him the alcohol? We have been afraid to tell his psychiatrist for fear no more controlled substances will be prescribed. His current medications seem to be helping most of the time, except when he has these flashback and nightmares. His psychiatrist has increased doses several times but they continue. He has started a new therapy called EMDR with his counselor and we are praying that will help. After the flashbacks and nightmares he is obviously very upset - shaking, sweating, depressed, etc. He claims the coping skills he has been taught do not help at these times. I am just looking for some support and opinions on members who may have experienced similar experiences. Thank you very much."

Have you experienced this side effect? Will this side effect eventually go away if I keep taking it? If so, how long will it take to wear off? I've been on Luvox (50 mg) for 3 weeks. I take it with my Abilify (2 mg), which I've been on for 3 years. At first, I took half a dosage in the morning and the other half at night. There's only one side effect I'm experiencing, and it's drowsiness. I had to leave work two days in a row because I couldn't stay awake.  After reporting to my doctor, she told me to only take half a pill at night. It worked at first, but I'm still feeling drowsy. It's not as bad, but I fall asleep at red lights. I NEVER feel sleepy while driving. I thought it was because I take it super late. I work two jobs every day of the week. I like going out to party til 1 or 2 AM, so I changed my bedtime to midnight. I was still sleepy. Last night I took it at 10 PM, and my eyes were heavy on the way to work this morning. I never get this tired, even when I'm out all night. My energy drink (Spark) doesn't even work anymore, and it always works. Will I eventually get used to Luvox? Has it worked for you?"

I'm not worried about my anxiety but it's the panic attacks I get MORE THAN 10 times A DAY without Klonopin. So, that's obviously a reason why I'm taking it daily to function or I'll end up in the hospital, not being able to go ANYWHERE, not being able to leave the house, etc etc etc. Anyways, I've always been on 1MG. (Supposed to take it twice a day but I only take it once a day because I feel my body need that exact amount. If I'm having a super bad day then I'll take it twice a day which is SUPER RARE!!!) so, I've been taking it for about 4 years.. I know Klonopin is no way in heck good for your body for a long term use but that's THE ONLY medicine that works and let's me function right. (Trust me I've tried a lot of different kinds before being put on Klonopin) my doctor also recommended Ativan 0.5 for emergencies panic attack that gets out of the control but I trusted myself and told her no thank you, I don't want to ""drug"" myself too much. Now lately, I'm feeling guilty a lot because I really need it to actually function. Am I wrong for feeling guilty? I even tried counseling, challenge my panic attacks, breathe, cope skills, ground techniques, etc and nothing works... someone please tell me in this KIND OF situation, I shouldn't feel bad about myself taking it. :(  Anyways! Lately, I've been having lightheaded. Nothing like ""dizzy"" or anything serious. I'm wondering if it's because my body feel like it's used to the same MG for so long and it's going through ""withdrawals,"" or whatever? I refuse to increase my MG though. I cannot let myself get in deep trouble with Klonopin because if I ever get cut off from it or if I decide I no longer want them, I know how dangerous the withdrawal is.. 1MG is enough for daily in my opinion.."

I cannot stop thinking and when I go to school I cannot concentrate no matter how hard I try because there is a loud voice in my head (My own voice, not a strange or unknown voice) just thinking and thinking all day long. I have actually failed two quizzes now because it is so hard for me to listen in the classroom...I woke up one morning and asked myself a simple question, and I came up with two possible answers and from those two answers I came up with more questions, and more possible answers and it just continues throughout the day until I go to sleep. Then I wake up the next day and remind myself where I left off in my thought process, and I continue my train of thought. It is starting to scare me because it distracts me from school and a few of my grades have dropped because I cannot stop thinking about these crazy topics. I am an 18 year old high school student and I suffer from anxiety. I tried researching what this could be and I found a lot of anxiety related answers, but those answers described overthinking things and worrying about things, but my thinking processes are not worrisome. My boyfriend asked to see what one of my thought processes was like, so here is an example of a message that I sent him, which is what I was thinking at that moment he asked me: ""You know how we are a physical embodiment of our souls? And people usually consider their physical appearances a big part of their personality? Like the things we wear, piercings, tattoos, and what we do with our hair. That's only a small aspect of our personality, so who are we with out our physical appearances? What does our inner being consist of? Do my opinions make me who I am? In the controversy of abortion, I am pro choice. So is being pro choice a part of who I am? I don't think so because that is an opinion that I have about something in the physical world. If that controversy never existed, who would I be then? Do my values make me who I am? I value my friends and my well being. Does that make me who I am? I don't think so because those are basic human values. I think our inner being consists of something that makes us unique from every other inner human being. If we eliminate all physical properties and all that is left is our souls, then who is my soul and how is it different from everyone else's soul? What if I have it all wrong? What if all of our souls are exactly the same and it is up to the individual to create his/her own unique being? If this was true, then should we be okay with the bad people in this world? For example murderers, they want to be murderers so why would we stop someone from being who they want to be? (I know this sounds horrible, but complete open mindedness is necessary for this topic. I do not agree with murder, this is just for the sake of this example.) But murderers are a product of our society. People are oppressed, abused, or traumatized and become murderers. So in this government, we create murderers and then throw them in jail as punishment for doing something that they found pleasure in. People think that there is only one criminal and one victim, but actually, the murderer is also a victim. A victim of this government. This government is the real criminal (for turning its own citizens to into horrible people), and the prisoners are the victims (because they are bad due to a crappy government) Many prisoners are actually very smart people, and sometimes that is why they are in prison! They are a threat to the government so they find a stupid reason to put the smart people in jail. Smart people end up dying in cells every day. Smart people actually live miserable lives because they know too much about the real world. Smart people are smart enough to realize that being smart isnt all that fun, because you know things that you dont want to know.."" This train of thought continued for about 6 hours and by the end of the night i found myself talking about the multiverse theory. Let me remind you that this started off with the questioning what an inner being consists of and led me to the multiverse theory. It happens consistently and even when I am talking to someone, I cannot concentrate on what they say because my mind is too distracted with this thinking. It has come to the point where I get horrible headaches every night and the thinking still doesn't stop and it is starting to worry me. My boyfriend said that I showed incredible analysis and critical thinking but I am actually scared of this and I want it to calm down. Has this happened to anyone else? Is this a mental disorder? Any answer is greatly appreciated!"

Smoke about 15 a day and social drinker but beer enthusiast so will have 1 IPA or similar with dinner a night. I have had slight anxiety since my mid 20's when I strained chest muscles playing golf which led to chest pain and a panic attack.  It's all gone down hill starting a year ago today. I was camping and just woke up and had some breakfast and a 1/2 cup coffee when everything started going sideways. And I mean that literally. I felt like my head was flip flopping and got very disoriented,light headed, and shaky. A (very long) trip to the ER later they wrote it off as slight dehydration and sent me on way. All labs were normal. Fast forward to October and was walking back in from lunch at work when I started getting the same wobble, strange feelings in my head, and started shaking horribly. EMT's were called and my BP was 170/116 and pulse 85 (pulse was still ok). Went to ER once again, they ran EKG and CAT scan which all came back normal. All labs once again also normal. I followed up with my primary and they decided I should see a neuro and cardio to rule anything out. Cardio was a easy EKG and stress test, passed with flying colors. Neuro requested MRI and MRA contrast and non. Both came back normal. Next he sent me for additional bloodwork.... OK BOOM - B12 was in low normal range but from what I have read this can cause some neuro symptoms, imbalace, as well as mock other conditions. I've been on sublingual 1200 mcg drops, B6, and folic acid for 2 months.. This is where everything else comes in - I STILL FEEL AWFUL. I have daily episodes where I feel like world is crashing in, head feels weird ALL THE TIME, my muscles feel like they are constantly overused and like NERF if that makes any sense. All in all there is not one day that goes by I don't think I'm going to end up back in the hospital.  As I said, I'm pretty laid back. I don't get stressed out at my job much even though I'm a higher level manager and alot of responsibility. I have a good family life, eat well, prob dont exercise enough, but all in all should be not feeling this way. Can this be anxiety?"

Everything i tired to look at I couldn't. It was all a big blur. I didn't go to doctor until my left arm started to go numb and II couldn't focus on anything. Also my head was very lightheaded. (not sure if a coincidence or not but two nights before at work I got very cold, so cold in fact I couldn't talk proper afterwards for a little while. The cold came from my lower back and my left side of face was causing the problem for trying to talk. Anyways I went to doctor and just said I was dissy and he said I had vertigo and gave me serc and it went away. Before it went away I had very bad motion sickness which I never had A week later I returned home the symptoms came back (not s bad as initial drunk feeling) after I tried to clean my ears (or that's my guess). My left arm went a little numb again. I got sec again from another doctor. My focus problems improved but I could telll something is off and not rite. FYI I continued to take sec until June 2017!! Had bloodworm done, ct scan, stool sample and everything came back good but I still felt lightheadness, and was off and hard time to focus. Doctors just though crystals in my ears were off Went to ent in August 2016. He finally explained that I didn't have vertigo as I'm lightheadness and I didn't have vertigo which is the room is spinning around me and all ear tests came back good. He couldn't understand why sec would work as to him it should be useless. He proceeded to clean my ears and removed a large chunk of wax from left ear. two days later my left side of my face and my neck went numb. Felt very weak. I went to doctor who then thought I had nerve damage from the cold and requested I see neurologist.. I couldn't and still can't put anything in my ears such as listening to music as it makes me sick the next day Tried to give up my sec pills but when I did my left eye would vibrate and i couldn't focus so I got back on them Seen neurologist. in november 2016. He said to him everything seemed fine even though I told him I feel way of. He requested a mri I continued to feel off and lightheadness and hard to focus and if i forgot a serc pill I would feel worst November 2016, shoppers drug mart gave me the generic of serc which made me very sick and didn't work for me also Had Mri Feb 2017 on my head. Everything came back good. Then in early March I felt perfect, best i did in years then all of a sudden mid march it was like April 2017 all over again but kinda different. My left eye wouldn't stop vibrating, I couldn't focus, felt like gonna throw up, and was gonna pass out at random times. This went away (back to my new normal which still wasn't perfect). I was at work april 2017 and got very sick again. Hard to focus, but this time felt very warm and flustered like I had a fever or blood pressure was up. My legs would burn. I checked blood pressure and it was good. I would feel the worst in the mornings and feel overheated after lunch. I had severe motion sickness. I had to be driving. and if I had to stop and go a lot in traffic it would make me feel sicker. This went away after 2 weeks and back to my new normal.  I gave up sec pills June 15th to see how I would be when seeing the ent. I was a little bit worst but not totally I went back to ent last week and he said again it's not a ear problem and has referred me back to a neurologist. He cleaned my ears and now I feel very off again I do have anxiety over this all as I have a fear of getting sick and not working as I have a lot of bills. He said this could make symptoms worst. Im very tired all the time. My left arm feels weaker than right arm. If I make sharp left turns it feels worst than right turns. Hard for me to focus as I like to drift off when somebody is talking to me. This is affecting my work as I usually work at heights but have not since and my work choices are limited Anxiety does run in my family but I only have it since I got sick. Could you wake up feeling like your drunk and serc help and it be anxiety? the part with things in my ears making me sick throws off the anxiety part. Im just not sure what tests are going to be next. I am overweigh a bit (511 and 220 as I stop exercising) and have diarrhea daily since a year Sorry for the long rite up but this has been a very hard year and I have a 2 year old son and have been sick for half of his life so far any suggestions greatly apppreciated"

Mental Health Create a Post  Telligent.Evolution.Extensibility.Api.Entities.Version1.ForumThread. Anonymous 11 hours ago I can't stop thinking or questioning things to the point where it is affecting my performance in school. I have really long trains of thought. I cannot stop thinking and when I go to school I cannot concentrate no matter how hard I try because there is a loud voice in my head just thinking and thinking all day long. I have actually failed two quizzes now because it is so hard for me to listen in the classroom...I woke up one morning and asked my self a simple question, and I came up with two possible answers and from those two answers I came up with more questions, and more possible answers and it just continues throughout the day until I go to sleep. Then I wake up the next day and remind myself where I left off in my thought process, and I continue my train of thought. It is starting to scare me because it distracts me from school and a few of my grades have dropped because I cannot stop thinking about these crazy topics. I am an 18 year old high school student and I suffer from anxiety. I do not smoke cigarettes, I rarely drink alcohol, but I moderately smoke marijuana because it helps me a lot with my anxiety. I tried researching what this could be and I found a lot of anxiety related answers, but those answers described overthinking things and worrying about things, but my thinking processes are not worrisome. My boyfriend asked to see what one of my thought processes was like, so here is an example of a message that I sent him, which is what I was thinking at that moment he asked me: ""You know how we are a physical embodiment of our souls? And people usually consider their physical appearances a big part of their personality? Like the things we wear, piercings, tattoos, and what we do with our hair. That's only a small aspect of our personality, so who are we with out our physical appearances? What does our inner being consist of? Do my opinions make me who I am? In the controversy of abortion, I am pro choice. So is being pro choice a part of who I am? I don't think so because that is an opinion that I have about something in the physical world. If that controversy never existed, who would I be then? Do my values make me who I am? I value my friends and my well being. Does that make me who I am? I don't think so because those are basic human values. I think our inner being consists of something that makes us unique from every other inner human being. If we eliminate all physical properties and all that is left is our souls, then who is my soul and how is it different from everyone else's soul? What if I have it all wrong? What if all of our souls are exactly the same and it is up to the individual to create his/her own unique being? If this was true, then should we be okay with the bad people in this world? For example murderers, they want to be murderers so why would we stop someone from being who they want to be? (I know this sounds horrible, but complete open mindedness is necessary for this topic. I do not agree with murder, this is just for the sake of this example.) But murderers are a product of our society. People are oppressed, abused, or traumatized and become murderers. So in this government, we create murderers and then throw them in jail as punishment for doing something that they found pleasure in. People think that there is only one criminal and one victim, but actually, the murderer is also a victim. A victim of this government. This government is the real criminal (for turning its own citizens to into horrible people), and the prisoners are the victims (because they are bad due to a crappy government) Many prisoners are actually very smart people, and sometimes that is why they are in prison! They are a threat to the government so they find a stupid reason to put the smart people in jail. Smart people end up dying in cells every day. Smart people actually live miserable lives because they know too much about the real world. Smart people are smart enough to realize that being smart isnt all that fun, because you know things that you dont want to know.."" This train of thought continued for about 6 hours and by the end of the night i found myself talking about the multiverse theory. Let me remind you that this started off with the absurdity of astrology and led to the multiverse theory. It happens consistently and even when I am talking to someone, I cannot concentrate on what they say because my mind is too distracted with this thinking. It has come to the point where I get horrible headaches every night and the thinking still doesn't stop and it is starting to worry me. My boyfriend said that I showed incredible analysis and critical thinking but I am actually scared of this and I want it to calm down. Has this happened to anyone else? Is this a mental disorder?"

Do you know much about liver injury or allergies? Want to shake up the day a little? I have a fun puzzle for you. :) Come down this rabbit-hole with me! Back in 2010 I started working in SE Asia, particularly Laos. Within 2 years (by 2012) I started getting mouth sores more often when eating citrus foods. So, I avoided them. By 2013, I was starting to have strange digestive issues. By 2014 I started down a medical rabbit-hole nightmare as I sought a diagnosis. No diagnosis came. It's 2019, and I still don't have a diagnosis (but I have a strong suspicion).  My LFTs are much more normal, but still my GGT is a bit high. I occasionally have strange food allergic reactions, but rarely nowadays (at least within the last 6 months). I sleep better, feel better, and think better. Better yet, I eat normal again. I only avoid a few things, and when I encounter them, I often either don't have a reaction or have a limited one. Things I wouldn't dare eat before, I can eat without issue. I'm cured, mostly (yes, I know you must be cringing now).  Life is now good and has been for a number of months. The change? I moved to Stung Treng, Cambodia, and avoided veggies from the common market. I don't eat much with locals. I drink my own filtered water from a city supply. I didn't control the food, I controlled where it came from and how cooked it was. At its worst symptoms included: rectal bleeding, vomiting/swollen throat, mouth sores, burned tongue /sore mouth/peeling skin in mouth while eating, severe lethargy, consistent long duration sleeping (12+ hours per night, not feeling rested), brain fog, emotional instability, inability to eat much in terms of fresh or home cooked food (processed food often didn't cause problems), abdominal pain/discomfort, lower back pain, and all kinds of other horrible things. Duration of symptoms lasting a couple days to 10 or more at a time, with cycles totally unpredictable. Yes, it was miserable. I attempted the whole fasting / removal thing to see if I could figure out a particular food trigger, lol. Look at the link below and see the results. You'll probably chuckle; don't feel bad, everyone else did too, including me.  Below this paragraph is the link for the food allergy blood test and the liver biopsy results. LFTs: GGT has mostly stayed in the 150-240 range (40 normal) for 7 years. Only once has it been less. ALT/ALP/AST ranged from normal to 80s-low 100s. Now they are effectively normal for more than 6 months. The food allergies stopped with the LFT normalization.      I have done extensive testing - they ran out of tests (far more than included above). Do you enjoy reading dictionaries in your free time? You had better.  Infectious disease, cancer, auto immune, fatty liver, diabetes, etc all effectively ruled out. I have all of the test results digitized, because such a crazy horrible experience must be documented, lol. I can share if someone wants to look. I have strong reason to believe my liver injury caused my food allergies. I believe my liver injury was due to chemical/pesticide exposure from either contaminated food or water. I believe that I have proof. Can you prove me wrong? ;) I've already stumped about 10 Drs, ranging from general to ID to GI to surgeons to just about anyone else I could make suffer. :) Next in line?

Do you know much about liver injury or allergies? Want to shake up the day a little? I have a fun puzzle for you. :) Come down this rabbit-hole with me! Back in 2010 I started working in SE Asia, particularly Laos. Within 2 years (by 2012) I started getting mouth sores more often when eating citrus foods. So, I avoided them. By 2013, I was starting to have strange digestive issues. By 2014 I started down a medical rabbit-hole nightmare as I sought a diagnosis. No diagnosis came. It's 2019, and I still don't have a diagnosis (but I have a strong suspicion).  My LFTs are much more normal, but still my GGT is a bit high. I occasionally have strange food allergic reactions, but rarely nowadays (at least within the last 6 months). I sleep better, feel better, and think better. Better yet, I eat normal again. I only avoid a few things, and when I encounter them, I often either don't have a reaction or have a limited one. Things I wouldn't dare eat before, I can eat without issue.

Second time month later my shift starts at 7am 12hr shifts. At 7:30am my hands itched like crazy everywhere. I thought my dog got into poison ivy and touching him I got it. Washed my hands in cold water with soap constantly. 7pm went to pharmacy got $40 in poison Ivy medicines and hydrocordozone cream. It didnt relieve it at all. 10 PM my left hand started swelling up and continued to. Broke out with hives on my hands, stomach, thighs and feet. Wheels the dr said they were. 2am my hands were so swollen I could not see my knuckles. I took 5 benadryl but it didnt do anything. Went to ER 6am dr administered EpiPen and 3, 20 mg of prednisone. Swelling stopped. They prescribed me 4 pills 50mg prednisone for 4 days also. 10 PM that night hives came back in full force. I took 50 mg prednisone and fell asleep in chair woke up they were gone. Swollen hands returned to normal 4 days later. 2 weeks later my bloodwork showed white blood cells high were 10,300. Still having reactions to same poly but none of the other brands of poly seem to not bother me. Have allergist appointment nov 7th. Anybody have any idea what I'm reacting to on this brand? Doesnt seem like its color print coz other poly wrap has same colors. Although its blue and a case of dassani water I touched i broke out in hives but that only happened once.

I cannot stop thinking and when I go to school I cannot concentrate no matter how hard I try because there is a loud voice in my head just thinking and thinking all day long. I have actually failed two quizzes now because it is so hard for me to listen in the classroom...I woke up one morning and asked my self a simple question, and I came up with two possible answers and from those two answers I came up with more questions, and more possible answers and it just continues throughout the day until I go to sleep. Then I wake up the next day and remind myself where I left off in my thought process, and I continue my train of thought. It is starting to scare me because it distracts me from school and a few of my grades have dropped because I cannot stop thinking about these crazy topics. I am an 18 year old high school student and I suffer from anxiety. I tried researching what this could be and I found a lot of anxiety related answers, but those answers described overthinking things and worrying about things, but my thinking processes are not worrisome. My boyfriend asked to see what one of my thought processes was like, so here is an example of a message that I sent him, which is what I was thinking at that moment he asked me: ""You know how we are a physical embodiment of our souls? And people usually consider their physical appearances a big part of their personality? Like the things we wear, piercings, tattoos, and what we do with our hair. That's only a small aspect of our personality, so who are we with out our physical appearances? What does our inner being consist of? Do my opinions make me who I am? In the controversy of abortion, I am pro choice. So is being pro choice a part of who I am? I don't think so because that is an opinion that I have about something in the physical world. If that controversy never existed, who would I be then? Do my values make me who I am? I value my friends and my well being. Does that make me who I am? I don't think so because those are basic human values. I think our inner being consists of something that makes us unique from every other inner human being. If we eliminate all physical properties and all that is left is our souls, then who is my soul and how is it different from everyone else's soul? What if I have it all wrong? What if all of our souls are exactly the same and it is up to the individual to create his/her own unique being? If this was true, then should we be okay with the bad people in this world? For example murderers, they want to be murderers so why would we stop someone from being who they want to be? (I know this sounds horrible, but complete open mindedness is necessary for this topic. I do not agree with murder, this is just for the sake of this example.) But murderers are a product of our society. People are oppressed, abused, or traumatized and become murderers. So in this government, we create murderers and then throw them in jail as punishment for doing something that they found pleasure in. People think that there is only one criminal and one victim, but actually, the murderer is also a victim. A victim of this government. This government is the real criminal (for turning its own citizens to into horrible people), and the prisoners are the victims (because they are bad due to a crappy government) Many prisoners are actually very smart people, and sometimes that is why they are in prison! They are a threat to the government so they find a stupid reason to put the smart people in jail. Smart people end up dying in cells every day. Smart people actually live miserable lives because they know too much about the real world. Smart people are smart enough to realize that being smart isnt all that fun, because you know things that you dont want to know.."" This train of thought continued for about 6 hours and by the end of the night i found myself talking about the multiverse theory. Let me remind you that this started off with the absurdity of astrology and led to the multiverse theory. It happens consistently and even when I am talking to someone, I cannot concentrate on what they say because my mind is too distracted with this thinking. It has come to the point where I get horrible headaches every night and the thinking still doesn't stop and it is starting to worry me. My boyfriend said that I showed incredible analysis and critical thinking but I am actually scared of this and I want it to calm down. Has this happened to anyone else? Is this a mental disorder? Any answer is greatly appreciated!"

I would go to sleep fine but at like 2-5 am I would wake up so itchy and covered in raised, not round, red hives. The only thing that would make them go away was taking a shower and giving them time. I went to the doctor for this after it didn't go away for weeks, and the doctor told me to try taking Zyrtec because that's an antihistamine originally for hives. She told me that if that didn't work she would have blood work done and see what's wrong. Zyrtec worked AMAZINGLY. whenever I take it everything is gone and I'm not itchy anymore. at first I had to take 2 Zyrtec per day to see results but soon that became one and now I take one every other day. I moved to Australia in September, and the hives came with me. I also worked with children in a summer camp over the summer and am wondering if that could have caused it."

Maybe I'm overreacting and it's normal for a teenager to have this or it's natural to be socially awkward, but I feel VERY uncomfortable in any spotlight. I am home-schooled and I have testing at public school sites a few times every year. This causes me to become extremely anxious and I usually stay up about an hour the night before at bedtime thinking about what horrors could happen (like a lock-down or school shooting OR me embarrassing myself in front of everyone OR having to talk in front of the WHOLE class). It's not anything new though. I've been doing it for the past two years. I don't like meeting new people and I feel like they judge me because of how I look and what I wear. When I actually DO get to the testing site, I'm not the loud-mouth fun, silly chatterbox that I usually am at home. I don't say ONE word and stay mute the whole time. I hate walking in front of people and moving around, getting out of my seat, eating the snacks they give us in front of people, and anyone watching me.

I'm a 28 year old female and about 17 months ago I suffered a horrible nervous breakdown from medication withdrawal that my doctor took me off way too quickly. It was only one med that I truly should not have been on in the first place. I was living in Nashville at the time and stuck it out as long as I could as I had little support. Mostly only from a few friends who did the best they could. 9 months after my withdrawal I somehow made it back to my small hometown in Northern California. I could only push through about 7 months of being home as I could not handle the suppression and bad memories of small town that still haunts me even with endless therapy. I am not running from my problems as I have made peace with those demons long ago. I just don't want to be reminded of things that have happened to me.  Fast forward to now. I moved back to Nashville and in with friends. They do the best they can but even they don't seem as supportive as I would have hoped. No one believes me that I am steal healing from this horrible drug I was on for 8 years. Moving back has sent me in a tailspin. Not only do I feel a strange lack of support but I live in a neighborhood that makes me feel so incredibly unsafe. It is one of the worst areas to live in. I know my way around and yet I began having terrible panic attacks all over again on the highways, in the grocery stores and restaurants.  I am unable to work as my panic is terrible anytime I leave the house so I am running out of money and I have no insurance. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I cannot go back home as I feel so isolated there but its even worse here. My sister and my brother in law live in Georgia but I have never been there and know nothing about it except they live in a safe place and i can do housework in exchange for rent.  I guess my question is I don't even know. I think I'm just looking for any guidance. I try listening to my instincts but it seems so scrambled. I don't know if I should stay put and work through it as best I can or if I should try moving again. Moving is stressful enough but it's 10x worse when you're brain is misfiring every day.  Side note, for 17 months I have been free of all medications (even Ibuprofen and tylenol!) I do not drink, smoke, do any drugs, no caffeine.. nothing. I don't even really eat added sugar. I'm trying to get my life back as healthy as possible but because I have been in so much pain for almost 2 years I feel like I will never get better. I feel like giving up.  Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
