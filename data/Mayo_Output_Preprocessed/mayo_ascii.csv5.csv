3,C0334037,Intestinal metaplasia,C0027769,Nervousness,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/degree-of-severity-of-intestinal-metaplasia/,Degree of severity of intestinal metaplasia,"I am from China and now work in the United States. In China, I was diagnosed of intestinal metaplasia (++). Here, (++) means medium severity. Two weeks ago, I had a endoscopy in California, the resulting biopsy report only showed the existence of intestinal metaplasia in Antrum and Angularis, but not mention its severity. I have no way to find whether this desease is improving or deteriorating. I am quite nervous about its malignant development and want to monitor it closely. Can MAYO issue a biopsy report showing the degree of severity of intestinal metaplasia at Antrum and Angularis? Thang you. Liked by Jackie, Alumna Mentor Follow Report"

I'm 52 and had my 1st colonoscopy a couple wks ago due to 4 months of diarrhea and significant weight loss. Over the years I have normally had a lot of problems with terrible constipation, so having diarrhea was/is definately a new thing for me. When i went for my consult regarding the results he told me he couldn't finish the procedure without the risk of perforating my colon. He said I had the colon of an 80 year old. He didn't use any specific terms/conditions. He said something about it being stretched and loose and that it didn't get that way overnight. That I have had some type of IBS for a long time and I need to have a barium enema. I don't know what any of this means. I do know for the barium enema I have to go on a clear liquid diet for 2 days and that will be hard because I'm already down to 87 lbs and get weak and dizzy easy and also haave other chronic pain problems that flare with not enough rest and not eating right. But mostly I'd like to understand what he was telling me about my colon. Thanks. Follow Report"

I'm really new to this forum and I wanted to see if anyone has ever received Botox injections in their stomach to treat Gastroperisis and Vagus Nerve Dysfunction? I just wanted to know if it's been effective more times than not. I understand everyone is different but if it worked for you or someone you knew what is the ""normal"" frequency of these injections, experience day of and through the procedure, any side effects experienced. My GI specialist told me that if after the first round of Botox injections don't work, they were not going to work and even though I'm not really a candidate for the gastric pacemaker, if I wanted I could then go see another specialist to discuss that treatment. All I know is I'm so tired of chasing my tail with all these symptoms that seemed to be more unmanaged than managed. I have a long story, if you have any questions please feel free to ask.

Ill give a little bit of history. Ive only had what I know as swallowing issues for the last 4-5 months at most. Sometimes I cant even get things to go down into my throat at all, other times I can but whatever it is just gets stuck and thats consistent. Ive had chronic heartburn since 2006 ish and been taking Prilosec and or 300mg of Zantac daily since. Which neither of these mess seem to help. But they help better than anything else Ive tried. I also have a condition called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome which is a collagen disorder, and I have type 3 (hyper mobile) with mild over lapping of type 4 (vascular). I also have POTs and other autonomic dysfunction. With that being said, I was sent to GI for a consult and so far have had the pudding esophageal motility test, and the Barium swallow X-ray. They have both come back abnormal. The esophageal motility test says: Esophageal Motility IMPRESSION: Esophageal transit is normal for water but delayed at mid esophagus for thin and thick semisolid boluses. FINDINGS: Esophageal transit scintigraphy performed per protocol. Graphic processed scintigraphic display reviewed in addition to the dynamic imaging. WATER BOLUS: The water bolus passes normally into the stomach within 10 seconds. BOLUS 1, THIN SEMISOLID: There is hang-up of the thin semisolid bolus in the mid esophagus and at the junction of the mid and lower third, with the tracer in the mid esophagus clearing after 25 seconds and the residual activity in the distal third of the esophagus clearing x 45 s. BOLUS 2, THICK SEMISOLID: The thick semisolid bolus shows considerable retention in the mid esophagus which predominantly clears after the second dry swallow at 40 seconds.  The Barium swallow X-ray says: Esophagus Moderate esophageal dysmotility is present with interrupted primary peristaltic wave, intermittent ineffective secondary peristaltic waves which are nonpropulsive. Subsequent peristaltic waves then stripped the barium bolus normally. There is a small hiatal hernia present with free spontaneous gastroesophageal reflux noted with esophageal distention to the thoracic inlet. There is however no ulceration, stricture, or mass present. Barium pill was administered, which passed freely through the GE junction into the stomach.  My Drs impressions says esophageal motility disorder with cervical and esophageal components. My question is what is this all telling me. I keep looking things up but then get super confused and mixed up. I still have to go back for a upper endoscopy, an esophageal manometry, neuro speech assessment, and a video X-ray barium swallow. I cant find anything on the speech assessment. And Im not understanding why I have to repeat the barium test? Since medicine isnt working what are some of the treatments or fixes to any of this. Can my esophagus just die? What happens if it stops working all together? Sorry for the long message. I dont live near Mayo and have to travel to get there so I dont get a lot of time with the drs to ask these questions. They are just more concerned getting the tests done before they make sense of it to me it seems, and I am super lost and confused. Any help would be greatly appreciated Follow Report"

I joined this group hoping to find tips for managing recurrent/chronic SBOs. I had a Ladd's procedure at 4 days old which left me with scar tissue. I started having partial SBOs at 25 but they went misdiagnosed as biliary colic because my anatomy is weird so I presented with RUQ pain mimicking gallbladder issues. Last year in March I was diagnosed with a closed loop bowel obstruction and had emergency surgery. They found that my intestines were adhered to my liver and gallbladder and the surgeon removed my gallbladder an resected a small portion of my small intestine. That resulted in a 21 day stay in the hospital due to post op complications. This year in June I had yet another SBO that ultimately resulted in another surgery. My surgeon said it looked like someone had dumped super glue in my abdomen the adhesions were so bad. That surgery resulted in a 26 day hospital stay ( my bowels don't like to wake up post surgery). I am now following a low fiber/no fiber diet, work out regularly, and drink 124 oz of water daily. I have had at least 2 SBOs since being released which were both managed with an NG. I find that eating any food sets me off and have had to stick to mostly liquids. Any tips for how to manage this thing??

I went to see a dentist in early January 2017 for a root canal. He injected me with numbing solution, but couldnt get me numb. For three days after that injection my heart was racing out of my chest, and I was having tremors at night. I went to the doctor and she said its likely the solution went into my system, and since it has epinepherine, it caused my heart symptoms. So she put me on propranolol/Inderal 20 mg 2x a day. After a few days, I developed intense mucous and cough and it felt like my throat was flapping in the wind. I was also experiencing what felt like my heart being squeezed and my throat closing. So she told me to back off the meds, and sent me to a cardiologist. The day I saw the cardiologist I was having major propranolol withdrawals. The cardiologist gave me the same information my GP had given me, that it was likely he dental numbing solution. She put me on a different beta blocker called metoprolol succinate ER. Six hours after taking it, I was having what felt like heart flutters when eating, then feeling like if my swallow was stopping. After a few days I noticed it was becoming increasingly harder to swallow, until by the end of ONE WEEK on the medication, I could not swallow at all and was choking on chicken broth and having very intense feelings of my heart being squeezed and then my throat closing. I took myself to a gastroenterologist after having googled my symptoms and being ignored by every medical professional I saw, and he said the drugs likely relaxed my smooth muscle too much. He had me stop the medication and do an endoscopy and a barium swallow/manometry. My endoscopy was normal, and my barium swallow showed I had tertiary contractions and also significantly diminished primary peristalsis. About six weeks after stopping the meds, I was given a manometry which showed that i had 90% swallows failed. About two months after stopping I was given another barium swallow which showed that now my distal esophagus had diminished peristalsis and that i was having spasms. I have never had any problems in my life. Then six hours after taking a random heart medication, esophagus is malfunctioning. I am six months out, and i have had improvement in that I am no longer choking up top, but i cant eat solids w/o spasms and food getting stuck. The doctor said I have non specific esophageal motility disorder and there was NOTHING ELSE THEY COULD FOR ME AND I HAD TO LEARN TO COPE. I refuse to accept this and am looking for a doctor with 1) compassion and 2) knowledge and willingness to try to treat, as Ive read there are treatments. I realize none of the treatments work for all, but to give up on me and leave me hanging w/o a nutrition plan, w/o anything, is cruel. Ive lost 53lbs since this started and I was so weak I could barely work. I am doing better now, but only because I am eating tons of ice cream and anything liquid, SO MUCH SUGAR. If anyone has experienced this or maybe can assist, please let me know. Thanks! i am in the dallas, tx area. I will take all recommendations, for in and out of state and even at Mayo! Thanks!

After a few days, I developed intense mucous and cough and it felt like my throat was flapping in the wind. I was also experiencing what felt like my heart being squeezed and my throat closing. So she told me to back off the meds, and sent me to a cardiologist. The day I saw the cardiologist I was having major propranolol withdrawals. The cardiologist gave me the same information my GP had given me, that it was likely he dental numbing solution. She put me on a different beta blocker called metoprolol succinate ER. Six hours after taking it, I was having what felt like heart flutters when eating, then feeling like if my swallow was stopping. After a few days I noticed it was becoming increasingly harder to swallow, until by the end of ONE WEEK on the medication, I could not swallow at all and was choking on chicken broth and having very intense feelings of my heart being squeezed and then my throat closing. I took myself to a gastroenterologist after having googled my symptoms and being ignored by every medical professional I saw, and he said the drugs likely relaxed my smooth muscle too much. He had me stop the medication and do an endoscopy and a barium swallow/manometry. My endoscopy was normal, and my barium swallow showed I had tertiary contractions and also significantly diminished primary peristalsis. About six weeks after stopping the meds, I was given a manometry which showed that i had 90% swallows failed. About two months after stopping I was given another barium swallow which showed that now my distal esophagus had diminished peristalsis and that i was having spasms. I have never had any problems in my life. Then six hours after taking a random heart medication, esophagus is malfunctioning. I am six months out, and i have had improvement in that I am no longer choking up top, but i cant eat solids w/o spasms and food getting stuck. The doctor said I have non specific esophageal motility disorder and there was NOTHING ELSE THEY COULD FOR ME AND I HAD TO LEARN TO COPE. I refuse to accept this and am looking for a doctor with 1) compassion and 2) knowledge and willingness to try to treat, as Ive read there are treatments. I realize none of the treatments work for all, but to give up on me and leave me hanging w/o a nutrition plan, w/o anything, is cruel. Ive lost 53lbs since this started and I was so weak I could barely work. I am doing better now, but only because I am eating tons of ice cream and anything liquid, SO MUCH SUGAR. If anyone has experienced this or maybe can assist, please let me know. Thanks! i am in the dallas, tx area. I will take all recommendations, for in and out of state and even at Mayo! Thanks!

I have been on here for awhile trying to figure out some Chest issues. I have digestive issues as well however. Yesterday afternoon I has a sharp pain in gallbladder area. Soon after it was from there all the way to center and my left side. Almost like a squeezing pain. Lasted about 5 minutes or so and also hurt to the touch lightly. It left and has been off and on today and it seems the area right below my sternum is swollen at times. I had had a scope and said I had a very small high hernia and also had a gallbladder test done with no issues. Could this be constipation or any other thoughts ? Follow Report

Im 20 years old and have suffered from nausea and burning in my throat for several years now. I have seen two GI doctors who have tried a few different PPIs and have tested me for many things, but I continue to get worse. Currently I am diagnosed with GERD and Fructose Malabsorption. PPIs seem to help with regular heartburn which I would get after eating a meal, but the burning in my throat is something different. It comes out of nowhere, usually two or three hours after I have eaten something or when I wake up in the morning. It will last for 2-3 days (sometimes more) straight with severe nausea, bloating, and gas. During these spells I can barely eat anything and medicines like Gaviscon, Zantac, and Pepto dont even touch it. Then, I will wake up the next day after having a spell and the burning will be gone, but I am left with a queasy/nauseous feeling most of the time. I have drastically changed my diet and dont eat or drink anything acidic or irritating. I dont have coffee, chocolate, sauces, fried foods, etc. I also dont smoke and I am pretty underweight. Does anyone have any ideas or tips? I am so desperate for relief that I am willing to try anything. Follow Report"

My problem started about a month ago when I started chugging down a glass of water and suddenly I had a spasm in the area of my pharynx. It scared me, and took several minutes to abate, but no other symptoms. Soon, I found that I could no longer drink orange juice without the same problem, and then ice cream gave me very thick saliva that was difficult to spit out as well as the tightness in my throat. I had had problems with normal heartburn in the past, but a few days of ranitidine (Zantac) and I was OK. I think this was because of my taking ibuprofen on an empty stomach. If the Zantac didnt help, which was seldom, I took Prilosec for 3 days and it was gone. Now, after the spasms, I began burping and having hiccups frequently, which was new to me, so I started on Prilosec 20mg once a day. I also changed my diet to conform with the diet for GERD and I think Im beginning to get better, but its taken a lot out of me because Ive been on the same diet for a long time and all of a sudden Im missing crucial nutrients that I ordinarily get. By the way, Im 69 and have been healthy and disease free for at least 20 years. I want to discontinue the Prilosec because Ive only been taking it for a little more than two weeks. Im wondering if I could switch back to the Zantac 150mg twice a day without experiencing rebound symptoms because Ive been on the Prilosec for such a short time. I can see that there are many people here with digestive health problems and Im hoping someone can steer me in the right direction. My doctor is very good at giving labs and writing prescriptions, but he doesnt seem to do much doctoring, but that was OK, because I havent had any serious health issues. He just told me  You know you have to see a gastroenterologist. Because of the holiday I havent been able to schedule an appt. yet and now, with some of the symptoms lessening, Im hoping theres a chance that I can switch to Zantac, or preferably cimetidine (Tagament) which helped me greatly when I developed an ulcer many years ago, and solve this problem without any intervention. The reason I want to stop taking it is because of the side effects. Ive had diarrhea a few times and lots of headaches.Im also worried about the things that can happen when you have so little stomach acid. Id appreciate any comments from people who have had experience weaning off Prilosec after short term use, or anyone who has suffered with LPR or laryngopharangeal reflux, or anyone at all.

I've tried taking additional digestive enzymes, but the benefit is minimal. I've gotten to the point where I have eliminated those things from my diet because I am so fearful that I'll end up bloated again. I watch my diet closely because I've been hospitalized previously with bowel obstructions. But other than not eating the usual suspects for people with digestive problems, seeds, nuts, fruit, veggies, etc. I can pretty much eat what I want without getting bloated or other problems.

I am a healthy 70-year old female. I have felt fine throughout; however I have this tiny pain every day, but not all day. What I am imagining is that a staple inside the area is pricking the area. This is only a thought and I cannot quite describe it. When I press around the belly button it does not feel worse, but there is some hardness to the tissue. Could this be stitches healing? It is only in one spot. I called the nurse and she was quite dismissive saying: you cannot call about every little thing; you are still healing; you should not play golf and a racquet sport (but the surgeon said I could  I have not played these sports yet but I do work out in the gym); I told her the surgeon said I had a little redness irritation around the navel but she said he did not put it in his notes !!  Well, he is the one who brought it to my attention !? The concern is that this little pin prick feeling does not get better  it stays the same. The surgery report says I have Tycron stitches. I guess I should demand to see the surgeon or go for a second opinion or get an X-ray? (I have asked questions throughout, as that is my M.O.). Follow Report"

Twice, in 2012 and 2013, I was hospitalized with an obstructed bowel. It was unpleasant (NG tube), 12 on the pain scale, and frightening. Fortunately, with conservative hospital treatment, I avoided surgery and recovered. The reason for my obstructions was massive adhesions due to 7 abdominal surgeries. This was after a couple of years of all kinds of bloating, diarrhea, bowel incontinence, etc. After much testing and many trips to the ER, I went to the Cleveland Clinic. More tests  but nothing definitive. My GP was my best resource, and we finally decided that I should not eat any fruit, veggies, nuts, seeds, or fiber. I have an interesting diet! But it's okay. He also put me on Miralax every day to keep everything moving. This was 5 years ago, and I have been without any obstructions during that time. I follow my diet. The Miralax does keep things moving  boy, how I love to hear those peristalsis sounds! I have read several studies that indicate that this is not a healthy habit; however, it works for me, and I suspect the researchers have never suffered with an obstructed bowel!

My symptoms for 7 months have not been devastating; I could live with them. Only had 2 bad attacks (even they were not tremendous pain)  but they were not fun; others were minor. Problem is, you cannot predict when you will have an attack. I have the symptoms: urine that is pale half the time and medium YELLOW half the time; big pressure in upper quadrant of stomach for several hours here and there (longest was 8 hours); weird and diverse stools and a total change in regularity and amount. I was determined to manage this with diet. I had some success but every professional I speak to says take it out!!. Once you start having symptoms it is time to act before it gets worse and gallstone gets stuck in bile duct etc., etc. Their point is it is easy to manage elective removal than to have many problems if it develops too far. I object! to losing a body part. But I am going to have the surgery. Heres the dilemma: Laparoscopic is easy with quick recovery  not invasive. However, you have to agree to having OPEN surgery if they have difficulty or discover something else. This is a more serious surgery, much longer recovery time and I guess more follow-up issues. I am very healthy  so I am disgusted to have to invade my body.My surgeon is young and says he has a ton of experience in gallbladder and other surgeries. 2 doctors I know recommend him. I feel like I should wait until I am really sick; but, again, the common approach is to take it out once the gallstones start causing problems. What would you do? Liked by debiobrien Follow Report"

I've posted here a few times in the past on both these topics in regard to my status currently. Things have been slowly getting worse since this past December, and I really don't have a plan to fix it. My GI surgeon is at a loss, because he said my symptoms and test results narrow it down to these. He says roux en Y surgery will do more harm than good, as I will likely lose 25-30 pounds and may never get that back (?). I have lost 14 pounds in the past few months due to no appetite and the fullness one feels after a small amount of food. Plus the constant nausea to some level adds up to not wanting to eat. But I ask you out there for some advice. I just went for a run (this is therapy for me, and lets me clear my mind from all that I am going through) tonight, and vomited bile when I was done. I vomit a couple times a week now, which has never happened to me in all the time I have dealt with GI issues post gallbladder removal. Clearly I have a dysfunction. GI suggested botox to keep the valve open at the bottom of the stomach.but if I have bile reflux, that will open this up to a worse situation with more bile flowing into the stomach.

These symptoms have gone on since January. I spend about 20 minutes every morning hacking up thick mucous. Sometimes the mucus is so thick that it gets stuck in my throat and I have to pull it out with my hand. Other times, I am too exhausted from trying to expel mucus that I give up, and suffer with the choking feeling. In March/April my sputum was tested and grew staph, so my pcp put me on bactrum. At that time I was also experiencing dizziness, swollen lymph nodes, and a fainting episode, in addition to the continuing symptoms listed above. However, my pcp and pulmonologist believe that the staph was a red herring that would not cause the continuing symptoms. I have had my sputum tested since then and it came back as contaminated with saliva. I am extremely exhausted and I can sleep 17 hours straight (getting up half awake to urinate) and then i wake up still tired. I am nervous about driving because I feel sleepy when I drive. I feel winded if I talk to much. (I am a normal weight and otherwise healthy.) The upper abdominal pain is pretty much constant, and seems to worsen after eating. That feels like pain behind the ribs. Then I also have a dull aching of the part of my abdomen above my belly button. I have had the heartburn feeling in the past and excessive burping especially at night. My PCP put me on omeprazol which has not helped, followed by pantoprazole, which also has not helped. I have seen an ENT as well, who saw no problems with my sinuses and no evidence of postnasal drip. I have had an endoscopy, (came back normal) esophogeal manotromy (normal), and barium swallow test (normal). I have had a CT scan of abdominal organs, ultrasound of my lymphnodes, mri of my brain because i am having spotty vision (and because of the fainting episode). I saw an allergist who said this would not be a food allergy and she did do various blood tests and urine collections. She noted some seasonal allergies (but my problems began in January) and ruled out allergy to dust mites or cockroach gasses as the cause. She suggested nasacourt and an antihistimine. Both were ineffective, and she ultimately concluded she couldn't help me. My pulmonologists noticed mild obstruction I was put on advair because the thought was that the obstruction was likely due to asthma. That did not work. I was later put on flovent and montelukast, and I have been on those for about three weeks although I feel no difference. My pulmonologists think that this is likely a GI issue, so they scheduled a ph study, but I do not have the results yet. They also doubled my dosage of pantoprazole. I saw a GI specialist affiliated with my PCP's office and without examining me, he told me that my symptoms were trivial and that I should get over it and stop focusing on myself. Luckily my pulmonologists were shocked by his reaction and referred me to a different specialist which I have in August. I have cut out all sodas and fast foods in the past year and I do not have any dogs or cats in my environment. I have maintained a very clean home environment and also using the allergy reducing bedding. I do not have any food allergies that have been determined. Celiacs disease was ruled out. I even did a three day juice cleanse (dairy free, gluten free, soy free, all natural and organic) but that did not help. I have been drinking a lot of water to keep me hydrated, and I have eliminated coffee acidic foods from my diet in the past several months. I have never been a smoker or done recreational drugs, and i no longer consumer alcaohol but prior to all of this would have 2 drinks a week. My PCP has scheduled an abdominal ultrasound to check out my gallblader, although it appeared normal in the previous CT scan. I have that on Wednesday. The mucus is exhausting and really uncomfortable. My upper torso still feels like it is on fire, and have ceased all of my usual daily activities. I don't know what to do.

I am new to this forum so I hope its okay to first do a short introduction.I am in my fifties and single (and happy with it!), living with two cats. I am a teacher and love this work. As I am a writer too, i am hardly at a loss for things to do.But since a few years I have had lots of problems with my bowels. I had a problematic childhood and youth which left me with these problems. I can hardly go, if you know what I mean. The doctors gave me meds to help with that but I react to hardly anything. The new doctor gave me magnesium since that can cause diarrea. Which it did. The dose was, as she put it, up to me. She advised I would take 2 tablets per day, then try 3 if that didnt do the trick, and that I could even take 6. The tablets each contain 750 mg. of magnesium though. She said there were absolutely no side effects. However, ever since I have been taking this supplement, I have been feeling strange. I have been diagnosed with a heart rhythm problem way back in 2007 (I had a TIA and my heart stopped at some point, months later) and I am a bit concerned the magnesium is messing up my heart. Last week, I started getting brainfog and my head felt like it was swelling up, then I would smell blood and eventually there would be blood in my nose. Very strange. I had a strange way of walking, felt uncoordinated, just plain sick Does anyone of you have had magnesium to treat constipation, and have you experienced similar problems? Follow Report"

Watching my mom suffer through the prep every year, I know it's going to be unpleasant, but I need to make sure it's WORTHWHILE. Unfortunately, I don't have much confidence in the gastroenterologist/practice who will be doing the procedure  he did an upper endoscopy a month ago that I have some concerns with his findings/methods.* I've been chronically and inexplicably ill since June with extreme fatigue, low-grade fever (99-100), nausea and urinary frequency; more recently (after the endoscopy, in fact, although I don't think there's a causative relationship there other than they tell you to pay attention to your stool afterwards, which is something I never really did previously), I have had some issues with my anal area feeling ""moist"" (occasionally area will be wet in underwear) and like there's something moving down there, and I've seen increasing amounts of mucous and occasionally blood spots in my stool. With the as-of-yet unexplained fever of unknown origin and slightly elevated CRP, the nausea and strange bowel experiences, the infectious disease specialist spoke to the gastroenterologist personally and now he wants to do a colonoscopy. Even before this was advised, I had hoped to seek a second opinion from a different gastroenterologist/practice, but unfortunately, a slew of factors (running out of FMLA days/difficulty obtaining short-term disability without a diagnosis; the ""re-set"" of my out-of-pocket-maximum, which I'd reached in July, on October 1; repair surgery on Friday for an incisional hernia in my umbilicus from my gallbladder removal surgery in 2016; and honestly just exhaustion from feeling like crap) mean I'm pretty much stuck with this guy. So, I need to make sure I'm well educated and know exactly what to ask for and how to prepare. Particularly: 1. Are there any medications that need to be stopped/could affect any potential biopsies taken or testing done (Protonix/pantoprazole, a PPI, especially comes to mind, as well as the antibiotic Doxycycline, and maybe the probiotic)? 2. Is there anything in particular I should ask be done/tested for? I read @tdrell 's note to request biopsies be read by a gastric pathologist (how exactly would you do that? Do I ask the hospital somehow?) and @hokiefan 's suggestion to have stains for eosinophils/mast cells done (not sure what this would be for? I assume some kind of allergy or intolerance?), and I may request an acid-fast bacilli stain done as well in consideration of a positive Quantiferon Gold TB blood test a month ago. I'd like to ask (or if I have time, research beforehand) about whether anything special needs to be done/tested to consider parasites (I had frequent recurrent issues with pinworms as a kid; I've tried the ""tape test"" and checking my stool several times but don't see anything moving) and/or rectal yeast infection (I'm not entirely sure this is even a thing, but I've been struggling with chronic vaginal ""yeast infections""  the doctors swear that's what's going on and then the culture comes back negative  so I want to make sure that's not somehow connected. Anything else? Doubting the upper endoscopy results after-the-fact was bad enough  I do NOT want to have the same worries about this colonoscopy and perhaps have to have it repeated down the road/if I get into Mayo/upon a second opinion). 3. I realize my ignorance is showing, but is there anything gynecological that the gastroenterologist could see/explore in a colonoscopy, and/or anything liver related? There've been a lot of weird vaginal exam findings  both my primary care and gynecologist were convinced I had a bad, acute yeast infection or (less likely) bacterial vaginosis, and I was started on Diflucan, but then the test results/cultures came back normal, and nobody's given me an alternate explanation other than ""practice good genital hygiene"", like no douching (never did), I've switched to cotton underwear, I take probiotics when on antibiotics (like I am presently), not sexually active, etc. Admittedly, I've never paid much attention to ""down there"", and am embarrassingly clueless about what everything is, but from my best understanding of some research (it's actually rather hard to find clear/understandable information on female anatomy that you can match to your own body), I think I have a polyp just inside my vaginal opening. I'm assuming the gastroenterologist can't, and I probably don't want, him taking a peek down there while I'm out and taking any samples or something, but assuming that's true, is there anything he WOULD be able to see/look for that could indicate a gynecological issue (other than the obvious like a prolapse or fistula or something)? The liver is another thing that keeps coming up with abnormalities; there was a 7x7mm cavernous hemangioma identified and removed from my liver during my gallbladder/appendix removal surgery in 2016, and the biopsy report showed ""mixed inflammation of the portal tracts, which is mild to moderate, and contains neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes, predominantly. Foamy histiocytes are also seen in association with the portal tract."" I haven't had much luck searching what that means  my infectious disease specialist didn't think it was normal  and I don't know for sure that it couldn't all have been from the gallstones that precipitated the surgery, but it's another question. My most recent MRI/ultrasound shows a new lesion, 42.7cm focal nodular hyperplasia (benign, but again, I'm 30 years old and not sure why I'm sprouting liver lesions right and left), and one of my abnormal blood results was an elevated LD5, ""seen with striated muscle lesions (eg, trauma) and with liver diseases (eg, hepatic congestion, congestive heart failure, hepatitis, cirrhosis, alcoholism)""  and not an alcoholic, FYI, and hepatitis blood work all came back negative and cardiologist said everything was fine there. But again, if there's anything I can ask him to check out/look for liver-wise, I think it might be a good idea. Ugh, I always start off intending to write a short, succint post since I know these long honking things scare people off and probably decrease my chances of getting help, but it never seems to work out because there's so many variables or possible avenues to mention, and I don't want to leave out the one little detail that might inspire a lightbulb moment. If you're still reading this, or did a skim the top and bottom, any advice on how to make sure I'm making the most out of this colonoscopy would be greatly appreciated. Advice on how to make this as painless as possible wouldn't be amiss either.  Thanks in advance! *My main issue was, I asked his office about stopping Pantoprazole (a Proton Pump Inhibitor) prior to the upper endoscopy and was told no need to discontinue. After the procedure, I asked if that PPI use could prompt a false negative biopsy result  again, was told no; however, all the peer reviewed articles I've read since say in fact it very often does affect the histopathology biopsy (it inhibits the bacteria growth, though you still have it), and should be stopped at least two weeks prior. Also, all the biopsy samples were taken from stomach body, when the evident inflammation was noted in the gastric antrum (and again, research and procedural guidelines seem to instruct taking biopsy samples from both sites). Lastly, the biopsy samples were sent to the pathologist labeled ""rule out H. pylori""  that sounds like it means no other pathology was studied, which seems like a huge waste. On a less technical side, I've also been very frustrated with his lack of communication with me  right after the endoscopy, he had said I had ""watermelon stomach"" inflammation very common with H. pylori, but it could also be bile reflux, especially since my gallbladder was removed in 2016; then after the H. pylori biopsy came back negative, and I tried multiple times through his staff to set up an appointment to ask about the PPI use and how we explore bile reflux, and he left a message (I was, ironically, in the bathroom at the time) that ""gastritis can be caused by anxiety and stress."" That is very true, and I'm not saying that can't be the cause, but I just want to know why the other possible causes he mentioned are suddenly ruled out and the diagnosis is ""anxiety"". For all these reasons, I'm not thrilled that he'll be doing the colonoscopy, but I feel stuck at this point. Liked by Teresa, Volunteer Mentor, Jackie, Alumna Mentor, eliana5 Follow Report"

So, I need to make sure I'm well educated and know exactly what to ask for and how to prepare. Particularly: 1. Are there any medications that need to be stopped/could affect any potential biopsies taken or testing done (Protonix/pantoprazole, a PPI, especially comes to mind, as well as the antibiotic Doxycycline, and maybe the probiotic)? 2. Is there anything in particular I should ask be done/tested for? I read @tdrell 's note to request biopsies be read by a gastric pathologist (how exactly would you do that? Do I ask the hospital somehow?) and @hokiefan 's suggestion to have stains for eosinophils/mast cells done (not sure what this would be for? I assume some kind of allergy or intolerance?), and I may request an acid-fast bacilli stain done as well in consideration of a positive Quantiferon Gold TB blood test a month ago.

Anything else? Doubting the upper endoscopy results after-the-fact was bad enough  I do NOT want to have the same worries about this colonoscopy and perhaps have to have it repeated down the road/if I get into Mayo/upon a second opinion). 3. I realize my ignorance is showing, but is there anything gynecological that the gastroenterologist could see/explore in a colonoscopy, and/or anything liver related? There've been a lot of weird vaginal exam findings  both my primary care and gynecologist were convinced I had a bad, acute yeast infection or (less likely) bacterial vaginosis, and I was started on Diflucan, but then the test results/cultures came back normal, and nobody's given me an alternate explanation other than ""practice good genital hygiene"", like no douching (never did), I've switched to cotton underwear, I take probiotics when on antibiotics (like I am presently), not sexually active, etc. Admittedly, I've never paid much attention to ""down there"", and am embarrassingly clueless about what everything is, but from my best understanding of some research (it's actually rather hard to find clear/understandable information on female anatomy that you can match to your own body), I think I have a polyp just inside my vaginal opening. I'm assuming the gastroenterologist can't, and I probably don't want, him taking a peek down there while I'm out and taking any samples or something, but assuming that's true, is there anything he WOULD be able to see/look for that could indicate a gynecological issue (other than the obvious like a prolapse or fistula or something)? The liver is another thing that keeps coming up with abnormalities; there was a 7x7mm cavernous hemangioma identified and removed from my liver during my gallbladder/appendix removal surgery in 2016, and the biopsy report showed ""mixed inflammation of the portal tracts, which is mild to moderate, and contains neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes, predominantly. Foamy histiocytes are also seen in association with the portal tract."" I haven't had much luck searching what that means  my infectious disease specialist didn't think it was normal  and I don't know for sure that it couldn't all have been from the gallstones that precipitated the surgery, but it's another question. My most recent MRI/ultrasound shows a new lesion, 42.7cm focal nodular hyperplasia (benign, but again, I'm 30 years old and not sure why I'm sprouting liver lesions right and left), and one of my abnormal blood results was an elevated LD5, ""seen with striated muscle lesions (eg, trauma) and with liver diseases (eg, hepatic congestion, congestive heart failure, hepatitis, cirrhosis, alcoholism)""  and not an alcoholic, FYI, and hepatitis blood work all came back negative and cardiologist said everything was fine there. But again, if there's anything I can ask him to check out/look for liver-wise, I think it might be a good idea. Ugh, I always start off intending to write a short, succint post since I know these long honking things scare people off and probably decrease my chances of getting help, but it never seems to work out because there's so many variables or possible avenues to mention, and I don't want to leave out the one little detail that might inspire a lightbulb moment.

Advice on how to make this as painless as possible wouldn't be amiss either.  Thanks in advance! *My main issue was, I asked his office about stopping Pantoprazole (a Proton Pump Inhibitor) prior to the upper endoscopy and was told no need to discontinue. After the procedure, I asked if that PPI use could prompt a false negative biopsy result  again, was told no; however, all the peer reviewed articles I've read since say in fact it very often does affect the histopathology biopsy (it inhibits the bacteria growth, though you still have it), and should be stopped at least two weeks prior. Also, all the biopsy samples were taken from stomach body, when the evident inflammation was noted in the gastric antrum (and again, research and procedural guidelines seem to instruct taking biopsy samples from both sites). Lastly, the biopsy samples were sent to the pathologist labeled ""rule out H. pylori""  that sounds like it means no other pathology was studied, which seems like a huge waste. On a less technical side, I've also been very frustrated with his lack of communication with me  right after the endoscopy, he had said I had ""watermelon stomach"" inflammation very common with H. pylori, but it could also be bile reflux, especially since my gallbladder was removed in 2016; then after the H. pylori biopsy came back negative, and I tried multiple times through his staff to set up an appointment to ask about the PPI use and how we explore bile reflux, and he left a message (I was, ironically, in the bathroom at the time) that ""gastritis can be caused by anxiety and stress."" That is very true, and I'm not saying that can't be the cause, but I just want to know why the other possible causes he mentioned are suddenly ruled out and the diagnosis is ""anxiety"".

So, I need to make sure I'm well educated and know exactly what to ask for and how to prepare. Particularly: 1. Are there any medications that need to be stopped/could affect any potential biopsies taken or testing done (Protonix/pantoprazole, a PPI, especially comes to mind, as well as the antibiotic Doxycycline, and maybe the probiotic)? 2. Is there anything in particular I should ask be done/tested for? I read @tdrell 's note to request biopsies be read by a gastric pathologist (how exactly would you do that? Do I ask the hospital somehow?) and @hokiefan 's suggestion to have stains for eosinophils/mast cells done (not sure what this would be for? I assume some kind of allergy or intolerance?), and I may request an acid-fast bacilli stain done as well in consideration of a positive Quantiferon Gold TB blood test a month ago. I'd like to ask (or if I have time, research beforehand) about whether anything special needs to be done/tested to consider parasites (I had frequent recurrent issues with pinworms as a kid; I've tried the ""tape test"" and checking my stool several times but don't see anything moving) and/or rectal yeast infection (I'm not entirely sure this is even a thing, but I've been struggling with chronic vaginal ""yeast infections""  the doctors swear that's what's going on and then the culture comes back negative  so I want to make sure that's not somehow connected.

Doubting the upper endoscopy results after-the-fact was bad enough  I do NOT want to have the same worries about this colonoscopy and perhaps have to have it repeated down the road/if I get into Mayo/upon a second opinion). 3. I realize my ignorance is showing, but is there anything gynecological that the gastroenterologist could see/explore in a colonoscopy, and/or anything liver related? There've been a lot of weird vaginal exam findings  both my primary care and gynecologist were convinced I had a bad, acute yeast infection or (less likely) bacterial vaginosis, and I was started on Diflucan, but then the test results/cultures came back normal, and nobody's given me an alternate explanation other than ""practice good genital hygiene"", like no douching (never did), I've switched to cotton underwear, I take probiotics when on antibiotics (like I am presently), not sexually active, etc. Admittedly, I've never paid much attention to ""down there"", and am embarrassingly clueless about what everything is, but from my best understanding of some research (it's actually rather hard to find clear/understandable information on female anatomy that you can match to your own body), I think I have a polyp just inside my vaginal opening. I'm assuming the gastroenterologist can't, and I probably don't want, him taking a peek down there while I'm out and taking any samples or something, but assuming that's true, is there anything he WOULD be able to see/look for that could indicate a gynecological issue (other than the obvious like a prolapse or fistula or something)? The liver is another thing that keeps coming up with abnormalities; there was a 7x7mm cavernous hemangioma identified and removed from my liver during my gallbladder/appendix removal surgery in 2016, and the biopsy report showed ""mixed inflammation of the portal tracts, which is mild to moderate, and contains neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes, predominantly. Foamy histiocytes are also seen in association with the portal tract."" I haven't had much luck searching what that means  my infectious disease specialist didn't think it was normal  and I don't know for sure that it couldn't all have been from the gallstones that precipitated the surgery, but it's another question. My most recent MRI/ultrasound shows a new lesion, 42.7cm focal nodular hyperplasia (benign, but again, I'm 30 years old and not sure why I'm sprouting liver lesions right and left), and one of my abnormal blood results was an elevated LD5, ""seen with striated muscle lesions (eg, trauma) and with liver diseases (eg, hepatic congestion, congestive heart failure, hepatitis, cirrhosis, alcoholism)""  and not an alcoholic, FYI, and hepatitis blood work all came back negative and cardiologist said everything was fine there. But again, if there's anything I can ask him to check out/look for liver-wise, I think it might be a good idea. Ugh, I always start off intending to write a short, succint post since I know these long honking things scare people off and probably decrease my chances of getting help, but it never seems to work out because there's so many variables or possible avenues to mention, and I don't want to leave out the one little detail that might inspire a lightbulb moment.

Are there any medications that need to be stopped/could affect any potential biopsies taken or testing done (Protonix/pantoprazole, a PPI, especially comes to mind, as well as the antibiotic Doxycycline, and maybe the probiotic)? 2. Is there anything in particular I should ask be done/tested for? I read @tdrell 's note to request biopsies be read by a gastric pathologist (how exactly would you do that? Do I ask the hospital somehow?) and @hokiefan 's suggestion to have stains for eosinophils/mast cells done (not sure what this would be for? I assume some kind of allergy or intolerance?), and I may request an acid-fast bacilli stain done as well in consideration of a positive Quantiferon Gold TB blood test a month ago. I'd like to ask (or if I have time, research beforehand) about whether anything special needs to be done/tested to consider parasites (I had frequent recurrent issues with pinworms as a kid; I've tried the ""tape test"" and checking my stool several times but don't see anything moving) and/or rectal yeast infection (I'm not entirely sure this is even a thing, but I've been struggling with chronic vaginal ""yeast infections""  the doctors swear that's what's going on and then the culture comes back negative  so I want to make sure that's not somehow connected. Anything else? Doubting the upper endoscopy results after-the-fact was bad enough  I do NOT want to have the same worries about this colonoscopy and perhaps have to have it repeated down the road/if I get into Mayo/upon a second opinion). 3. I realize my ignorance is showing, but is there anything gynecological that the gastroenterologist could see/explore in a colonoscopy, and/or anything liver related? There've been a lot of weird vaginal exam findings  both my primary care and gynecologist were convinced I had a bad, acute yeast infection or (less likely) bacterial vaginosis, and I was started on Diflucan, but then the test results/cultures came back normal, and nobody's given me an alternate explanation other than ""practice good genital hygiene"", like no douching (never did), I've switched to cotton underwear, I take probiotics when on antibiotics (like I am presently), not sexually active, etc. Admittedly, I've never paid much attention to ""down there"", and am embarrassingly clueless about what everything is, but from my best understanding of some research (it's actually rather hard to find clear/understandable information on female anatomy that you can match to your own body), I think I have a polyp just inside my vaginal opening. I'm assuming the gastroenterologist can't, and I probably don't want, him taking a peek down there while I'm out and taking any samples or something, but assuming that's true, is there anything he WOULD be able to see/look for that could indicate a gynecological issue (other than the obvious like a prolapse or fistula or something)? The liver is another thing that keeps coming up with abnormalities; there was a 7x7mm cavernous hemangioma identified and removed from my liver during my gallbladder/appendix removal surgery in 2016, and the biopsy report showed ""mixed inflammation of the portal tracts, which is mild to moderate, and contains neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes, predominantly. Foamy histiocytes are also seen in association with the portal tract."" I haven't had much luck searching what that means  my infectious disease specialist didn't think it was normal  and I don't know for sure that it couldn't all have been from the gallstones that precipitated the surgery, but it's another question. My most recent MRI/ultrasound shows a new lesion, 42.7cm focal nodular hyperplasia (benign, but again, I'm 30 years old and not sure why I'm sprouting liver lesions right and left), and one of my abnormal blood results was an elevated LD5, ""seen with striated muscle lesions (eg, trauma) and with liver diseases (eg, hepatic congestion, congestive heart failure, hepatitis, cirrhosis, alcoholism)""  and not an alcoholic, FYI, and hepatitis blood work all came back negative and cardiologist said everything was fine there. But again, if there's anything I can ask him to check out/look for liver-wise, I think it might be a good idea. Ugh, I always start off intending to write a short, succint post since I know these long honking things scare people off and probably decrease my chances of getting help, but it never seems to work out because there's so many variables or possible avenues to mention, and I don't want to leave out the one little detail that might inspire a lightbulb moment. If you're still reading this, or did a skim the top and bottom, any advice on how to make sure I'm making the most out of this colonoscopy would be greatly appreciated. Advice on how to make this as painless as possible wouldn't be amiss either.  Thanks in advance! *My main issue was, I asked his office about stopping Pantoprazole (a Proton Pump Inhibitor) prior to the upper endoscopy and was told no need to discontinue. After the procedure, I asked if that PPI use could prompt a false negative biopsy result  again, was told no; however, all the peer reviewed articles I've read since say in fact it very often does affect the histopathology biopsy (it inhibits the bacteria growth, though you still have it), and should be stopped at least two weeks prior.

So, I need to make sure I'm well educated and know exactly what to ask for and how to prepare. Particularly: 1. Are there any medications that need to be stopped/could affect any potential biopsies taken or testing done (Protonix/pantoprazole, a PPI, especially comes to mind, as well as the antibiotic Doxycycline, and maybe the probiotic)? 2. Is there anything in particular I should ask be done/tested for? I read @tdrell 's note to request biopsies be read by a gastric pathologist (how exactly would you do that?

Doubting the upper endoscopy results after-the-fact was bad enough  I do NOT want to have the same worries about this colonoscopy and perhaps have to have it repeated down the road/if I get into Mayo/upon a second opinion). 3. I realize my ignorance is showing, but is there anything gynecological that the gastroenterologist could see/explore in a colonoscopy, and/or anything liver related? There've been a lot of weird vaginal exam findings  both my primary care and gynecologist were convinced I had a bad, acute yeast infection or (less likely) bacterial vaginosis, and I was started on Diflucan, but then the test results/cultures came back normal, and nobody's given me an alternate explanation other than ""practice good genital hygiene"", like no douching (never did), I've switched to cotton underwear, I take probiotics when on antibiotics (like I am presently), not sexually active, etc. Admittedly, I've never paid much attention to ""down there"", and am embarrassingly clueless about what everything is, but from my best understanding of some research (it's actually rather hard to find clear/understandable information on female anatomy that you can match to your own body), I think I have a polyp just inside my vaginal opening. I'm assuming the gastroenterologist can't, and I probably don't want, him taking a peek down there while I'm out and taking any samples or something, but assuming that's true, is there anything he WOULD be able to see/look for that could indicate a gynecological issue (other than the obvious like a prolapse or fistula or something)? The liver is another thing that keeps coming up with abnormalities; there was a 7x7mm cavernous hemangioma identified and removed from my liver during my gallbladder/appendix removal surgery in 2016, and the biopsy report showed ""mixed inflammation of the portal tracts, which is mild to moderate, and contains neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes, predominantly.

But again, if there's anything I can ask him to check out/look for liver-wise, I think it might be a good idea. Ugh, I always start off intending to write a short, succint post since I know these long honking things scare people off and probably decrease my chances of getting help, but it never seems to work out because there's so many variables or possible avenues to mention, and I don't want to leave out the one little detail that might inspire a lightbulb moment.

Thanks in advance! *My main issue was, I asked his office about stopping Pantoprazole (a Proton Pump Inhibitor) prior to the upper endoscopy and was told no need to discontinue.

If you're still reading this, or did a skim the top and bottom, any advice on how to make sure I'm making the most out of this colonoscopy would be greatly appreciated. Advice on how to make this as painless as possible wouldn't be amiss either.  Thanks in advance! *My main issue was, I asked his office about stopping Pantoprazole (a Proton Pump Inhibitor) prior to the upper endoscopy and was told no need to discontinue. After the procedure, I asked if that PPI use could prompt a false negative biopsy result  again, was told no; however, all the peer reviewed articles I've read since say in fact it very often does affect the histopathology biopsy (it inhibits the bacteria growth, though you still have it), and should be stopped at least two weeks prior. Also, all the biopsy samples were taken from stomach body, when the evident inflammation was noted in the gastric antrum (and again, research and procedural guidelines seem to instruct taking biopsy samples from both sites). Lastly, the biopsy samples were sent to the pathologist labeled ""rule out H. pylori""  that sounds like it means no other pathology was studied, which seems like a huge waste. On a less technical side, I've also been very frustrated with his lack of communication with me  right after the endoscopy, he had said I had ""watermelon stomach"" inflammation very common with H. pylori, but it could also be bile reflux, especially since my gallbladder was removed in 2016; then after the H. pylori biopsy came back negative, and I tried multiple times through his staff to set up an appointment to ask about the PPI use and how we explore bile reflux, and he left a message (I was, ironically, in the bathroom at the time) that ""gastritis can be caused by anxiety and stress."" That is very true, and I'm not saying that can't be the cause, but I just want to know why the other possible causes he mentioned are suddenly ruled out and the diagnosis is ""anxiety"". For all these reasons, I'm not thrilled that he'll be doing the colonoscopy, but I feel stuck at this point. Liked by Teresa, Volunteer Mentor, Jackie, Alumna Mentor, eliana5 Follow Report"

It started out once a day every other week or so. I'm now up to several minutes just about every day. I've had bouts of diarrhea here and there but it's been pretty much all the time since August 27th (when I'm leaving home and taking Imodium I'm okay for maybe 24 hours) with pain in my left lower abdomen that is more and more frequent. Norway has socialized medicine so I'm spending more and more money out of pocket trying to figure out what is going on. I had a colonoscopy last week and the results were diverticular disease (doctor said there were more pockets then he had previously seen). Since I'm paying out of pocket for just about every test, I tell the doctor what I would like for him to do and he says okay. Other things  my white count, red count, hemoglobin, Hemocrit, Alkaline Phosphatase, Globulin, MCHC, Abs Lymphocytes were low in August and now my T3 is low as well.

Im suffering from chronic lower left abdominal pain and with no exaggeration Im pushing something which feels like a squishy lump back into my abdominal wall at least 10-15 times a day. Sometimes, I cant get this lump to get back in and its stuck and it causes the most excruciating pain (worse than childbirth) that has on occasion caused me to pass out. My daughter has had to call the Medic to get me to the hospital on several occasions, Ive suffered through the pain at home more times than I can count. These attacks as I call them typically last 2 hours or so. Here is the problem with my diagnosis, by the time I get to the emergency department and Im seen by the Doctor and they do the CT scans and Ive had many, the lump decides to unstick itself for lack of better terms and my pain immediately goes away and my CT scans, X-rays, ultrasounds always come back normal. Ive had a colonoscopy, nothing found. Ive been to GI doctors that just keep telling me that the CT scans are clear, ok so what is this small lump, mass or whatever you want to call it that I keep pushing back in? They dismiss it. Ive been given every diagnosis under the sun but Im still suffering. I think I have a hernia that becomes incarcerated or strangulated and causes these intense attacks. Im just at my wits end.

My husband for the past 2 years has lost 20lbs. He has always had a good metabolism and has always been on the ""fit"" low body fat side. The past 3-4 years he was diagnosed with diabetics type 2; AC1 6.6, but with diet he has been able to control the blood glucose levels and has lowered his A1C to 6.3. His weight in 2016 was 140lbs and he maintained this weight for a long time, but then in the last 2 years he started losing weight and down to 120lbs. His stools are always lighter in color as in lack of bile. Also in the last two years, his increase in bowel movements has gradually increased and more recently in the last 6 months he is experiencing loose stools. More recently in the past 3 months he has oily stools, but not foul smelling and very frequent. His recent fecal tests have shown severe endocrine pancreatic insufficiency and he is scheduled for a CT scan next week. He is not on any medications, feels great, and has no pain. He is going to start taking Creon too. My question is will the Creon help with weight gain and/or are there any other suggestions for weight gain? Since currently this is his biggest issue and he is at a low body weight. We are monitoring his vitamin levels and everything in his blood labs are relatively normal. I am just surprised Dr. is not recommending a specific diet and/or ways to gain the weight. I know we are still in the process of diagnosing exactly what is going on, but I wanted to know if anyone has similar experiences and can give me input on things I can do to get him on the right track fast.

Ive never had this problem and could always pretty much eat what I wanted without any ill effect. Now if I accidentally eat even the smallest amount of gluten or anything with dairy I am sick for 2 to 5 days and I feel totally exhausted the entire time. First starts belching, then painful bloating and cramping and I become constipated. My upper abdomen hurts as if I had been hit with something hard, my gut feels raw inside and often unremitting nausea also sometimes happens. Once the bloating calms back down, out of the blue I experience urgent diarrhea that can come even if I eat even a few bites of approved food. (Ive been on FODMAP since Feb). My appetite has gone away and Ive lost 19 lbs since I started eliminating foods on the list. The diarrhea can last the entire day and by the time it stops my body is weak, im very tired and my abdomen feels tender for the next few days. Ive become hesitant to eat, although Im falling woefully short of calories nearly every single day. Food has lost its appeal to me and feels more trouble than its worth. My social life has been totally impacted by these problems and I pass up on fun activities that have been a part of my life forever. Going out to a restaurant is mostly a nightmare now. My GI dr prescribed Bentyl and Omeprozole, which didnt help much, and basically sent me on my way telling me that I need to work on reducing my stress levels. I have dealt with major depression and an anxiety disorder for going on 25 years, which is currently well managed with the exception of the anxiety that being this ill can trigger. Im getting acupuncture twice a week and that does seem to help. The D.O. that is doing this for me also has me on a regime of Digestive Enzymes. Hes also given me a recipe for a gut healing smoothie that contains several holistic ingredients, including probiotics with acidophilus/bifidus. Im currently waiting for these things to come in the mail so I cant speak to its effectiveness yet. At this point Im willing to try just about anything to get my life back. I feel that I am constantly complaining to my friends and family when they ask how things are going, The only thing that I can point to as what brought this all on, although my GI dr wouldnt agree, is that I had two colonoscopies within 6 months (March and August of last year) as a result of numerous polyps, one of which was difficult to fully remove in one session. None were cancerous but all were of the type that will eventually turn into cancer. Because of this she now wants to start doing colonoscopies every 3 years, which I totally dread just it case it triggers my IBS to become worse. If its not related to those procedures and their prep, can and did your IBS just come on suddenly with no warning and nothing particularly prompting it? Do you feel, or have you been told that this illness will be something that you have to live around forever? Have you ever heard of it going into remission and/or going away entirely? Ive done a lot of reading on this subject but really need to hear from those of you who understand and can relate to what I am talking about. I feel alone in this and am afraid that this is my new normal. Thank you for reading this and for hopefully sharing a bit about your experience with IBS. Liked by JK, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

Stood up. Got this pulled muscle sensation in my back around my bra strap area. I then proceeded to have chest pain, shortness of breath, flushed, sensation of hot liquid seeping out into my chest, dizziness, and numb and tingly all over my body. I felt like I was gonna pass out or die. I was rushed to the ER. After several tests, and an overnight stay, they discharged me the next day with Synthroid (thyroid just a tad low) and Flexeril for my back pain. I still had the shortness of breath. But they assured me my heart and lungs were fine. Did not do any x-rays or anything for my back. The next day I was pretty much laid out at home due to the flexeril. The following day, I decided to go back to work. Got up, took a shower, then I started having all the same symptoms as before. I had my son take me to the ER again. They did several tests, said my heart and lungs were fine. The doctor diagnosed me with GERD, and sent me home with Prilosec. I took Prilosec for 4 days, then my PCP had me try Protonix, which by the way, both of these gave me horrible side effects (confusion, delirium-hallucinations) and were not helping my stomach pain and nausea. So, she started me on Zantac, which worked wonders the first couple of days, but seems to have worn off now too. Also, after numerous testing, doctor said my Vitamin D was low, was 11, and should be between 30-80. So I started taking Vitamin D3400 units. 2 weeks later, I have been to the ER three times, had an endoscopy just yesterday (doctor said everything looked fine, but sending off stomach sample for biopsy). Still taking Zantac, and Vitamin D. Trying to eat more foods rich in Vitamin D and calcium. I continue to have nausea, stomach pains, body very weak, losing weight, diarrhea, dizziness, flushed and feel like passing out. I cant sleep, and feel very dehydrated. Every morning I feel like Im dying with these symptoms. It feels as though it hurts from deep inside my muscles or bones, even my joints in my fingers and elbows hurt. Closer to noon, I feel a little better, try to eat a little something, then it starts all over around 9 or 10 in the evening, and keeping me up all night. I WAS TOTALLY FINE UNTIL 2 WEEKS AGO, THEN ALL THIS STARTED HAPPENING. CAN SOMEONE HELP ME PLEASE? I DONT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO. I FEEL LIKE IM JUST GONNA SHRIVEL UP AND DIE.

I have taken Miralax once a day for five days now but still have not passed a normal bowel movement, just smaller infrequent ones.

The pizza had a lot of raw dough in it. Im very bloated and nauseous a lot of the time. Also it causes other pains like arm pain and leg pain. Im not constipated per se, but my motility is awful now. I feel like I have no movement in my digestive system. My digestive system is full of stool also and never really empties, even though I have bowel movements. I have had many tests done (MRI to test for Crohns, colonoscopy, endoscopy, and most recently a gastric emptying study) all with normal results. I believe I have raw dough stuck in my stomach and/or yeast causing a problem in my stomach. I have tried making myself throw up, but its hard to do and exhausting. I go back to my GI doctor on September 15. I think I may need to have my stomach pumped or have surgery of some kind, as I am not getting any better and it has been over four months. Please if you have some insight share it with me. Im not sure what to do and Im at the end of my rope. Thank you. Follow Report"

I was recently diagnosed with diverticulitis in August. Spent 3 days in the hospital, w/micro perforation put on liquid diet and IV antibiotics. Cleared up.. fast forward to January 2019 CT scan reveals I had MILD diverticulitis but no pain this time and only slight change in bowel habits. Back on low fiber and treated with usual cipro and flagyl. Now here we are March and follow up ct scan says diverticulitis again, But between January and March got C Diff along the way and then e coli while in Mexico. I demanded to be put on a different antibiotic so they gave me Amox/Clav but second culture still says I had c diff. Now I cannot tell if this is c diff or div. Doctor ordered me Deficid for the c diff since the amox/clav should handle the div. I am sure hoping that this is just the c diff and the deficid will take care of it! But at my wits end. Based on what i read and on this site and others I have spoken to, the diverticulitis seems to come back even after surgery. I am seeing a surgeon next week but am very reluctant to get a resection if it is not going really solve the problem. Also, has anyone else dealt with both c diff and div at the same time? This is completely nuts! any guidance or insight would be helpful since this is driving me insane. thank you all. fpats17 Follow Report"

I also quit smoking at the same time. 3 years ago today actually, I was hospitalized with extremely elevated liver enzymes, right side pain (which I still have).

I feel that I have done a pretty good job of being gluten free, but we do have regular bread and such in our home.

Since I have been gf for so long my Dr. is having me do a gluten challenge, where I eat 2-10 grams of gluten per day for 6 weeks at which time I will have blood work and an endoscopy. I've been eating gluten for over a week now (which is kind of fun, but also feels wrong) and the only difference I can tell is that I am constipated, which I have had problems with off and on. I feel more bloated, obviously, and feel even more exhausted than usual, plus a nagging headache. I apologize for the long story.

I was told I have a fatty liver and that something is wrong where the bile duct is. I am in constant pain on my right side and in my stomach. The pain goes right through to my back. I am not on any meds for pain. I have been taking Lanzaprazole? for my stomach, but it isn't doing anything for me, so I stopped it. I read on Web MD that it is a PPI and that these types of meds are not good for the liver. Is this true? Can anyone tell me what I should be doing for myself to help improve my fatty liver. I am overweight which I know is really bad and I take 3-6 Tyleonol #1 every day and have been for years. I believe that the Tylenol has damaged my liver. I am going to see a surgeon on May 10 to find out what she thinks about the ultrasound. I don't have much faith in my new Dr. in town and she wants me to go see this surgeon. I would very much appreciate any discussion anyone will have with me so has this same problem. Thanks so much. Loretta Liked by Teresa, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

It all started when I went to see my doctor about mucus in my throat that I couldn't seem to get rid of. I was told it was GERD and was immediately put on Omeprazole once per day. A few weeks later after not much relief I had a scope performed on my throat and stomach and everything came back normal, no ulcers, hernia, or damage to my throat. Before starting the Omeprazole I never had any burning pain in my chest, but now it seems like its very frequent and it still hasn't done much of anything for the mucus in my throat. I am young, fairly active, never smoked, not overweight, and don't drink any caffeine so being diagnosed with GERD doesn't really make sense to me. Now if I try to stop taking Omeprazole I have extremely bad burning in my chest that Zantac cant even help. I also occasionally wipe blood when pooping. I told my doctor but she said it could just be something to do with my acid levels Is there anything else that could be causing these GERD-like symptoms that I'm missing? Follow Report"

I must remind myself we all are of ""unknown"" reliability. However, here goes: It has been suggested I have gallbladder removal due to surprising symptoms (attack?) that started 5 months ago: tremendous tightness in upper right quadrant, no warnings, ""almost"" some shortness of breath and vague pressure traveling upward in back/chest/arms (hard to describe), brief cold sweat. Distressing but not SUPER painful. I have only had a few of these ""big"" episodes; maybe weekly I have a milder version of the above. Ultrasound showed gallstones. I AM ADAMANT about trying not to lose this organ. I just had 3 elective surgeries in 3 years  all successful (2 total knee replacements and 1 dental bridge). I have always been quite healthy and will go to extremes to avoid surgery. Sorry, I am leary of doctors. I am seeking a great gastroenterologist or alternative medicine Dr. as I am determined to not follow doctors' advice. I have read about gallstones that can cause fatal damage if they pass into pancreas, etc. But I am trying to figure out how to manage. Have discovered smaller meals seem to help, choosing proper foods for this condition, eating slower (I think). But, I still cannot predict when an attack will occur. I am fearful of infections because of my 2 knee replacements. I do not get infections actually; am quite healthy, very active physically, intellectually engaged in volunteer projects and teaching. So far I REFUSE TO CONSIDER SURGERY. Please do not stereotype me when I reveal chronological age (78 yr. old female). I consider myself more like 60-65. My attitude is one of shock and annoyance that this problem arose and that surgery has (possibly) been suggested. People say ""it is easy""; not a big deal. Shall I wait for more disturbing symptoms? See if I can handle this myself? Get multiple opinions? Thank you for your comments (I realize there is no definite answer.) Liked by Kanaaz Pereira, Connect Moderator Follow Report"

No reflux, bloating, gas, blood in stool, or abnormal BM though. Aug 2017 right testicle pain and conjunctivitis developed, white eye discharge, discharge in toilet. After many doctors, CT scans, ultrasound, bloodwork, STD tests, and rounds of antibiotics later, no diagnosis and very little relief. Nutritionalist ""said"" I have Candida overgrowth from spinal surgery in 2014, so I've been on a keto diet for 10 months, good probiotics, Lglutamine, and heavy oregano oil (1-2grams per day). While it seemed to improve with each step, my testicle still hurts daily, right kidney is screaming, guts leave me in fetal position often, and my heart palpates hourly (from low carbs I guess). I've seen family doc, GI doc, urologist 3+ times, and cardiologist over the past year  everyone says I'm perfectly healthy. The infectious disease doc wouldn't even see me because my records show I'm healthy, of which I am obviously not. I know candida takes time, and everyone promises I'm not dying, but it hurts something fierce. Help if you can. Follow Report"

This is her account so far: I had three courses of unavoidable antibiotics back in November 2016, and since then my digestive system has really been messed up. Ive been having lots of yogurt and took acidophilus for a while but after five months I still have very loose bowel movements or diarrhoea daily  only during the night and in the morning. I tried taking some other probiotics but gave up after a few days as they made it much worse. A nutritionist I saw said I should definitely not have probiotics or kefir or fermented vegetables at this stage as it would make it even worse, so I havent dared try. She also suggested I may have SIBO (small intestine bacterial overload), but the UK NHS seems very dismissive of this. Ive tried FODMAP with no success, I even had a colonoscopy in case it was bowel cancer. The specialist says it should sort itself out with time, but I see no sign of any improvement. Has anyone had any experience of this type of thing? Thanks so much for any replies. Follow Report"

Then when l tried to make an appointment they wouldnt schedule me an appointment because l owned them 62.00. And l really wasnt in to much of a rush since all my other hospital bills. So now l tried to make an appointment again since the Mayo Clinic was asking me about seeing a doctor at home. They called me and scheduled appointment then l got a call from the hospital saying my general practice doctor is referring me to the liver clinic.

172,C0019151,Hepatic Encephalopathy,"C0037088, C0030193","Signs and Symptoms, Pain",https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/hepatic-encephalopathy/,Hepatic encephalopathy,Yesterday l saw my neurologist at the Mayo Clinic she told me some good news that l dont have frontal dementia and l was suppose to see another neurologist and psychiatrist/ psychologist and l was able to cancel both appointments. But a vascular disease doctor l saw before her was talking about one of my stunts being wide but he didnt know how wide so l had to have a ct of my stomach and pelvis to see how wide and if they would have to do anything. So he put on my notes that he will have to talk to a gastenerologist for a second opinion. Well l thought that was great. Then l started itching this morning and l had to take a shower and put on my cream from the dermatologist. Then l looked up hepatic encephalopathy which l do have and it seemed like the neurologist sounded like she wasnt saying anything that seemed right to me. When l asked my husband he said she sounds like shes being careful what shes saying because l have been misdiagnosed a lot. When l was reading the stages it seems like l have symptoms of all 4 but she said that maybe sometimes your ammonia levels fluctuate. Which l can see that. Then my general practice doctor referred me to a liver clinic instead of a gastenerologist. And l was reading that when you have stunts you are suppose to be seen every month then 6 months and then if everything is alright maybe you can see the doctor every year just to make sure you have no problems with the stunts. After my shunt was put in l saw my gastenerologist once and then he said he was retiring and asked me which of his partners l wanted to see. I tried to make an appointment because he didnt say it was a rush he said l could see him next year. Then when l tried to make an appointment they wouldnt schedule me an appointment because l owned them 62.00. And l really wasnt in to much of a rush since all my other hospital bills. So now l tried to make an appointment again since the Mayo Clinic was asking me about seeing a doctor at home. They called me and scheduled appointment then l got a call from the hospital saying my general practice doctor is referring me to the liver clinic. So when l asked the question why l am not going to the gastroenterologist l cant get an answer that makes sense. But my ammonia levels are ok so l just dont understand doctors now a days.

I have put that off for almost a year because it seems radical, and from my research it is not always effective and varies from person to person. I was also seen by an ENT again who thought it might be from my salivary glands secreating too much saliva. He did a scope on me and they appear normal. He said they do not go inside them unless they suspect cancer. So I went on a medication to reduce the amount of saliva one secretes.

Now, I don't really have a choice, as I am suffering from chronic constipation. My surgeon gives me no recommendations, with the exception of more fiber, more water and to be more optimistic that it will improve. I get more depressed by the day, as this is coloring every aspect of my life. My surgeon told me having this surgery would ""give me my life back"". So far, it's taken all the joy from it.

Nexium only will help for better sleep nothing more. Walking for 1-2 hours makes me feel good but I cant do that because I am working/studying in office. I am really thinking for an operation because its very hard to run do gymnastic and affects also my sexual life. I thought if you do Linx operation you will have problem doing magnetic tomography in the future. Is it designed to stay forever or you remove it after treatment? Please give some advise before doing any step thank you! Follow Report"

Have had a recent colonoscopy everything ok there. Tested positive for SIBO, G I Doc put me on a couple rounds of antibiotic which did not help. I currently live in MS where the healthcare is atrocious! Can anyone help me back on the road to good health? My GI Doc tells me to take Gas-X 30 minutes before meals. I have been to a functional medicine doc, who put me on a bunch of expensive supplements that seemed to make things more uncomfortable. Have tried to stay away from the white flours and sugars, not perfect but am trying! I take a probiotic every am, but not certain if I have the right one for me?

Around late July, middle of night, I had discomfort around where gallbladder is located. The following week, the discomfort turned into minor but clearly noticeable pain and I thought my liver was failing. I also had multiple nauseas at that time. A week later, around 2 am, I had chest pain radiating from center of my chest, so I rushed to E.R. The E.R doctor told me my chest was fine after checking EKG and other things. He also told me my liver was fine after running blood test. He advise me to see my primary physician for getting ultra sound imaging for my gallbladder although the blood test did not show inflamed gallbladder issue. Few days after that, I went to see my physician, but he refused to get me ultra sound imaging for gallbladder because I had it last year and the test came out normal for both of my gallbladder and liver. I also finished Hep B vaccine January this year. He then had me do stool sample because I had H.pylori last year and treated for it but they never checked to see if I was clear of H.pylori after the treatment. The stool sample test returned and I was told that I was clear of H.pylori. Afterward, the physician had me to get multiple blood test but everything came out normal. He then referred me to gastroenterologist. After listening to me about pains and symptoms I was dealing with, the gastroenterologist diagnosed me with neuromuscular issue and told me all my digestive organs were fine. But he agreed to get me endoscopy and it turned out to be I have chronic gastritis. I began taking Omeprazole (a type of proton pump inhibitor) and I had been on it for 3 months. My chest pain is still there. The pain mostly occur around center but it moves to side to side or below or up. The pain feels like burning sensation mostly. Sometimes it feels like I have sore muscle or bruise on chest. I also have pain around right side abdominal area. Usually it feels like something is squeezing my gallbladder. I sometimes have very light electrical shooting pain or needle poking sensation. The abdominal pain mostly stays around gallbladder but it would move to appendix area time to time. What is interesting about my abdominal pain is that whenever I drive car, I could feel the pain is clearly noticeable in comparison to other occasion like walking or sitting. While taking the Omeprazole, for a short period, I had had headache, mind fog and sometimes fatigues. However, I no longer have those possible side effects. (according my research about proton pump inhibitor, the side effects extremely rare) Both abdominal and chest pain are less noticeable when I am walking or exercising or even focused on something seriously like studying. Everyday is different but typically, I feel much better in the morning, then it starts getting worse. My only clues about my symptoms are my diets, eating habit, and stress level. About 3 month prior to the symptoms occurred, I would daily eat heavy meal late night (10 pm) then go to bed right away. I used to be under extreme stress from work and school between April and May. In June, for the whole month, I used not eat anything until 1 pm and I often felt pain in my stomach. I used also drink several cans of coke in empty stomach I quit drinking alcohol 7 years ago and do not smoke Up until here, it was about my chest and abdominal pain. About my back pain, it constantly move arounds but pain near right shoulder blade side is always there. I do not remember if the right shoulder blade pain began after I went to the E.R or before because I have had my back pain for over 4 years. So, it is possible I already had the shoulder blade pain before. I have learned that troubles in gallbladder could cause pain in right shoulder blade and also chest pain. I know I have chronic gastritis but I am wondering if I also have issue in the gallbladder. Could they all (gastritis, gallbladder and back pain) be related? Anyone has idea what I should do next? I am planning to get ultra sound imaging in January to check my gallbladder. Follow Report"

I felt dizzy and l knew my ammonia levels were high. I always know when something is wrong. So l asked her would she order an ammonia test and she did. Now this was on Oct 30th. So my general practice doctor retired and l wrote him about when l went to the mayo clinic last year. I told him the doctor who saw me when he saw my levels from his visits. The doctor wasn't to concerned but he really was in question about the test. Were the accurate or not. I just found out that the lab system we use is outdated. So when my levels were in the 54- 63 range it wasn't accurate. It was higher. So now thank Gpd they changed it our new levels is anything over 72 is toxic. And now my last reading 73 so they said l was toxic but even though it shows that. My new general practice doctor wants to still say l have conversion disorder but now its conversion disorder with convulsion or seizure and then my old neurologist will say wi th H depression and anxiety. But no one wants to say that the liver procedure was done wrong and one shunt isn't going the way it should. I guess it's to obvious for negligence. Liked by Teresa, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

In the recent months, I've suffered a steep drop in quality of life, the likes of which I could have never conceived. I'm 22 years old (M). Other than being slightly underweight, I've [fortunately] never suffered with any health problems before. I have no known history of significant health issues in my family, other than my 20 year brother who has (manageable) UC. At the beginning of the summer, I went to a routine doctor visit for some blood work. Everything came back normal EXCEPT for my bilirubin levels which were high (2.3). The doctor suspected nothing serious, but he ordered me to get an ultrasound of my gallbladder to check for stones or inflammation. At this point I had no symptoms other than anxiety that there could be something seriously wrong with me. Less than a week later, when I laid down to get some shuteye after eating a heavy meal, I experienced a dull, intermittent burning pain just under the ribcage on my left side. My primary care doctor suspected an ulcer and prescribed 8 weeks PPI (omeprazole.) The pain continued despite medication as well as drastic diet and lifestyle change. It occurs for 1-2 hours after meals, and in the morning when I wake up. I began to panic so I requested more testing. A CT scan revealed nothing other than a small nonobstructive kidney stone. I eventually decided to go forward and see a GI doctor, who recommended an EGD. Here's where things start to get strange: The EGD revealed I have no ulcer, only gastritis caused by a pool of bile in the gastric body. I've exhaustively researched a possible reason for this, but found absolutely NOTHING that could lead to a conclusion. I've never had any surgery before, no history of digestive problems up until this point. After I got this EGD, I started to feel an occasional tenderness in my upper right abdomen (gallbladder area.) I also have unexplained inflammation of the sclera in both eyes, which I've read can be symptomatic of IBD, but I have no lower abdominal pain and my stool is unremarkable. In the past 5 months I've lost almost 20 pounds, (mostly due to a vegetarian diet and lack of appetite, I presume.) Last month I got an MRI of the liver, (with and without contrast) as well as blood tests to check for abnormalities in my liver enzymes. BOTH came back unremarkable. My GI doctor is now recommending a biopsy of the liver tissue to check for other possible problems that might have evaded detection.

By then I had developed sepsis and was dying. Very long story, including being unconscious for ten days, two-plus weeks in intensive care and 30 days total in hospital. Another 5 months sans esophagus, food and medicine via tubes, with bag for saliva on neck.etc., etc., finally ending with the colon interposition. Following the colon interposition, I was told that the severe pain that wrapped around my back, over my ribs and beneath my breasts would last anywhere from three to five years, maybe longer, maybe not so long. The pain on the right side subsided after five-plus years, the left side continues approximately seventy-eighty per cent of the time, especially at night, or when Ive done something wrong, or a bra hits the wrong spot. I use Lidoderm, Vicodin and Lyrica to address this pain. Lidoderm when I need relief very quickly, along with Vicodin (hydrocodone since Vicodin is impossible to find in the United States outside of hospitals). I take the Lyrica (3) at night and (1) in the morning. I also take Ambien and Trazadone for sleep. The Ambien and Trazadone were prescribed before the surgeries for longstanding sleep issues. It is more critical since the surgeries because if the pain is unbearable I can at least go to sleep to escape the pain and usually wake up free of pain in the am. The primary and very distressing side-effects of the colon interposition surgery are digestive. I have gas more often than I can begin to describe, but the worst is the diarrhea at night. I regularly wake up in a bed full of excrement. I dont wake up when its about to occur, nor when its occurring but, rather, when I wake up in the morning. Of course, it can be worse if I eat later, which I mostly avoid doing, though dinners out can present problems. Red wine may or may not be a causative factor. Certain foods are givens for creating problems and I always avoid them: spinach, cream-based dishes/sauces, mashed potatoes (butter, milk), some cheeses, not all, tomato sauces, lattes too late, potato chips before bed (grease?), but not earlier in the day, and others Im not thinking of at the moment. Meats are better tolerated than vegetables and fruits. Even with red wine. Sugar in candy, ie, jelly beans before bed, are a no no. Black licorice  late, but not during day. So. Primarily I need help with addressing the diarrhea issue. The pain in the ribs and around my back has been somewhat alleviated by exercises that stretch and expand my chest and strengthen my back and core. Exercise also strengthens me psychologically and emotionally. Periodically, the pain comes back with a vengeance and is breath-stopping. And even tear-producing. But nothing can compare with getting up day after day to clean up myself and my bed (sometimes my preparations just cannot anticipate the mess that can occur). It can take an hour or more and that doesnt include doing laundry. I may have to shower two-three times or use the bidet several times, change my clothes twice or more. Thank goodness I insisted on a bidet when we renovated our house eleven years ago. It is a lifesaver. The emotional, psychological and physical tolls this issue takes on me are huge, huge. My marriage has suffered overall, but in particular as a result of the diarrhea problem. Sex and intimacy are long gone. I cant deal with either. My husband complains mightily. It doesnt matter.

After an ultrasound and MRI and MRCI, the results are unclear. He doesnt have typical symptoms of pancreatitis (not sick, no vomiting, no fever) and there is no seen cause (gallbladder or trauma) for pancreatitis. Aside from occasional stomach pain, and fatigue, he is totally happy and healthy.We are supposed to wait and see and do a second MRI in 6 weeks.I am sacred this could be a tumor and that is what they are looking for in the MRI. Is there anything else this could be? Six weeks seems like an eternity and I am sick with worry trying to find any information.I read a few studies where pancreatitis was caused from celiac disease. Any help or similar stories that can lead my investigation to finding answers would be appreciated. I am a very scared mom right now. Follow Report"

Combine that with IBS and you're in real trouble. I'm trying to put weight on while the majority of people are trying to take it off. That of course brings it's own stress and as we all know that's the worst thing for any health issue. I am currently on a anti biotic and am being balanced off with a probiotic. Seems to be helping my stomach and the diarrhea associated with IBS. This is the first thing that has made me feel normal after seeing multiple gastroenterologists with no positive results. Is anyone familiar with Lypo Gold. It's an enzyme that is suppose to help aid with fat digestion. Just wondering what input anyone has on how it works and their results from taking it. Thank you.

So this was a little confusing to me since your doctor always says everything is fine. Oh and l forgot to say l had elevated liver 3 times. So l asked my new gp and he didn't want to see me the first appt so l had to come the next day. He said my chart was to detailed so he needed to read it further. Well this seemed silly since he knew about my appointment 1 weeks ago and you are picking up patients from the previous doctor. So now what l was saying l asked him l have a new diagnosis on my chart and it's a little confusing, l have on there cirrhosis of the liver. He tells me all the liver diagnoses are the same. Well first of all my first gastroenterologist told me after l had my biopsy l didn't have cirrhosis. The last year l went to the mayo clinic again no cirrhosis. Now when l see my hepatologist at home everything was fine after my routine follow up but no mention of cirrhosis but when l am falling and having elevated ammonia levels then l assume that's when it comes documentary on my chart. So l had to have appendix surgery and l thought well this is crazy a women of my age appendicitis. So l had the surgery and the surgeon tell me at follow up. The radiologist didn't agree with me you should have had the surgery because you had stool on your appendix but no was you wont have to have your appendix removed. But she said l know it should have been done. Again just a little confusing. Now this last hospital visit since l went to the other one l had a great experience it was the heart hospital. And l had to go there because a doctor at another er felt comfortable l hax a workup there because of my heart rate. She get as the golden star. So going to this hospital it's as professional as it can get especially where l live. So when l was transferring by emsa l asked the perimedic about all these diagnoses of my liver is it possible to be the same. I trusted him more that my doctors and he told no but l guess if there is something else going on it could. Well the question is what????. So the cardiologist at th he heart high hospital great doctor. He knew my problem or maybe you might say medical history. He tells me l am going to do a workup on you and you will know about your liver and heart. I will be looking at all the veins connected to these origins. Yeah l hit the lottery a doctor who has sense and put there patients before there payment. So he did th he test and he said my heart checked out and my liver enzymes were normal but keep you eeg appointment with your hepatologist at the mayo clinic.

He told me well l better get you out of the hospital so you can go to Minnesota. He asked me If l had to make my appointment when l got there. I told him no it's all setup. I know when my first appointment starts to last one for Monday. He was surprised about all of that. I told him l am going to see the same hepatologist l saw before that found the problem with my shunt just one.

I had successful sugery for colon cancer in 2008. About 6-months later I was hospitalized for 5 days with a bowel obstruction (that did resolve without further surgery). It took several months for my system to get back to proper working order, but it did and for the past 5-years everything worked normally. Then, out of the blue, I had another bowel obstruction 2-months ago. I was hospitalized for 6-days, but again, no surgery. At this point I can only have bowel movements by taking Miralax and then I have diarrhea. Im trying to eat a normal diet, just smaller amounts at a time and more frequently. Im paranoid about another bowel obstruction, and also that my guy will not get back to normal. Has anyone had experience with this? Follow Report"

I would like to lay flat one night and sleep more than 4 hours at 2 hour intervals. I have IBS with bile stools 5 minutes after eating or taking pills. Any suggestions?

My wife was diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos in 2015 and it has been a non-stop fight to limit the multi-directional instability from her EDS. For her EDS, she has a comprehensive pain management program that includes a small amount of opioids along with RFAs and physical therapy. Prior to the diagnosis, she had crippling stomach pains but this issue was resolved after her gallbladder was removed (2014). She has had zero problems associated with her stomach until the last few months. Her stomach pain has simply been unbearable. As such we went to the ER of a hospital in Louisiana widely regarded as the best health system in the state. To make a long story brief, after 35+ days and countless tests, the attending physicians and GI consults told us, ""we aren't equipped to handle your EDS so you need to find another place to go."" But they were able to give themselves their own peace of mind by sending us on our way with a ""best guess"" diagnosis of Narcotic Bowel Syndrome, which is directly contrary to the unremarkable small bowel follow-through and gastric emptying study. This hospital, like most, treated my wife like an opioid user rather than an EDS patient with a terrible stomach condition. After discharge and less than two days at home, her condition was rapidly deteriorating and I had no choice but to take her to another ER, this time, it was allegedly to the hospital with the best GI department in the state. They have done their own tests and have also told us, ""EDS is a really tough condition, we know you're in pain but we don't know what it is."" Now, they are also telling us that as soon as my wife can hold down liquids, even if she is in unbearable pain, she will be discharged tomorrow (even with a new C-Diff diagnosis). So, I say all of this to say that I am overwhelmed with the feeling of my wife being left for dead by the health system in our state. I am waiting on a decision from Mayo to see if we can be accepted for an appointment but I am unsure how I can get my wife through the next week, day, hour, or minus after she is discharged. I am considering making the 1,000 mile trip to Rochester to go to St. Mary's ER in the hopes that my wife can get the care she needs, knowing full well that the ideal thing for me to do from the hospital's perspective would be to wait for my appointment.

Between then and now Ive had 3 moves, one about 4 hours from where Id lived for 30 years, a TKR and also a revision, am on several psychotropic medications for cyclothymia, and just feel awful. Well, Im 73 and have had my teeth removed in order to get dentures . theres been quite a harang with this and its been over a year since Ive been eating soft and pureed foods . cream of wheat, soups (pureed), pureed spaghetti, if I do eat a piece of fruit it has to be pureed, but I try not to. Its been a long haul. Well, now Im packing to move to a low-income apartment closer to my girls, and the IBS has become the diahrrhea form .. OMG, its awful. Im afraid to go out. I dont know what to do anymore. Im new down here and only have an Internist, but with moving that will have to change. I need the name of a good gastro-enterologist at the hospital I will be using. In the meantime, does anyone have any suggestions for me? Im forced to use pads right now just in case .. I know this is anxiety and tension, but its got to stop. Thanks much, abby Follow Report"

On memorial day I went to a outdoor picnic and stayed in the shade for 2 hours then went home, I had a very bad headache with sharp eye pains. The next day I woke up with achy joints and muscles, then had bad stomach pains with diarrhearight after that these red dots appeared near all my joints, both wrist joints, elbow joints and ankle jointsIve never had this happen before, the red dots got a little bigger and swelled up a little under the skin and now their round red bumps. I did go to the ER for the level 9 pain in my stomach and the terrible joint pains. Today I woke up and still had the achy joints and muscles and exhaustion. I took 2 tramadol for pain and that just take the edge off it. I get tired of going to the ER for severe pain and I thought having my gallbladder out would take care of itand it was covered in adhesions. All tests for kidney, liver, heart was ok in the ER, dr there says if pains are related to MCTD I would have to see my reg. dr for more testing. I dont think my reg. Dr knows what to do, his clinic is the one who sent me to the ER the other day. Im considering going to Mayo clinic in Rochester to see if they can help me figure out what I need to do to stop flare ups, or even control this MCTD from progressing. Does anyone else have Thyroid nodules or even these weird red spots near their joints too?? Liked by Anonymous Follow Report"

Now it feels as if the doctors are ordering tests to look for things that the doctors can even explain to us how they would cause his symptoms, so I am hoping to get more guidance in my research of what to ask next. Here is what is going on My husband had an routine endoscopy (and stomach biopsy) in early November due to heart burn and burping which had increased over the last two years. The doctors found a 2cm hiatle hernia and no other significant findings. He began taking Prilosec (he routinely takes a baby aspirin and is on no other medications) as recommended by the doctor just after his endoscopy (he was prescribed to take it for 8 weeks but was told to stay on it for 3 1/2 months since he began to have to take NSAIDs for the pain post endoscopy  he is now off the Prilosec). 2 days later he had significant pain/pressure in his rib cage which became intense within a week after the endoscopy. The pain moved around depending on what side he was laying on, what time of day, and was accompanied by shortness of breath and nausea. We have kept a detailed journal of this and have NOT seen any correlation with his symptoms and eating, BUT he begins to burp frequently when he is feeling bad and has bad breath. He also has light colored stools, and extreme itchyness in his lower legs (from the knees to the ankles)  neither of which are normal for him. His pain symptoms seem to come in waves and are frequently accompanied by shortness of breath and high blood pressure. He has not been able to be active since this has happened as if he even walks a short distance it (most of the time) increases his symptoms significantly. So back to the week after his endoscopy We returned to the doctor and they did chest X-rays (no findings) and told him maybe it was arthritis (which has never made any sense to us). Two days later it was bad enough that we went to the urgent care and he had blood work and an EKG and another set of chest X-rays (slight low voltage on the ekg, no findings on the chest X-ray, high WBC 13 k/ul and high neutrophils 9.9 k/ul and high monocytes .9 k/ul and low lipase 10 u/l  all other tests came back in normal range). We were again told it was probably just arthritis. His symptoms continued and we returned to the doctor. In December his had another slightly low voltage ekg, WBC and neutrophils were both back down in normal range, and his CRP (26 mg/l) and ERS (30 mm/h) were both tested for the first time and high. He had an abdominal CT and there was a small pulmonary node and a small thyroid node (we were told both were not significant) and they said he looked constipated. The doctors sent him to a physical therapist in December and he continued through January  no results. In January he had another set of blood work  high CRP (27 mg/l) high ERS (26 mm/h) and high neutrophils (7.5 k/ul), and an echocardiogram (we were told there were no significant findings and his heart looked great). In February he again had blood work  high CRP (22 mg/l) high ERS (26 mm/h) high cyclic citrullinated peptide AB (34 u/ml) and negative rheumatoid factor (WBC was not tested in Feb). He also had a low CK test but that makes some sense after 4 months of very little activity for a normally active guy. At this point his symptoms are still coming in waves and not improving. He eats a very healthy diet (mostly whole non-processed ingredients, mostly plant based with some chicken). Before this he was a very active guy, who spent most of the last year diving, swimming, and hiking everyday (we are biologist and are jobs keep him very active) but since this has been in such excruciating pain when a wave comes that he has been unable to work or participate in any of his normally fun (or even not fun) activities.

Now it feels as if the doctors are ordering tests to look for things that the doctors can even explain to us how they would cause his symptoms, so I am hoping to get more guidance in my research of what to ask next. Here is what is going on My husband had an routine endoscopy (and stomach biopsy) in early November due to heart burn and burping which had increased over the last two years. The doctors found a 2cm hiatle hernia and no other significant findings. He began taking Prilosec (he routinely takes a baby aspirin and is on no other medications) as recommended by the doctor just after his endoscopy (he was prescribed to take it for 8 weeks but was told to stay on it for 3 1/2 months since he began to have to take NSAIDs for the pain post endoscopy  he is now off the Prilosec). 2 days later he had significant pain/pressure in his rib cage which became intense within a week after the endoscopy. The pain moved around depending on what side he was laying on, what time of day, and was accompanied by shortness of breath and nausea. We have kept a detailed journal of this and have NOT seen any correlation with his symptoms and eating, BUT he begins to burp frequently when he is feeling bad and has bad breath. He also has light colored stools, and extreme itchyness in his lower legs (from the knees to the ankles)  neither of which are normal for him. His pain symptoms seem to come in waves and are frequently accompanied by shortness of breath and high blood pressure. He has not been able to be active since this has happened as if he even walks a short distance it (most of the time) increases his symptoms significantly. So back to the week after his endoscopy We returned to the doctor and they did chest X-rays (no findings) and told him maybe it was arthritis (which has never made any sense to us). Two days later it was bad enough that we went to the urgent care and he had blood work and an EKG and another set of chest X-rays (slight low voltage on the ekg, no findings on the chest X-ray, high WBC 13 k/ul and high neutrophils 9.9 k/ul and high monocytes .9 k/ul and low lipase 10 u/l  all other tests came back in normal range). We were again told it was probably just arthritis. His symptoms continued and we returned to the doctor. In December his had another slightly low voltage ekg, WBC and neutrophils were both back down in normal range, and his CRP (26 mg/l) and ERS (30 mm/h) were both tested for the first time and high. He had an abdominal CT and there was a small pulmonary node and a small thyroid node (we were told both were not significant) and they said he looked constipated. The doctors sent him to a physical therapist in December and he continued through January  no results. In January he had another set of blood work  high CRP (27 mg/l) high ERS (26 mm/h) and high neutrophils (7.5 k/ul), and an echocardiogram (we were told there were no significant findings and his heart looked great). In February he again had blood work  high CRP (22 mg/l) high ERS (26 mm/h) high cyclic citrullinated peptide AB (34 u/ml) and negative rheumatoid factor (WBC was not tested in Feb). He also had a low CK test but that makes some sense after 4 months of very little activity for a normally active guy. At this point his symptoms are still coming in waves and not improving. He eats a very healthy diet (mostly whole non-processed ingredients, mostly plant based with some chicken). Before this he was a very active guy, who spent most of the last year diving, swimming, and hiking everyday (we are biologist and are jobs keep him very active) but since this has been in such excruciating pain when a wave comes that he has been unable to work or participate in any of his normally fun (or even not fun) activities. He has seen GI specialists, cardiologist, rheumatologist, internal medicine specialist, and a physical therapist. He normally docent go to the doctor and in the past I have been blown away by his pain threshold, but myself and everyone else in the family have never seen him in so much pain as this.

PPIs do not seem to help so we suspect pepsin rather than acid. The severity of symptoms changes over time with throat experiences occuring roughly as follows: No problem (10%) Cold feeling like finishing a breath mint (30%) Like a mild burn from food + tightness (40%) Moderate to intense pain/redness (20%) By now, the odds of resolving this seem remote. My doctor talked about me entering another phase which feels like it will get worse. My questions: 1. Does anyone have any feedback/experience about the potential impact of this type of continual inflammation leading to severe problems including cancer? Is it possible that just learning to live with this is an option that will not end with something awful? 2. Does anyone have any experience/feedback on surgery options besides classic Nissen fundoplication? I have read about Linx (magnetic ring) and partial (270 degree) fundoplication.

I now have almost a ring around my lower abdomen of fat or bloat. It is very noticeable. I follow a strict, non-inflammatory diet and I exercise several times a week. Is this belly bloat a side effect of extreme starvation? What are some ways to help my system get back on track?

Doctors helped me tremendously: Powerful herbs cleared up inflamed and toxic feelings, kidneys improved keeping salt in my system, digestion/constipation improved with adominal pumping, deep breathing, yoga exercises, only eating 3x a day, adding foods like rhubarb and cactus, avoiding stress and taking time to be easy and digest slow and relax after eating (I cant eat around stressful people or places) I improved and was having daily bowel movement then bam went down with abnormal severe weakness.

Worst I felt was hard to describe but like my organs were fighting for strength and blood flow. Bowel movements stopped. Infection of the gut caused by stress and leaky gut????? PCP ordered blood tests, CT scan, 24 hr urine test and chest X-ray. All good results. Gastroenterolgist ordered abdomen sonogram: normal. EGD upper scope: Gastroparesis I am strictly avoiding dairy, gluten, spicy food, alcohol, coffee, fruit juices, tap water. (still trying to understand gluten so avoiding all grains including oats until I figure out the rules) any help here? Eating balanced diet of veggies, meat, beef bone broth, fish, white rice, fruits and only drinking purified water or coconut water. Only doing passive yoga stretches, slow walks and resting until I get better. I used to be so active and hope to be able to run and bike and exercise again. Digestion has improved slowly and I dont feel as scary weak but my body needs a lot of rest. I can only walk a short while and bowel movements have not been easy. I get urge to go but then it feels like my guts are so tight and weak they wont push out waste. Any advice to heal gut? Liked by John, Volunteer Mentor, Johnny V Follow Report"

He told me your levels are normal. I can tell by looking and hearing you. Your not confused and your not jaundice but l told him l am bloated and gaining weight. Which l know could be ascites.

No w l dont know the difference? Since when l went to my previous gasterentogist did everything in the begin. Is the hepatologist to continue to follow up with you in case it runs in to more complications with TIP procedure since it was done incorrectly. Does anyone know?

I was put on Dexilant and noticed the pain dissipate almost immediately only problem was I couldnt tolerate the medication. I was then put on Tecta and referred to a G. I. My general Practitioner did some blood work for h pylori and I tested positive. I started to develop tinitus in my left ear. I had a gastroscopy where they found a 2 cm Hiatel Hernial and my lower sphincter was weak. Thats when I was told I have a mild case of gerd, but I dont suffer from any heart burn. I was put on triple dose of antibiotics for h pylori and continued with the Tecta, domperadone and sucrolafate.

After a setback with UC, I am now on Humira, Uceris, still on Lialda and Canasa, along with trying different probiotics and glutamine.

She has started complaining about having a bubble feeling in her throat. She says sometimes it is big and sometimes it is not. She does not want to eat because when she does she feels nauseas. When she gets nauseas she gets the chills really bad and begins to shake, have diarrhea. This has been going on since the beginning of March. She is not getting good sleep because this bubble wakes her up, she has dark circles around her eyes, and she is constantly tired. We have brought her to out pediatrician, they did an x-ray which she thought looked normal, bloodwork which was fine and autoimmune tests (celiac) which was negative. They put her on antacids and said it must be acid reflux, but the medication has not helped and the bubble in constantly there and my poor daughter is not herself and completely run down. I also worry because she has been sick since the end of December every two weeks with some sort of illness. The end of December she had 103 temperature and was having labored breathing, headache and cough at times  they said it was croup. She seemed to get bette than two weeks later had bad headaches, tired constantly, had stuffed up nose, hard to breathe they said they could test her for pneumonia but when listening to her chest she sounded ok. She got better for a couple weeks than end of January she had bad headaches, congested, body aches and tired all the time. They said it was a sinus infection.

I was lucky that the symptoms were mild for several years andt did not need strong drug intervention until about 3 years ago. My doctor put me on Budesonide 9mg/day. The drug worked really well but each time we tried to lower the dose in attempt to tapper it off the symptoms come back.. So I become what you call a steroid dependent. So I had to switch to a new doctor since my doctor moved out of the area. The new doctor suggested to switch to Imuran. I started reading about Imuran and got really terrified of the potential side effects. I have to questions: 1) has any one been on Budesonide for longer than 3 years, any problems ? 2) The same for Imuran, is it helpful, any side effects and how long can you take it for ?

I had a barium swallow test, and was told that the muscle rings that are supposed to work in sequence, are moving at random. Things like bread are the worst, and often even liquids get stopped part of the way down, and I cough a lot with liquids. I dont have chest pain, that is often connected with dysphagia. Im always the last one to finish eating. It helps to have bread toasted. The doctor who told me what he saw in the barium test didnt tell me anything except the random contractions.

He does not fit the profile. He is being scheduled for a liver biopsy to stage his liver. Anyone have any words of wisdom or advice?

Symptoms started in Aug 2015, working at a zoo. Previously he never had any stomach issues, not even the stomach flu as a kid. Started having severe diarrhea & a lot pain for a day (5-25 times in a 12 hour period) this would happen 1 month. Sometimes vomiting would occur. Then he would go back to normal for the rest of the time. All labs and stool samples came back normal. They decided to treat him for a parasite because of symptoms and that he was working at the zoo when symptoms began. He was treated with Albendazole and Flagy and for almost 2 months was symptom free with normal bowel movements. Then symptoms reoccured, he had a couple times with blood and mucus. Had a CT scan that showed thickening of the ileum and mesenteric adenitis. EGD and Colonoscopy that was normal, except for his disaccharidase levels being low- the GI doc we were seeing didnt really think this was a big deal. His symptoms continued to get worse and became daily. Pain increased and he would sit on the toilet with just globs of mucus coming out. They tried some antispasm medication that did nothing. They scoped him again, the GI doctor said that the clean out wasnt ideal on the first one. This time he had 11 ulcers- 9 in his colon and 2 in his stomach, also they saw patches of inflammation. They put him on prednisone for a 6 week run including the taper. The biopies came back as normal, except again the dissacharidase being low . The GI group we were at told us that he had a Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis. After about a week on the predisone, he started doing really good and became basically symptom free. We ended up getting a second opinion as we felt that we werent getting anywhere. This doctor had us taper more quickly off of the predinsone because she reviewed the Eosinophilic levels and they were actually normal. Once he had to taper off the predisone, symptoms came back. My sons symptom have become spending most of the day in the bathroom pooping soft serve, lots of mucus- sometimes it is bloody. He has had a couple times of blood in his stool throughout all of this. They did a pill cam, which showed nothing. He was scoped for a 3rd time by our new GI doc and she found inflammation in the duodenum, where the disaccharidase enzymes are, his disaccharidase levels are now extremely low. His lactase is now zero, all of the other ones are very low as well. He felt really good for a couple of days after this scope, we dont know if it was from his system being cleaned out & he was also given Decadron during the procedure. This doctor is finally taking these disaccharidase levels seriously and obviously it is causing a lot of his symptoms since he can not properly digest any sugars or carbohydrates. They are trying to figure out what the cause of this damage to the duodenom and the dissacharidase deficiency. Our doctor says it is most likely from an infection (bacteria or parasite probably from the zoo) or an atypical presentation of Crohns. He seems to really respond to anti inflammatories.

Symptoms started in Aug 2015, working at a zoo. Previously he never had any stomach issues, not even the stomach flu as a kid. Started having severe diarrhea & a lot pain for a day (5-25 times in a 12 hour period) this would happen 1 month. Sometimes vomiting would occur. Then he would go back to normal for the rest of the time. All labs and stool samples came back normal. They decided to treat him for a parasite because of symptoms and that he was working at the zoo when symptoms began. He was treated with Albendazole and Flagy and for almost 2 months was symptom free with normal bowel movements. Then symptoms reoccured, he had a couple times with blood and mucus. Had a CT scan that showed thickening of the ileum and mesenteric adenitis. EGD and Colonoscopy that was normal, except for his disaccharidase levels being low- the GI doc we were seeing didnt really think this was a big deal. His symptoms continued to get worse and became daily. Pain increased and he would sit on the toilet with just globs of mucus coming out. They tried some antispasm medication that did nothing. They scoped him again, the GI doctor said that the clean out wasnt ideal on the first one. This time he had 11 ulcers- 9 in his colon and 2 in his stomach, also they saw patches of inflammation. They put him on prednisone for a 6 week run including the taper. The biopies came back as normal, except again the dissacharidase being low . The GI group we were at told us that he had a Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis. After about a week on the predisone, he started doing really good and became basically symptom free. We ended up getting a second opinion as we felt that we werent getting anywhere. This doctor had us taper more quickly off of the predinsone because she reviewed the Eosinophilic levels and they were actually normal. Once he had to taper off the predisone, symptoms came back. My sons symptom have become spending most of the day in the bathroom pooping soft serve, lots of mucus- sometimes it is bloody. He has had a couple times of blood in his stool throughout all of this. They did a pill cam, which showed nothing. He was scoped for a 3rd time by our new GI doc and she found inflammation in the duodenum, where the disaccharidase enzymes are, his disaccharidase levels are now extremely low. His lactase is now zero, all of the other ones are very low as well. He felt really good for a couple of days after this scope, we dont know if it was from his system being cleaned out & he was also given Decadron during the procedure. This doctor is finally taking these disaccharidase levels seriously and obviously it is causing a lot of his symptoms since he can not properly digest any sugars or carbohydrates. They are trying to figure out what the cause of this damage to the duodenom and the dissacharidase deficiency. Our doctor says it is most likely from an infection (bacteria or parasite probably from the zoo) or an atypical presentation of Crohns. He seems to really respond to anti inflammatories.

The diseased was fairly mild until about 3 years ago where I started having serious flares.. My doctor put me on Entocort (Budisonide) 9mg/day. The drug kept my symptoms under control but each time I tried to taper off the drug the symptoms would come back. I have been on the drug for about 3 years now. My new GI doctor wants to switch me to a new drug Imuran to replace the Entocort. I have done serious reading about Imuran the side effects scare me to death. While reading, someone wrote about the possibility of having a preventative surgery.. meaning that have a surgery to remove the affected area and therefore you dont have to deal with all the drugs and their nasty side effects.

I used to eat ice cream by the half gallon and down Strawberry milkshakes weekly, until suddenly I had a reaction (intense cramping and diarrhea) one day after drinking a strawberry milkshake from In-N-Out. Since I had never had that reaction before, I decided to try one about a week later, but closer to home:-) and same reaction. Then I realized all my favorite Ice Cream was affecting me too. I assumed it was Lactose Intolerance developed later in life (use to drink a quart of milk at a time almost every day after school as a kid). I am especially sensitive to butter now too. I love Lobster, but cannot tolerate melted butter. I seem to be OK with Yogurt and small portions of Non-Fat milk (Starbucks Non-fat Latte). As a result of what I have been researching on Lactose Intolerance, I am wondering if my problem is not more related to milk FAT, rather than lactose(?) I read that non-fat milk contains the same amount of lactose as whole milk, but I can tolerate (some) non-fat milk, but NOT whole milk or cream. My question relates to Whey Protein, which is high in lactose, according to what I have been reading. I have used it to make protein-fortified smoothies for quite a while with no ill effects. I also add low-fat Greek yogurt, and eat it by itself often with no adverse reaction. I have eliminated butter from my diet, and though it is hard to eat an airplane meal without cheese being injected in just about everything (including eggs), I avoid cheese as much as possible. I am now wondering if there is another allergy I have to milk fat, and not necessarily lactose, and if there is a way to test or such a thing; and, if detected, can it be cured or treated..OR, do I just keep avoiding butter, cheese, whole milk, cream (and cream-based sauces) for the rest of my life. It is certainly not the end of the world to continue avoiding these things, but it would be great to be able to eat things I used to enjoy. Ay suggestions would be helpful! Follow Report"

My daughter tested very positive for Celiac which was confirmed with the Endoscopy. Her doctor suggested that my wife and I get tested. We had thought that I may have it as well as I had been on a extremely low carb diet that one of my doctors put me on to help control my reflux, which a lot of issues went away shortly after going onto the diet. I checked with my primary doctor to see how long I need to do the gluten challeng and he said to eat a normal gluten based diet for a week (what is a normal gluten based diet?) I checked with my gastro doc and he said to eat 4 slices of bread a day for 4 weeks. The thought that I may have it came from about 2 weeks before my daughter was tested and I had a few glasses of Whiskey (cheap stuff) and the next day stomach cramps and many visits to the bathroom. Everyone passed it that I was hung over, which I have never been before. A week or two later I have even less whiskey and get sick again (black velvet whiskey) The next day I have a piece of cake and I get sick yet again.. Not really knowing what is going on. My daughter gets tested and comes back positive. I start the gluten challenge and it was hell for 4 weeks. Massive fatigue comes back, bruises all over again, stomach cramps (whcih were new), many visits to the bathroom (new), socially withdrawn, gained 25 lbs and massive appetite came back. Reading on the celiac disease foundation site they suggest a 12 week period for a gluten challenge. Was mine too short? My doctor ordered 2 tests. The Tissue Transglutaminase IGA and the Gliadin Antibody IGA. Both came back negative, but online reading suggests that anything short of 6 weeks is too short and you will get a negative result. 2 days after I had stopped the gluten challenge, I feel a ton better.

I am a 79 year old Caucasian female suffering many years with this condition that didnt have a name until last week (May 2015). Years ago, a GI doctor told me that the pain in my lower right side originated from the bowel pressing on scar tissue from a hysterectomy I had many years ago. As the pain would come and go, I thought this was a plausible diagnosis UNTIL several months ago when the discomfort didnt go away. It is now in a full-blown flareup for which I sought treatment from my internist who, in turn, suggested the CT scan (hence, the diagnosis). I am quite sure I could benefit from the groups discussions and, hopefully, add something to it. Liked by LS4 / Lisa Schwart Tulsa Oklahoma (FB page) Follow Report"

My story,"I am 22 years old. I dont smoke or drink. Growing up I can remember having a slight hoarse voice in the morning if I ate to late at nights. But never anything too miserable. It would go away within a hour after drinking water. March 2011 on a Wednesday. I woke up with a hoarse voice that never went away. After a few weeks I started to get slightly worried so I went to my family doctor. I went 3 times over a course of 5-6 weeks and they had no idea after giving me multiple steroids and antibiotics that did nothing. I also had no pain in the beginning my throat didnt hurt at all. My only symptom was the voice. So they sent me to a throat specialist. (Audiologist) He did a throat endoscopy and told me I have GERD. He prescribed me omeprazole 20mg once a day. I changed my diet. I stopped eating hours before I went to sleep. I have never been a soda drinker, I am not a fan of fatty foods. The fattiest thing I like to eat sometimes is chocolate.. So I gave that up. I dont eat big meals. I have always been a snacker. But I didnt seem to get that much better so back as planned in 6weeks. He told me to start taking it twice a day. my throat started to hurt and become really sore around this point. I would wake up in severe pain, and it would hurt through out the day. I would take 2- 20mg omeprazole and I would also drink baking soda mixed with water whenever I couldnt handle the constant burn anymore.. I wouldnt drink the baking soda/water at the same time as taking the omeprazole. I made sure I did that hours apart from one another. So about 10-12 weeks later my symptoms got much worse. It wasnt working. Nothing seemed to work. So I went back to the doctor. They did another endoscopy and my throat is more swollen than the first. Its starting to swell up even higher around where my thyroid is. I started having chest pains and it has become hard to swallow anything. My heart rate gets insanely high in random occasions. I feel a knock/thump whenever I swallow. My throat is always hurting. I am nauseous when I eat. Its painful to eat or drink anything; I have lost almost 30lbs because of it. So I have had a endoscopy twice now, I got a barium swallow done and he told me I have acid reflux. probe test done,.,Blood work.How many more test need to be done? I havent heard my voice in a year now. Its to the point where I am becoming depressed and I ignore talking to people. I ignore hanging out with friends, because if I talk to much my throat becomes incredibly sore to the point where I wont be able to sleep. I cant yell or whisper. I have one tone. If I yell then Im pretty much out for the rest of the day because my throat hurts so badly. I am thinking about going to the Mayo Clinic. Has anyone else been through this? Do you think they will be able to help? Could it be something else? Im desperate. Liked by cedarsd, Melody J, Anonymous Follow Report"

I am 24 years old and I have severe constipation and NOTHING seems to work. I have been to 4 doctors all around texas, changed my diet, taken laxatives, tried suppliments, drinking water, had tests done, physical therapy and so on and so on. All they can tell me is that I have slow transit and IBS. It is nothing for me to go 5, 6, 7 days without seeing anything and then when I finally get the urge I am dissapointed as to the very little that comes out. Please.. please can anyone help and am I truly alone. My next thoughts are to undergo surgery of the large inteston and I certainly do not want to do that. I starve myself so I will not feel the pain but I can only go so long with that now can I. Please help! Liked by leibniz Follow Report"

I am new to this board and if anyone could help or has any opinions that would be great. I got very sick in Feb 11 I was losing weight rapidly and had constant rectal pressure and very tired. My pcp kept insisting that I had C-diff and mono. I am a nurse and I had been taking care of a pt that had C-diff. Even though my c-diff came back negative six times he still persisted that was the problem. By May I had lost thirty two pounds and was going to the bathroom twenty to thirty times a day. I could not stay hydrated and could not take the pain anymore. I was admitted I had a endo and colonoscopy I was told that I had Crohns Disease. I failed first line treatment therapy Asacol, Pentasa. Had a small bowel series in June new discovery a mass on my right ovary and a endocervical tumor was not on CT in May. Had a emergency hysterectomy. Was re-admitted back to the hospital in Aug for left upper quadrant pain and lower quadrant pain with black stools and again twenty to thirty a day. Was told I had a UTI and a flare up was started on Remicade. Tried Remicade until December severe fatigue, fever, sick all the time, tremors. Still going to the bathroom non-stop no weight gain. Was switched to Humira same issues with Remicade no energy, no weight gain, tremors, and severe headache. My pcp decided to start me on Marinol because I am down to 98lbs. Was re-admitted last week and spent a week in the ICU because my body could not take the Marinol. Not only was I going to the bathroom non stop and I was now vomitting. Was re-scoped GI doctor does not have any idea what is going on in fact I got my records and out of eight biopsies both from last year and this year none positive for Crohns Disease. Negative for celicac sprue both times. So she has put me, my family, and career through a living nightmare for nothing? Not to mention my mental health.

In short, before I met her, she was obese and chose the aforementioned procedure as a solution to her problem. She lost an enormous amount of weight, and all seemed well. During the summer of 2009, her condition degraded greatly. Her small bowel died, and the surgeon removed all but 30 milimeters of her small intestion. For 2-1/2 years, I provided her with 4 litres of hydration, and TPN (Total Parential Nutrition) for nutrients, administered over a 24 hour period per day.

Since June last year I have been in and out of the doctor. To catch you up to speed, I have had a CT can done, polyps on ovary ( I only have half of one from previous problems) and polyps on gallbladder. I had an ultrasound on my gallbladder and basically it just confirmed the ct scan. My symptoms are vomiting, Neausea, extreme bloating ( look 8 m prego at times ), extreme fatigue. I at times feel anemic but blood tests say Im not. I urinate alot, I get woken up about 3x a nightmy bowel bothers me as well, it sometimes hurts so much after that I feel neausous and sleepy. I think sleep is my pain methodbut it could be a symptom. The drs have tried many different medications and nothing seems to help. They just recently did an endoscopy and took 6 biopsies, two days later they called me and I now see them in two days. My history, the reason I have half an ovary is about 8 years ago I had an enlarged blood filled mass on my ovary so they took it, and the other or vary had so many cysts that they had to take half of itso I understand. I feel that this is all cyclic and told my dr that from my first visit over a year ago..they seem to be focused on my stomach however.. Anyone else have this combination of symptoms? Follow Report"

For the past maybe 2-3 years I cannot remember a day where my nose is not running. In addition to that, i almost constantly have thick boogers (idk the proper term for boogers) stuck to the back of my nostrils which semi block my breathing. I can still breathe but its like i can tell its not as clear as it should be. And because its so far back tissues dont really work so i (carefully) use q-tips to try to clear out my nose. And this is seriously everyday. No matter what, when i sleep one of my nostrils will always end up clogged. As of recently (maybe past 6 months or so) i started experiencing real pain around my nose tip and nostril bone area. Its bizarre, i will maybe touch my nose or blow it and then this pain feels as though my nose is bruised from a punch or something. It goes away quickly after but i dont understand why it occurs. Im a 29 year old female. I dont really get allergies and if i do its light. I truly never get sick. I dont have any preexisting health issues. Never had a nose injury. I dont do any drugs involving my nose. So i really do not understand what this issue is. Ive been just letting it go forever but its been just annoying and confusing me lately. Its not normal to not go one day without blowing your nose, or it running, or stuffing Up. And now this pain thing. Im curious if anyone else has experienced this or has any sort of insight. I plan to bring it up to my doctor whenever i see him next but i also would appreciate any suggestions on how to word this to understand that its not just a runny nose. Thank you! Follow Report"

I had a mild case of Tinnitus A Ringing In My Ears. I understand millions suffer from this condition. And there are those that suffer badly. Some even say on internet that they suffer horribly as well from severe Tinnitus. I cannot sit in my room having discovered my cure for Tinnitus and not saying anything to help relieve others sufferings. I discovered the CSW cure when I wanted to experiment with counter soundwaves . I play the piano and knew that Bach created counter melodies to his melodies. Thus, I tried counter sounds to the constant unpleasant Tinnitus sound I always tried to drown out. I tried bell sounds and had bought an air balloon with a little bell at bottom of T shaped air balloon. Essentially a kidss toy thick plastic air balloon. When placing the bell sound to my ear I noticed the squeaky sound coming from air balloon softened the bad Tinnitus sound considerably and with further investigation of every 15 minute testing even could barely hear the unpleasant Tinnitus sound a lot and great improvements. However an ear doctor reconmended I use a nasal spray called Fluticasone propionate and it moved my Tinnitus sound to my left ear but became louder. Then I discovered my CSW Couoter soundwave cure for my bad Tinnitus. I would want FDA approval first before anyone tries this themselves. What I can share is that a wealth of information of understanding Tinnitus can be learned from my Tinnitus cure such as softest sounds,Tinnitus can be manipulated and moved around. and a non bothersome sound like a clock majorly happens when you apply 50 doses in morning and again in evening of the squeaky sound from the air balloon from my CSW cure. I want to give back the compassion I found in my time of need. Eva L. Hart Follow Report"

Help,"Hello, I posted before in another group in its entirety but I think its too broad and there could be a multitude of theories and explanations. So Im going to break my story down into my most bothersome episodic symptoms. To start, everything on the surface looks like panic disorder or anxiety. However, my different episodes seem to be helping each other keep me feeling frantic more days than not so on the surface it looks like anxiety. Ive had lots of lab work testing including thyroid, Lyme, sleep apnea home test, brain MRI, spine MRI, abdominal ct scan, and way too many doctor visits with no answer, but they do agree on one thing. The symptoms are weird and seem to be more than just anxiety. There are little bits here and there but unfortunately not enough to go on. Keep in mind these episodes arent all going on at the same time but theyre not giving me any recovery time and feel like im sinking further down the hole. Its like fighting 5 bullies one at a time and losing. Just as you feel like you can get up another bully hops in. Episode 1: After waking up with head pressure, teeth chattering, shivering, lower back pain, and sweating. Oral temperature is ALWAYS between 93.8 F and 94.8 during these episodes. Also, every day is constant cold hands and feet that never happened until all of these episodes started. Episode 2: Brain fog, head pressure that feels like youre being pushed down when standing (like when youve had one too many drinks), usually later in the day when that feeling wears off, Ill have adrenaline body tingling, uncontrollable thoughts of self-harm and head chatter. (Not dwelling on things or worried about things, its just the mind doing what it does and I have no control.) Also, my eye will twitch like crazy before and during these. Episode 3: When standing for a long period of time, like cooking or washing dishes, and sweating starts to happen my heart rate increases and get extremely dizzy and feels like Im being physically pulled down. Episode 4: An overly excited feeling, almost like needing to yell or run to get adrenaline out, Heart rate is low. Episode 5. Sharp colon pain, yellow stools (frequently), stools that look sickly or unhealthy, and constipation more often than not. I had a colonoscopy recently and I was told everything looks good. Ive tried SSRIs and benzodiazepines and they dont stop these episodes from occurring. Ive tried strict diets and those dont help.

Ive visited my allergist, an ear-nose-throat specialist and my own internist. None of them have ever heard of my problem and dont know how to help me. Started approx 20 yrs ago, Every couple of months I would get an awful pain on one of my ears if I had been laying on it during the night. It would happen to either ear, whichever one I laid on. To describe the pain. It is so intense that it wakes me. Pain is NOT inside the ear but around the edges of the entrance of it. It is so painful, I cant touch it. It will be throbbing. It also hurts tremendously behind, towards the bottom back of the ear. Cant touch that either. The only thing that will make it go away is when I then get up and stand and within approx 30 min it is gone. I even tested it by massaging behind the ear (once I could bear to touch it) and it seemed to make pain go away faster. The last approx 3 years, I have no longer been able to even lay on either ear when in bed because now the pain will come every time. I have learned to sleep on my back. Sometimes I would still move onto my side during night, and wake up with pain. For last 6 months, Ive been having pressure and achy feeling around one of the ears, even while laying on my back. Then I started getting the pain even while sleeping on my back. I am very much afraid that the day will come when I will no longer be able to lay down in my bed to go to sleep. I am desperate to get to the bottom of this and perhaps for first time in 20 years be able to comfortably lay on my side in bed. My ENT doctor said my ears are healthy . i have no hearing loss. This ear pain, however, is starting to affect my daily living, since I dont seem to be able to get the restful sleep I need. I will be forever grateful if someone could pinpoint this. thanks.

It took years of him complaining to Dentists and Doctors before it was diagnosed. Finally a Dr referred him too the Cleveland Clinic. They were able to diagnose it, but didnt have a Dr on staff that could offer any advice. Being that Eagle syndrome is so rare less than 4% percent have this condition and of that 0.16% show symptoms.We found a couple of Drs who have treated the condition. But they claim the surgery is horrible they found it creates more issues. That to hold off as long as a person can.It is very painful at times for my son. He said right now, he can feel the Styloid pressing on his Hyloid bone.Does Mayo Clinic have any studies or Drs that deal with Eagles Syndrome? Liked by de9g Follow Report"

About five days ago, in the middle of the afternoon, I suddenly had pain on the lower right side of my nose. if I didnt touch this area, the pain was about a 2 out of 10, but when I would press the outside of my nose at all the pain would increase to around a 6 out of 10. I had no redness or swelling, no nasal drip, and no pain across the bridge of my nose. This pain decreased the next morning and was gone by the end of that night, without any medication. Today, I woke up with sinus drip, though that is now gone by the evening as I type this. However, beginning a few hours ago, I now have similar pain to what I had five days go. The difference now is that its only located on the lower left side of my nose. Again, there is no redness, no swelling and no pain around the bridge of my nose. The other difference is that today is more painful than five days ago (5 out of 10 when not touched, around an 8 when touched). I am in good health otherwise and am not on any medications. I keep trying to search to see what I may have, but everyone I find who describes this type of pain also mentions having swelling and/or redness, which I do not have. My only change in behavior is recently I have started to use a shampoo with tea tree oil in it, which shouldnt trigger this type of response (so far as I can find). My PCP is on vacation this week and the other doctor in his office is not someone I have had positive experiences with, to put it mildly. Any insights or recaps of similar incidents are appreciated.

This is going to be a long read so Im sorry in advance. Details about the jaw pain is in the last paragraph! Im actually going to get an MRI for this in a month but I was thinking I could also get other peoples perspectives and ideas on what my issue could be before then since its been going on for so long already with no answers yet. Im also asking here since Im now starting to believe it has something to do with the nerves, maybe (which the MRI should hopefully reveal). Heres the story: in March of last year I began having mild aching pain under my right jaw (not where the jawbone is, a little closer to the neck in the soft area). I initially thought it was just another symptom of my anxiety due to school so I ignored it, but after two weeks it suddenly got worse to the point where I couldnt bend down at all or else the pain would grow so intense it felt like whatever was in pain there was gonna explode. I visited the local walk-in clinic that day which started my journey to trying to find the cause. Got a bunch of blood tests which all turned up normal. Then got a neck ultrasound which actually revealed that I had thyroiditis! By this point the pain was still a constant but definitely not bad, and I could bend down again without a reaction. I went to see an endocrinologist and in 3 months my thyroid got better (its still enlarged to this day but its stable), and the pain was completely gone. Cut to October and the pain under my jaw suddenly comes back again. I thought it was my thyroid again so I got another neck ultrasound but I sat down with my endocrinologist when we got the results and he told me that my thyroid is still where it was before and that he had no idea what the pain I was feeling was, but that it definitely didnt have anything to do with my thyroid. So I went back to the walk-in clinic and got a jaw x-ray, which came back normal too. I also asked my dentist about it but they dont have any idea what it could be. My doctor tried to refer me to an orthodontist to try and maybe see if its caused by TMD (Temporomandibular disorder), but when we tried to book an appointment with them they told me the earliest one would be in 2021, so thats a no-go (Im done school in April and going back home which is too far). At this point my pain disappeared again after being present for about 2-3 weeks. I thought it was maybe over with, but come December and the pain came back yet again, this time Id developed constant head pains as well. The jaw pain went away after another 2 weeks but my head pains were constant and relentless for a solid 2 months. It first felt like a pinch in the back right side of my skull, at the base, then would develop into something like an ache in the connection between the skulls plates that would get worse when I lied down. It felt like I had to crack the back of my skull real bad but I couldnt no matter what I did. The pain would also move depending on which side I would rest my head. It kept me up for countless nights and just made my life for those 2 months absolutely miserable, and when it was at its worse so too was the pain under my jaw. I started seeing a Chiropractor around a month ago thinking maybe it had something to do with my neck and spine, and then both went away in late January/early February. Then a little under two weeks ago I had a migrane which lasted a few days; it was a dull/sharp pain located right above and slightly forward from my right ear (its also present at the exact same place on my left side, but not as intensely). The pain intensifies whenever I lay my head down, especially on its sides. Ibuprofen/Advil didnt work at all. Now both the jaw pain and the migraine have recently come back AGAIN a couple of days ago and it looks like its gonna last another couple of weeks if the pattern is anything to go by. They both sometimes pulsate pain when its really bad. Throughout the day the pain comes and goes and lasts for about a minute or a bit more, but around nighttime it becomes a constant and prevents me from sleeping, often keeping me up until 5 or 6am. I was referred to a neurologist last month but they havent called me back yet, so Ill call them in a couple of days after family day. The details of the jaw pain now is that during the 2-3 weeks that its present, it comes and goes with no obvious triggers. The pain is usually either a sharp, pulsating pain that lasts for a second, or a dull aching pain that can last for over an hour. During the whole year it had gotten as bad as to wake me up three times from deep sleep. It has never gotten as bad as the initial incident with not being able to bend down, but it still remains a consistent pain that disrupts my daily life, and pain medication such as ibuprofen/advil or aleve dont have any effect on it. Im a 25 yo female with no allergies or past medical history besides an oral surgery I underwent about 10 years ago to remove a cyst (which turned out to be a false alarm). I have not been officially diagnosed, but I am 100% sure I have misophonia, and with that, Im somewhat sure that I have some form of anxiety (I will be seeking official help with a counselor soon).

I went to see an endocrinologist and in 3 months my thyroid got better (its still enlarged to this day but its stable), and the pain was completely gone. Cut to October and the pain under my jaw suddenly comes back again. I thought it was my thyroid again so I got another neck ultrasound but I sat down with my endocrinologist when we got the results and he told me that my thyroid is still where it was before and that he had no idea what the pain I was feeling was, but that it definitely didnt have anything to do with my thyroid. So I went back to the walk-in clinic and got a jaw x-ray, which came back normal too. I also asked my dentist about it but they dont have any idea what it could be. My doctor tried to refer me to an orthodontist to try and maybe see if its caused by TMD (Temporomandibular disorder), but when we tried to book an appointment with them they told me the earliest one would be in 2021, so thats a no-go (Im done school in April and going back home which is too far). At this point my pain disappeared again after being present for about 2-3 weeks. I thought it was maybe over with, but come December and the pain came back yet again, this time Id developed constant head pains as well. The jaw pain went away after another 2 weeks but my head pains were constant and relentless for a solid 2 months. It first felt like a pinch in the back right side of my skull, at the base, then would develop into something like an ache in the connection between the skulls plates that would get worse when I lied down. It felt like I had to crack the back of my skull real bad but I couldnt no matter what I did. The pain would also move depending on which side I would rest my head. It kept me up for countless nights and just made my life for those 2 months absolutely miserable, and when it was at its worse so too was the pain under my jaw. I started seeing a Chiropractor around a month ago thinking maybe it had something to do with my neck and spine, and then both went away in late January/early February. Then a little under two weeks ago I had a migrane which lasted a few days; it was a dull/sharp pain located right above and slightly forward from my right ear (its also present at the exact same place on my left side, but not as intensely). The pain intensifies whenever I lay my head down, especially on its sides. Ibuprofen/Advil didnt work at all. Now both the jaw pain and the migraine have recently come back AGAIN a couple of days ago and it looks like its gonna last another couple of weeks if the pattern is anything to go by. They both sometimes pulsate pain when its really bad. Throughout the day the pain comes and goes and lasts for about a minute or a bit more, but around nighttime it becomes a constant and prevents me from sleeping, often keeping me up until 5 or 6am. I was referred to a neurologist last month but they havent called me back yet, so Ill call them in a couple of days after family day. The details of the jaw pain now is that during the 2-3 weeks that its present, it comes and goes with no obvious triggers. The pain is usually either a sharp, pulsating pain that lasts for a second, or a dull aching pain that can last for over an hour. During the whole year it had gotten as bad as to wake me up three times from deep sleep. It has never gotten as bad as the initial incident with not being able to bend down, but it still remains a consistent pain that disrupts my daily life, and pain medication such as ibuprofen/advil or aleve dont have any effect on it. Im a 25 yo female with no allergies or past medical history besides an oral surgery I underwent about 10 years ago to remove a cyst (which turned out to be a false alarm). I have not been officially diagnosed, but I am 100% sure I have misophonia, and with that, Im somewhat sure that I have some form of anxiety (I will be seeking official help with a counselor soon).

My ENT Doctor recently cleaned out my right ear today ( Wednesday the 29th) which has fungus and which caused a severe ear ache .havent had ear aches since I was a child. I am to see him again this Friday and bring with me Iodine and a dropper. He will clean out more of the fungus and paint my ear with the iodine and give me instructions on how to administer iodine drops and for how long. I have read how iodine is effective in killing fungus and bacteria in general and how it may be effective in treating fungus in the ears. I have little ear wax and know that ear wax has anti microbial properties. No hearing aid in that ear until I see him again. My question ishas anyone ever been diagnosed with ear fungus and what did you use beside RX medications to treat the fungus or ear infections in general. I think the fungus may be resistant to any medications at this point so the iodine would be a preventative measure. I was using apple cider Vinegar and water on occasion to ward off ear infections but it is very drying to my ear canals. I also use mineral oil on a semi regular basis.

The scary thing is that this sinus is very close to the optic nerve and other important parts of the brain and could cause irreparable damage to my optic nerve that would possibly cause loss of sight. The procedure to open up the sinus is one that is performed under general anesthesia and there is also the risk of the surgeon accidentally disturbing something else in the brain close to the sinus.

I instantly got concerned, as my throat never hurtseven with a coldunless I have strep throat, which I tend to get twice a year. I looked down the back of my throat, and low and behold, white spots! I saw my doctor promptly the next day. My doctor looked down my throat and did a rapid strep test. The test came back negative and the doctor suspected that the spots I was seeing were tonsil stonesvery likely, as Ive been told by my ENT that I have many of these.

Its just when swallowing. The pain is SEVERE. Over the weekend I was forced to go to an Urgent Care center, as I had developed bacterial pink eye. Im on eye drops and am now symptom-less (is that a word?), but finishing up the bottle. I was also swabbed for flu at this time, and that, too, came back negative. The Urgent Care doctor was very obviously rushing to get home (he stated that the entire staff was waiting to leave) and didnt even look in my ears! My throat actually doesnt look red or bad at all when you look at it. Its for this reason that he didnt believe I needed a further strep culture.

He gave me a diagnosis of a viral upper respiratory infection after barely looking me over. (How could VIRAL URI give me BACTERIAL pink eye?)

This is my first post, so a little background I suffer from a very debilitating case of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and one of my main obsessions in my health. Whats been going on is completely weighing on my mind to a degree I cannot handle any longer, and I need help. Last Tuesday night I started to develop a scratchy throat. I instantly got concerned, as my throat never hurtseven with a coldunless I have strep throat, which I tend to get twice a year. I looked down the back of my throat, and low and behold, white spots! I saw my doctor promptly the next day. My doctor looked down my throat and did a rapid strep test. The test came back negative and the doctor suspected that the spots I was seeing were tonsil stonesvery likely, as Ive been told by my ENT that I have many of these. She advised me that she thinks what I was experiencing was simple sinus drainage and to push liquids and to take Zyrtec and Mucinex. By the next day, my throat was not only scratchy, but my tonsils felt like a truck was hitting them every time I swallowed. Its been a week, and its felt l like that ever since, along with this same severe pain when swallowing in my ears/eustachian tubes. My throat actually no longer hurts on its own. Its just when swallowing. The pain is SEVERE. Over the weekend I was forced to go to an Urgent Care center, as I had developed bacterial pink eye. Im on eye drops and am now symptom-less (is that a word?), but finishing up the bottle. I was also swabbed for flu at this time, and that, too, came back negative. The Urgent Care doctor was very obviously rushing to get home (he stated that the entire staff was waiting to leave) and didnt even look in my ears! My throat actually doesnt look red or bad at all when you look at it. Its for this reason that he didnt believe I needed a further strep culture. Its like, BEHIND the tonsils/in the neck that this pain is unbearable. So it doesnt surprise me that my throat looks okay. He gave me a diagnosis of a viral upper respiratory infection after barely looking me over. (How could VIRAL URI give me BACTERIAL pink eye?) Other symptoms are stuffy/dry nose, hacking cough, coughing up yellow mucus. Occasional pressure in my teeth. Itchy ears. Ive had no fever throughout the entire thing. My doctors keep telling me that this is a virus and refusing to give me any medicine. They just keep telling me to push Mucinex and liquids like Im drowning. Theyve been telling me this for a week now, and my symptoms havent budged. In fact, theyve worsened. And when they originally saw me, all I felt was a tiny scratch in my throat. I didnt have any of these symptoms. I have an appointment tomorrow. They keep dismissing me as an anxiety case on the phone and not taking my level of pain seriously. Im at a loss of what to do to ease my mind. I can not afford to go back to Urgent Care, and I mentally cannot afford to sit in an Emergency Room (worst OCD nightmare).

Went to see Ear Nose Throat doctor and she recommended me to do sinus rinse twice a day, prescribe me prednisone for five days and order a blood test to what I am allergic to. Medication did not work. Went back to the same doctor this time she told me to take sudafed and flonease. Medicatiion did not work but the sinus rinse did. I couldnt get another appointment right way so I wen to see another Ear Nose Throat doctor. This time doctor recommended me to have a cat scan so I did. It turns out I have chronic sinus. So he prescribe twice to me antibotics and another round of prednisone low dosage. It did not work. I went back to my doctor and I told him you know what I have allergy. He put me on allergy medication which y you take before you go to bed at night. Medication did nothing for me. I have another appointment to see my doctor end of this month. What really worked for me is Mucinex.which I take at night before going bed. I want to find out if any of you out there had similar experience that Im going through and it got resolved.

However, for the last about 2 years I have had severe and constant daily symptoms of what seems to be, to a T other than the lack of imaging results, Eagles Syndrome. It began shortly after I had my Tonsillectomy in 2017. It was necessary, I had strep over 20 times, but I have recently been made aware that a form of Eagles Syndrome can develop after tonsillectomy that is different than the kind common in EDS patients where the styloid process itself elongates. I am wondering if this is possibly not as visible on CT, or doesn't cause the same jugular stenosis? If there is any possibility with negative imaging it could still explain my problem, or if there is another disorder with symptoms similar to Eagles Syndrome that might? Essentially, I have daily, near constant pain where my neck meets my jaw on the left side, about an inch and a half below my ear. It is just in front and below where my jaw's corner is. There is a small, enlarged area/lump there that is not on the right side, that has been there well over a year or more. My craniosacral physical therapist, who is very knowledgeable about hypermobility and my symptoms, said that every time she works on my neck where it hurts, my styloid feels inflamed and displaced, and my hyoid is often screwed up as well. I had a second well regarded therapist second this recently as well. The pain radiates up towards my ear, thought not terribly, and every once in a while radiates down almost tingly to my collarbone, nerve pain like. Ice is somewhat helpful but quite frankly nothing really helps it. Massage helps some of the tension around it but not the pain itself. So far nothing anyone has done has helped. It is worse with turning my head to that side. It sometimes hurts to swallow but not most often. I have ehlers danlos syndrome. I was reading that the type of Eagles Syndrome that can occur after tonsillectomy is caused by abnormal healing. Medscape says that ""After tonsillectomy some people develop calcium deposits on the stylohyoid ligament, which attaches to the styloid process. Most people do not develop symptoms, but some may experience pain and other unusual sensations."" I scar atrophically and severely from very light injury. I am wondering if this could explain my pain?? Do any of you have experience with this and does my pain sound similar?

I have horrible hypersalivation and at times I feel like what it must feel like to get water boarded. I have to spit constantly and to get it out I have tohow shall I put this violently cough it up if that makes sense, making guttural noises. I feel like my throat is being crushed and Im increasingly having difficulty swallowing my salvia which at times makes it difficult to breathe and Im gasping for air. I also have horrible nerve pain, when its at its worse my rib cage, spine, shoulder blades, arch of my left foot and my left toe feel like they are on fire, I have nerve pain in other areas but those are the most constant. Throughout my day I feel like Im going to suffocate on my salvia.A couple of months ago my Neurologist prescribed something called Rubinol for the hypersalivation and up until a week ago 3 1 mg pills made it tolerable then I had to start taking 4 then 5 the last 2 days Ive been taking 7 and 8 and its not helping and the maximum dose is 8! My Neurologist doesnt thing the Hypersalivation is related to my nerve pain issues but when the hypersalivation starts getting bad so does the nerve pain they get worse at the same time and recede at the same time. Im getting a second opinion October 2nd. I had my first endoscopy about 3 months ago which revealed that I have Barretts esophagus and Im on several meds for Gerd which never helped as I mentioned the only thing to date that helped was the Rubinol until a week ago. Before that my GP prescribed Elavil but that helped for less than a week. I had a second endoscopy about 3 weeks ago and when I went to get the results last week my Gadtronoligist said they didnt have to dilate my esophagus, that it was ok and not causing me my symptoms. I also had Barium swallow study which revealed I have something called Esophageal dismolitity.Im still waiting for my insurance to approve a speech therapist. Ive had a brain Mri which my Neurologist said ruled out MS he also did a nerve conductivity test which revealed pinched nerves in my neck. Ive seen a Rheumatologist and had bloodwork which ruled out auto immune diseases. I had a CT scan of my neck which found a 1 cm tumor and a 5 mm tumor on my trachea although although apparently that was a misdiagnosis because in the notes it recommends a isolated CT scan of my chest which found that my trachea and airways are clear and their is no mention of tumors in the diagnosis report.Tonight was the 3rd time Ive gone to 3 different ERs because I feel like Im going to suffocate on.my salvia after taking my blood pressure and doing bloodwork which was ok they discharged me!I was rereading the report of my CT Angiography of my neck before going to the ER and had never noticed that it says in my history that I had Cerebral infarction which I had to Google to find out it means stroke which I have no recollection of having I panicked and then although my memory is bad I remembered my Neurologist talking about what I think was white matter that the brain Mri revealed and then his asking me if I use to use cocaine when I was younger which regrettably is true as well as Crystal meth Im now clean and sober and attend A.A. meetings every night. Its hard to wrap my head around the thought that my previous addictions concluding a heavy smoking habit are likely the reasons for my health issues. I stopped smoking cigarettes about 22 months ago but at times I think I did this to myself.I was prescribed oxycodone 7.5 mgs and asked my sponsor how he felt about it and he was ok with ut unfortunately after it giving me relief initially 3 7.5 pills now basically give me very little relief and Im not sure if the pain would be so much worse if I wasnt taking them or if opioids just are not effective for what I have and if its worth the nausea, headaches and feeling tired all the time.Im really getting desperate for some answers and not sure how much longer I can deal with the pain plus I fear that Im going to suffocate on my salvia in the not too distant future my next Doctors appointment is with a ENT on the 18th of this month and since my symptoms have progressively gotten worse this week especially the hypersalivation, feeling like Im being choked and difficulty swallowing that Im not going to make it that long even water is difficult to swallow the last few days and eating food really hurts!I really appreciate any comments anyone might have.Im also going to give the ER at USC county a shot Ive been told that although its going to be a very long wait that they do comprehensive testing and they likely will admit me for observationdoes anyone have experience with them or knowledge about that?Thank you!

I had a second endoscopy about 3 weeks ago and when I went to get the results last week my Gadtronoligist said they didnt have to dilate my esophagus, that it was ok and not causing me my symptoms.

Ive had a brain Mri which my Neurologist said ruled out MS he also did a nerve conductivity test which revealed pinched nerves in my neck. Ive seen a Rheumatologist and had bloodwork which ruled out auto immune diseases. I had a CT scan of my neck which found a 1 cm tumor and a 5 mm tumor on my trachea although although apparently that was a misdiagnosis because in the notes it recommends a isolated CT scan of my chest which found that my trachea and airways are clear and their is no mention of tumors in the diagnosis report.Tonight was the 3rd time Ive gone to 3 different ERs because I feel like Im going to suffocate on.my salvia after taking my blood pressure and doing bloodwork which was ok they discharged me!I was rereading the report of my CT Angiography of my neck before going to the ER and had never noticed that it says in my history that I had Cerebral infarction which I had to Google to find out it means stroke which I have no recollection of having I panicked and then although my memory is bad I remembered my Neurologist talking about what I think was white matter that the brain Mri revealed and then his asking me if I use to use cocaine when I was younger which regrettably is true as well as Crystal meth Im now clean and sober and attend A.A. meetings every night. Its hard to wrap my head around the thought that my previous addictions concluding a heavy smoking habit are likely the reasons for my health issues.

Atropic Rhinitus mystery case,"Im 33 years old from the midwestern area of the USA. *I have not had any turbinate reduction or any surgery whatsoever.* 2 months ago I woke up in the middle of my sleep from a lack of air resistance in my nose. My sensation went back and forth from normal to bad for about 4 days. One day my breathing sensation completely went away. Of course I look to google scrambling for information on too much air and no nose resistance when breathing etc. it led me to the symptom of Empty nose syndrome. So 2 weeks go by with absolutely 0 sensation of nose breathing. Impossible to sleep, hard to put together a sentence due to forgetting how with this new sensation. Even hard to walk without hyperventilating. About a week into this I went to my dr who prescribed anxiety pills (Buspar) and topical gel for inside of the nose (Mupricin). They check my oxygen and its 98%. After 2 weeks of this  I had a pop in my ear and a little phlegm production. OMG- did my body/ nose just fix itself?? Well no, because the normal breathing sensation lasted for about 2 hours and went away to completely nothing. Another week goes by with these ups and downs. All of a sudden I notice my baseline breathing is about 25% of normal. Im not always suffering and have a *glimpse* of nose resistance. And randomly- I have small periods of normalcy aka phlegm production, moisture in nose, buggers, swelling of turbinates. Ive seen 2 separate ENTs at 2 separate hospitals (one of the top ent in the nation) They both said turbinates are there and that mucus is also there. Things look normal but maybe dry. I was sent to a rheumatologist to check for sjegeons syndrome. Had 19 blood tests, urine, and lung x Ray. Things look normal. I had high celiacs and 160 speckled ANA. Ive got a ct scan tomorrow. I had a phone consult with a highly respected ENT/ENS doctor. He mentioned due to my alopecia barbae and high ANA blood test that he believes auto immune may be eating at my mucosa glands/cells. Ive suffered and still am for the most part with breathing/anxiety/depression/sleep sensations due to this. Things are slightly getting better I think. But occasionally my nose will go back to being completely open without any resistance. The only thing I can pinpoint with this whole thing is I have ALWAYS had non-allergic rhinitis my entire life (phlegm, post nasal drip, etc.) and all of a sudden one day it changes to completely dry! I dont know if its mucusa damage, or just my body getting used to not having moisture/allergies. I could take a decongestant when sick and never get dry and have ENS symptoms at all. Whatever it is, its not normal. Its hard/impossible to lead a normal life. Hoping that something switches in my body soon, or that a Dr. can not just automatically assume its in my head and prescribe pills (which I am not taking) The only things that are helping are: Showering Humidifier Ayrgel in nose Going for walks (when breathing feels good) Talking with friends/family.

During these episodes I feel as if the floor is not stable and that I may pass out. It gets extreme and debilitates me. I have never passed out. Outside of the episodes, I have near constant disequilibrium. I describe it as dizziness but it feels as if the floor is not stable or that I may fall through it. I feel weightless in my limbs and have head pressure that goes along with this. Not all these symptoms occur together but they all occur. It is effectively ruining my life and mental health. I can no longer enjoy activities I used to once enjoy. Leaving the house is a chore, working out is a chore and leaves me feeling drained, work is hard to be focused, etc. Physical activity greatly exaggerates the condition and sometimes I cannot complete workouts. I have seen two primary care physicians, three ENTs, two neurologists and a neurosurgeon, two cardiologists, and an allergist. They ran multiple tests and cannot give me a reason for the way I am feeling. They found a pineal gland cyst on a brain MRI but say it has no significance. Wore an event monitor for 2 weeks and there were some PVCs but the cardiologist assured me they were normal. Full vestibular workup done as well. Many have tried to tell me that it is all anxiety but I do not believe that is the case as these episodes arise and even the constant disequilibrium arises with no apparent trigger or when I am jut home doing nothing. I have had anxiety issues in the past but not to a degree that caused physical symptoms. Im also suspect of this diagnoses as the sensations came out of nowhere and I was perfectly fine prior to them starting while living a much less healthy lifestyle. Also anxiety medication does not alleviate the symptoms only seems to make me not care as much. I still feel drained and weak however. I believe that my condition is causing some anxiety which is in turn making things worse, but I do not believe it is the root cause. I am able to breathe through episodes of anxiety. I have seen therapists and psychiatrists. They dont have answers for me. I have seen some alternative providers as I am now getting desperate. A chiropractor was helpful but did not relive symptoms, although she was the only provider Ive seen who put a lot of effort into my case. Ive recently seen a dentist to evaluate if anything went wrong with a wisdom teeth surgery I had a few months before my symptoms started. I only thought of this after coming across some information about cavitations on the internet. However there is no concrete evidence these are actually a medical issue. Upon focusing on the extraction sites, using a cone beam ct, I did show what appear to be cavitations. I am torn now because the dentist is saying yes it is unusual (he said it looked as if I has just had my wisdom teeth removed despite the surgery being over 2 years prior), but he does not think it would cause symptoms. Information online paints a different story. They report cavitations could definitely cause the issues Ive been having. I just find it a strange coincidence that I do indeed have pockets in the bone where my teeth were removed and that my symptoms began not too long after my surgery.

During these episodes I feel as if the floor is not stable and that I may pass out. It gets extreme and debilitates me. I have never passed out. Outside of the episodes, I have near constant disequilibrium. I describe it as dizziness but it feels as if the floor is not stable or that I may fall through it. I feel weightless in my limbs and have head pressure that goes along with this. Not all these symptoms occur together but they all occur. It is effectively ruining my life and mental health. I can no longer enjoy activities I used to once enjoy. Leaving the house is a chore, working out is a chore and leaves me feeling drained, work is hard to be focused, etc. Physical activity greatly exaggerates the condition and sometimes I cannot complete workouts. I have seen two primary care physicians, three ENTs, two neurologists and a neurosurgeon, two cardiologists, and an allergist. They ran multiple tests and cannot give me a reason for the way I am feeling. They found a pineal gland cyst on a brain MRI but say it has no significance. Wore an event monitor for 2 weeks and there were some PVCs but the cardiologist assured me they were normal. Full vestibular workup done as well. Many have tried to tell me that it is all anxiety but I do not believe that is the case as these episodes arise and even the constant disequilibrium arises with no apparent trigger or when I am jut home doing nothing. I have had anxiety issues in the past but not to a degree that caused physical symptoms. Im also suspect of this diagnoses as the sensations came out of nowhere and I was perfectly fine prior to them starting while living a much less healthy lifestyle. Also anxiety medication does not alleviate the symptoms only seems to make me not care as much. I still feel drained and weak however. I believe that my condition is causing some anxiety which is in turn making things worse, but I do not believe it is the root cause. I am able to breathe through episodes of anxiety. I have seen therapists and psychiatrists. They dont have answers for me. I have seen some alternative providers as I am now getting desperate. A chiropractor was helpful but did not relive symptoms, although she was the only provider Ive seen who put a lot of effort into my case. Ive recently seen a dentist to evaluate if anything went wrong with a wisdom teeth surgery I had a few months before my symptoms started. I only thought of this after coming across some information about cavitations on the internet. However there is no concrete evidence these are actually a medical issue. Upon focusing on the extraction sites, using a cone beam ct, I did show what appear to be cavitations. I am torn now because the dentist is saying yes it is unusual (he said it looked as if I has just had my wisdom teeth removed despite the surgery being over 2 years prior), but he does not think it would cause symptoms. Information online paints a different story. They report cavitations could definitely cause the issues Ive been having. I just find it a strange coincidence that I do indeed have pockets in the bone where my teeth were removed and that my symptoms began not too long after my surgery.

Eventually I started feeling great he sounds like saliva and it always seem to be coming from the front of my mouth and I swear it was coming from in between the teeth from gums. I am now getting tan, white, orangish and brown What seems to be calcium buildup which leads me to believe salivary gland stones.

Visually you cant see anything under my tongue no white spots no lumps or on the inside of my cheeks.

Then sometime later I noticed and felt hey mom on my hard pallet an felt like it was just under the skin and was movable. Moving the object hurt extremely and over about a week i eas finally abe to get it to the rear (throat side) of my mouth. Towards the back if hard pallet it started navigating to the top rear teeth.It eventually subsided for some time after figuring out certain ways to swallow in order to move it and try to keep it in a spot that didnt cause to much pain. Months later: The pain start to return again and it Seem to always be on the right side which is where the Long is on my throat thats just right of the Adams apple and slightly lower.. it seemed that the pain would be more so on the right side from rear molars to run stopping at the canine. Again swallowing a certain way I was able to get the majority of what was bothering me back down into the lower part of my mouth or throat it seemed. Throughout this entire time I always felt like my nose/mouth that saliva Was being pulled down to what i seemed to feel was my mid stomach. This couldve been just the pressure. Currently: About a months ago I noticed When using one of those flosh/tooth picks when using pick in between gums I suddenly tasted salt and if I swallowed the direction I felt it coming in it would obviously be more of that salty saliva. Eventually I started feeling great he sounds like saliva and it always seem to be coming from the front of my mouth and I swear it was coming from in between the teeth from gums. I am now getting tan, white, orangish and brown What seems to be calcium buildup which leads me to believe salivary gland stones. They seem to come out more easier when I take the first bite of something. However the amount that has come out already seems to be far more than any ive seen Online. When Going to the doctors I saw 2 ENT, Er, urgent care. I also had 2 endoscopys done And they couldnt find anything one doctor said he saw it was a little irritated and red and inflamed he also told me to swallow which I did and then repeated himself again to swallow and he said he saw limited to no movement in my saliva but no sign of anything else. Visually you cant see anything under my tongue no white spots no lumps or on the inside of my cheeks. Yesterday I looked into salivary massages to help lose my saliva and decided to push on the Area I could feel it in my throat again To the right of my Adams apple and slightly lower pressed it and it sounded like someone cracking my knuckles for joint and then they begin to slowly rise towards stayed around the molar to canine area And extremely hurt. Whats leading me to believe that it might not be stones is that the thyroid is also in his area as the amount of discharge for what I believe is calcium deposits is a lot more than what Ive seen any advice would be really appreciated thank you very much I attached two pictures they are the same just one is zoomed in more.

I am 33 years old and have been dizzy every single day for the last four years. I have had blood tests that have come back normal, an MRI which showed no abnormalities and I have seen a Neurologist and an ENT who did all the different tests and could find nothing wrong with me. The ENT, six months ago, decided that I must have Vestibular Migraine and prescribed me Pizotifen. I have not taken these at all because I am not convinced that I have had a four year unrelenting migraine and also she told me that it is common to put on lots of weight while on Pizotifen so I am not thrilled about that for sure. I am supposed to go back in a week for a follow up visit but I think I will just cancel it because she cant really follow up if I am not taking her advice. I just wish I could work out what could cause four years of dizziness like this. I am still functioning, I can force myself to go out, to work, to college and pretend like everything is normal. I am not falling over but have the constant sensation that Ive had a glass of wine too many. I can no longer drive a car. I do not get headaches or any other symptoms. Just the neverending dizziness. I struggle at work. Every day I think about quitting and just staying at home but then I force myself to carry on as I do not want this feeling to become a disability. The only time that I feel normal is lying down in bed at night. I also feel better sitting, not normal but definitely improved. However as soon as I have to walk anywhere, its back. I was thinking about trying Sertraline as I read somewhere that it can help chronic dizziness but Im scared of the other potential side-effects or if it is even worth trying. I might just be clutching for any solution here. Has anyone got any suggestions on anything that I can do? Im really willing to try mostly anything at this stage! Follow Report"

My daughter has a host of problems, including chronic sphenoid sinus disease with recurring polyp. She just had her second sinus surgery. In the month prior to the surgery she had a urinary tract infection with positive urine cultures for Klebsiella pnuemoniae. Her only symptoms were feeling achy and having right flank pain. They put her on Macrobid. That didnt resolve her symptoms of right flank pain and she still felt achy, so they put her on a round of Septra. She saw an ENT at that point because she has chronic sinusitis and thick nasal mucus with cough. A CT showed showed significant ethmoid sinus infection and a sphenoid nasal polypthe same symptoms she had prior to her first surgery a few years ago. Because of a similar history with her brother and because he presented with the unusal symptom of oral thrush a year before, a doctor told me to be sure that if she be checked for fungal infection. I asked the ENT to culture for fungus when he submitted her tissue for culture following this recent surgery. Her cultures were negative for bacteria, but positive for Candida albicans, a fungus/yeast. From what I have read and from what a general practitioner advises, she could have a systemic fungal infection. He put her on Diflucan four days ago. Now she is having the symptoms of die off. Fever, sweating, feeling flu-like. Im cautiously optimistic that we may have figured out what has eluded us for years as an explanation of her various symptoms. Has anyone here experienced a systemic fungal infection that was effectively treated? She is not immunocompromised. She does have multiple antibodies of type 1 diabetes and has autoantibodies for thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin. But from what two rheumatologists have told us, her immune system is working perfectly fine. She has thyroiditis shown on PET scan. Is it possible her body is attacking various tissues because of fungal infection? If this is a systemic problem, can anyone recommend a doctor to see?

I was hoping to run this by the forum to get some feedback on whether my symptoms really can be attributed to an ENT problem. Primary symptoms: fatigue, 'brain fog', swelling (most obviously in the face but I believe it's generalized), lax and discolored skin, dark under eye circles, chronic nasal congestion, exertion 'intolerance', throat-clearing tendency; I notice the mental and physical symptoms occur in tandem and the onset of physical symptoms often results in me looking tired, angry, and 5-10 years older than when they're not present (which is extremely disconcerting and, frankly, ruining my life) Secondary symptoms (possibly unrelated): skin sensitivity, highly prone to acne, sometimes high tendency to sweat even in very low temperatures (could be due to reliance on large amounts of caffeine) Observations:  Unrefreshing sleep. I almost always wake up completely exhausted, with a headache, and often looking like someone beat my face with a concrete block (I wish that were an exaggeration).  Cannot exercise safely. Exercising consistently will intensify symptoms over a period of several weeks until they're so bad that I can no longer function. I've attempted to restart an exercise regimen and been forced to quit it many times over the past 3 years. Usually hit somewhere between the 6 and 8 week mark before it's so bad that I have to stop.  After exercise, within 0.5 to 2 hrs: noticeable increase in swelling (generalized). This has always struck me as really odd. I don't know anyone else who has the same reaction to exercise. I've been observing it for at least the past 7 years.  Zyrtec and Flonase provided tremendous relief for about 1 week after I started taking them a few months ago. The effect has since diminished and they're no longer effective.  I never appreciated it until I started paying attention and felt the difference initially created by Zyrtec and Flonase, but I spend most of life quite congested. Even during the summer months.  Noticeably increased congestion when I lie down. Worse when on my right than left side.  Adderall 5mg provides almost immediate relief. Eliminates all mental and physical symptoms (think clearly, look far less tired, and my face debloats completely). I don't like using it and do so very infrequently, when necessary. I've been working through a prescription I've had since May and I don't intend to refill it. I looked it up and was surprised to discover that one effect of Adderall is to improve breathing. Anecdotally, I do feel less congested when I take it.  Walking or moving in general will resolve symptoms, physical and mental, for the duration of the movement. However, they will often resume as soon as I'm stationary again.  Drinking any hot beverage causes swelling.  More generally, high heat seems to make all symptoms much worse (particularly dark eyes, swelling, and fatigue).  Sometimes experience dizziness/lightheadedness moving from sitting to standing.  5-10 minutes of conscious deep breathing seems to resolve symptoms for a short time.  Constraining my throat in any way increases brain fog and facial swelling (two cases in which I've noticed this: barber cape when getting a haircut and wearing a tight collar on shirts). I've seen one ENT already and he observed a deviated septum in both nostrils and a swollen tonsil (that latter is an acute issue; wasn't present in a physical examination done a month prior). Are there any other ways for the airway to be obstructed that I should be thinking about testing? Do the above symptoms line up with an ENT problem? I think many of them are likely related to obstructive sleep apnea as well. I have a sleep test and an appointment with a second ENT already scheduled.

For the past 2 years, he has been going through medical issues. Different things, one after another. He was a perfectly healthy 27 year old, and then out of no where, all this stuff hit him at once. He has seen so many doctors, that Ive lost count. Hes been on medical leave for almost 2 years now (with a short break in between where we thought he was okay, but then something ELSE popped up) As his partner, it really scares me that no one can diagnose what hes going through and we really want some resolve Ill start from the beginning, but Ill try not to make this too long. It started off with him having bowel issues. He would go to the bathroom 9-10 times a day. Sometimes he would be in the bathroom for half an hour. We thought maybe it was IBS. Maybe Crohns Disease. Eventually, they did a colonoscopy and an endoscopy and they found inflammation in his intestines. Gave him meds, and now the inflammation is gone and we dont worry about that anymore. However  during this time of his bowel issues  he also started getting chest pain, and side/flank pain. After his bowel issues resolved, his side pain is gone, but he still gets random chest pain. No one can figure out why. They did x-rays and EKGs on his heart. Its all good. I looked some stuff up and thought maybe it was pleurisy? Doctors said, very vaguely, he has inflammation in his muscles. One doctor chalked it up to asthma. Another said it was anxiety (which he doesnt have). The only thing that seems to help temporarily is going to a chiropractic neurologist who helps him stretch his chest out. That, plus applying heat to the area. However, it doesnt resolve the issue permanently, and STILL no one can tell us WHAT exactly it is and what is causing the pain. It comes and goes in waves. Fast forward to this past July  he got an ear infection. Didnt worry about it too much. However, he was complaining of INSANE ear pain. We put garlic oil and a couple homemade remedies in his ear to try to help still thinking the pain was from an ear ache. Eventually after a week or so, we took him to the doctor for the second time and they told us that the ear infection was gone. Ok  so what is causing the pain? They said perhaps its a damaged nerve. So they referred him to a neurologist. First one told him it was all in his head Needless to say, we were NOT happy hearing that. So he started seeing a different neurologist. This new neurologist says MAYBE its migraines. From what hes telling me, what hes feeling is like lightning shocks of pain in his face. They come on unexpectedly out of the blue, then it subsides. Aside from that, sometimes the left side of his face just hurts and he says it feels like his left eye is bigger or feelings like its coming out, due to the pain only on one side of his face. Hes got blood work done, xrays, a brain scan.. Nothing. We thought MAYBE it was an autoimmune disease? So he tested for a bunch. All came back negative. Cancer came back negative. While all of these tests coming back negative is a great relief because it tells us what he doesnt have  it also causes a lot of grief because NOTHING is telling us what he DOES have. And as if that isnt enough  he recently started getting random leg pain. Every day. His legs will be so sore to the point where he doesnt want to move. He CAN move, but he doesnt want to. All were hearing is a lot of guesses, but NO DIAGNOSES. Neurologist says maybe its a migraine thats so bad that its affecting his legs.. But, I just dont think this is a migraine. So to sum up: Hes suffering from random chest pains that come and go, face paint on one side of his face, and extreme leg soreness. Were at the end of our rope here. I found Mayo Clinic and I know they deal with rare conditions. Ive read articles where people who havent been able to get diagnoses for years, and then they go to Mayo Clinic and get a diagnoses within a week of being there. Were so fed up with the doctors where we live and having no answers. Is it worth the trip to come out to the Mayo Clinic?? Liked by Jamie Olson, Lisa Lucier Follow Report"

For the past 2 years, he has been going through medical issues. Different things, one after another. He was a perfectly healthy 27 year old, and then out of no where, all this stuff hit him at once. He has seen so many doctors, that Ive lost count. Hes been on medical leave for almost 2 years now (with a short break in between where we thought he was okay, but then something ELSE popped up) As his partner, it really scares me that no one can diagnose what hes going through and we really want some resolve Ill start from the beginning, but Ill try not to make this too long. It started off with him having bowel issues. He would go to the bathroom 9-10 times a day. Sometimes he would be in the bathroom for half an hour. We thought maybe it was IBS. Maybe Crohns Disease. Eventually, they did a colonoscopy and an endoscopy and they found inflammation in his intestines. Gave him meds, and now the inflammation is gone and we dont worry about that anymore. However  during this time of his bowel issues  he also started getting chest pain, and side/flank pain. After his bowel issues resolved, his side pain is gone, but he still gets random chest pain. No one can figure out why. They did x-rays and EKGs on his heart. Its all good. I looked some stuff up and thought maybe it was pleurisy? Doctors said, very vaguely, he has inflammation in his muscles. One doctor chalked it up to asthma. Another said it was anxiety (which he doesnt have). The only thing that seems to help temporarily is going to a chiropractic neurologist who helps him stretch his chest out. That, plus applying heat to the area. However, it doesnt resolve the issue permanently, and STILL no one can tell us WHAT exactly it is and what is causing the pain. It comes and goes in waves. Fast forward to this past July  he got an ear infection. Didnt worry about it too much. However, he was complaining of INSANE ear pain. We put garlic oil and a couple homemade remedies in his ear to try to help still thinking the pain was from an ear ache. Eventually after a week or so, we took him to the doctor for the second time and they told us that the ear infection was gone. Ok  so what is causing the pain? They said perhaps its a damaged nerve. So they referred him to a neurologist. First one told him it was all in his head Needless to say, we were NOT happy hearing that. So he started seeing a different neurologist. This new neurologist says MAYBE its migraines. From what hes telling me, what hes feeling is like lightning shocks of pain in his face. They come on unexpectedly out of the blue, then it subsides. Aside from that, sometimes the left side of his face just hurts and he says it feels like his left eye is bigger or feelings like its coming out, due to the pain only on one side of his face. Hes got blood work done, xrays, a brain scan.. Nothing. We thought MAYBE it was an autoimmune disease? So he tested for a bunch. All came back negative. Cancer came back negative. While all of these tests coming back negative is a great relief because it tells us what he doesnt have  it also causes a lot of grief because NOTHING is telling us what he DOES have. And as if that isnt enough  he recently started getting random leg pain. Every day. His legs will be so sore to the point where he doesnt want to move. He CAN move, but he doesnt want to. All were hearing is a lot of guesses, but NO DIAGNOSES. Neurologist says maybe its a migraine thats so bad that its affecting his legs.. But, I just dont think this is a migraine. So to sum up: Hes suffering from random chest pains that come and go, face paint on one side of his face, and extreme leg soreness. Were at the end of our rope here.

It only occurs when I sleep, and I been suffering for years. Been to a couple of Dr's they check my ears and go they look fine. There is notjing wrong. I wake up in the middle of the night, from my ears itching like crazy, my right ear more than my left. One Doc gave me medicine for swimmers ear. It doesnt work. So recently, took it upon myself to take two benadryl tablets before bed. Well that seems to help. My ears stop itching and draining while sleeping. Could I have an allergy causing this? Cause it just seems odd that the Benadyl works. Is it even ok to take Benadryl on a daily basis? Follow Report"

I, like a few others, have a real saga going on here. Started about 4 years ago with, what I thought, was post-nasal drip. I then felt unwell and lost about 40-45 lbs. Had a bilateral oopherectomy and had major stomach problems after that. During this time, I also started suffering from dry mouth and throat issues. To make a very long story shorter, I have since developed chronic dry mouth and throat with a feeling of a mucus-type feeling from behind my left sinus, plugged ear now and down my throat. It is now constant and has kept me almost house-bound. Like I said, a long story but I have had some other symptoms and have seen multiple ENT docs, had biopsies and scopes done and no diagnosis. The tissue in my mouth and throat just doesnt feel right. I often have a coating on my tongue. This is now causing gum recession and my top teeth are loose. I need a gum graft but cant even imagine how I would get through that with the mouth and throat problems. Ive had numerous blood testing done along with CT scans and MRIs, colonoscopy and recently a cardiovascular angiogram and they just cannot find anything specific. Ive had blood work and 2 biopsies done for Sjorgens, which were negative. I do have thyroid nodules which have been scanned and biopsies twice. Luckily, no malignancy and they say this is not causing my problem,. I feel generally unwell daily now always conscious of my dry mouth and throat and problems swallowing. My ENT docs have pretty much dumped me saying they cant do any more for me and dont know what is wrong. My dentists dont know whats wrong. My latest appt was a self-referral to UCSF Oral Medicine clinic, which I researched on the Internet. The doc I was supposed to see was out for the day so saw another. He said the glands under my chin are producing saliva but, doing a collection test and exam, he says I am producing very little saliva and he could get next to none from the Parotid glands. He suggested I try an anti-fungal logenge for two weeks, which I just started today and hope I dont have side effects from it. Ive had more problems with meds they try to give me so I just take Alprazolam (Xanax) as needed at a very low dose, like 1/2 of a .5 mg tab twice a day. Yesterday was a bad mouth/throat/swallowing day so I took an extra 1/2 tab. I have been on this medication for about 4 years now. Cutting down has not improved the mouth and throat issues. Ive had some stomach issues through all this. I started to break out in petechia and puprua (?) which the docs say is normal and attribute to my age, 62. Seemed to happen rather suddenly. Had my doc check my clotting factor and it was normal. Endocronologist put me on Vit D for Osteo and my doc put me on B-12, which is normal now. Except for some Tums or Pepto on occasion, that is all I take. I just constantly feel plugged up, feeling of mucus in my throat and just generally feel unwell, to the point that I want to go to the ER but, like my husband says, what the hell are they going to find or do? I also have a slight feeling of nausea almost all the time. I can eat and swallow, hard time with pills, and I can taste. I am at my wits end with this. How can people get these odd diseases diagnosed and nobody can figure this out? Someone suggested I see an infectious disease specialist (which is about the only one I havent seen). I did insist my PCP do a culture of my nose and throat for staph, as my husband had an infection about the time this all started with me. It was negative. Some of these tests havent been done for a while but, like I said, the docs are pretty much giving up on me. One suggested I try acupuncture, which I did. It helped my sciatic pain but not the mouth and throat issues. Yes, Ive gone for counseling and saw two psychiatrists who do not feel this is a psychiatric issue. One said hopefully Ill get lucky and find a doc who can figure this out. Most of the ENT docs want to blame it on GERD, which I have been tested for and treated for with no change. Last doc at Stanford told me to stop the Nexium as, while taking it, I had a rib fracture. It never made a difference anyway. All this causes me anxiety on bad days and is driving me nuts and affecting family members. I can understand that.

Ive had numerous blood testing done along with CT scans and MRIs, colonoscopy and recently a cardiovascular angiogram and they just cannot find anything specific. Ive had blood work and 2 biopsies done for Sjorgens, which were negative. I do have thyroid nodules which have been scanned and biopsies twice. Luckily, no malignancy and they say this is not causing my problem,. I feel generally unwell daily now always conscious of my dry mouth and throat and problems swallowing. My ENT docs have pretty much dumped me saying they cant do any more for me and dont know what is wrong. My dentists dont know whats wrong. My latest appt was a self-referral to UCSF Oral Medicine clinic, which I researched on the Internet. The doc I was supposed to see was out for the day so saw another. He said the glands under my chin are producing saliva but, doing a collection test and exam, he says I am producing very little saliva and he could get next to none from the Parotid glands. He suggested I try an anti-fungal logenge for two weeks, which I just started today and hope I dont have side effects from it. Ive had more problems with meds they try to give me so I just take Alprazolam (Xanax) as needed at a very low dose, like 1/2 of a .5 mg tab twice a day. Yesterday was a bad mouth/throat/swallowing day so I took an extra 1/2 tab. I have been on this medication for about 4 years now. Cutting down has not improved the mouth and throat issues. Ive had some stomach issues through all this. I started to break out in petechia and puprua (?) which the docs say is normal and attribute to my age, 62. Seemed to happen rather suddenly. Had my doc check my clotting factor and it was normal. Endocronologist put me on Vit D for Osteo and my doc put me on B-12, which is normal now. Except for some Tums or Pepto on occasion, that is all I take. I just constantly feel plugged up, feeling of mucus in my throat and just generally feel unwell, to the point that I want to go to the ER but, like my husband says, what the hell are they going to find or do? I also have a slight feeling of nausea almost all the time. I can eat and swallow, hard time with pills, and I can taste. I am at my wits end with this. How can people get these odd diseases diagnosed and nobody can figure this out? Someone suggested I see an infectious disease specialist (which is about the only one I havent seen). I did insist my PCP do a culture of my nose and throat for staph, as my husband had an infection about the time this all started with me. It was negative. Some of these tests havent been done for a while but, like I said, the docs are pretty much giving up on me. One suggested I try acupuncture, which I did. It helped my sciatic pain but not the mouth and throat issues. Yes, Ive gone for counseling and saw two psychiatrists who do not feel this is a psychiatric issue. One said hopefully Ill get lucky and find a doc who can figure this out. Most of the ENT docs want to blame it on GERD, which I have been tested for and treated for with no change. Last doc at Stanford told me to stop the Nexium as, while taking it, I had a rib fracture. It never made a difference anyway. All this causes me anxiety on bad days and is driving me nuts and affecting family members. I can understand that. You get to retirement age, think you are going to enjoy some traveling and then this happens. Any ideas? I am truly at the end of my rope with this. Follow Report"

I have been dealing with whatever is going on in my body now for 7 months. It all started back towards the end of Dec 2010. By the begining of Jan 2011, I started loosing weight. My glands in my neck begin to swell, my skin itches so bad that sometimes I have to take Benedryl to help. Now fastforward to July, I have lost almost 7 pounds (I only weigh 90 pds right now, started at like 97-98 pds 50.) The glands that are now swollen have spread to under my arms, and my bikini area. I get these cramps in my stomach (had a hysterectomy 2 years ago) and get bloated after eating. I went to an endocronologist in March and he was no help. He did a thyriod scan of my neck which showed a small nodule (hyperochoic), a ct scan which showed small probably bengin lymph nodes all through my neck. He refused to do a bioposy due to the nodlue being so small so he sent me elsewhere. Middle of May I went to a thyroid specalist who told me it may be my thyroid and it just quit or something. So at the begining of June she did an ultra sound of my neck, told me that she did not see the thyroid nodlue anymore but on the ultra sound report she clearly states a .6 cm something in my right lobe area. Her indication is a cervical adneopathy and recommened a bioposy. Since this appt, she has now told myprimary that she thinks it is Hashmotosis thyroiditist but given that I have dealt with this for almost 7 months, for further evualtaion be done. He refused saying that I just need to take an asprin for the next 3 months and come in again to re evaluate my thyroid levels. As you can imagine this frustrates me. My thyroid levels are fine (armour thyroid for hypothyriod for about 2 years), Since I am still loosing weight and having the itchy skin and now with they lymph nodes swelling more, I am very concerned.

I apologize up front for the length of this post as well as jumping around. Two years ago,I was sitting at a baseball stadium outside when I started to feel strange and then had the tunnel darkness start in my peripheral vision. I don't remember anything then until there was a woman standing in front of me talking to me. I couldn't hear her at first, just see her. It was reported that I just slumped over in my chair, my eyes were open and moving, but I was not responding. Once I could hear her, I stood up and tried to leave. I immediately felt weak and nauseous. A wheelchair was brought to where I was and I was taken to the medical office. The medical staff at the field began the questions and I couldn't remember important details such as how old I was, medications I take(I took one for 18 years prior and couldn't remember), etc. Paramedics arrived to assess. I began to vomit and feel shaky and very unsteady. At the field they took my blood sugar, pulse, and blood pressure. Everything was good but my pressure was up a bit. I was taken to an acute care clinic where I was still vomiting and too incoherent for them to see so they sent me to the ER. At the ER they did the stroke test which was difficult for me but I could do it. I really had to think about it. The doctor accused me of faking how difficult it was. I had a CT scan done with everything looking normal. He diagnosed me with an anxiety attack, which the paramedics had diagnosed me with at the park. He instructed me to follow up with my own doctor. I began taking anti-anxiety meds, and 1 month later while sitting at my desk after finishing my lunch, I felt the same feeling right before losing consciousness the first time so looked at my coworker and try to ask for help. The same thing happened, my head was down on my arms, my eyes were open and moving but I was not there. I was taken by ambulance to the ER where I was had an EKG done, blood work, monitoring, and then fitted with a heart monitor for 72 hours. Nothing showed up on the heart monitor. My PA then ordered a series of tests including an MRI, EEG, tilt test, and EMG. I began seeing a neurologist who ordered more tests. All came back fine. I saw a neuropsychologist who ran tests on me as well that came back that I was fine. I had a couple of different episodes after where I felt like I had had a spell but hadn't lost consciousness and my blood pressure went very high. I was put on blood pressure medication. All test results showed that I was healthy. With doctors thinking it was anxiety/stress, I chose to change jobs at the end of that year. I gave up caffeine, carbonated drinks, changed my diet, and began exercising more consistently, saw a therapist to work through childhood trauma, and prioritized myself in my life. Thirteen months after the previous ""spell"", I was sitting at my desk at the end of the day and I started to feel what I have come to know as an aura again. I tried to talk to my coworker but couldn't say anything, and my head went down on my desk. The paramedics were called but I did not go with them. That spell felt as though I had to fight hard to come out of it and was significantly more scary, for lack of a more medical term. After that, I was taken off of the blood pressure meds and anti-anxiety meds as they seemed to be treating after symptoms rather than the cause of the problem. I saw a cardiologist who referred me to a neurologist specializing in seizures interestingly enough. The cardiologist noted that on one of my MRI scans there was an area that was showing slowed activity. That neurologist reluctantly suggested I begin seizure medication but my regular neurologist overruled and said that there wasn't enough to justify my taking that medication. The next tests that were ordered were two sleep studies, one in my home and one in a facility. The company that does the ones in my home closed and so were not able to administer the test. The one in a facility, tey wanted $1400 up front to run the test and we could not afford to pay so haven't had that test done. I saw an endocrinologist as well, and my thyroid levels were checked and adjusted. I was just cleared last week from seeing the endocrinologist again for another year. My blood pressure was good, heart rate was good. I have lost weight. I completed a half marathon this past spring and was readying myself for another in November. A little over a year since the last one, and I had a fourth spell 4 days ago. Once again, I had been moving around doing my job and came back to my desk to send a quick email and felt the aura. Thinking it might help if I moved again, I stood up and started to walk. Realizing that it wasn't going to help, I told my coworker that I was going to pass out and to help me. I then sat down and my head laid down on my arms. She reported that all color drained from my face and my skin looked yellowish. She thought I had passed away. I had been feeling the best I have felt in years health-wise, mentally, and emotionally when this spell occurred. The following things have happened each time: It feels like picture in picture as I feel it coming on  like I am in the present but there is some sort of activity, sound, movement that is going on at the same time. While in the spell, there is activity, thoughts, dreams, what have you, going on in my head, but i am not in my surroundings. Once I regain consciousness, I am unaware of where I am, confused, struggle to find my words, nauseous, and upset. After the first spell when I couldn't remember things, I feel as though I consciously try to remember things and do somewhat better, but still struggle with important information when being asked. Initially, I can sit upright and answer questions but within a minute or so, I am weak, shaky, and feel very sleepy. I will either vomit or dry heave. I struggle with my words and staying awake. Once I have been settled in and left alone, I sleep hard for 45 minutes or an hour. It takes me a couple of days to fully regain my strength,often sleeping the entire day after an event. I am also in a brain fog for at least 24-36 hours struggling to find my words and understand what people are saying to me. The time immediately after a spell I can remember faces of people, and how I felt about what they were saying but only remember bits of what was said. Still today, I can only remember 3 or 4 things said to me four days ago, but can't remember anything else. In this process, I have had people that were with me at the time write up their recollection of what happened as soon after as possible. Many report seeing the same things. They don't last a long time, 30 seconds to a minute and a half. An addition to this episode that wasn't noted previously is that throughout the day of this most recent spell, I had great difficulty hanging onto things. I kept dropping things even though I had a good hold of them. I am an educated professional and not wanting to take more meds and I hate missing work. I may be grasping at straws in trying to think of any detail that may be important. II am struggling to find a path to answers so I thought that maybe someone on this site could help me.

We were sent to a neurologist last year and had a sleep deprived EEG which came back normal and then we were sent to a sleep specialist and had two sleep studies done. The first one came back abnormal and the second one normal. The sleep specialist put him on concerta to keep him awake in school. This made things worse, because he started having these episodes while walking. They decided to admit him to the hospital and they had a team of specialists working with him. They did another sleep deprived EEG and it came back abnormal and so they diagnosed him with primary generalized epilepsy. I guess he doesnt have the normal symptoms of a seizure and they think it is brought on by him not getting quality sleep at night even though he sleeps through the night. They are not doing anything for the sleep and they put him on seizure medication. He has been home from the hospital and is still having these episodes during the day at school. I am confused and concerned if he is being treated correctly. I feel like we are so alone, because he doesnt present normal symptoms. I am looking for help and a better understanding of all of this. Since this has all started he is not the same happy little boy he use to be. I want a better understanding of all of this, so I can help him. Follow Report"

I've had a seizure were I'm having a normal conversation with someone and nothing is out of the ordinary. Since I was 12 I've had two seizures an hour apart or two seizure in one month then the following month. Recently, I had one in April and then another one in June with no physical reason. I eat healthy and I workout for 45 to 60 minutes everyday. The theory is I'm having seizures based on my hormones. I've had 3 CAT scans, 1 MRI, and countless EEG's. All my EEG's show I have abnormal spikes in my brain and if I get a high spike over the threshold line I will have a seizure. The only thing my Neurologist has been doing is writing my prescription for the same medication I've been taking since my seizures started. I'm at the max dose of my medication and yet still had a seizure while on the max dose. I've been to several doctors who aren't Neurologist to see if something else is causing me to have a seizure and no one can tell me anything because they aren't willing to think outside the box.

I'm lucky however compared to other people who have epilepsy because I'm not having them everyday and not having several seizures throughout the day, so I'm very lucky with the amount of seizures I have.

Her EEGs are all normal. I am a nurse and the seizure activity appears real ( no way that someone can fake it), but she never has any kind of incontinence & she seems to be aware of what went on after the seizure. The seizures last a few minutes and seem to be getting longer, but a little less frequent. She seems to have some control over them. She does have a lot of stress going on in her life. Her parents divorced about 2 years ago and her mother moved in with her boyfriend shortly before the seizure activity started. the boyfriend and his wife separated and divorced about the same time and they had been family friends. My son ( her dad) is not in a relationship. She has 2 older brothers and a younger brother. She is very close to her family, especially the oldest brother, he is in the Navy and deployed to Japan just after the seizures started. She has been dealing with chronic severe pelvic pain for several years. She seems to have some control over when the seizures occur. She has them in school, but rarely at a school function ( sporting event/concert etc.) She has never had one when she is with me or her aunt ( my daughter), unless the rest of the family is present. She has them much less frequently when she is with her dad 3-5 days/week ( alternating weeks) & then they are usually only at night ( when her dad does not see them). When she is with her mom they average 3-4/day according to her mom. Her mother seems to like the attention that she gets and talks about her condition on social media. My granddaughter is completely under the control of her mom and show contempt for her dad if he tries to get involved. She even refused to continue to going to her primary care MD because she wanted her dad to come to her appointments. She was seen at Childrens Hospital in Omaha when the seizures started but the neurologist pretty much signed off after the EEG was normal :(. She is now seeing a different neurologist and they are trying to get her into a 3 day seizure study. The seizure that she had at our house on Christmas caused her to lose feeling and activity on her left side & she had slurred speech for about 20 minutes afterwards. I guess this is pretty common now. She is no longer attending school ( doing her work online). She is a very good student. Her personality has changed so much. She is now very manipulative insecure, and needs constant attention. My daughter (nurse also) & I treat her just like the rest of the grandkids and try not to make it all about her We do not really respond to the seizure activity like everyone else, but it does scare me. She use to be so outgoing with many friends & now most of them are moving on. It is so sad. She is a beautiful smart girl & it just seems like her life is going down the drain. She is seeing a counselor (a friend of her mother). Her original primary care doctor wanted her to go to a trauma psychiatrist with both parents being involved, but she refused. We all live in the same small city so have always been a close family. I am so frustrated and feel so helpless. Her mother is convinced she has a severe medical condition, but it appears to all the rest of us that is all phycological. None of us dare say anything as her mother will just change doctors & turn her against us. I am sorry for the long post, but just hoping someone may have some insight. Thank you.

So i havent taken it in almost 2 weeks and i also have epilepsy and take Briviact, Onfi, Lyrica, Buspar(anxiety) and medical cannibas for epilepsy. I have been having many seizures..complex partials, extreme anxiety, racing thoughts, alot about dying whether its me, or my husband, my sons, my chihuahua, my momsomebody close to me and it just wont stop!! My heart feels like its going to jump out of my chest, its just a roller coaster of ups and downs all day all night long. I dont work because of my uncontrolled seizures and im home all day by myself. Ive torn my house apart looking for that med. My memory is awful from having brain surgery, seizures, the meds im on doesnt help at all im sure. Ive talked to my neuro about it to see if theres anything she can do for me or have any suggestions andnothing! I cant get it refilled until April 2nd. Im trying to get through this until then but I dont know how much longer I can do this..has this happened to anybody else? The buspar doesnt do anything the medical cannabis does absolutely nothing for my seizures anxiety..im so scared!!!! Thank you in advance for letting me ramble on. Please help!!!

No known medical issues other than being overweight and wearing glasses. In fact I have undergone a large number of blood tests lately and all came back great. Lately I have been dealing with some health issues that my doctor is unsure of. After doing some research, I brought up the idea that I might have epilepsy with simple focal seizures. She (my doctor) seemed skeptical, but open to the idea, and said she would put in for an EEG (I havent heard back yet, this was about two weeks ago). I was wondering about hearing any thoughts on if this is a valid idea to look into, or if I am bringing up ideas that can get in the way of finding out what I have been dealing with? The reasons the idea of focal seizure epilepsy are as follows: For years now I have maybe 2-3 times a day instances of being light headed. It isnt so much as getting dizzy, but more like I could fall over, man times feeling like I am in a dream and not real life. I would say maybe about 25% of the time I see a small flash of streak of white or red light(s) right as this happens. More often however I see movement out of the corner of my eye, almost like a shadow. To be honest, sometimes they scare me, because its almost human shaped, but many times looks more like a cat zipping out of the way. This happens usually randomly, but commonly at work or at night outside. Usually I can snap out of these light headed spells (wait them out until I come back to normal, or keep thinking to myself this is real, dont fall, this is real, dont fall, that seem to last 8-10 seconds. But lately I started to pass out. In the last three weeks I have passed out three times. The first two were at work, the third while I was grocery shopping. First two times I was out for 10-15 seconds (third time I fell into a battery display and was caught by my spouse who shook me and wasnt out as long), and when I would come to I would be in a fog the rest of the day, and would always wake up feeling like I was going to throw up. I usually couldnt remember the last 20 seconds or so before that happened. I would also have the worst headache the next day that no matter how much medicine I would take, wouldnt go away. Visited ER first time (found nothing, then had follow up visit with doctor where she put in a referral to a Cardiologist for end of October). Second time visited walk-in clinic (it was the weekend) at my Dr. office, that doctor took away my drivers license and ordered an MRI. Third time saw no one as it would be redundant and they said dont come in unless I hit my head (I didnt). In doing research, other signs I have notice that could point to focal seizures are my bad sleep walking. But unlike what most sleep walkers deal with, I remember most of what happens when I sleep walk. The people I think I am talking to and our conversations (Why is Justin sitting on the end of my bed talking about work at 2AM!), the horrible creatures I see staring in my window at me that arent real but scare me, sleep eating, going for walks around the neighborhood, etc. Sometimes if we are entertaining I have go to bed early as I work early, and I will come out like an hour or two later and interact with them all, and I remember much of it as if it was a dream, but it was what I was really doing. I have read where this is a possible sign of focal seizures in your sleep. This has been a problem since my early teenage years Since I was maybe 12 or 13ish I have had this stupid problem my family use to make fun of me, where I would feel this wave come up from my left arm, and shoot up to my head that would make me involuntary jerk my head and neck. This still happens, but is never often, maybe once a week or so. I have a Great Aunt with epilepsy (but hers are absence seizures), and have read where having meningitis can increase your risk for it (I had bacterial meningitis at age 2), but as far as other risk factors I dont know of any I have. Some things to make me think this is just me over thinking this issue (besides my doctor not seeming to be too keen on the idea) are:1) Why would I start passing out only in the last three weeks if I have had these light headed spells for a few years now?2) The walk-in Dr. I saw said I have a left eye deviation when I have to follow his finger to my nose. Never read anything where that could be a sign. This is something new and had never been mentioned by my eye Dr. before.3) During these light headed spells, I dont shake or jerk or anything. I also dont lose my ability to talk normally either. They also seem too short time wise when they happen. Anyhow, thank you for reading my long post. I would be thankful for any thoughts you all had if Im justified in thinking this could be related to epilepsy or if this sounds like an unrelated issue.

Usually I can snap out of these light headed spells (wait them out until I come back to normal, or keep thinking to myself this is real, dont fall, this is real, dont fall, that seem to last 8-10 seconds. But lately I started to pass out. In the last three weeks I have passed out three times. The first two were at work, the third while I was grocery shopping. First two times I was out for 10-15 seconds (third time I fell into a battery display and was caught by my spouse who shook me and wasnt out as long), and when I would come to I would be in a fog the rest of the day, and would always wake up feeling like I was going to throw up. I usually couldnt remember the last 20 seconds or so before that happened. I would also have the worst headache the next day that no matter how much medicine I would take, wouldnt go away. Visited ER first time (found nothing, then had follow up visit with doctor where she put in a referral to a Cardiologist for end of October). Second time visited walk-in clinic (it was the weekend) at my Dr. office, that doctor took away my drivers license and ordered an MRI. Third time saw no one as it would be redundant and they said dont come in unless I hit my head (I didnt). In doing research, other signs I have notice that could point to focal seizures are my bad sleep walking. But unlike what most sleep walkers deal with, I remember most of what happens when I sleep walk. The people I think I am talking to and our conversations (Why is Justin sitting on the end of my bed talking about work at 2AM!), the horrible creatures I see staring in my window at me that arent real but scare me, sleep eating, going for walks around the neighborhood, etc. Sometimes if we are entertaining I have go to bed early as I work early, and I will come out like an hour or two later and interact with them all, and I remember much of it as if it was a dream, but it was what I was really doing. I have read where this is a possible sign of focal seizures in your sleep. This has been a problem since my early teenage years Since I was maybe 12 or 13ish I have had this stupid problem my family use to make fun of me, where I would feel this wave come up from my left arm, and shoot up to my head that would make me involuntary jerk my head and neck. This still happens, but is never often, maybe once a week or so. I have a Great Aunt with epilepsy (but hers are absence seizures), and have read where having meningitis can increase your risk for it (I had bacterial meningitis at age 2), but as far as other risk factors I dont know of any I have. Some things to make me think this is just me over thinking this issue (besides my doctor not seeming to be too keen on the idea) are:1) Why would I start passing out only in the last three weeks if I have had these light headed spells for a few years now?2) The walk-in Dr. I saw said I have a left eye deviation when I have to follow his finger to my nose. Never read anything where that could be a sign. This is something new and had never been mentioned by my eye Dr. before.3) During these light headed spells, I dont shake or jerk or anything. I also dont lose my ability to talk normally either. They also seem too short time wise when they happen. Anyhow, thank you for reading my long post. I would be thankful for any thoughts you all had if Im justified in thinking this could be related to epilepsy or if this sounds like an unrelated issue.

I usually couldnt remember the last 20 seconds or so before that happened. I would also have the worst headache the next day that no matter how much medicine I would take, wouldnt go away. Visited ER first time (found nothing, then had follow up visit with doctor where she put in a referral to a Cardiologist for end of October). Second time visited walk-in clinic (it was the weekend) at my Dr. office, that doctor took away my drivers license and ordered an MRI. Third time saw no one as it would be redundant and they said dont come in unless I hit my head (I didnt). In doing research, other signs I have notice that could point to focal seizures are my bad sleep walking. But unlike what most sleep walkers deal with, I remember most of what happens when I sleep walk. The people I think I am talking to and our conversations (Why is Justin sitting on the end of my bed talking about work at 2AM!), the horrible creatures I see staring in my window at me that arent real but scare me, sleep eating, going for walks around the neighborhood, etc. Sometimes if we are entertaining I have go to bed early as I work early, and I will come out like an hour or two later and interact with them all, and I remember much of it as if it was a dream, but it was what I was really doing. I have read where this is a possible sign of focal seizures in your sleep. This has been a problem since my early teenage years Since I was maybe 12 or 13ish I have had this stupid problem my family use to make fun of me, where I would feel this wave come up from my left arm, and shoot up to my head that would make me involuntary jerk my head and neck. This still happens, but is never often, maybe once a week or so. I have a Great Aunt with epilepsy (but hers are absence seizures), and have read where having meningitis can increase your risk for it (I had bacterial meningitis at age 2), but as far as other risk factors I dont know of any I have. Some things to make me think this is just me over thinking this issue (besides my doctor not seeming to be too keen on the idea) are:1) Why would I start passing out only in the last three weeks if I have had these light headed spells for a few years now?2) The walk-in Dr. I saw said I have a left eye deviation when I have to follow his finger to my nose. Never read anything where that could be a sign. This is something new and had never been mentioned by my eye Dr. before.3) During these light headed spells, I dont shake or jerk or anything. I also dont lose my ability to talk normally either. They also seem too short time wise when they happen. Anyhow, thank you for reading my long post. I would be thankful for any thoughts you all had if Im justified in thinking this could be related to epilepsy or if this sounds like an unrelated issue.

No known medical issues other than being overweight and wearing glasses. In fact I have undergone a large number of blood tests lately and all came back great. Lately I have been dealing with some health issues that my doctor is unsure of. After doing some research, I brought up the idea that I might have epilepsy with simple focal seizures. She (my doctor) seemed skeptical, but open to the idea, and said she would put in for an EEG (I havent heard back yet, this was about two weeks ago). I was wondering about hearing any thoughts on if this is a valid idea to look into, or if I am bringing up ideas that can get in the way of finding out what I have been dealing with? The reasons the idea of focal seizure epilepsy are as follows: For years now I have maybe 2-3 times a day instances of being light headed. It isnt so much as getting dizzy, but more like I could fall over, man times feeling like I am in a dream and not real life. I would say maybe about 25% of the time I see a small flash of streak of white or red light(s) right as this happens. More often however I see movement out of the corner of my eye, almost like a shadow. To be honest, sometimes they scare me, because its almost human shaped, but many times looks more like a cat zipping out of the way. This happens usually randomly, but commonly at work or at night outside. Usually I can snap out of these light headed spells (wait them out until I come back to normal, or keep thinking to myself this is real, dont fall, this is real, dont fall, that seem to last 8-10 seconds. But lately I started to pass out. In the last three weeks I have passed out three times. The first two were at work, the third while I was grocery shopping. First two times I was out for 10-15 seconds (third time I fell into a battery display and was caught by my spouse who shook me and wasnt out as long), and when I would come to I would be in a fog the rest of the day, and would always wake up feeling like I was going to throw up.

This msy be funny but the first time that ive hurt my head was when i got tackled but this big guy(he was twice my size) in gym class, this was when i was 13-14(weighed less than 100), and i smacked my head on the hard floor, i thought i was fine but apparently i wasnt. by the time turn 15 over the year i would notice i would stared off a lot, and i had an accident where i was running in the dark outside in a field and got choked by rope and knocked out, automatic concussion and again,i thought i was okay, but then when i got to high school it got worst.i was 16 by this time and I would have pounding headaches that would cause me to pass out on numerous occasions and i was honestly scared. but then something happened one day im class. i woke up that day feeling draggy and thought nothing of it, throughout the day i was becoming dizzy and barely understanding things. 4th period last class of the day around 2:30, I had this unbearable headache and I was so dizzy, I dont remember much by my friends told me that I fell out the chair onto the floor and started shaking, and I was like so weird and it freaked me out. Went to the er and they didnt do anything, fast forward to 3-4weeks ago, I went to my boyfriends friends house for a pool party and theyre dog didnt like me and so it lunged at me but I ran away back downstairs and I was panicky and then my boyfriend came down an tried to calm me down, it worked but after I had the pounding headace and I fell down on the bed cupping my head I was so bad and then I sat up and I was so confused everything was like foggy like not double vision but close and my leg which was hanging off the bed began to shake violently and I got this taste i my mouth and I knew i did cuz you know when you eat something thats nasty and I make that face and taste your tongue idk how to explain and it went on for a couple of minutes and my boyfriend kept me in sitting position, I was like I was aware it was happening but I couldnt respond to the questions he would ask and afterwards he layed me down cuz remember feeling so wore and so I fell asleep just like that.

I have a book out called Epilepsy Through A Childs Eyes its about my whole 10-year childhood journey on living with epilepsy and being cured from it.

I wrote her to ask if there was a med i could take during the middle of the day because I was having most of my seizures and auras during that time. I also asked her if the abnormality on my hippocampus was why Im still having seizures despite being on 3 different seizure meds and medical cannabis. She never answered me about the mid day med but said she wanted me to have an MRI. So I did that and it said there were no abnormalities and everything was normal. Back before I had my brain surgery at Shands, I have had MRIs done and none of them showed any abnormalities. The test that did see them was the PET test. 1 on my right frontal lobe and the other on my hippocampus. I have a seizure diary app on my phone to keep up with them and to show my neuro how often im having them. Sometimes I dont even remember logging them in, my concern and constant worry is that im never going to be seizure free. Should i just accept that? Is there anybody else doing the medical cannabis and its not helping them? Oh, and also, I just recently had my 6month appt. with my medical marijuana doc and let her know that i was still having seizures so she recommended that I do 1part cbd and 1 part thc. Tried that and NO THANK YOU!!!!! It made me feel like I was in a constant aura that would not go away, I hated it and never want to do it again!!!! Had a seizure 1 hr after I did it. And have always had seizures after ive done the vape or the oil. It just doesnt help me at all. Nothing is or has!!!! I apologize for this long post but is anybody else out there in a situation like mine?

I am at a loss as to what I should do about my granddaughter. 8 weeks ago I joined this group because my granddaughter was put into a medically-induced coma while the doctors tried to control her seizures. Now 8 weeks later she is still in a coma and the doctors have tried approximately 20 different medicines at different doses. This past week they started electroshock therapy. All they are doing is trying to stop the seizures. They said they cant let her wake up. It could cause brain damage. They arent trying to find out what is causing the seizures or where they are coming from. My son cannot afford to transfer her anywhere else. His insurance wont cover any of that.

I take zonisamide and am trying to lower my dose and do lifestyle changes to combat the seizures. The zonisamide seemed to increase issues with depression, short term memory problems, and issues with words to a level that it just messes with my life. My neurologist has okayed me to decrease again from 300 to 250mg and eventually to 200mg if I feel ok with it. So far its going well. Ive been researching ways that I can improve my health overall and hopefully decrease my likelihood of seizures as well. Last summer I worked with a doctor who did allergy testing. Ive taken 9 foods out of my diet, moved to a more plant based and home cooked diet and have lost 30lbs. I feel a lot better. Recently, I decided to add in coconut oil. Its hard to tell if its doing anything, but I figure whether or not it stops my seizures its probably good for my skin and hair, right? This morning I was running across a number of articles on magnesium levels. I took a look at my health history and didnt find any tests of my magnesium levels, but did find that my sodium and chloride levels have consistently been quite high at least since 2015 when my medical history goes back to online. Im currently taking 350mg of magnesium, but wondering if increasing the dose might help? Anyone with experience with this? Liked by Dawn, Alumna Mentor, Leonard Follow Report"

What makes me angry is the stigma that gores with the word pseudo when people hear the word they think we are faking and that we have control. A couple week-ends ago I went through a series of very bad ones. My daughter ( who was visiting ) said I went through about four of them consecutively and was hallucinating and was unresponsive the whole time. Naturally they called an ambulance who when the medics got there decided that Pseudo seizures didnt warrant taking me into the emergency room. Now, I dont know about the rest of you but I feel they should have had more compassion and took me in. Pseudo or not, a seizure is a seizure and warrants medical attention.

Seizures were a daily part of my everyday life. I lived with Epilepsy for almost 20 years with consistent seizures.I was an army cadet throughout my adolescent years and cadets was my life. I was involved in everything (band, drill, biathlon, rifle teams etc.). I could probably say that in many ways, army cadets helped me through those years. As a result, my dream was to join the Canadian Forces in some capacity when I was an adult. Either full-time, as a part-time reservist or as a CIC officer (Cadet Instructor Cadre). As time went on, my desire to join the Canadian Forces only became stronger. Until one day, when my Mom and guidance counsellor had to sit down with me to inform me that the possibility of joining the Canadian Forces was not an option for me because of my Epilepsy.In my last year of high school, once again my medication had starting failing. By this time, I had been on many different Epilepsy medications for the years as I had lived with Epilepsy for almost 20 years. My seizures were becoming more frequent and my neurologist starting looking at other options as medications were not working. One year later, after my first year of university, I was sent to an Epilepsy Unit in London Ontario for an observation to see if I would be a possible candidate for Epilepsy Surgery. After several observations and tests, I was able to have the surgery and on July 25, 2001, MY LIFE CHANGED. My trials were not over and I had to overcome other trials such as the medication withdrawal and minor loss of certain functions.When I came home, I had applied to the Canadian Forces right away after my operation, but I was still rejected because you have to go so many years without a seizure and without seizure medication. As a result, I continued to work with different cadet units as a Civilian Instructor. To this day, I have been almost 16 years seizure free and roughly 5 years ago, I re-applied to the Canadian Forces as a CIC officer. It was a slow process and took a few years because of my medical history and I had to go through a rigorous medical review. I remember calling every few months and checking in and the response was often, we havent heard anything or we are still waiting. However, it was worth the wait because I will never forget the day I received the call from the Canadian Forces recruitment center wanting to make an appointment for my interview, which was the next step in the process because I had finally been medically approved. I cant verbally describe what I felt that day and I knew I was about to start a new chapter in my life. PrestigiousI feel like I have been given a second chance at life and since my operation. I have been able to accomplish things I would have never thought possible. I completed university with three degrees (B.A, B.ED and my M.A). Besides being a part-time Canadian Forces Officer, I am a full time teacher. I know for many, everyday things like driving a car doesnt seem like a big deal, but there are many times I get into my car and remember the conversation my Mom had with me when I was a young teenager and she told me that I will not be able to get my license as a result of my seizures.Today, I live a new life and even though I am very proud of the things I have been able to accomplish, my biggest accomplishment would be my acceptance into the Canadian Forces and I am very proud and honoured to wear a Canadian Forces uniform. A dream that was once impossible has now become possible. Liked by Colleen Young, Connect Director Follow Report"

I was also on lots of meds prior. I recently started to see a new Neurologist in town in Jacksonville, FL and he says it may not be seizures. Right now, its happening only in the middle of the night.My EEG in clinic and MRI were both normal. He wants to do EEG with Video for 72 hrs. My insurance have a high deductible. Does anybody know of any grants that will help pay for it? My insurance also doesnt cover Mayo. Neurologist thinks Its anxiety, depression, etc.. Also, I have told him that I think it increases with stress. There will also be times that I dont have seizures for example: like a year and a half and then it would come back. Its off and on.

I started out with pain in my head, neck and legs, then I also started to have numbness in the saddle region, ringing and swooshing noises in my ears. I am in constant pain throughout my whole body. It is an internal pain that I can not describe. I then couldnt walk to far because it felt like my lower legs were going to tear open. As well as feeling really dizzy and uneasy on my feet. I would go grocery shopping for 30 minutes and within 5 mins of being out shopping I could hardly walk. When I finally got to the car I had to sit sideways in the car seat and then physically lift each leg into the car because I could not lift them. After a while I had full body numbness. So of course not being able to do too much I did gain extra weight. When this first began I was approx 100kg. My GP sent me to Orthopedic doctors, Neurological doctors and gynecologist. No one had an answer. They looked at me as if I was neurotic or a hypochondriac. I knew something wasnt right but the doctors kept saying there was nothing wrong. Also a year and a half ago I have had to start wearing glasses and have had to get them updared every 5-6 months. I got fed up with seeing doctors and all of them telling me I need to lose weight because Im fat. I was caught between a rock and a hard place. Then in June I went to a doctor because I was waking with severe pressure headaches. I am also allergic to anything codeine or opiate based so the only thing I can have is Panadol and Anti Inflammatory meds. The doctor sent me to an Optometrist. They took a photo of my optic nerve and found that I had Papilledema. So I was sent to an Opthalmologist. They confirmed the finding. I have then had CT scans, MRI scans and also a Lumbar Puncture. I am on Diamox. They have also found that I have Empty Sella Syndrome. On Wednesday I presented to the Emergency Department due to having a pop sensation on the left side of my head followed by a sharp pain. I had my Lumbar Puncture last Friday and was discharged that afternoon. I then ended up having to go to the Emergency Department on Sunday due to severe headache, nausea and vomiting. Put on a drip, prescribed Stemetil and sent home. I work, but have had since last Wednesday off due to the pain. I have an extremely high pain threshold due to not being able to have strong painkillers and have battled through and kept working. But I think I am now over my threshlld. My skull feels like it needs to explode open at the back, my neck is so painful and I have limited movement when turning my head. I just need to know is there something I can do to help relieve the pain and pressure. Just wondering if anyone out there has experienced the same or similar. Please any help would be great.

For at least two years I was plagued with the constant irritating presence of gauzy, wispy, moving clumps that would obscure my vision and make reading and driving a tiring challenge. Prior to this I had had cataract surgery and a lens exchange surgery. Many, many follow up appointments and a second opinion did not pinpoint a reason for my continuing complaints. Although I did not complain of dry eyes, I was led to believe that was my issue and was treated with Xiidra and then Restasis and then even both at the same time, with no improvement in my symptoms. Finally a follow up appointment with a new ophthalmologist in the practice and my description of what I was seeing led to a diagnosis of a degenerating vitreous and a referral to a vitreal surgeon. Last week I had a vitrectomy to remove the vitreous. Despite the after effects of the surgery, the next day when the eye patch and bandages came off, I could immediately tell that my vision in that eye had cleared. It has been such a relief! I am hoping my recovery is uneventful and am now anticipating following up with the surgeon to schedule the procedure on my other eye. Has anyone experienced a situation similar to mine? Why would my problem not be recognized and diagnosed sooner? I have wondered if I simply was not able to describe my symptoms well enough or if ophthalmologists tend not to recognize or acknowledge how debilitating the condition can be. I understand that over time and with age the vitreous does degenerate for all people. Do only a few people experience what I did during that process or are there many people experiencing its deleterious effects on their vision and are just living with it, or as in my case, are not able to get a diagnosis from their eye care providers? I should add that I am in my early 70s and was extremely nearsighted my entire life. Anyone out there experience what I did? Liked by dragl1959 Follow Report"

Here's my problem/story I'm 34. A couple weeks ago I woke up one day and after about ten to twenty minutes of being awake I noticed some weird little mark in my vision. It was almost like a little fleck of distortion or something, it's hard to describe. It seemed to be in both eyes although I only tested that aspect of it for a couple minutes. I have never experienced something like that before or since. To give you some idea of how out of the norm this was and how scared it made me, I immediately went to the emergency room to have it checked and I hadn't been to an emergency room as a patient in almost twenty years, so I'm not someone that just goes to the hospital for every little thing. About fifteen to twenty minutes after I got to the ER, so probably 40ish minutes after I noticed the problem, it was gone. The doctors still ran a few tests. They had me do a basic eye test where I read letters off a chart. They shined a light in my eyes and had me track a moving finger. Finally, they gave me a CT scan just to make sure it wasn't a major brain issue like a stroke. They told me they couldn't find any problems, nothing wrong on the CT scan, didn't see signs of a torn retina, etc. They told me to book an appointment with an Optometrist, just to have a specialist do a more thorough follow up, which I have booked, although at the time of this post it's still a week and a half away, so I haven't seen them yet. Then the real problem started. The original eye problem that brought me to the ER, that little distorted spot? It's never come back. I haven't seen it since that one hour in that one day. What did happen in the following days was me being very stressed about what had happened, and becoming hyper-aware of my vision. For me this meant I became more aware of the floaters in my eyes. I've had floaters for years and years, probably most of my adult life, if not longer. Currently, I have three pretty obvious ones in my right eye, one or two obvious ones in my left, and maybe some more light, hard to see ones that I could only find if I really went hunting for them. Floaters are annoying, but I've gotten used to them like most people do and in fact I will go months and months at a time without even thinking about them once. But being hyper-aware of my vision after my ER scare, I paid more attention to them for a few days and was more annoyed by them. Just when I was starting to forget about them one day I was brushing my teeth before bed and looking into the dim hallway I noticed a very weird vision thing. It is really hard for me to put into words, but the best I can say is it's like some kind of visual grain. It feels like it's moving but it might just be rapidly pulsating, I'm not sure. All of a sudden, I noticed that I see it all the time, everywhere, out of both eyes. It is most noticeable when I stare at something blank without much detail: a wall, the floor, ceiling, a towel several feet away, but I can see it on things with detail as well. It's there persistently. It's more noticeable in a darker/dimmer setting but is still very noticeable in normal light levels as well. It's not like a floater, it's not like the weird one time thing sent me to the ER. The closest thing I can compare it to is when you rub your eyes hard and then open them again, your vision is very briefly kind of flickering little levels of light where you rubbed them? Well, imagine that constantly over your vision, only a bit less severe and maybe a finer ""grain"" to it. I've looked up various online pictures and videos that try to approximate what visual snow looks like to people, and none of them really fit. Again, I don't see it in colors, and if it's dots they're so small that I can really even define them as dots. Now, there are three situations where I can make this problem far less noticeable. One, if I focus on something incredibly close up, but I'm talking nearly on my eye, as close as you can get and still focus on something. Two, if I stare at a bright spot, like a white patch of ceiling right next to a light bulb. Three, if I watch something moving with lots of detail, like a TV show, although even there I can see it if I look for it or there's a big patch on the screen of a single color with no detail, so this one might be more of a distraction than anything. In the three or four days since I've discovered this, I've been a wreck. It's all I can focus on. The fact that it's there constantly everywhere and it has some kind of either movement or pulsation really bothers me and I'm worried it's never going away. I've lost my appetite, I'm panicked, I'm depressed, I feel helpless. The funny thing is I can vaguely remember noticing I had some kind of visual ""noise"" years ago, but it was once in a dark room and I had never thought of it again. It's been so long since that time, I can't remember if this is worse or the same as what I noticed then, but I get the feeling this is something I've had for a long time to some degree but was used to it or it progressed so slowly I didn't really notice, but now that I do see it, I can't unsee it. It's all I see. Before I get into my worries/questions I'll also say that I am nearsighted, have been since I was a pre-teen, and I wear glasses. I am in fact long overdue for an optometrist appointment, we're talking years since I've seen one, and I know my vision has gotten somewhat worse and I need a stronger prescription, but it's not been a big issue for me. I still have read, watched TV, lived my life, I just have noticed having to get somewhat closer to things in recent years. So with all that said, these are the worries I have: 1. I have visual snow/static. The only eye condition I can find that even comes close to describing the symptoms I have is visual snow, but I'm unsure if that's even it, which is a big reason why I'm here writing this. I'm looking for you, the people who are definite sufferers of visual snow/static to give me your opinion. The moving nature of it and the ""grain"" jive with your condition, but it is not really dots. It's not colors. The part that does match up is that moving/shimmering/flickering/whatever you want to call it effect, which does feel a little like static. 2. I have some other eye condition I have not found anything else online that comes close to fitting this description, but obviously I'm not an expert. I am still waiting to see the optometrist but the ER doctors did do that basic vision check and didn't notice anything there. 3. There's nothing I can do about it and it's never going to go away This is my biggest fear. I am so scared of the idea that this is just the way my vision will always be now. I know I probably lived with it at some level for some time and didn't notice, but that that I'm aware of it, I can't get used to it. The grain aspect isn't fun but the bigger problem is that feeling that it's moving or flashing or whatever static type thing it's doing. It's so distracting and now that I see it it makes me queasy if I focus on it. It's like I can trust my eyes, nothing is still and that bothers me so much. I'm willing to accept that part of this might be stress related. I have suffered panic attacks in the past and the ER situation did put me in a very scared state about my vision. On the other hand, this has been the only time in my life I've ever worried about my vision in a major way and I do remember noticing years ago that I had something like this to some degree, although again, it's been so long I can't remember how it compares, I just know at the time it was enough to notice but not enough to freak me out like it's doing now. I don't think I'm hallucinating/imagining this out of nothing. Any and all help would be appreciated. Again, I am so stressed right now, this is ruining my life. I am so worried I'm just going to be told that there's nothing to be done or I'm crazy and imagining it. I don't know if I can get used to this. Please help if you have any insight. Follow Report"

Here's my problem/story I'm 34. A couple weeks ago I woke up one day and after about ten to twenty minutes of being awake I noticed some weird little mark in my vision. It was almost like a little fleck of distortion or something, it's hard to describe. It seemed to be in both eyes although I only tested that aspect of it for a couple minutes. I have never experienced something like that before or since. To give you some idea of how out of the norm this was and how scared it made me, I immediately went to the emergency room to have it checked and I hadn't been to an emergency room as a patient in almost twenty years, so I'm not someone that just goes to the hospital for every little thing. About fifteen to twenty minutes after I got to the ER, so probably 40ish minutes after I noticed the problem, it was gone. The doctors still ran a few tests. They had me do a basic eye test where I read letters off a chart. They shined a light in my eyes and had me track a moving finger. Finally, they gave me a CT scan just to make sure it wasn't a major brain issue like a stroke. They told me they couldn't find any problems, nothing wrong on the CT scan, didn't see signs of a torn retina, etc. They told me to book an appointment with an Optometrist, just to have a specialist do a more thorough follow up, which I have booked, although at the time of this post it's still a week and a half away, so I haven't seen them yet. Then the real problem started. The original eye problem that brought me to the ER, that little distorted spot? It's never come back. I haven't seen it since that one hour in that one day. What did happen in the following days was me being very stressed about what had happened, and becoming hyper-aware of my vision. For me this meant I became more aware of the floaters in my eyes. I've had floaters for years and years, probably most of my adult life, if not longer.

It was almost like a little fleck of distortion or something, it's hard to describe. It seemed to be in both eyes although I only tested that aspect of it for a couple minutes. I have never experienced something like that before or since. To give you some idea of how out of the norm this was and how scared it made me, I immediately went to the emergency room to have it checked and I hadn't been to an emergency room as a patient in almost twenty years, so I'm not someone that just goes to the hospital for every little thing. About fifteen to twenty minutes after I got to the ER, so probably 40ish minutes after I noticed the problem, it was gone. The doctors still ran a few tests. They had me do a basic eye test where I read letters off a chart. They shined a light in my eyes and had me track a moving finger. Finally, they gave me a CT scan just to make sure it wasn't a major brain issue like a stroke. They told me they couldn't find any problems, nothing wrong on the CT scan, didn't see signs of a torn retina, etc. They told me to book an appointment with an Optometrist, just to have a specialist do a more thorough follow up, which I have booked, although at the time of this post it's still a week and a half away, so I haven't seen them yet. Then the real problem started. The original eye problem that brought me to the ER, that little distorted spot? It's never come back. I haven't seen it since that one hour in that one day. What did happen in the following days was me being very stressed about what had happened, and becoming hyper-aware of my vision. For me this meant I became more aware of the floaters in my eyes. I've had floaters for years and years, probably most of my adult life, if not longer. Currently, I have three pretty obvious ones in my right eye, one or two obvious ones in my left, and maybe some more light, hard to see ones that I could only find if I really went hunting for them. Floaters are annoying, but I've gotten used to them like most people do and in fact I will go months and months at a time without even thinking about them once. But being hyper-aware of my vision after my ER scare, I paid more attention to them for a few days and was more annoyed by them. Just when I was starting to forget about them one day I was brushing my teeth before bed and looking into the dim hallway I noticed a very weird vision thing. It is really hard for me to put into words, but the best I can say is it's like some kind of visual grain. It feels like it's moving but it might just be rapidly pulsating, I'm not sure. All of a sudden, I noticed that I see it all the time, everywhere, out of both eyes. It is most noticeable when I stare at something blank without much detail: a wall, the floor, ceiling, a towel several feet away, but I can see it on things with detail as well. It's there persistently. It's more noticeable in a darker/dimmer setting but is still very noticeable in normal light levels as well. It's not like a floater, it's not like the weird one time thing sent me to the ER. The closest thing I can compare it to is when you rub your eyes hard and then open them again, your vision is very briefly kind of flickering little levels of light where you rubbed them? Well, imagine that constantly over your vision, only a bit less severe and maybe a finer ""grain"" to it. I've looked up various online pictures and videos that try to approximate what visual snow looks like to people, and none of them really fit. Again, I don't see it in colors, and if it's dots they're so small that I can really even define them as dots. Now, there are three situations where I can make this problem far less noticeable. One, if I focus on something incredibly close up, but I'm talking nearly on my eye, as close as you can get and still focus on something. Two, if I stare at a bright spot, like a white patch of ceiling right next to a light bulb. Three, if I watch something moving with lots of detail, like a TV show, although even there I can see it if I look for it or there's a big patch on the screen of a single color with no detail, so this one might be more of a distraction than anything. In the three or four days since I've discovered this, I've been a wreck. It's all I can focus on. The fact that it's there constantly everywhere and it has some kind of either movement or pulsation really bothers me and I'm worried it's never going away. I've lost my appetite, I'm panicked, I'm depressed, I feel helpless. The funny thing is I can vaguely remember noticing I had some kind of visual ""noise"" years ago, but it was once in a dark room and I had never thought of it again. It's been so long since that time, I can't remember if this is worse or the same as what I noticed then, but I get the feeling this is something I've had for a long time to some degree but was used to it or it progressed so slowly I didn't really notice, but now that I do see it, I can't unsee it. It's all I see. Before I get into my worries/questions I'll also say that I am nearsighted, have been since I was a pre-teen, and I wear glasses. I am in fact long overdue for an optometrist appointment, we're talking years since I've seen one, and I know my vision has gotten somewhat worse and I need a stronger prescription, but it's not been a big issue for me. I still have read, watched TV, lived my life, I just have noticed having to get somewhat closer to things in recent years. So with all that said, these are the worries I have: 1. I have visual snow/static. The only eye condition I can find that even comes close to describing the symptoms I have is visual snow, but I'm unsure if that's even it, which is a big reason why I'm here writing this. I'm looking for you, the people who are definite sufferers of visual snow/static to give me your opinion. The moving nature of it and the ""grain"" jive with your condition, but it is not really dots. It's not colors. The part that does match up is that moving/shimmering/flickering/whatever you want to call it effect, which does feel a little like static. 2. I have some other eye condition I have not found anything else online that comes close to fitting this description, but obviously I'm not an expert. I am still waiting to see the optometrist but the ER doctors did do that basic vision check and didn't notice anything there. 3. There's nothing I can do about it and it's never going to go away This is my biggest fear. I am so scared of the idea that this is just the way my vision will always be now. I know I probably lived with it at some level for some time and didn't notice, but that that I'm aware of it, I can't get used to it. The grain aspect isn't fun but the bigger problem is that feeling that it's moving or flashing or whatever static type thing it's doing. It's so distracting and now that I see it it makes me queasy if I focus on it. It's like I can trust my eyes, nothing is still and that bothers me so much. I'm willing to accept that part of this might be stress related. I have suffered panic attacks in the past and the ER situation did put me in a very scared state about my vision. On the other hand, this has been the only time in my life I've ever worried about my vision in a major way and I do remember noticing years ago that I had something like this to some degree, although again, it's been so long I can't remember how it compares, I just know at the time it was enough to notice but not enough to freak me out like it's doing now. I don't think I'm hallucinating/imagining this out of nothing. Any and all help would be appreciated. Again, I am so stressed right now, this is ruining my life. I am so worried I'm just going to be told that there's nothing to be done or I'm crazy and imagining it. I don't know if I can get used to this. Please help if you have any insight. Follow Report"

I am still waiting to see the optometrist but the ER doctors did do that basic vision check and didn't notice anything there. 3. There's nothing I can do about it and it's never going to go away This is my biggest fear. I am so scared of the idea that this is just the way my vision will always be now. I know I probably lived with it at some level for some time and didn't notice, but that that I'm aware of it, I can't get used to it. The grain aspect isn't fun but the bigger problem is that feeling that it's moving or flashing or whatever static type thing it's doing. It's so distracting and now that I see it it makes me queasy if I focus on it. It's like I can trust my eyes, nothing is still and that bothers me so much. I'm willing to accept that part of this might be stress related. I have suffered panic attacks in the past and the ER situation did put me in a very scared state about my vision. On the other hand, this has been the only time in my life I've ever worried about my vision in a major way and I do remember noticing years ago that I had something like this to some degree, although again, it's been so long I can't remember how it compares, I just know at the time it was enough to notice but not enough to freak me out like it's doing now. I don't think I'm hallucinating/imagining this out of nothing. Any and all help would be appreciated. Again, I am so stressed right now, this is ruining my life. I am so worried I'm just going to be told that there's nothing to be done or I'm crazy and imagining it. I don't know if I can get used to this. Please help if you have any insight. Follow Report"

Week before last I was admitted into the university of Louisville and they still could not find out what is causing me these terrible problems. They believed me 100 % just did not have any answers. They done another mri which showed volume loss and I Pray with every ounce in me that doesnt mean anything bad. my worst problems are severe debilitating eye pain and visual disturbances that are never ending. The worst vision problems are seeing objects repeatedly everything I look at, it doesnt have to be anything bright anymore, severe light sensitivity, flashes of light, always see light with my eyes closed, seeing moving white dots of light all the time, shadows and spots that arent there silhouettes of almost everything I look at bad floaters which I dont hardly notice compared to the other bad things and so so much more. I have been to multiple eye specialists who all say my eyes structurally check out fine. This has progessively gotten so much worse its almost unbearable. Also my eyes have became red almost all the time. The pain has made it impossible to live life normally Ive dealt with this for over a year with it increasingly getting worse. I am honestly worried about my life this has progressively gotten so much worse it has stopped life as I knew it and cant find help. Have also been having one sided headaches for years now and seeing my heartbeat in my vision along with plugged ears all the time. Im only 32 all I ever want is please God in Jesus name to have everything restored back to normal I desperately need a miracle. Anyone that can help in anyway please do.

On October 13, 2014, I presented pain in lower left jaw area. I was referred to an oral surgeon for a possible wisdom tooth extraction. The oral surgeon confirmed extraction of the bottom left wisdom tooth (suggesting taking out all four at the same time). On October 14th, I ended up having all four wisdom teeth removed. I was placed on antibiotics and pain medications. However, I could not hold down any food. I threw up several times dislodging the blood clot. I went back to the oral surgeon and he informed me that I developed dry socket in the lower left wisdom tooth area. I received daily treatment of clove oil at the oral surgeons office for five days. On November 2, 2014, I began to notice a change in my vision. My left eye had begun to get hazy. I figured I had gotten something in my eye, therefore it was irritated. Several days went by and I had no visual improvement. On November 10, 2014, I saw an optometrist. He performed a basic eye exam, an OCT and visual fields exam. He noticed paleness in the left eye but had no concerns and sent me on my way with no treatment. Two days later I was uneasy, at this point I had begun to have severe pain and headaches. I then got a referral to see a neuro-ophthalmologist (seen on November 13, 2014). The neuro-ophthalmologist performed a series of tests (such as an OCT, visual fields, amsler grids, color vision, near vision). She stated I had eye inflammation and it was possible optic neuritis. I was then instructed to get a brain MRI with and without contrast (MRI procedure was done on November 15, 2014) to see of potential MS. The results came back normal. No lesions were present. I was then referred to a Rheumatologist (seen on November 25, 2014) to check for any autoimmune disorders. The Rheumatologist performed a large panel of blood work and a chest x-ray. I received a call to meet with the Rheumatologist. I had an office visit on December 8th and he stated that the results were in and everything came back normal. He also stated for the possible optic neuritis he would like for me to have 3 days of IV steroids (solu-medrol). I received IV treatment on December 10-12th, followed by 9 days of prednisone (60mg 3days, 40 mg 3 days and 20 mg 3 days). This treatment did not improve my symptoms. I was referred back to the neuro-ophthalmologist (seen on January 5, 2015). She requested a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) and a referral to a neurologist. The lumbar puncture procedure was done on January 8, 2015. The results were sent back to the neuro-ophthalmologist and to the new neurologist. [In the meanwhile, I was still experiencing pain in the lower left jaw area. I followed up with the Oral Surgeon again for a post operation appointment (seen on January 16, 2015). He stated the wisdom teeth extracted areas are healing well and suggested that tooth number 18(lower left tooth) may be fractured. He requested I go back to my general dentist to have a vitality test performed on the tooth/teeth. My general dentist referred me to an Endodontist. On January 19, 2015 I met with an Endodontist, she stated there was major sensitivity in tooth number 18 and would have to go in with a microscope to check/confirm for any tooth fractures because the x-rays did not reveal anything. On February 11, 2015, the Endodontist confirmed a 5ml fracture in tooth number 18 and performed/completed a root canal procedure.] Waiting on the results of the lumbar puncture and a referral to the neurologist I was seen by a neurologist for a consultation on January 30, 2015. The neurologist reviewed the lumbar puncture results. He suggested possible MS due to a high number of oligoclonal bands. The neurologist ordered some blood work (all results came back normal) and prescribed prednisone. On January 31, 2015 I started back on the prednisone taking 60 mg daily for 14 days (January 31- February 14th) to now currently tapered down to 40 mg a daily. The neurologist also ordered an MRA and MRI of the cervical spine (the two procedures were completed on February 20, 2015). On, February 23, 2015 the neurologist confirmed that the results from the MRI and MRA both came back normal. To date, I am currently still in pain and having blurred/ hazy vision. My pain areas are centralized on the left side of my head and include the left side of my scalp, left eye, the area above my left eye, left ear, left jaw and left temple area. I am staying strong but I am very concerned! Does anyone have any advice or suggestions? What should I do at this point? Follow Report"

I received IV treatment on December 10-12th, followed by 9 days of prednisone (60mg 3days, 40 mg 3 days and 20 mg 3 days). This treatment did not improve my symptoms. I was referred back to the neuro-ophthalmologist (seen on January 5, 2015). She requested a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) and a referral to a neurologist. The lumbar puncture procedure was done on January 8, 2015. The results were sent back to the neuro-ophthalmologist and to the new neurologist. [In the meanwhile, I was still experiencing pain in the lower left jaw area. I followed up with the Oral Surgeon again for a post operation appointment (seen on January 16, 2015). He stated the wisdom teeth extracted areas are healing well and suggested that tooth number 18(lower left tooth) may be fractured. He requested I go back to my general dentist to have a vitality test performed on the tooth/teeth. My general dentist referred me to an Endodontist. On January 19, 2015 I met with an Endodontist, she stated there was major sensitivity in tooth number 18 and would have to go in with a microscope to check/confirm for any tooth fractures because the x-rays did not reveal anything. On February 11, 2015, the Endodontist confirmed a 5ml fracture in tooth number 18 and performed/completed a root canal procedure.] Waiting on the results of the lumbar puncture and a referral to the neurologist I was seen by a neurologist for a consultation on January 30, 2015. The neurologist reviewed the lumbar puncture results. He suggested possible MS due to a high number of oligoclonal bands. The neurologist ordered some blood work (all results came back normal) and prescribed prednisone. On January 31, 2015 I started back on the prednisone taking 60 mg daily for 14 days (January 31- February 14th) to now currently tapered down to 40 mg a daily. The neurologist also ordered an MRA and MRI of the cervical spine (the two procedures were completed on February 20, 2015). On, February 23, 2015 the neurologist confirmed that the results from the MRI and MRA both came back normal. To date, I am currently still in pain and having blurred/ hazy vision. My pain areas are centralized on the left side of my head and include the left side of my scalp, left eye, the area above my left eye, left ear, left jaw and left temple area. I am staying strong but I am very concerned! Does anyone have any advice or suggestions? What should I do at this point? Follow Report"

I had bifocal lenses since last 2 years. My numbers were -3.5 and +1. Since I started exercises my +1 has gone completely. So far as my -3.5 numbers are concerned during exercises and during good sun light I am able to see without glasses for short durations of time. These exercises caused me cough as well. During exercises lot of water comes from my eyes. Recently I added another exercise for my lenses (natural). I stand facing the sky 2 feet inside my room facing balcony. After 10 second I move towards balcony without blinking. As more light enters eye due to coming out of room I am not able to keep my eyes open for long durations. I doing this for 15 to 20 minutes. I blink eyes when where is some fluid in my eyes or after 1 to 2 minutes. I believe this will exercise my eye lenses. When more light enters eye the lens will reduce in size and as I go back in the room and the amount of light entering eye is reduced the lens will enlarge. This should take care of the size problems of lens in next few months. I do other exercises to strengthen the eye muscles. I stand in front of a wall with a small circle on it. I stand about 12 to 18 inches from the wall. I move back and forth at 10 to 15 second interval without blinking my eyes for 1 to 2 minutes. This causes lot of fluids to come from my eyes. So far this is improving my eye sight. I do not get head aches due to not wearing glasses. I have stopped wearing my glasses since last 1 month. I drive without glasses even at night. There is improvement in seeing lights at night. The vehicles coming from opposite side do not trouble me that much now. So far no accident or even close encounter with accident. I want to know if there is likely to be some adverse effect of this. Some one pointed out that this may cause eye dryness. I have struggled with dry eye syndrome for more than 7-8 years earlier. And I know for sure that the dry eye syndrome has completely gone since I started these eye exercises. There is hardly any doubt in my mind about that. Follow Report

At that moment I knew that I needed to start really standing up for myself. I collected every form from every doctor that I had seen related to this topic and started a binder. I met with my doctor in Edina, MN and she really worked with me to figure out a plan of what to do to improve quality of life. By this time, endometriosis had started to affect my digestive system as well and I rarely felt myself. The day I walked in to meet with Dr. Kahn he challenged me to use my voice, my experience and to speak up. He told me that this would continue to happen to girls around the world until people started to draw attention to the issue. He is right! I cannot expect others to understand but I can help to educate them and hopefully the next girls who suffer will not have to walk the same road many others of us have.

I was told it was a very slow progressing hormone receptor negative cancer that Id had for years. After lumpectomy, chemo, and radiation I had no evidence of cancer for almost 10 years. But was diagnosed again in January 2011 with stage 2 breast cancer in the other breast. This time a hormone receptor positive type. After surgery and remaining on Arimidex for 5 years, In Sept 2016, I was told the cancer had metastasized to my thoracic spine and two ribs. Im told this is connnected to my BRCA1 gene mutation and is the most agggressive breast cancer there is and all that could be offered is palliative care and hope for 3 more years avg. So more chemo which was much harder on me this time, and some radiation. I developed a lung toxicity in my left lung and ended up in the hospital, in and out out of ICU three times, for almost 3 weeks. I couldnt go home so Ive been in assisted living on oxygen full time since July. The left lung was too damaged to get it back to normal but I did surprise all the doctors by actually pulling out of the respiratory failure and making it more than a couple months. So were in the new year now, 2018, and Im still here in the assisted living. Doing pretty well except for the endless debilitating fatigue. Im on hospice and they do an excellent job with pain control and nausea so far. I count my blessings every day for the extra years I was given to see the youngest of my four kids graduate, get married and has 3 little ones now. Im sure Ive seen all my 18 grandchildren. Well, maybe theres another possible one in the future, my son and his wife are still discussing having one morelol And Ive seen 5 great grandchildren, Im sure there will be many more. Ive also been blessed with all of their love and support. Im just wondering if anyone else has stopped all treatments like I have. I did have one more radiation treatment in November and was sick from it for about 6 weeks. Ive decided its not worth being so sick when I could be having fun visits with children and grandchildren. The cancer is just taking its course now and it seems I can feel it slowly taking over. New bone pains, new aches, sleeping longer and longer, more growths or tumors I can feel under the skin. I just dont know what to expect, its kind of scary. Im not afraid of death, I just hope and pray the pain stays under control and I can go peacefully in my sleep. We dont always get what we want but I hope I do this time.Anyone else in my shoes? Liked by Scott, Volunteer Mentor, stoneypath, metalneck Follow Report"
