Now, one year in remission, the pap is ASCUS with no HPV. But her is the complicating matter: I was Stage IVA colon cancer (squamous cell), but they are not sure if it's primary of colon or metastatic from cervix. The reason for the uncertainty is that I had a hysterectomy a few years before diagnosis. So when I look at my medical records, I see it described as everything from cervical to colon to rectal cancer. So, anyone with this weird diagnosis and, separate question, anyone ASCUS negative HPV one year out from treatment? I've read it should go in the opposite direction in time, so I'm nervous about recurrence. Liked by Jackie, Alumna Mentor Follow Report"

I was told it was a very slow progressing hormone receptor negative cancer that Id had for years. After lumpectomy, chemo, and radiation I had no evidence of cancer for almost 10 years. But was diagnosed again in January 2011 with stage 2 breast cancer in the other breast. This time a hormone receptor positive type. After surgery and remaining on Arimidex for 5 years, In Sept 2016, I was told the cancer had metastasized to my thoracic spine and two ribs. Im told this is connnected to my BRCA1 gene mutation and is the most agggressive breast cancer there is and all that could be offered is palliative care and hope for 3 more years avg. So more chemo which was much harder on me this time, and some radiation. I developed a lung toxicity in my left lung and ended up in the hospital, in and out out of ICU three times, for almost 3 weeks. I couldnt go home so Ive been in assisted living on oxygen full time since July. The left lung was too damaged to get it back to normal but I did surprise all the doctors by actually pulling out of the respiratory failure and making it more than a couple months. So were in the new year now, 2018, and Im still here in the assisted living. Doing pretty well except for the endless debilitating fatigue. Im on hospice and they do an excellent job with pain control and nausea so far. I count my blessings every day for the extra years I was given to see the youngest of my four kids graduate, get married and has 3 little ones now. Im sure Ive seen all my 18 grandchildren. Well, maybe theres another possible one in the future, my son and his wife are still discussing having one morelol And Ive seen 5 great grandchildren, Im sure there will be many more. Ive also been blessed with all of their love and support. Im just wondering if anyone else has stopped all treatments like I have. I did have one more radiation treatment in November and was sick from it for about 6 weeks. Ive decided its not worth being so sick when I could be having fun visits with children and grandchildren. The cancer is just taking its course now and it seems I can feel it slowly taking over. New bone pains, new aches, sleeping longer and longer, more growths or tumors I can feel under the skin. I just dont know what to expect, its kind of scary. Im not afraid of death, I just hope and pray the pain stays under control and I can go peacefully in my sleep. We dont always get what we want but I hope I do this time.Anyone else in my shoes? Liked by Scott, Volunteer Mentor, stoneypath, metalneck Follow Report"

It all started in July 2016 when I had an operation called an Ivor Lewis Oesphogectomy which involved the removal of a large non-cancerous tumour from my oesophagus, by stretching my stomach up to create a new link between my throat & my stomach. Whilst the operation was initially successful after 5 days I became very ill & following investigations it was thought that as the tumour was very high up near my voice box, the blood circulation wasn't sufficient & caused the join to die. Unfortunately this caused 2/3rds of my stomach to be burnt back & other complications including damage to a lung due to leakage of necrotic fluid. I had an immediate emergency operation to basically save me which involved tying off what was left of my stomach & inserting a jejunostomy peg feed for liquid food & drink. My remaining oesophogus was pulled out externally to my throat where a stoma drained my nose & saliva. I ended up being in ICU for 11 days & spent 2 months recovering in hospital. I only realised afterwards how ill I was although this was more obvious physically as I also lost another 2st in weight. When I was released I was told to get as fit as I could in readiness for another major operation in order to re-connect me. I was also diagnosed with depression but this was to be expected having gone through what I had at the time. After recovering fairly well, considering the circumstances, nine months later in April 2017 I was deemed fit enough to undergo an operation called a Colonic interposition which involved transplanting approx 14"" of my large intestine to provide me essentially with a new working oesophagus. The operation again went well however unusually whilst the lower join healed the upper join failed to. I spent another 2 months in hospital waiting for it to heal but it wouldn't so the hospital made the decision to discharge me home with my peg feed & stoma yet again. I was closely monitored & underwent regular bi-weekly endoscopic stretches (dilations) of the new oesophagus until by the September the join eventually healed. From that time I would have the stretches but I also carried out daily dilations manually by swallowing a rubber dilator (2 feet long) I cannot say this was very pleasant but having gotten this far it was important to maintain what my consultant requested in order that I may one day eat & drink again. Life suddenly got much better as for the first time in 18 months I began to eat & drink again. No it wasn't a case of back to normal by any means as I could only really manage soups, etc but I gradually moved onto to soft food like mashed potatoe, etc. I cannot begin to explain how wonderful it was to be able to taste & swallow again except to say it was like having my body back again after being ravaged by major surgeries, so it was truly fantastic. However it was only the beginning of a long rocky road to what I thought was my full recovery. Throughout the next few months things seemed to improve if only very slowly. Eating & drinking was difficult but I felt I was getting there even though I still had to have the hospital dilations & do the daily dilations myself. I was also still having to insert water & use the peg feed for nutrician something which the consultant said was important as back up as I could not eat/drink enough to fully sustain my 9st body. However I began to get chest infections which caused me problems trying to eat & drink. These became more & more frequent & I was getting more & more frustrated as it resulted in my eating becoming harder. It culminated in May when I suddenly had a bout of gastroenteritis. This proved to be horrendous as not only could I not tolerate any food/drink orally but also nothing via my peg feed. I spent 9 whole days in bed gradually deteriorating & can only say it was probably the worst I had ever felt in my life, including the previous surgeries. I lost another stone in weight, was delirious at times due to dehydration & fell into a further deeper depression. Amazingly I wasn't hospitalised & really don't understand why I wasn't at the time but my recollection of that time is still hazy & no doubt I probably argued that I didn't want to go back in anyway. I should add very importantly that during this episode it the first time I was physically sick (in 2 1/2 years since it all began) so it was the first time as such I was sick using my new oesophagus. Being sick normally is quite distressing to an able bodied person anyway but the physical action for me was both painful & shocking also as I really didn't know what was happening to me internally as it wracked my body further. After recovering a few days later I had a swelling on my throat externally on the location of my operation scar which basically swelled to the size of a golf ball. This eventually burst & left a small hole in my throat but even at that point I didn't realise what had happened. It was only when I tried to swallow some water that it poured out of the hole in my throat. I was in a complete state of shock obviously with the thought that there was something seriously wrong. I went back to the hospital & scans revealed that my oesophagus transplant had basically shrivelled up & effectively died due to lack of blood circulation (or other?) & the upper join of the had ruptured & so any fluid would discharge from the hole in my throat. They also found a fistula (a hole or link) from the oesphogus & my lung. I cannot tell you how devastated I was at hearing this news. It was a full year & a month on from having the operation & it had sadly ended this way. The consultants are at a loss as to explain why this happened except to say that my situation is unique to them & suffice to say that a medical paper is now being written about my unfortunate situation as we speak. Having lived with the situation now for the past 6 months, they decided that nothing could be done directly without making things worse. I have recently been back to my consultant who has informed me they are looking at possibly carrying out another major operation in March 2019 which is called a Jump Graft, using a piece of my small intestine this time, in order to reconnect me. Unfortunately they have only carried out this operation on patients requiring short lengths in the UK but apparently they have done the longer grafts in Australia & America but I don't know how successful they have been. I am waiting for further information on these nearer the time as the team of consultants is put together. However, again, unfortunately my consultant has advised that due to a possible issue with my immune system they are not very confident that the operation will work. (10% chance it will work) So in the meantime I am coming to terms with the distinct reality that I may have to rely on my peg feed & stomas for the rest of my life. Not a very positive outlook & it would seem with no way back. What I am hoping from posting this story is that someone somewhere will either have gone through what I have or knows somebody that can help me come to terms with my situation. After having been through all this only to be told that any operation is unlikely to improve my situation has left me feeling in despair & suicidal at times & I seem to have nobody to talk to that understands.

It all started in July 2016 when I had an operation called an Ivor Lewis Oesphogectomy which involved the removal of a large non-cancerous tumour from my oesophagus, by stretching my stomach up to create a new link between my throat & my stomach. Whilst the operation was initially successful after 5 days I became very ill & following investigations it was thought that as the tumour was very high up near my voice box, the blood circulation wasn't sufficient & caused the join to die. Unfortunately this caused 2/3rds of my stomach to be burnt back & other complications including damage to a lung due to leakage of necrotic fluid. I had an immediate emergency operation to basically save me which involved tying off what was left of my stomach & inserting a jejunostomy peg feed for liquid food & drink. My remaining oesophogus was pulled out externally to my throat where a stoma drained my nose & saliva. I ended up being in ICU for 11 days & spent 2 months recovering in hospital. I only realised afterwards how ill I was although this was more obvious physically as I also lost another 2st in weight. When I was released I was told to get as fit as I could in readiness for another major operation in order to re-connect me. I was also diagnosed with depression but this was to be expected having gone through what I had at the time. After recovering fairly well, considering the circumstances, nine months later in April 2017 I was deemed fit enough to undergo an operation called a Colonic interposition which involved transplanting approx 14"" of my large intestine to provide me essentially with a new working oesophagus. The operation again went well however unusually whilst the lower join healed the upper join failed to. I spent another 2 months in hospital waiting for it to heal but it wouldn't so the hospital made the decision to discharge me home with my peg feed & stoma yet again. I was closely monitored & underwent regular bi-weekly endoscopic stretches (dilations) of the new oesophagus until by the September the join eventually healed. From that time I would have the stretches but I also carried out daily dilations manually by swallowing a rubber dilator (2 feet long) I cannot say this was very pleasant but having gotten this far it was important to maintain what my consultant requested in order that I may one day eat & drink again. Life suddenly got much better as for the first time in 18 months I began to eat & drink again. No it wasn't a case of back to normal by any means as I could only really manage soups, etc but I gradually moved onto to soft food like mashed potatoe, etc. I cannot begin to explain how wonderful it was to be able to taste & swallow again except to say it was like having my body back again after being ravaged by major surgeries, so it was truly fantastic. However it was only the beginning of a long rocky road to what I thought was my full recovery. Throughout the next few months things seemed to improve if only very slowly. Eating & drinking was difficult but I felt I was getting there even though I still had to have the hospital dilations & do the daily dilations myself. I was also still having to insert water & use the peg feed for nutrician something which the consultant said was important as back up as I could not eat/drink enough to fully sustain my 9st body. However I began to get chest infections which caused me problems trying to eat & drink. These became more & more frequent & I was getting more & more frustrated as it resulted in my eating becoming harder. It culminated in May when I suddenly had a bout of gastroenteritis. This proved to be horrendous as not only could I not tolerate any food/drink orally but also nothing via my peg feed. I spent 9 whole days in bed gradually deteriorating & can only say it was probably the worst I had ever felt in my life, including the previous surgeries. I lost another stone in weight, was delirious at times due to dehydration & fell into a further deeper depression. Amazingly I wasn't hospitalised & really don't understand why I wasn't at the time but my recollection of that time is still hazy & no doubt I probably argued that I didn't want to go back in anyway. I should add very importantly that during this episode it the first time I was physically sick (in 2 1/2 years since it all began) so it was the first time as such I was sick using my new oesophagus. Being sick normally is quite distressing to an able bodied person anyway but the physical action for me was both painful & shocking also as I really didn't know what was happening to me internally as it wracked my body further. After recovering a few days later I had a swelling on my throat externally on the location of my operation scar which basically swelled to the size of a golf ball. This eventually burst & left a small hole in my throat but even at that point I didn't realise what had happened. It was only when I tried to swallow some water that it poured out of the hole in my throat. I was in a complete state of shock obviously with the thought that there was something seriously wrong. I went back to the hospital & scans revealed that my oesophagus transplant had basically shrivelled up & effectively died due to lack of blood circulation (or other?) & the upper join of the had ruptured & so any fluid would discharge from the hole in my throat. They also found a fistula (a hole or link) from the oesphogus & my lung. I cannot tell you how devastated I was at hearing this news. It was a full year & a month on from having the operation & it had sadly ended this way. The consultants are at a loss as to explain why this happened except to say that my situation is unique to them & suffice to say that a medical paper is now being written about my unfortunate situation as we speak. Having lived with the situation now for the past 6 months, they decided that nothing could be done directly without making things worse. I have recently been back to my consultant who has informed me they are looking at possibly carrying out another major operation in March 2019 which is called a Jump Graft, using a piece of my small intestine this time, in order to reconnect me. Unfortunately they have only carried out this operation on patients requiring short lengths in the UK but apparently they have done the longer grafts in Australia & America but I don't know how successful they have been. I am waiting for further information on these nearer the time as the team of consultants is put together. However, again, unfortunately my consultant has advised that due to a possible issue with my immune system they are not very confident that the operation will work. (10% chance it will work) So in the meantime I am coming to terms with the distinct reality that I may have to rely on my peg feed & stomas for the rest of my life. Not a very positive outlook & it would seem with no way back. What I am hoping from posting this story is that someone somewhere will either have gone through what I have or knows somebody that can help me come to terms with my situation.

I had such a struggle finding food that was soft enough to eat, but also tasted good. There is only so much soup a person can stand, right??? I had a feeding tube during several rounds of treatment, but had to eat by mouth during my first few diagnoses. Did anyone land on some food that worked really well post-surgically or during treatment? I ate way too many of my moms peanut butter pies. It has a smooth texture, and I would make it without the crust  Pudding and cheesecake were also winners in my book. Definitely not a low sugar diet, but it worked for me. What about you?

Level II and Level III nodes less than 1cm. in October 2015. I started a course of chemotherapy/radiation for seven weeks. 37 Treatments of radiation and was on Sysplatin for a week then had to change to Caboplatin and Pacitaxel as I had a bad reaction to sysplatin. It has now been 10 weeks since treatment finished but I still have ulcers on my tongue and it hurts to swallow. I have got a dewlap which I was told would go away in about three months but it is still there and at the moment there seems to be no sign of the fluid draining away. I was told that this is what is causing me having this choking feeling all the time. I have no taste and no saliva. My question is, is there anyway I can help to regain some saliva glands and is there anything to help for these ulcers to go away. I have quite a bit of pain on the left side of my face and it seems to have gone to my ear and feels like earache all the time. Just wondering if someone has some suggestions for me.

Actually I have seen one there before that went away and has now returned. Im conisdering surgery possiblility at Mayo Clinic in Florida was looking at this site and found the discussion board. Ive had Fine Needle Biopsy and diagnosis is probable for Warthins Tumor. After the biopsy the tumor got hot, inflammed and I had a small vien or nerve or something that was standing out on my neck and ran the length of my neck. I also experienced some cognitive issues during this time. Or at least I felt like I was. I saw an ENT and was given clindamycin to take. The tumor shrank back down. A few months later now and the tumor again got sore enlarged some. I was hoping that I didnt need a surgery for this. But since Im having these types of problems since the needle biopsy I suppose I should have this taken care of. Im also getting scared that maybe this is cancer since it is swelling and sore. I dont believe the ENT in my area has done many surgerys of this type. Im looking for an ENT that does this has a lot of experience as Im totaly afraid of possible damage to my facial nerves. Anybody has this surgery performed in Florida? If so who did your surgery? I suffer from several other health issues as well. Degerative Disk Disease, Tremors mostly my head but sometimes my hands also. Multiple lesions on my brain with a degerative type disease. Was once thought possible Multiple Sclerosis and could still be but not sure this has been going on for many years now with no diagnosis and was hoping to maybe see a neurologist at the Mayo Center as well in hopes of getting a confirmed diagnosis. I would have to fly and get hotel room etc to visit the Mayo Clinic. Was hoping to possible do all this in a about one wks time and return home as the expense of the trip would be high. Anybody have knowlege or advice about this? Also, Im on disability and have medicare (Humana) with a secondary insurance from previous employer(United Health Care). From reading on the web site doesnt look like Mayo Clinic like medicare. Well most people and hospitals dont. LOL But, anybody have experience with that in Florida as well? Follow Report"

After the biopsy the tumor got hot, inflammed and I had a small vien or nerve or something that was standing out on my neck and ran the length of my neck. I also experienced some cognitive issues during this time. Or at least I felt like I was. I saw an ENT and was given clindamycin to take. The tumor shrank back down. A few months later now and the tumor again got sore enlarged some. I was hoping that I didnt need a surgery for this. But since Im having these types of problems since the needle biopsy I suppose I should have this taken care of. Im also getting scared that maybe this is cancer since it is swelling and sore. I dont believe the ENT in my area has done many surgerys of this type. Im looking for an ENT that does this has a lot of experience as Im totaly afraid of possible damage to my facial nerves. Anybody has this surgery performed in Florida? If so who did your surgery? I suffer from several other health issues as well. Degerative Disk Disease, Tremors mostly my head but sometimes my hands also. Multiple lesions on my brain with a degerative type disease. Was once thought possible Multiple Sclerosis and could still be but not sure this has been going on for many years now with no diagnosis and was hoping to maybe see a neurologist at the Mayo Center as well in hopes of getting a confirmed diagnosis. I would have to fly and get hotel room etc to visit the Mayo Clinic. Was hoping to possible do all this in a about one wks time and return home as the expense of the trip would be high.

I live in the Cleveland, OH area, so there are 5k races (and longer) available throughout the year, but I'm 230 lbs now (after a year of getting on and off antidepressants) and struggle to catch my breath when walking and talking. I've come a long way from being fit and healthy in my 20s. Now in my early 30s, even though I know this isn't the case, it still feels like another lifetime/a pipe dream to get back to health and fitness. If I want to pursue a 5k, does anyone have recommendations for doing so? I have a treadmill at home because I'm honestly too embarrassed to train with other people (even a trainer, who's probably used to obese people working toward fitness). I should probably start with an app or something, right? Any help, insights, advice, or tools you have to recommend are more than welcome!

I can think of no better way to get some honest opinions and suggestions. This morning my daughter introduced me to juicing. We had a discussion about juicing over breakfast when I was talking about tapering off of prednisone and looking for natural ways to reduce inflammation. Besides PMR I also have osteopenia and am supposed to take 1200 mg calcium daily which presents some output challenges for me. We stopped by the grocery store on the way back to her house and picked up all the ingredients to make some ginger juice for inflammation (2 large oranges and some ginger root) and red cabbage juice to help with the constipation (2 heads of red cabbage, 3 apples, 2 oranges, 1 lime, and small bag of carrots). Into the juicer they went! She poured the juice into 18 oz glass containers for me to take home and keep in the refrigerator. What have I learned so far? Well, when I got home I poured about 4 oz of the red cabbage juice into a glass and topped it off with about 1 oz or more of ginger juice. I learned not to use so much of the ginger juice in my drink as it kind of has a zingy feeling on the tongue and throat. The red cabbage juice tastes a lot better than I thought  better than my breakfast smoothie. My plan was actually to use a little of both in my breakfast smoothie and reduce the amount of fruit but add the greens (kale, spinach, arugula, etc..) into a blender with the juice. Questions for anyone willing to share:  Has juicing helped you?  What tips or favorite recipes can you share? and how do they help? Looking forwarding to hearing from you!

Im curious how different folks deal with movies. I have not gone to many movies because I cant understand them. Ive probably gone to about 6 theater movies since 1970 and have tried to listen to movies at home (mostly unsuccessfully). Sound effects overpower a lot of speech, I cant understand any whispering, and shouting doesnt help. Caption glasses and FM listeners are not very user-friendly for me. I heard that this theater was showing the Open Caption movie at the request of some other deaf/hard of hearing individual. (It pays to speak up). I noticed several other deaf/hard of hearing folks there too so word must have gotten out about the Open Caption. I learned that even though I thought I could hear birds and crickets with my new 3-year old hearing aids I cant hear them well at all. The captions told of several things that were playing in the soundtrack but I didnt hear at all. And I learned that I could follow the movie much better than any other Ive watched. Now Im wondering how to find when/where open caption movies play, how to request them, why they are not offered more. I did send a thank you to the theater for showing the movie and their consideration for the deaf and hard of hearing community. Liked by JK, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

It worked, but the mic was so weak that it was useless, except for my own voice. I ditched my perfectly good IPhone and switched to an Android (Samsung A20) and downloaded Live Transcribe. I tried it at home with the TV, but most of the time there were no icons at the bottom of the screen, so I couldn't make it start. I did go to ""Accessability"" and ask to use Live Transcribe, but it still didn't work most of the time. I thought perhaps the mic wasn't strong enough to pick up electronic voices from the TV. Today, I went to a meeting of 10 people and fired up Live Transcribeand got a message ""App is offline. You'll see sound events, but not transcription."" I was able to connect to the internet, but my phone continued to give me the same disappointing message. Another meeting of mystery discussion, dammit! I've searched on line to find an answer, but haven't been able to. This is extremely disappointingthe IPhone could connect for phone calls, at least, even though Otter was a dismal failure because it lagged five minutes or more behind and was unable to understand tech terms. Anyone else have this problem or know what I might be able to doother than hurl the phone at the brick wall next to my desk???? Follow Report"

The hearing aids need to be properly fitted to your ears so that they provide the correct amount of amplification to maximize hearing aid benefit. Prior to fitting the hearing aids, your audiologist will conduct a thorough hearing test to measure the softest sound you can hear at different pitches and record the volume of sound that is uncomfortably loud for you. Based on these tests, your audiologist will know how much gain the hearing aid needs to provide in order to amplify soft sounds so they are audible and how much to compress loud sounds so that they are not uncomfortable. Different styles of hearing aids, levels of technology, and cost will all be discussed at your Hearing Aid Evaluation appointment. Your various listening environments and expectations of hearing aids will also be discussed. Your audiologist will discuss different features available in hearing aids and make recommendations based on your hearing evaluation and communication needs. You will select the hearing aids you want to order. Earmold impressions will be taken of your ears (if necessary) to order the hearing aids. About two weeks after you order the hearing aids, you will return for the hearing aid fitting. At the hearing aid fitting appointment, your audiologist will verify that the hearing aids are providing the correct amount of amplification by doing Real Ear Measures. Real Ear Measures allow the audiologist to know how loud sounds are in your ear canal. First, a thin tube will be inserted into your ear canal. This tube is connected to a microphone that will measure the volume of sound near your eardrum without any hearing aid device in your ear. Next, your hearing aid will be inserted in your ear taking care not to move the probe tube microphone already in your ear canal. Once the hearing aid is turned on, your audiologist will measure how loud the sound is at the output of your hearing aid in your ear. It is important for your audiologist to play different volumes of sound from soft to very loud in order to verify that soft sounds are amplified so you can hear them, that moderate-intensity sounds are amplified to a comfortable listening level, and that loud sounds are considered loud, but do not exceed your discomfort level. Proper verification of your hearing aid settings is integral to a successful hearing aid fitting. If these measures are not completed, then the audiologist will not know whether your hearing aids are programmed properly. Real Ear Measures ensure that you are getting the appropriate amount of amplification in accordance with the severity of your hearing loss. Once the hearing aids are programmed, your audiologist will then review the care and maintenance of the hearing aids. Tasks, like inserting the hearing aids and changing the batteries, will be practiced in the office. Liked by arrowshooter, whatdidyousaynaz Follow Report"

Is the helping hurting in the long run?,"I had this discussion on the HLAA forum and got no satisfactory answer. The HLAA forum is pretty dead and on it's way out so I didn't get but one or two responses and they weren't conclusive. Also it is my fault because I don't think I explained myself clearly. Please understand, I'm not trolling, I really want to know. If my logic is sound, I will only wear my aids when I need to instead of all day. I can't get along without them. Let me divulge my logic (or lack of it): 1) I know that the sound level of 85dba (""A"" weighted, slow response) for 8 hours per day permanently damages hearing. The DB scale is logarithmic function, each 3db is double the power of the one before. So at 91dbdba 2 hours of exposure damages permanently, at 100dba it's only 15 minutes, at 110dba it's mere seconds and at 120dba it's instant permanent damage. Logarithms are comparative ratios, adding the a suffix (dba) is referencing it against a standard, and is what all hearing tests use  db is a ratio and dba is a definite value. 2) Hearing aids amplify the frequencies you cannot hear as a reverse curve to your hearing loss audiogram 3) Say you have a 70 db loss in hearing at 3Khz (3,000 cycles per second), that means at 71 dba in a quiet hearing booth you can barely hear the faintest whisper of a 3khz tone. And like many of us, say your lower frequency hearing is either zero or around 6 dba. (note: most consonants are in the 2-4 khz range so this is where we understand speech) 4) Now say you are in a room that conversation level is around 75 dba, you will need about 75 db of the consonants to understand what the person across the table is saying to you. (Note: I have several sound level meters and 75db in a restaurant is average for one without loud background music.) 5) Since your hearing loss is at -70db, there is already 75dba of conversation in the room how high does your hearing aid have to amplify the 3khz sounds? 6) Do you have to take the 70db loss, add it to the 75dba conversation level in the room and amplify to an ear damaging 145dba? Remember, adding 70dba is your tiniest, softest, perception at the frequency in a quiet soundproof booth. So it seems 70dba wouldn't be enough. Hearing a whisper of a consonant in a 75dba room seems to me to be worthless. So it seems to me that amplifying the ambient noise of the room above 85dba could slowly erode your hearing so you will need stronger and stronger hearing aids, which amply more and damage more, which means you will need stronger and stronger hearing aids, damaging more and more. etc. (feedback loop) Or am I missing something? If my thinking is faulty, please explain in detail and tell me why my logic is not logical. Thanks, Bob Follow Report"

I dont feel as balanced anymore but have resumed Zumba (no fast twirling as a precaution). I have a relative who got shingles and lost his hearing and it returned. Another person thought he had Menieres (lost hearing in one ear) and it did get better. He thought that a recommendation of eating a very low salt intake did the trick. Im not so sure about that. I havent seen any discussions about people who lost hearing and it returned.

I habituated to it and rarely noticed it except in a quiet room. I was careful to protect my hearing so it never worsened. On May 9 this year I went to see my dentist to start the process of getting a crown on a molar. As soon as he began working with this drill. to remove the old tooth I experienced a very loud painful screeching noise in both ears. I stopped him and told him what was happening. I don't recall what he said but, stupidly, I allowed him to continue working despite the painful noise. I had to stop him several times because it was unbearable. I remember gripping my belt as he worked. At one point he offered me little rolls of cotton to put in my ears but that didn't help. It wasn't the noise coming into my ears externally I was hearing but noise from vibration being carried through my skull to my ears. It was so intensely loud I can't even explain. It sounded like the noise was coming from inside my ears. I don't know how long this went on. Ten minutes or so I guess. Why I allowed the dentist to continue is something I will never understand. Immediately after he was done I had extremely loud tinnitus. Within a couple of days I was having throbbing pain in both ears. I went to see my PCP who prescribed a steroid pack. About a week later I saw an ENT where I did a hearing test showing major loss of hearing in the high frequencies. The ENT continued the Prednisone for another week. I now have very noticeable hearing loss. It's like there's a ""dead zone"" in my hearing. I am having difficulty understanding what people say on the phone, on TV and even in person. Voices sound flat. If there's any background noise whatsoever it makes it even harder to understand. I've noticed many things just don't sound the same. At night the loss is very noticeable. There are environmental sounds from around the house and from outside I either barely hear now or don't hear at all, unimportant sounds that I used to just take for granted and ignore. Now it bothers me that I'm not hearing them. I heard a slow police siren in the distance a couple of nights ago. When the siren reached the highest pitch the sound disappeared completely and then I could hear it again as it was falling. The tinnitus is very loud. I'm having anxiety through the roof, difficulty concentrating, difficulty sleeping. I found a support forum for tinnitus where I learned about ""tinnitus distress"", of which I have every symptom. So at least I have a name for it, but in that forum they are focused more on tinnitus than on hearing loss. While the tinnitus is driving me crazy I am actually even more upset about losing my hearing. Before this happened I could very clearly. I did not have difficulty understanding people talking. It's just hard to believe and accept I lost so much hearing so quickly because of dental work. This didn't have to happen. I'm more angry at myself than at the dentist because I could have and should have stopped the whole thing. Why I allowed the dentist to continue I will never understand. I have to see a mental health professional because I'm not functioning very well. My life has kind of ground to a halt. All the normal problems I was focused on before have kind of flown out the window. I'm still able to work, but concentrating is very difficult. Sorry for the long post.

Ive had a hearing aid for 50 years, since I was 18. Ive found the following Web pages to be particularly good for letting others know how to help a hard-of-hearing person hear them. I cant post the URLs right now as a new member, so Ive included what these pages say. Communicating with People with Hearing Loss (from ucsfhealth)https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/communicating_with_people_with_hearing_loss/ Successful communication requires the efforts of all people involved in a conversation. Even when the person with hearing loss utilizes hearing aids and active listening strategies, it is crucial that others involved in the communication process consistently use good communication strategies, including the following: 1. Face the hearing impaired person directly, on the same level and in good light whenever possible. Position yourself so that the light is shining on the speakers face, not in the eyes of the listener. 2. Do not talk from another room. Not being able to see each other when talking is a common reason people have difficulty understanding what is said. 3. Speak clearly, slowly, distinctly, but naturally, without shouting or exaggerating mouth movements. Shouting distorts the sound of speech and may make speech reading more difficult. 4. Say the persons name before beginning a conversation. This gives the listener a chance to focus attention and reduces the chance of missing words at the beginning of the conversation. 5. Avoid talking too rapidly or using sentences that are too complex. Slow down a little, pause between sentences or phrases, and wait to make sure you have been understood before going on. 6. Keep your hands away from your face while talking. If you are eating, chewing, smoking, etc. while talking, your speech will be more difficult to understand. Beards and moustaches can also interfere with the ability of the hearing impaired to speech read. 7. If the hearing impaired listener hears better in one ear than the other, try to make a point of remembering which ear is better so that you will know where to position yourself. 8. Be aware of possible distortion of sounds for the hearing impaired person.They may hear your voice, but still may have difficulty understanding some words. 9. Most hearing impaired people have greater difficulty understanding speech when there is background noise. Try to minimize extraneous noise when talking. 10. Some people with hearing loss are very sensitive to loud sounds. This reduced tolerance for loud sounds is not uncommon. Avoid situations where there will be loud sounds when possible. 11. If the hearing impaired person has difficulty understanding a particular phrase or word, try to find a different way of saying the same thing, rather than repeating the original words over and over. 12. Acquaint the listener with the general topic of the conversation. Avoid sudden changes of topic. If the subject is changed, tell the hearing impaired person what you are talking about now. In a group setting, repeat questions or key facts before continuing with the discussion. 13. If you are giving specific information  such as time, place or phone numbers  to someone who is hearing impaired, have them repeat the specifics back to you. Many numbers and words sound alike. 14. Whenever possible, provide pertinent information in writing, such as directions, schedules, work assignments, etc. 15. Recognize that everyone, especially the hard-of-hearing, has a harder time hearing and understanding when ill or tired. 16. Pay attention to the listener. A puzzled look may indicate misunderstanding. Tactfully ask the hearing impaired person if they understood you, or ask leading questions so you know your message got across. 17. Take turns speaking and avoid interrupting other speakers. 18. Enroll in aural rehabilitation classes with your hearing impaired spouse or friend. 10 Tips For Communicating With People With Hearing Loss (from Beltone) 1. Get their attention Getting the listeners attention before you start speaking will give them a moment to shift their attention and focus on you. Try saying the persons name, touching their arm or using a gesture to get their attention. 2. Eye contact Ensure that you are face to face with your hearing impaired listener. Maintaining eye contact will help them focus on what youre saying. Lip reading and facial expressions play a large part in communicating for both sides of the conversation. 3. Speak naturally and clearly  dont shout Speak clearly, at a normal or slightly slower speed and enunciate your words. Speaking in a slightly louder voice may also help your listener understand, but be careful not to shout. Shouting distorts the sound of your words and can make lip reading more difficult. 4. Keep your hands away from your face Most listeners depend on lip reading and facial expressions to understand conversations more completely. Be sure not to cover your face and avoid exaggerated facial expressions that may distort your mouth and impede the listeners ability to lip read. 5. Rephrase If you find that youre being asked to repeat yourself, try rephrasing and using different words to make your message easier to understand. Ask leading or clarifying questions throughout the conversation to ensure your message is clear. 6. Avoid excessive background noise Background noise makes listening conditions difficult for those with hearing loss, try to avoid situations where there will be loud noises whenever possible. Turn off the television/radio, move away from noisy areas and if youre in a social environment, try to find a quiet place to sit or a seat in a restaurant that is away from the kitchen or large gatherings. 7. Talk into their good ear Many people who suffer from hearing loss tend to have one ear that is stronger than the other. Look for cues as to which ear that is, ask them if appropriate, and situate yourself on that side of your listener. 8. Watch your listener Pay attention to your listeners facial expressions and body language for signs of confusion or that they dont understand. If you notice that they seem puzzled, tactfully ask if they understand or if they need clarification. 9. Speak to the person, not the interpreter If your listener communicates via an interpreter, be sure to keep your eyes on and speak directly to your listener and not the interpreter. It may seem odd at first, but the interpreter is a tool to help the listener communicate. 10. Be understanding You may feel understandably frustrated when interacting with the hearing impaired, but keep in mind how it must be for them on a daily basis. Be patient. Communicating with hearing loss is a cooperative effort and requires understanding from both sides. Id add a few other pieces of advice: 1. Dont talk while you are walking away. 2. When getting into or out of a car with someone, dont talk while you are on opposite sides. Wait until youre both in the car, or until youre close to each other outside the car. And dont talk while the garage door is going up or down. 3. Never say Never mind. It makes the person you say it to feel unimportant to you! When Im on the phone with someone whos speaking too quickly, or who has a foreign accent (which I generally find hard to understand), I always start by saying that Im hard of hearing, and that Id appreciate it if they could speak a bit slower (and louder, if I think that would help). Sales people and help line people often forget that sometime during the conversation. If so, I try to gently remind them. I hope this is helpful!

Please foregive the long post. I was wondering if anyone has had a hard time while being on and going off Carvedilol (Coreg). I am an active 45 year old mom of a young child. I have always tried to eat healthily and keep in shape (I do yoga, pilates and, run about 5k 2x per week). My BP has always been pretty good, but since my 40s it has gone up a bit (heredity factors play a role). My BP and heart rate also spike when I get stressed or anxious, but for the most part are pretty level during normal times. I do have anxious moments, but I would not say anxiety has been a major life problem. At my last check (Feb 2016), and after wearing a 24 hour BP monitor, my cardiologist suggested I start Carvedilol 6.25 1x per day (quite a low dose) for the spikes and to keep the heart from getting too excited. I agreed that maybe it was a good idea and started over two months ago. Other than stimulating rapid bowel movements, I did not notice any side effects at first. I would say about three to four weeks into taking the Carvedilol, I began not sleeping well. I also noticed my heart pounding, like a bass drum, slowly and steadily, at times. Then the heart pounding began to wake me up at night (it turns out my HR was down in the high 40s at night). Some nights I even felt my chest muscles vibrate, as if a phone on silence mode was on top of my chest. I started to notice this more and more and then I would have a few normal nights, so I figured I would just talk about this at my next cardio check (booked out in June). I also noticed I was getting more and more anxious. I wasnt too sure why little things were beginning to bother me. I thought it was hormones, PMS, whatever, and started looking for someone like a therapist to talk to. The previous week was bad. I woke up from a few nightmares and I started to panic in bed, just woken up from sleep. I had three nights of waking up to panic attacks and body shakes. The experiences made me very nervous. At this point I started looking into the side effects of Carvedilol and I was seeing not only chest pounding, but in rare cases reported effects of nightmares, visual disturbances, tremors, anxiety. I also know one does not simply stop a beta blocker, so we talked about tapering down. I tapered down for four days, and then I got in to see another cardiologist on Monday and he said just stop immediately. The effects are rare, but they have been noted. Going off this medication has been frightening. I feel weak and shaky all the time, and I get sporadic periods of pounding and muscle tremors in my legs, anxiety and fuzzy vision. I frequently get so cold I begin to shake. Yesterday I went back to the clinic for an EKG (normal) and some blood tests (including thyroid) and everything was normal. I am just assuming this is my body reacting and readapting itself after being on beta blockers. It has only been five days, but I am wondering if anyone out there has had similar experiences. How long did it take you to feel normal again? I ran a 5k just two weekends ago and yesterday I could hardly take a walk. Thanks for listening.

After three years of seeing specialist after specialist and having many tests, it is a bit of a relief to finally know the cause of my debilitating symptoms. I learned more after my first echocardiogram at Mayo in October than in the dozens of other tests I endured over the previous several years. So we now know whats wrong. We even know the cause: radiation to the chest to treat cancer over 40 years ago. I cant whine too much about that. The cancer was cured and I got (so far) 40 years of life I otherwise would not have had. The challenge now is determining the treatment. The two surgeons Ive met with agree that surgical intervention is necessary, but they dont agree on the details. They do agree that Im not a candidate for the less invasive TAVR procedure. Apparently the extent of radiation damage is important to assess and wont be apparent until they get eyes on the heart. One wants to focus on the aortic valve  the one in the worst shape and the cause of my most quality of life destroying symptoms- and take on the others later. The other wants to do all three at once. I dont know what to do. Any recommendations? Anyone else face this kind of choice? Liked by penn1023 Follow Report"

I suffer from ptsd and often have bouts of anxiety and sometimes panic attacks. About a month ago I decided to take myself to the hospital because of a mild shortness of breath and everything seeming to be a little harder! I did an ecg which was normal and I did an echocardiogram which showed I had a bicuspid valve with mild stenosis with an dilated ascending aorta of 48mm. Cardiologist said that he would look at replacing the valves at 55mm which would hopefully be a number of years away, however because I failed the stress test because of skipped beats he ordered a ctca scan to check for cad. Because my cardiologist is on holidays I got the report from my gp and was blown away! I have a CAC score of 627, I have approximately 50-75% stenosis in my Lad, it stated that this could be an over estimation due to blooming artefact( not sure why the big gap in estimation when I read its so accurate. It states further in summary moderate diffuse disease elsewhere outlined. Doctor was shocked and said Ill fax this to the cardiologist, you will probably need a stent! Trouble is the cardiologist is on holidays for a month as am I. If any helpful soul out there can shed some light on my situation Id much appreciate it. Thanks Vince Follow Report"

After hours in this procedure the surgeon came out and told us that he had good news and bad news/ good news was it was not cancer- the bad news he peeled this mass back like an onion and was not sure what it was. Knowing my son had an interrupted ivc I found a white paper that mentioned it could be thrombosis in his abodomen. The hospital said no and sent him home after five days and would have to evaluated evaluate this further. He was sent home with the same back pain. Within four days of being home his pain worsened and his bowels no longer worked and his legs were swollen and discolored. We went back to the hospital and were told that he had Dvt in both legs and completely occulsef and the so called tumor was a giant clot probably a vein that was possibly where the ivc was located. They did several days of ir intervention and also found out that he had factor five- a clotting disorder.

Long story, try to make as short as possible. I had gastric bypass surgery in 1978 and lost 100+ lbs. Four years ago, in 2015, I had a very fast heart rate and wound up in the hospital for a week. Prior to that, had a heart murmur but nothing else. Dr put me on Xarelto for a-fib, metropol for blood pressure, and a diuretic. Diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse. In 2017 my cardio dr advised surgery to repair/replace the valve but I refused surgery at that time as our 42 year old son was very sick with kidney failure and my husband and I were helping out with taking care of his family. He got a kidney last year and I told my cardio dr that I was ready to have the heart surgery. Went to Barnes in St. Louis (we live 100 miles away) and my dr there was going to to minimally invasive surgery). Surgery was aborted mid-procedure because he could not advance the catheter (or whatever is used, not familiar with the medical terms) because of surgical clips being in the way from my gastric bypass done in 1978! So I spent 4 days recovering at Barnes (from tubes being put in, etc..) As my nurse said, I got all of the pain and none of the results. My dr at Barnes wanted me to reschedule for regular open heart surgery with him after a few months, but I have put it off. My only reason for going to Barnes was for the minimally invasive technique. If I have to go through open heart surgery, I will have it done here in my town (Springfield IL) where we have excellent heart surgeons for open heart surgery. So my regular cardio dr moved to a different state in March, and I have a new cardio dr. Like him very much. He looked at my records, listened to my heart, had me have an EKGand told me that he didnt think that my heart issue was very significant, right now anyway. But, he wanted me to see a surgeon for another opinion. Well, I had met this surgeon a few years ago (he was the one that I told that I would wait on surgery because of my son being sick, and I didnt really care much for him). I went to see him, waited almost 2 hours for him to spend 2 minutes with me. He listened to my heart, looked at my chartand said he didnt think I needed surgery right now  this is the same surgeon that told me 2 years ago that I need open heart surgery! So,both my cardiologist and a cardiac surgeon have told me that they dont think that my heart issue right now is serious enough to require surgery at this time. Today the nurse at the surgeons office calls to set up my open heart surgery! I was flabbergasted and told her I was under the impression that it wasnt necessary at this time. She said that my cardio dr and the surgeon looked at my echo results and decided that the valve is bad enough that it needs to be replacedafter telling me a month ago that surgery isnt necessary as of right now. I am totally lost on what to do. I have zero confidence in the surgeon, although I like my new cardiologist. Seriously considering coming to Mayo for another opinion since I am being told you dont need surgery now, you need surgery now If I do need surgery, I am willing to do it and start the recovery process. But, if it isnt necessary, I sure dont want to have my chest cut open, endure a lot of pain, and spend months recovering because of a procedure that wasnt actually necessary.

In October, 2018, I had chest pains, dizziness, etc.. I went to the ER where they performed a variety of heart related tests such as X-ray, troponin, ECG, and blood panel. all came back good. The left chest pain has NEVER gone away, even today. Some days are better than others. Today, I tried to do a couple things but ended up in bed as my chest pain was terrible. My pain is always in the left chest and sometimes is accompanied by chest pressure all over. But I usually dont have breathing difficulty. After the ER visit I went to my primary doctor who said I probably had panic/anxiety and she put me on Wellbutrin and said GERD is a possibility and gave me meds My next visit I told her I was concerned and still having left chest pain. She then added buspirone. My very next visit after that I expressed I was still having these chest pains and it is greatly affecting my life at this point. (I don't hike or exercise any more because the pain gets stronger the more I exert myself). She then added Lexapro to my meds. I never took the Lexapro and decided to find a new physician. My new doctor has been great and doesn't buy into the whole anxiety thing. She has ordered many tests, including ECG, chest xray, Calcium, echocardiogram, pulmonary test, treadmill stress test, thoracic tests. Everything came back good. The chest pain remains. I have no doubt I have a degree of anxiety, but I am not sure this is the main cause. I tried to buy into it and went to two different counselors. Both said they saw no reason for me to go the counseling route. At my last appointment, I asked my doctor if she could refer me to another cardiologist for a second opinion. She stated she would like to keep looking for other answers, and a cardiologist referral would not be accepted by my insurance at this time. Im at a lose and my quality of life has gone down.

While the frequent urination happened recently, the pins and needles in my feet has been going on for months, and my doctor said not to be worried about that regard. However, with the urination, this worries me as ive read these are symptoms of diabetes. I am a student who drinks a lot of black coffee, but for over a year already.

I dont want to give out to much personal information as I am unaware of who will be seeing this message. My name is Jim Angeles. I am a 16 year old that lives in Arkansas. I am in the 11th grade. I have been struggling with my health for a while now and I am unsure of what to do. Let me start at the beginning Back when I was in 8th grade, I began to run regularly. Before this I had never really had an active life. That was back in 2016 if I recall correctly. I dont exactly remember when but towards the end of the year going into 2017, I began to experience these palpitations. Nothing would hurt during these episodes, my heart would just beat really fast and I could feel it and so could my mother when she put her hand on my chest. We went to see a doctor for this and I was referred to a cardiologist where he did this thing where he put some gel on my chest and used this device that could see into my chest or something. Then I wore a holter monitor for 48 hours to monitor my heart. Everything came back to be normal and the palpitations stopped about a month after they started. Fast forward a bit to August (still in 2017). At this point Im in 10th grade. I dont know if what I am going to say in this part matters but I want to give as many details on my previous health problems as possible. So towards the end of August going into september. I began to feel really sick. It turned out that I was allergic to milk and wheat. It took me a bit to adjust my diet and I struggled to eat right, as my choices were very limited. (Now I have a healthy diet and I dont struggle with these problems anymore). I am also allergic to egg but I have also adjusted my diet for this. I dont struggle with my diet and I eat well. Now lets fast forward to the end of 2018. Im in 11th grade now and this happened just at the end of last year. At the beginning of November last year, I was in class one day. We were watching a movie and I was falling asleep (yes these details are important because I want you to note that I was in a non-stressful situation). All of a sudden I get a sharp jab in my chest. And then another and another. The pain kept growing and growing. I got up and I walked out into the hall. My heart was pounding. It was beating so fast, it felt like it was going to pop out of my chest. I told my teacher and he went to get the nurse. They took me to their office but by then everything had stopped and I felt fine again. It was about a 5 minute timeframe before I got to the nurses office. They took my blood pressure and pulse and temperature and everything was normal expect that my heart rate was elevated a bit. 98 beats per minute if I recall correctly (and this was after it had calmed down). I went home and the rest of the evening I felt okay. My chest ached a bit and my body felt like it had been beat up. A couple weeks later, I was on Thanksgiving break. I had been relaxing all week and there was nothing on my mind that I was worrying about (again note how I am not in a stressful situation). It was a Wednesday evening, I was relaxing on my bed watching a video, when all of a sudden my heart starts pounding. I noticed this right away and I got up. I walked around a bit and I was trying to breath deeply to calm myself. My chest had started hurting. Again it was those sharp jabs of pain. This episode lasted for about an hour. I became disoriented and It felt as if I was going to pass out. After everything passed, I remember my body felt so depleted of energy. I went to sleep thinking I would feel better the next day. The next day I woke up with chest pain. My veins would hurt and I remember I got another episode where my heart started racing. Then the next day after that was the same story. I remember that Friday I went to an Urgent Care clinic because the main clinic that I go to was closed. The doctor checked me and listened to my heart. Everything sounded normal. He said maybe there was some inflamed muscle that was pushing on the heart and causing the chest pain. Everyday after this just got worse and worse. I was experiencing all kinds of things. Sharp Jabs in my chest, needle sensations in my hands that would also spread to other parts of my body, pain in my left upper back and left part of my neck, pain in my veins, disorientation, dizziness, and every now and then it would feel like my heart was racing. I went to go see my doctor and she referred me to a Cardiologist. When I went to go see the Cardiologist, he said that It would be best if I wore a cardiac event monitor for 30 days that would record any abnormal rhythms in my heart to see if there was a problem they could detect. Though out the 30 days that I wore the monitor, it automatically recorded things on multiple occasions. I remember one time my friends and I went to a jumping place and while we were there I started to feel kind of bad and the monitor automatically recorded something on 3 separate times while we were there. Fast forward a bit, after the 30 days the results came back and everything was normal. I was shocked and so was my mother. I did have a couple times where my heart rate elevated slightly, but nothing out of the ordinary according the cardiologist. So I went to go see my doctor and again she explained the results of the monitor and she told me she was confused. She was unsure of what to do. She told me that she would refer me to a social worker that they have at the clinic so I could see her and we would treat it as if it were anxiety. She also gave me Propanolol so that it could treat the elevated heart rate and if it is anxiety, it could also help with that. Now fast forward to present day. This is where I stand right now. I have constant sensations all over my body. It feels like tiny needles pricking me. I will also get jabs in my chest. I havent had palpitations and I think the Propanolol is helping with that. But I still do get this feeling where it feels like my heart has a hic up or a skipped beat. I tried to get back into exercising by going out for a very light jog, but that triggered a lot of bad things. I started having very bad headaches after I went for a jog and they have been going on since last week Tuesday. I will become disoriented and I have had noticeable memory problems. My veins will also hurt sometimes and I will get pain on the left side of my neck. This is really interfering with my daily life. All these symptoms happen everyday and it feels like a battle trying to get to the end of the day because my energy levels are always low even though I sleep 10 to 12 hours everyday. I would like to say one thing. I do not believe this is due to anxiety. My doctor is also not totally convinced that it is anxiety, she just wants us to go ahead and treat this as it were, For Now. She was very confused as she does not know what we could test next. I have had blood drawn and everything is normal. My vitamin D was low a couple weeks ago but I have been taking prescribed supplements for that. I have had multiple EKGs done and they were all normal. I would also like to add on that I have passed out twice due to these symptoms (this was last year). I have gone to the ER three times and everything was normal. Other than that I cant really think of anything else. I hope I am not leaving anything out. I Again like I said I strongly do not believe that this is anxiety or panic attacks. There has to be a trigger to panic attacks and I have done everything to eliminate any kind of stress-triggering activity in my daily life. I am always relaxing and I do deep breathing exercises. Note that most of the episodes I have experienced have happened when I am relaxing or falling asleep and towards the end of the day. Now this is where I need your help and input. For whoever reads this. I need help. I cant keep going like this. This is starting to affect my emotional health. I want to know what is wrong with me, but I dont really want to go to the doctor anymore because I dont know if my doctor can do anything for me. Any thoughts?

Im winded, gasp for air, and my face turns red. When I press my fingers against my sweaty neck, I count 125 thumps a minute and relish every breath. Im running sprints and have only been able to listen to my heart beat like this since open-heart surgery at Mayo Clinic. I was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (my story) a few years ago, a condition that inhibits blood flow because the heart muscle is too thick. I tried medicine, but decided that a procedure to remove a part of that muscle, a septal myectomy, was my best option. Immediately after surgery, a new sound with a steady rhythm and powerful cadence played through my body; this music to my ears was my new and improved heartbeat, which continues today, nearly three years later. Over this time, I have seen a lot of similar questions about HCM surgery on social media sites like Connect. After my positive experience, I wanted to share some HCM CARE tips to help patients and families prepare for surgery: Help  Prior to surgery; get help at home and at work. Line up a caregiver, friend, or family member for two weeks after surgery. My wife was amazing and without her, I believe I would have suffered setbacks. If you work and have a leave of absence policy, make arrangements as early as possible and try to detach from work during your recovery. In my case, that helped me recover physically and mentally. Clean  Follow wound prep instructions precisely before and after surgery. Prepare as many laundered clean towels and wash cloths as you can before leaving for the hospital, if possible, at least 20. These need to be clean every day when you get home, so load up. In my case it was also recommended to use liquid, not bar soap. Meals  Try to buy or prepare two weeks of frozen dinners and lunches. You might not feel like bending over after you return home. This also offers the opportunity eat healthy. Chair  If you have a seat to recline in, great. I didnt, and that would be one of my top recommendations. If you can afford to buy a chair or rent one of those seats that props you up, please consider that. The first few weeks after surgery, I felt like a turtle trying to roll upright after tipping over. Area restaurants and hotels  I live in Rochester, Minnesota and work at Mayo Clinic in Communications, so this experience was easier for me, but a lot of people ask for a list of hotels and restaurants. Rehab  Studies show that people who participate in rehab have an improved long-term outcome. When I came home, my wife would take me to the mall and I would shuffle from store to store until I built up enough stamina to work out. This report from our Mayo Clinic News Network on my cardiac rehab from about two years ago shows the benefits. Also, if it is offered to you, I recommend massages by an occupational therapist who can work the muscles that have been traumatized. I began this in the hospital and believe it helped me. Exhale and inhale  My biggest surprise was low lung capacity. Even though my daughters tried to make me laugh in the hospital, I could barely make a squeaking sound. I used a spirometer (not quite like the one in the picture but a smaller version) to learn how to exhale and inhale after being placed on the heart-lung machine during surgery. The goal or incentive of the spirometer is to open the air sacs in your lungs, making it easier to breathe deeply and keep your lungs clear. It is believed that proper usage may speed up your recovery time while reducing your risk of developing pneumonia or other breathing problems. Additionally, no matter how many pictures and videos as you see before your surgery, its still surprising to see wires and tubes coming out of your chest. Everyones experience is unique, so always please keep that in mind. I would go through it again in a heartbeat (pun intended) and as I have said often, the team at Mayo exceeded all of my expectations. The intense pain following surgery subsided after the first few days and today, I feel decades younger. I have high exercise tolerance and on most days, my overall energy level is very good. However, I occasionally experience bouts of low energy, and when that happens, I try to lay low and sleep. Atypically, my appetite is less than it was prior to surgery and my food tastes have changed. Thats good in that I lost a healthy amount of weight, but bad because I dont enjoy my wifes fantastic cooking like I used to. While my heart is doing well, I have experienced frequent back pain over the past few years. I have gone through physical therapy and am told my core is strong, but I continue to address this challenge. Social media was an invaluable resource to learn about HCM and preparing to make a decision about surgery. In addition to Mayo Connect and Mayos other information about HCM surgery, another great resource for this journey is the blog, HCM Beat, hosted by fellow patient, @cynaburst. I felt prepared because I read posts and blogs from other patients, conducted a lot of research, and felt informed going into this. I do wish that I would have connected with more patients to learn about the post-operative challenges after going home. My surgery was a great success and I hope this post can help make your experience even better. For those of you who have had surgery, what tips would you add ?

I was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (my story) a few years ago, a condition that inhibits blood flow because the heart muscle is too thick.

Over this time, I have seen a lot of similar questions about HCM surgery on social media sites like Connect. After my positive experience, I wanted to share some HCM CARE tips to help patients and families prepare for surgery: Help  Prior to surgery; get help at home and at work. Line up a caregiver, friend, or family member for two weeks after surgery. My wife was amazing and without her, I believe I would have suffered setbacks. If you work and have a leave of absence policy, make arrangements as early as possible and try to detach from work during your recovery. In my case, that helped me recover physically and mentally. Clean  Follow wound prep instructions precisely before and after surgery. Prepare as many laundered clean towels and wash cloths as you can before leaving for the hospital, if possible, at least 20. These need to be clean every day when you get home, so load up. In my case it was also recommended to use liquid, not bar soap. Meals  Try to buy or prepare two weeks of frozen dinners and lunches. You might not feel like bending over after you return home. This also offers the opportunity eat healthy. Chair  If you have a seat to recline in, great. I didnt, and that would be one of my top recommendations. If you can afford to buy a chair or rent one of those seats that props you up, please consider that. The first few weeks after surgery, I felt like a turtle trying to roll upright after tipping over. Area restaurants and hotels  I live in Rochester, Minnesota and work at Mayo Clinic in Communications, so this experience was easier for me, but a lot of people ask for a list of hotels and restaurants. Rehab  Studies show that people who participate in rehab have an improved long-term outcome. When I came home, my wife would take me to the mall and I would shuffle from store to store until I built up enough stamina to work out. This report from our Mayo Clinic News Network on my cardiac rehab from about two years ago shows the benefits. Also, if it is offered to you, I recommend massages by an occupational therapist who can work the muscles that have been traumatized. I began this in the hospital and believe it helped me. Exhale and inhale  My biggest surprise was low lung capacity. Even though my daughters tried to make me laugh in the hospital, I could barely make a squeaking sound. I used a spirometer (not quite like the one in the picture but a smaller version) to learn how to exhale and inhale after being placed on the heart-lung machine during surgery. The goal or incentive of the spirometer is to open the air sacs in your lungs, making it easier to breathe deeply and keep your lungs clear. It is believed that proper usage may speed up your recovery time while reducing your risk of developing pneumonia or other breathing problems. Additionally, no matter how many pictures and videos as you see before your surgery, its still surprising to see wires and tubes coming out of your chest. Everyones experience is unique, so always please keep that in mind. I would go through it again in a heartbeat (pun intended) and as I have said often, the team at Mayo exceeded all of my expectations. The intense pain following surgery subsided after the first few days and today, I feel decades younger. I have high exercise tolerance and on most days, my overall energy level is very good. However, I occasionally experience bouts of low energy, and when that happens, I try to lay low and sleep. Atypically, my appetite is less than it was prior to surgery and my food tastes have changed. Thats good in that I lost a healthy amount of weight, but bad because I dont enjoy my wifes fantastic cooking like I used to. While my heart is doing well, I have experienced frequent back pain over the past few years. I have gone through physical therapy and am told my core is strong, but I continue to address this challenge. Social media was an invaluable resource to learn about HCM and preparing to make a decision about surgery. In addition to Mayo Connect and Mayos other information about HCM surgery, another great resource for this journey is the blog, HCM Beat, hosted by fellow patient, @cynaburst. I felt prepared because I read posts and blogs from other patients, conducted a lot of research, and felt informed going into this. I do wish that I would have connected with more patients to learn about the post-operative challenges after going home. My surgery was a great success and I hope this post can help make your experience even better. For those of you who have had surgery, what tips would you add ?

I sought a second opinion and he said this was not venous insufficiency but he offered no other explanation that I have not already ruled out. He said venous ablation could make the pain and swelling worse. Has anyone ever had this procedure and where can I go to get a trustworthy answer as to whether this is the problem or not?

Ill cut to the chase, Im yet again worse because of the meds I believe. Im now experiencing tachycardia (120 BPM) with no elevation in BP (110/70). The reason he threw me on a muscoskeletal regimen is the occasional sharpness of my pain. Its constantly there and dull in nature right over my heart and I can feel the palpitations through my chest but all my blood work and EKGs keep coming back perfect. I suppose my real question is after 24 hours shouldnt the hydrocodone and steroid shot be giving me some relief and is it typical for a steroid shot to cause tachycardia? I cant shake the feeling that my pain Im having is cardiac but the ER isnt convinced. If it was muscles, the painkillers should be working. If it was GI Id think GI cocktail would stop it.

Ive recently seen a cardiologist and have been given a 30 day heart monitor and my echocardiogram is still a week away but my symptoms are just disrupting my life. Bear with me I want to give as many details as I can so sorry for the long post! Im a 33 y/o female, fit, and generally healthy. For the past few years Ive suffered sudden bouts of fatigue and body aches that go away after a few weeks, blood test reveal some markers of inflammation but nothing doctors seemed concerned about. The last month however, I began feeling very fatigued and was sleeping 12-14 hours sometimes and still feeling like I could sleep more. Eventually, the fatigue became accompanied by an ache in my left shoulder. Since at the time I was working out, I laid off of my workouts completely to recover. That turned into full body aches. On Friday, 11/23, the migraines started, I took my migraine medication and was fine, things took a turn for the worst. On 11/25, I couldnt get out of bed, my body was aching like I had the flu, low grade fever, and severe fatigue. After sleeping all day I decide to wake up and get some food, after about 10 minutes of being awake, I felt an odd sensation and next thing I know I passed out. I was out according to my husband for about 5 seconds, woke up unaware I had passed out, broke out into a cold sweat, and passed out again while on the ground for a few seconds. This when I began feeling like something was really wrong and I havent felt like myself ever since (I have never fainted before). I went to ER after the fainting and two separate ECGs came back, one abnormal one borderline.

Ive recently seen a cardiologist and have been given a 30 day heart monitor and my echocardiogram is still a week away but my symptoms are just disrupting my life. Bear with me I want to give as many details as I can so sorry for the long post! Im a 33 y/o female, fit, and generally healthy. For the past few years Ive suffered sudden bouts of fatigue and body aches that go away after a few weeks, blood test reveal some markers of inflammation but nothing doctors seemed concerned about. The last month however, I began feeling very fatigued and was sleeping 12-14 hours sometimes and still feeling like I could sleep more. Eventually, the fatigue became accompanied by an ache in my left shoulder. Since at the time I was working out, I laid off of my workouts completely to recover. That turned into full body aches. On Friday, 11/23, the migraines started, I took my migraine medication and was fine, things took a turn for the worst. On 11/25, I couldnt get out of bed, my body was aching like I had the flu, low grade fever, and severe fatigue. After sleeping all day I decide to wake up and get some food, after about 10 minutes of being awake, I felt an odd sensation and next thing I know I passed out. I was out according to my husband for about 5 seconds, woke up unaware I had passed out, broke out into a cold sweat, and passed out again while on the ground for a few seconds. This when I began feeling like something was really wrong and I havent felt like myself ever since (I have never fainted before). I went to ER after the fainting and two separate ECGs came back, one abnormal one borderline. The details only said Nonspecific T wave abnormality now evident in Inferior leads T wave inversion now evident in Lateral leads they sent me home and symptoms have only gotten worse.

They can be very painful, and can lead to intense swelling that can make sexual intercourse a non-starter. Vulvar varicosities are also among the more embarrassing issues a woman will encounter during pregnancy, leading many women to try their best to get through it without informing their doctor. This is a bad idea. In most cases, vulvar varicosities can be effectively treated using only compression therapy. A special undergarment designed for vulvar varicosities is worn by the expecting mom, applying constant pressure to the vulva and vulvar region. In most cases, this alone is sufficient to bring about significant relief of symptoms. In severe cases, a technique known as sclerotherapy may be used to reduce the pain and swelling.

After my surgery, I was prescribed Crestor, Plavix, metoprolol tartarate (25 mg 2x/day), and low dose aspirin. In addition, I have been taking Wellbutrin for around 6 years for an unrelated condition. My concern is with the metoprolol and some adverse effects that I am having.

I started running again in April and noticed the following: substantial effort where rate of perceived exertion (RPE) was high, dizziness when standing, weight gain, bradycardia, hypotension, and winded when climbing hills and stairs. My cardiologist reduced my medication to 12.5 2x/day and some of the symptoms subsided. I also found that my runs were improved if I ran *before* taking the half-tablet. (RPE) was improved, heart rate increase slightly but would I would still struggle with longer runs. After discussion with my cardiologist, he decided to have me stop taking the metoprolol since it was such a small dose.

I also noticed irregular heart beat, my blood pressure was ca. 160/105, palpitations, feelings of anxiety. The concern that I have is whether or not the Wellbutrin caused the ""low dose"" metoprolol to have more of an effect on blood concentration, thus making the sudden stop in medication causing a rebound effect. I discussed the interaction between metoprolol and Wellbutrin with my cardiologist and he seemed convinced that 12.5 mg 2x/day was a very small dosage and did not appear to be concerned with the rebound effect. If my heart rate is near maximum when running *easy*, then should I be concerned with running harder? Also, should I be following a tapering protocol?

(RPE) was improved, heart rate increase slightly but would I would still struggle with longer runs. After discussion with my cardiologist, he decided to have me stop taking the metoprolol since it was such a small dose. Three days later, my easy run pace improved by 1 minute/mile with a much improved RPE. However my heart rate was near my maximum. I also noticed irregular heart beat, my blood pressure was ca. 160/105, palpitations, feelings of anxiety. The concern that I have is whether or not the Wellbutrin caused the ""low dose"" metoprolol to have more of an effect on blood concentration, thus making the sudden stop in medication causing a rebound effect. I discussed the interaction between metoprolol and Wellbutrin with my cardiologist and he seemed convinced that 12.5 mg 2x/day was a very small dosage and did not appear to be concerned with the rebound effect. If my heart rate is near maximum when running *easy*, then should I be concerned with running harder? Also, should I be following a tapering protocol? Any guidance would be helpful, and I do realize that before doing anything, I should consult my cardiologist or other health care provider.

I recently had an exercise stress echo while pedaling a bicycle. I'm very confused. The results showed Myocardial Ischemia based on the EKG that was being monitored during the test but the echo did not show anything to indicate lack of blood flow such as a wall motion abnormality. I recently had a cardiac stress MRI which I was told was normal. EKG is monitored during the MRI the entire time and I was never told it showed myocardial ischemia. The MRI was March 2018 and the stress echo was this past Friday. Shouldn't the stress MRI have indicated the same thing just 2 months prior? Can anyone shed any light on this? I'll be discussing this with my doctor of course but i thought i would put this out there to see if anyone has had this experience. Follow Report

He had a banding procedure at birth to slow the blood going into his heart and they patched a hole in his heart. At the age of 4, he was old enough to have a major heart surgery performed called a Modified Fontan. His heart basically works with 2 chambers. He did well until he was 18 and had Afib. He has had a pacemaker since 18 and is on his second one about to get another. He will some day need a heart transplant. As he got older he started getting really bad episodes of gout in his toes, ankles, and knees. He has been told he has arthritis in his back. He has had other problems along the way such as a hernia, dead bone in his knee, teeth implants etc. Last year he had a terrible case of MRSA. He was hospitalized and it took 3-4 tries to get the right drug cocktail to take out this MRSA. They sent him home on IV meds. A week later he stopped getting better and got put back in the hospital for another round of different drugs and sent home again on IV meds, which, thankfully, this time worked. When he was in the hospital with MRSA, they did a CT scan on him (he cannot have an MRI due to his pacemaker), they found a spot on his kidney and said it might be cancer but it was very small and they wanted him to recover from the MRSA. Six months post MRSA, he had 2 biopsies done on his kidney (the first was inconclusive). The second came back as cancer. He just had surgery which froze the cancer and surrounding area. The reason they chose to freeze it is because he is on Xaralto, a blood thinner for his heart. He came home from surgery and his stomach was quite swollen so after 24 hours they told us to come back into ER. We came back to the hospital and they did another CT scan to make sure there was no internal bleeding. They determined the swelling was normal and they were not concerned. During this visit, they noticed his eyes were yellow so they did a bilirubin test which was at a 6, very high. They said that they looked at other bilirubin tests done on him in the past and it always trended high, like around 3 and they figured that the stress from the surgery caused it to jump but they wanted to keep him for observation and run another bilirubin test the next day and see if it dropped. The next day they drew blood and ran more tests on it including bilirubin and hepatitis. They also did a CT scan of his liver and spleen. The results of the blood test were that his bilirubin dropped to 4.9. The CT scan showed some noduality or cirrhosis of the liver and an enlarged spleen. They questioned him about how much he drank and told him to stop drinking. For the record, he is not a big drinker but yes, he does drink. They indicated that the first thing to look at was if the pressure in his heart was off and thus affecting his liver. So he needs to make a cardiology appointment. He also has an appointment with a gastroentomologist (sorry about the spelling). He cannot see the gastro dr for 3 months. While he was in the hospital, I asked the urologist if there was a link between the mrsa, the gout and the kidney cancer. She said she did not know but didnt think so.. that was her answer. She said she would look into it. I asked her why he was not seeing a kidney doctor (nephrologist). She said it was because they work with the function of the kidney and his kidneys are working fine. I disagreed and said they are not working fine because in my mind 1. he just had cancer removed from one and 2. his reoccurring viscious gout episodes. Gout is uric acid  produced by your kidneys  that your body does not get rid of properly. Believe it or not, the urologist came back into the room and said she googled the relationship between gout, kidney function and kidney cancer and couldnt find anything that related them. So I am posting this in the autoimmune section, the heart section and the cancer section of this forum as I have no idea where to start to try and help my son. I have concerns that Xarelto is causing problems, or maybe the Sotalol or Valsartan he takes for his heart. He had a rheumatologist to handle the gout but after the mrsa it was rampant in his body and the steroids, allopurinol and other drugs he normally got from his rheumatologist he could not get without being seen and appointments for a rheumatologist are months out so he ended up in urgent care to get the steroids he needed to calm the gout down. I would like all his doctors to talk to one another and try to learn what is causing all this to happen in his body. I would like his doctors to explain why these things are not related in a logical way. I would like his doctors to take an interest in him and his unique situation and care enough to investigate it further. Ironically my son was a big fan of the show House. He could really use a doctor like that right now. Is there any guidance I can get from this forum? Follow Report"

479,C0018099,Gout,C0013604,Edema,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/complex-health-issues/,Complex Health issues,"My son was born with transposition of the greater arteries among other heart defects, 33 years ago. He had a banding procedure at birth to slow the blood going into his heart and they patched a hole in his heart. At the age of 4, he was old enough to have a major heart surgery performed called a Modified Fontan. His heart basically works with 2 chambers. He did well until he was 18 and had Afib. He has had a pacemaker since 18 and is on his second one about to get another. He will some day need a heart transplant. As he got older he started getting really bad episodes of gout in his toes, ankles, and knees. He has been told he has arthritis in his back. He has had other problems along the way such as a hernia, dead bone in his knee, teeth implants etc. Last year he had a terrible case of MRSA. He was hospitalized and it took 3-4 tries to get the right drug cocktail to take out this MRSA. They sent him home on IV meds. A week later he stopped getting better and got put back in the hospital for another round of different drugs and sent home again on IV meds, which, thankfully, this time worked. When he was in the hospital with MRSA, they did a CT scan on him (he cannot have an MRI due to his pacemaker), they found a spot on his kidney and said it might be cancer but it was very small and they wanted him to recover from the MRSA. Six months post MRSA, he had 2 biopsies done on his kidney (the first was inconclusive). The second came back as cancer. He just had surgery which froze the cancer and surrounding area. The reason they chose to freeze it is because he is on Xaralto, a blood thinner for his heart. He came home from surgery and his stomach was quite swollen so after 24 hours they told us to come back into ER. We came back to the hospital and they did another CT scan to make sure there was no internal bleeding. They determined the swelling was normal and they were not concerned. During this visit, they noticed his eyes were yellow so they did a bilirubin test which was at a 6, very high. They said that they looked at other bilirubin tests done on him in the past and it always trended high, like around 3 and they figured that the stress from the surgery caused it to jump but they wanted to keep him for observation and run another bilirubin test the next day and see if it dropped. The next day they drew blood and ran more tests on it including bilirubin and hepatitis. They also did a CT scan of his liver and spleen. The results of the blood test were that his bilirubin dropped to 4.9. The CT scan showed some noduality or cirrhosis of the liver and an enlarged spleen. They questioned him about how much he drank and told him to stop drinking. For the record, he is not a big drinker but yes, he does drink. They indicated that the first thing to look at was if the pressure in his heart was off and thus affecting his liver. So he needs to make a cardiology appointment. He also has an appointment with a gastroentomologist (sorry about the spelling). He cannot see the gastro dr for 3 months. While he was in the hospital, I asked the urologist if there was a link between the mrsa, the gout and the kidney cancer. She said she did not know but didnt think so.. that was her answer. She said she would look into it. I asked her why he was not seeing a kidney doctor (nephrologist). She said it was because they work with the function of the kidney and his kidneys are working fine. I disagreed and said they are not working fine because in my mind 1. he just had cancer removed from one and 2. his reoccurring viscious gout episodes. Gout is uric acid  produced by your kidneys  that your body does not get rid of properly. Believe it or not, the urologist came back into the room and said she googled the relationship between gout, kidney function and kidney cancer and couldnt find anything that related them. So I am posting this in the autoimmune section, the heart section and the cancer section of this forum as I have no idea where to start to try and help my son. I have concerns that Xarelto is causing problems, or maybe the Sotalol or Valsartan he takes for his heart. He had a rheumatologist to handle the gout but after the mrsa it was rampant in his body and the steroids, allopurinol and other drugs he normally got from his rheumatologist he could not get without being seen and appointments for a rheumatologist are months out so he ended up in urgent care to get the steroids he needed to calm the gout down. I would like all his doctors to talk to one another and try to learn what is causing all this to happen in his body. I would like his doctors to explain why these things are not related in a logical way.

His family has no history of mental illness. He has had chest pains on & off for the past 3 years. Along with the chest pains hes complained of feeling dizzy/faint/cloudy & just a general sense of not feeling right. We have seen a neurologist, cardiologist, pulmonologist, endocrinologist, gastroenterologist, ent, urologist, our general practitioner, a disease specialist  on top of multiple ER visits. He has had a regular stress test, nuclear stress test, CT scan, MRI of his entire body (not all at once, but over time its equaled his entire body), colonoscopy, endoscopy, multiple different blood tests, hes even been tested for lymphoma, Lymes Disease, hes had an EEG & ECG. I am sure I am missing some tests however, each test came back perfect except his vitamin D is low (hes taking prescribed supplements), his testosterone is low (not enough to need supplements per our endocrinologist), his endoscopy came back inconclusive for Celiac disease so he did cut out gluten completely, his cholesterol is also minimally high so he also cut out meat. He has complained of minor dizziness here & there, hes never passed out. He woke up sweating once or twice in June (what prompted them to check for Lymphoma). He also has mentioned that he just doesnt feel right? The big thing is that everyday he gets home from work he complains of his chest hurting. He will call me in the middle of the day saying his chest hurts. I know he is hurting, I know what he is feeling is real but what else could they possibly test for? Is there anything I can recommend? I have no idea what to do anymore or how to help him. His pains have only interrupted his workday a few times to where he has gone to the EMTs that are on site (he works at an airport). I would say we go through phases of his chest hurts so bad we go to ER only to be told hes fine. At this point in time he says its mainly just annoying & frustrating to be told nothing is wrong but feel like something is, people dont just have chest pains for nothing do they? I know his father passing away when he was still very young has scarred him & I know that is playing a minor role in his worry  even though he wont admit it.

My name is Eliott. Over the last 5 years, Ive been suffering from hypercholesterolemia. As I am turning 25, my cholesterol levels seem to be relentlessly increasing. Despite the fact that I do not practice any sport, and my job requires me to sit all day long, Ive never been overweight. To the contrary, I have always managed to maintain a healthy but not ideal or athletic body weight. All the doctors Ive met insisted on putting me on prescription statin drugs, which I refused because of their predictable severe side effects in the long run on bones, muscles, and joints, etc Even though my good HDL cholesterol worth 42 points, I am kind of concerned that my LDL cholesterol has reached 292 mg/dl, according the last blood check-up which I did on mid-April 2016. Today, I am being extra careful watching my diet. Trying hard to reduce my fat intake by avoiding fried foods, sweets, bakery and everything that Ive read it might badly affect my cholesterol. I drink a lot of green tea, I eat oat with some dried fruits for breakfast. I quit dairy products and substituted chicken for red meat, etc In brief, I now feel forced to consume heart-healthy foods which have been shown to help lower bad blood cholesterol and triglycerides levels. In addition, its been 2 weeks since Ive been taking 1200 mg of red yeast rice daily with a dose of 100 mg of coQ10 (later, I was shocked to discover that red yeast rice is still controversial and is not but an alternative statin. How accurate is this?). I also make sure to sparingly include in my diet supplements and whole foods such as spirulina, chlorella, rice protein, vitamins D3 and B12, grape seed extract (sometimes red wine, resveratrol or pomegranate), royal jelly, etc As a next step, I am seriously planning to switch to either a combination of Sytrinol, Flush-Free niacin and apple pectin OR a garlic supplement (1800-2000 mg), cayenne (2000 mg) in addition to a certain dose of Guar Gum and/or Psyllium. But before proceeding any further, I just want to know whether or not I am doing the right thing. If not, should I give up all the supplements and switch to an individual dose of a statin? Could you please advise me on which cure will be more effective in my case? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! Follow Report"

Not sure if this is where I should post all this or not? My daughter was just in a bad car accident. A drunk driver hit her and her husband and best friend. They are all recovering and hurt very bad. My daughter had broken ribs and severe bruising along with her spleen being hurt. Another big thing was that her main artery in her neck was hurt due to the seat belt. She was sent to Regions in MN. They only kept her one week and put her on 3 different high does of blood thinners because of how the artery in the neck was. They did not think of any other factors involved. Less than 2 days at home she some how moved the ribs slightly so they caused internal bleeding. The bruises on her were very severe as well. All of a sudden she was screaming in pain and blood pooled so badly in her back and left arm that it looked like she was the hunch back of noder dame. She was rushed back to Regions. They took her completely off all of the blood thinners. Have given her plasma, Vit K, and 3 blood transfussions so far. The blood is finally starting to ooze where it should (as they said) in the body. Now they say she should only be on a low dose of asprin. That they over did the blood thinners on her. She wants another CT scan of her neck done (of the artery) before leaving. They are having a fit with her saying it wont show any thing different. She is telling them she wants this done for her piece of mine. That everyone at the hospital has been on a different page from Day 1 and now she is scared of a stroke happening. But yet she cant get her blood to thin or she will bleed again. She has also become anemic now and needs iron. So as they told her, she is a unique situation. Everyone is telling her she needs to get out of there and go to the Mayo Clinic to get a second opinion. I would have to agree. Although she and I are not sure how to even start this process.

Please keep in mind that I am very sensitive to medication and most of the time get the unusual or rare side effects from meds. The Cardiologist said I should swap from Benicar 40 mgs to Losartan Potassium 100 mgs . He said since the Losartan Potassium is not as effective as the Benicar that I should go up on the carvediol from 12.5 mgs , twice daily to 25 Mgs twice daily . I was okay with that and went along as usual . After about a week or 2 on this combination of medication , my left arm & leg started to hurt really bad . A couple days after that my left jaw and left shoulder and back started to hurt . A couple days after that I started having chest pains so bad I had to call 911 because I thought I was having a heart attack . I went to Emory University and they checked my cardiac enzymes and said that they were fine & that I did not have a heart attack . They were not sure what happened . I went back to the Cardiologist the next day and told him of the pains and he gave me Nitro Glycerin . It really did help with the chest pains . He scheduled a echocardiogram, which came out fine , a treadmill stress test, which came out fine , a nuclear stress test, which came out fine & then a heart cath which came out completely normal . He said my heart was clean and I had no blockages whatsoever . I told him my chest was still hurting , my jaw , my left shoulder and leg was still hurting . He gave me a long acting nitrate (isorbiside) and some more refills of the Nitro glycerin . He said my heart was fine and there was nothing else he could do for me . I started feeling so ill , overall feeling of being poisioned , so I thought back to when I started feeling this way and thought about the change in med. From Benicar to Losartan. By then the bottom of my feet hurt to walk on , all my teeth were hurting like they were loose and going to come out . When I researched the Losartan these are rare side effects of Losartan. I stopped the Losartan and paid out of pocket to swap back to the Benicar. After a 2 weeks of that , I was not getting any better, is when I started to research the carvediol. all these symptoms are side effects of the carvediol . All though I did fine on the 12.5 mgs twice a day , 25 mgs twice a day was way to much for me . I called my Cardiologist and told him what I had found and that this could very well be side effects of these meds and he said that it was not . I told him I read it on Web MD & the Mayo Clinic and he still insist that it is very unlikely that carvediol or Losartan was causing these side effects? I had never had a chest pain in my life , much less the arm pain , leg pain , feet pain & if my heart was fine then was is causing all this pain ? He said since my heart was fine he could not help me with the pain! He referred me to my Primary care. They agreed that all these pains were side effects of these meds but said they couldnt help since all my blood work was fine and said I need to go back to the Cardiologist since he prescribed these meds? He insisted the pains are not side effects of the Carvediolol . I am in so much pain . My primary care prescribed some muscle relaxers but I am scared to take them because there may be side effects .

EPISODES  Since 2015 Ive had about six episodes of crushing chest pain that radiated to my shoulders and back and made it difficult to breathe. Each episode happened a few days after upper body exercise (climbing ladders, lifting).  ECG and blood work was always negative. Chest X-ray in early 2016 negative  Discontinued HRT just in case trouble was estrogen related.  Chest ultrasound negative, blood work ordered, and referral given to Internist.  Physiotherapy prescribed which I have attended for two months. It has helped with muscle pain.  I requested a psychiatric referral. Dr. Prescribed Ativan for use during attacks. PAIN CHANGED  Two months ago I had an episode sitting up at 2 am, another laying down at 6 am, and another laying down at 5 pm all within 24 hours.  I used Ativan for two of the three episodes. Ativan had zero effect on my breathing and very little on the pain.  This was the first time Id had more than one episode at a time. PAIN CHANGED  Psychiatrist doubled my propranolol and prescribed Cipralex. Two days later I took a long haul flight overseas.  The episodes became daily then hourly. Pain and shortness of breath, fatigue, sleeping 14 plus hours a day in four hour stints. Climbing or lifting seems to bring on an episode more quickly than just walking. I learned to sleep sitting up and to avoid triggers as I discovered them. Cold clammy sweats a few minutes after each episode. Appetite dropped off. I discontinued Cipralex after two weeks. Episodes lessened slightly after two days but I stopped sleeping so much.  I foolishly ate a large meal with wine after a relatively active day. That evening I had episodes one after another, nearly continuous. Ambulance called and they gave me nitroglycerin. Afterwards I could breath even laying on my back on the gurney. The chest pain slowed down and stopped within a few minutes. ECG and blood tests normal. I asked if I could wait until I got back home for more tests.  I need to take a short walk every morning to clear my lungs. What makes it worse?  Cipralex  Laying on my back  Flying  Car sickness  Stress  Big meals  Alcohol  Chiropractor  Sex What makes it better?  Sitting up  Leaning forward  Resting  Concentrate on breathing deeply  Nitroglycerin (sometimes it takes 2)  Hot bath DIAGNOSIS TO DATE GP #1  Costochondritis  prescribed physio which helped with muscle pain. Physiotherapist after two months says the muscle pain was from gaurding my chest due to an underlying issue. This GP ordered an echocardiogram which was negative and blood tests and he referred me to Internist. He doesnt feel the issue is anxiety. Psychiatrist 1  absolutely convinced its anxiety, doesnt want to discuss alternatives. Psychiatrist 2  (filling in for the referred psychiatrist) told me that the only conclusive way to rule out heart was with an angiogram. Internist  does not feel its heart related but has ordered a stress test to be sure. Very clear that if the stress test is normal he will not pursue further potential heart issues. He says Psychiatrist 2 was in error telling me that an angiogram was the only conclusive test. He mentioned that the ultrasound technician did not look at my heart lining. He feels that the reason my symptoms worsened with Cipralex was due to an allergic reaction. He suggested that we may be looking at costochondritis, esophageal spasms or anxiety. He gave me nitroglycerin .3 mg and ventolin in the meantime which is helping immensely. I can even sleep on my back a bit. I dont know whether I should ask to see a cardiologist or whether I should accept what Im hearing from the psychiatrist and Internist. I looked up the DSM V for panic attacks and I do not meet the criteria. I am emotionally calm during episodes and actually had one episode at a west end musical because the music was exciting.

That evening I had episodes one after another, nearly continuous. Ambulance called and they gave me nitroglycerin. Afterwards I could breath even laying on my back on the gurney. The chest pain slowed down and stopped within a few minutes. ECG and blood tests normal. I asked if I could wait until I got back home for more tests.  I need to take a short walk every morning to clear my lungs. What makes it worse?  Cipralex  Laying on my back  Flying  Car sickness  Stress  Big meals  Alcohol  Chiropractor  Sex What makes it better?  Sitting up  Leaning forward  Resting  Concentrate on breathing deeply  Nitroglycerin (sometimes it takes 2)  Hot bath DIAGNOSIS TO DATE GP #1  Costochondritis  prescribed physio which helped with muscle pain. Physiotherapist after two months says the muscle pain was from gaurding my chest due to an underlying issue. This GP ordered an echocardiogram which was negative and blood tests and he referred me to Internist. He doesnt feel the issue is anxiety. Psychiatrist 1  absolutely convinced its anxiety, doesnt want to discuss alternatives. Psychiatrist 2  (filling in for the referred psychiatrist) told me that the only conclusive way to rule out heart was with an angiogram. Internist  does not feel its heart related but has ordered a stress test to be sure. Very clear that if the stress test is normal he will not pursue further potential heart issues. He says Psychiatrist 2 was in error telling me that an angiogram was the only conclusive test. He mentioned that the ultrasound technician did not look at my heart lining. He feels that the reason my symptoms worsened with Cipralex was due to an allergic reaction. He suggested that we may be looking at costochondritis, esophageal spasms or anxiety. He gave me nitroglycerin .3 mg and ventolin in the meantime which is helping immensely. I can even sleep on my back a bit. I dont know whether I should ask to see a cardiologist or whether I should accept what Im hearing from the psychiatrist and Internist. I looked up the DSM V for panic attacks and I do not meet the criteria. I am emotionally calm during episodes and actually had one episode at a west end musical because the music was exciting.

The bleed was due to treatment with warfarin. He fainted at home and I had him transported to the ER. The hospital doctor ordered an abdominal CT Scan and discovered the hematoma. He was immediately given Vitamin K and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma to stop the bleeding. The hematoma is sitting directly on top of his psoas muscle which controls the lifting of the thigh. He is very immobile right now. The hematoma has travelled to where it presents a large terrible bruise on his side. The physical therapist today said we needed to do therapy at home as tolerated and wait for the hematoma to be absorbed by the body. Until the hematoma is absorbed his left leg is pretty useless. I am wondering if anyone has experienced something similar and if so, how long did it take for the hematoma to resolve? His pain is not horrific now but there is a constant dull nagging pain and he cant move around in bed. He doesnt have the strength to roll onto his side. So nighttime and bed provokes agitation and anxiety. He hasnt been able to sleep at all. He is 76 but a very youthful 76. He is not particularly physically active but he is passionate about his hobbies and life and this immobility and weakness is tough on his mental health. The PCP gave him some Ambien to try tonight to see it that helps. Follow Report"

Vegetarian my whole life (lacto ovo) and exercise 1-3 times a week on average  usually something cardio-ish like the elliptical, jogging or rowing machine for 30-45 minutes. I dont know my body fat %, but could stand to lose 10lbs or so. I work in IT so am at a computer screen most of the day. I sleep through the night but rarely feel rested in the morning. Anyway, two or three months back I started feeling a bit lightheaded. Just a sense of disorientation when I walked around kind of like a mild head rush. I chalked it mostly up to fatigue and it kind of came and went. The last couple of weeks I feel like its worsened to the point that I began to think it may actually be something I need to look into. Observations:  Resting heart rate  69bpm. Perhaps this is a bit on the high side?  Not sure on my current BP unfortunately.  I dont faint or anything, noor have I had any disruption to my vision.  No weakness in limbs that I can perceive. Ive had knee surgery in the past (ACL) and have always had a bit of numbness and tingling from time to time in that leg, so I cant say that anything noticeably different is happening there.  I cant be certain if Im imagining it or not, but it seems Ive noticed my face feeling a little rubbery. Given my hypersensitivity to any possible symptom at this point Im not sure if this one is real or not.  Ive still been able to exercise w/out issue. If I close my eyes I dont notice the dizzy/lightheaded sensation.  I have had chest pains off and on for many years (since in my early 20s), but its inconsistent and have been told probably just something related to chest wall or using weights. Have never been formally checked for anything.  I sleep through the entire night (6-7 hours) without issue and dont snore, but again rarely wake up feeling rested. Anyway, obviously worried could be something heart related or ITA (though to my knowledge my family doesnt really have a history of this), but figure more likely to be diet related or something else. Symptoms kind of matched anemia, so Ive started taking an iron supplement along w/ Vitamin C and B12 a couple of times a day. I think it can take a week or so to see any difference. I may call my doc up tomorrow and see if they can somehow fit me in sooner. Not sure how worried I should be. Anyway, will follow up. Liked by Dawn, Alumna Mentor Follow Report"

He then prescribed a beta blocker, cholesterol meds, daily nitro (once a day) and blood pressure pills. I was not having them before, but now Im having night angina attacks. They are horrible. Has anyone else had this issue? I wake up multiple times during the night with sweats and chest pain. I take a nitro under the tongue and it helps. It seems that Im only having them when at rest.

He had a Lexiscan stress test this morning, which showed that he, in fact, suffered a heart attack. His ejection fraction on the right was 55% and on the left was, I believe, around 45%.

Doctors have told me that I have vasodepressor syncope. They started me on a medication to try to help and it has been about a month and their is no diffrence. The doctors more in less said that is all that they can do. But its getting kind of crazy passing out at least once a day or more. I have had to quit my internship because of it and stop doing a lot of stuff. Its crazy I am a healthy person my whole life up until now and now my whole life is revolving around me passing out and I am only a college student. What I was wondering is do you all think I should go to the mayo clinic and see if they say anything diffrent? All I really want is everything to go back to normal. In between the passing out I feel light headed and dizzy but dont actually pass out and there is never any signs when I do pass out. Does this happen to anyone else?

Help,"Hello, I posted before in another group in its entirety but I think its too broad and there could be a multitude of theories and explanations. So Im going to break my story down into my most bothersome episodic symptoms. To start, everything on the surface looks like panic disorder or anxiety. However, my different episodes seem to be helping each other keep me feeling frantic more days than not so on the surface it looks like anxiety. Ive had lots of lab work testing including thyroid, Lyme, sleep apnea home test, brain MRI, spine MRI, abdominal ct scan, and way too many doctor visits with no answer, but they do agree on one thing. The symptoms are weird and seem to be more than just anxiety. There are little bits here and there but unfortunately not enough to go on. Keep in mind these episodes arent all going on at the same time but theyre not giving me any recovery time and feel like im sinking further down the hole. Its like fighting 5 bullies one at a time and losing. Just as you feel like you can get up another bully hops in. Episode 1: After waking up with head pressure, teeth chattering, shivering, lower back pain, and sweating. Oral temperature is ALWAYS between 93.8 F and 94.8 during these episodes. Also, every day is constant cold hands and feet that never happened until all of these episodes started. Episode 2: Brain fog, head pressure that feels like youre being pushed down when standing (like when youve had one too many drinks), usually later in the day when that feeling wears off, Ill have adrenaline body tingling, uncontrollable thoughts of self-harm and head chatter. (Not dwelling on things or worried about things, its just the mind doing what it does and I have no control.) Also, my eye will twitch like crazy before and during these. Episode 3: When standing for a long period of time, like cooking or washing dishes, and sweating starts to happen my heart rate increases and get extremely dizzy and feels like Im being physically pulled down. Episode 4: An overly excited feeling, almost like needing to yell or run to get adrenaline out, Heart rate is low. Episode 5. Sharp colon pain, yellow stools (frequently), stools that look sickly or unhealthy, and constipation more often than not. I had a colonoscopy recently and I was told everything looks good. Ive tried SSRIs and benzodiazepines and they dont stop these episodes from occurring. Ive tried strict diets and those dont help. If you have any thought about even one of these episodes please dont be shy to comment. Thank you so much for taking the time to read.

I had a series of treatments for that ear including drugs, drops, and a tube. This all started about the same time my various heart conditions surfaced. According to the ENT doctor I saw the eardrum is fine, and time will take care of the rest. However, I continue to have this sensation in that ear with compromised hearing from it. There is not a lot of pain associated with this, just extremely annoying. Both of these conditions started a year and a half ago. Could there be a connection?

My husband, Walt, complained to his Mayo cardiologist about shortness of breath upon exertion. He had cardiac workups and pulmonary testing, and because he has a slow heart rate (his whole life), they thought a pacemaker to make sure his heart rate increased with exertion, would help. He had a pacemaker implanted at Mayo in August 2018. Honestly  it hasnt made any difference in his shortness of breath. None at all, and as far as we know, the only thing the pacemaker has done is ensure that his heart rate does not drop below 60 bpm. Walt has Parkinsons Disease, and was scheduled for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery at Mayo, to take place a few weeks after his pacemaker. MRIs are essential for DBS  and because of this, I spent a long time insisting on confirmation that the pacemaker Mayo was putting in him would be MRI compatible. It is. His DBS surgery was successful, and his Parkinsons symptoms were greatly reduced. Unfortunately  long story short  Walts DBS system, (consisting of electrodes placed in his brain, wires from the electrodes snaking their way across his skull and down his neck, and a battery pack/controller device under his collar bone like a pacemaker), all had to be removed by the Mayo neurosurgeon in March 2019, when a wire coming from his brain broke through the skin on his head, and was exposed. We have subsequently scheduled another DBS surgery at Barrows, Brain and Spine Center. Everything is in place for the surgery  except for one thing. Mayo cardiology gave him cardiac clearance, but will NOT give him a standard signed form clearing his pacemaker for MRI. The form must be completed and signed by Walts cardiologist of record, and sent to Barrows. Since the pacemaker is monitored remotely and transmissions are evaluated by doctors in the Mayo system; and since there have been no issues with the pacemaker, which is MRI compatible, the cardiologist at MAyo should be able to clear the pacemaker for MRI. They refuse to do so  Mayo says it will not accept liability for the acceptability of an MRI outside of the Mayo system. Barrows Patient Care Coordinator tells me that if Mayo will not sign off on it, we need to find another cardiologist to do an evaluation of the pacemaker  either remotely or by wanding him in the office, thus becoming Walts cardiologist of record. If we need to do that, there is no way Walt will be able to meet the timelines for his surgery, scheduled 10/2. WTH????? I guess Mayo wants to keep Walts business in-house? I feel like his pacemaker is being held hostage. I am furious  this is me venting. Has anyone else ever had to deal with this?

Apparently all went well. That day, the 21st, AND the following day, aside from being exhausted and sore, I did not experience a single AFIB episode! You ALL know what a joyous feeling THAT is! I began to foolishly hope that I was going to be one of the very lucky ones I have read about on these sites who say after their ablation, they felt like a million bucks, didnt have a single issue with their recovery and were back at work in 3 days. Who ARE these amazing people? After 3 days I was still trying to climb out of the fog from the general anesthetic! (Actually, there was a bit of a mishap there. Turned out I was extremely intolerant of this particular anesthetic and had a very nasty and frightening resurfacing from it. And please note that it was an INTOLERANCENOT AN ALLERGIC REACTION. The difference really CAN be life and death) Sorry, I see I am going into far more detail than I intended, I do apologize. My question, my concern, MY FEAR, is that on Saturday, 3 days post op, I woke up feeling what I can only describe as a sort of vibrating/buzzing feeling in my chest. It felt nothing like the pounding, chaotic beats that were MY AFIB experience. This sensation lasted consistently, with a few short pauses, from Saturday to now.Tuesday, the 26th. About 30 minutes ago it just stopped and so far, has not returned. I hope it stays gone as it was becoming not only annoying but frightening. Has anybody out there had this same or similar feeling? Does anybody know what It could have been? Im trying VERY hard to be logical and think that its just part of the healing process..perhaps nerves calming down? Perhaps the inflammation was pushing on something?) Hows that for a highly medical term? SOMETHING LOL Any stories, experiences, odd sensations would really help me out. I dont see my EP for another 3 weeks, and while they did give me paperwork about what to expect, for those of us with some anxiety issues, the details are pretty skimpy. I am also trying very hard NOT to call the doctors offices and be one of those people. I realize to them, this procedure is basically no big deal, but for me, it has been SO much more than I thought. (Well, my bubble just burst..I have just had some more episodes of things going on in my chest) Should I expect this to be as bad the entire 3 months before they tell me if the ablation worked or not. Right this minute, Im feeling like I made a huge mistake having this proceduremaybe I should have tried harder to tolerate the antiarrhythmics? Thanks for listening. Being alone and scared is not fun. Liked by TERESA LOGAN, catmom777 Follow Report"

I like and trust both my cardiologist and the EP who will be doing the procedure, but there wasnt much time for them to answer all my questions. I am BEGGING anyone who has had an ablation to tell me what its going to be like AFTER the procedure. Ive read and heard SO many conflicting stories, I dont know what or who to believe and that is pushing my anxiety through the roof! Will it really be 3-6 months before I know if the ablation worked? Will I really still have episodes of AFIB for months afterwards? Will I have lots of chest pains, which Ive read I will? How am I really going to feel? I know I will need to stay on the Xarelto, but will they put me on antiarrhythmics as well? I am just so scared about the after part of this procedure as nobody has really told me everything I can expect. I have panic disorder, which definitely does NOT help, but when I KNOW what to expect, I can control the panic. PLEASE.if any of you can help me soon I would be ever so grateful.

It was discovered when I went in for an annual appointment with my cardiologist, about a 3 weeks. The visit and subsequent EKG resulted in my being immediately admitted to the hospital for a heart catheter at which time I received a stint for a single 90% blockage. During this procedure I was told about the LTBBB. Previous stress tests (about every 2 to 3 years apart) showed absolutely no problems. Until this recent event I had not experienced any of the listed symptoms that are usually associated with BBBs, at least from what I read from literature and on this web site. Over the last 3 weeks I have had 2 additional stress test evaluations, including a cardiolite stress test. Both test began normally, no indicated abnormalities, however once my heart rate began to elevate the BBB kicked in. Then after setting for a few minutes and my heart rate dropped the rhythm dropped back into normal rhythm. Additionally, began to experience periodic flare ups that seem not to associated with any specific physical activity. I can tell when they are coming because there is a pressure or mild chest pain that seems to accompany each episode. These episodes last a very short time and have usually been relieved by me coughing fairly hard a couple of times. At the moment, my cardiologist tells me my BBB is a very mild case and is currently treating me with a mediation that is used to reduce heart pain. My concerns are this: First, chest pressure or pain is not listed as a symptom of BBB alone. Since I am experiencing this pain with my BBB episodes I am inclined to think there is also something else going on. Lastly, I am concerned with a heart pain mediation being my only treatment. It can't be a good idea to mask pain that is obviously an indication of there possibly being something else going on. Follow Report"

When it happens I have to sit fast, or feel like I will faint,, I have many pain problems and possible sjrogens syndrome. I have managed ok until this heart thing started. I can literally not make it through a short shopping trip, have to rapidly go to the car, and sit more or less feeling out of breath and pounding chest, maybe for about 15 minutes. This has beome so limiting to my life. I have seen a cardiologist, did a holter monitor, doctor said normal. Ekg normal, echocardiogram, normal, potassium and sodium normal. Im 64, 3 years ago I was exercising regularly, then a lot of back issues started. I know I am out of shape, but basically can only do very minor exercise, so some have suggested being unfit is the cause. I have been out of shape at other times, and yes, it effects you as far as stamina. But this is simply upon standing, sometimes even just turning too much in bed it will do it a little. I have low blood pressure. My primary has tossed put an offer of beta blockers, but this worries me. The cardiologist says heart is normal. But it sure doesnt act normal. I eat healthy, all blood work except auto immune is normal. I am at a loss. Seems that I would try the beta blockers, but I am alone a lot and fear they would drop my bp to pass out level. I believe in holistic medicine, and have been taking magnesium for years. I plan on trying the theonate form soon. If anyone has experienced this or has an idea of where to go next, would appreciate your thoughts Liked by grandmaR Follow Report"

Have lived with it since being told 35 years ago thats what I had to do. Over this period I had a couple of instances where my heart would start racing but only for a few seconds. Well, four years ago I was sitting at my desk at work one night and the racing kicked in, but this time it lasted for 14 hours. Since then, the AFIB incidents slowly got more frequent and so did all the flutters, jumping, hesitating, etc. to the point they were more alarming. I do have a cardiologist that Ive been seeing for about 3 years now. Put me on metropolol tartrate then switched to metropolol succinate, anywhere from 50-100 milligrams a day. Dont know if it has really helped or not. Also taking Vitamin C, D, Magnesium and baby aspirin. Have been prescribed blood thinners the last couple of years as well as dilitizem but have been afraid to take any of it. When in AFIB, my heart beats very hard at between 175-200 beats a minute. Have had several holter meters, echocardiograms, stress test over the last few years but everything appears to be normal. The holter meters did record hundreds of skips and other bothersome beating each day, and one time recorded 8,000 over a two-day period. On two occasions since April, 2017, I went into AFIB for several hours then, of course it always stops on its own. But, these two times it remained with me like aftershocks going in and out of AFIB numerous times over a two or three day period after the initial AFIB incident. Heart will feel very strange going in and out of these numerous incidents and makes me a little light headed. Feels like the heart is just rumbling around not knowing what to do. Very scary. Ablation has been talked about in the past and when I am at my worst I really start considering it. I do try and get through this all over the years by pushing myself and deciding Im just going to live my life the best I can. I am still a smoker, drink black coffee and drink beer maybe 3 or 4 a week. Been told however to cut down on all of it. But I am stubborn. Any suggestions or comments would be welcome. Follow Report"

So I isolate myself and dont spread my wings. Yet by nature I am an adventurerso this isolation leads to more depression. What is the lesson in all of this.

Im running sprints and have only been able to listen to my heart beat like this since open-heart surgery at Mayo Clinic. I was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (my story) a few years ago, a condition that inhibits blood flow because the heart muscle is too thick. I tried medicine, but decided that a procedure to remove a part of that muscle, a septal myectomy, was my best option. Immediately after surgery, a new sound with a steady rhythm and powerful cadence played through my body; this music to my ears was my new and improved heartbeat, which continues today, nearly three years later. Over this time, I have seen a lot of similar questions about HCM surgery on social media sites like Connect. After my positive experience, I wanted to share some HCM CARE tips to help patients and families prepare for surgery: Help  Prior to surgery; get help at home and at work. Line up a caregiver, friend, or family member for two weeks after surgery. My wife was amazing and without her, I believe I would have suffered setbacks. If you work and have a leave of absence policy, make arrangements as early as possible and try to detach from work during your recovery. In my case, that helped me recover physically and mentally. Clean  Follow wound prep instructions precisely before and after surgery. Prepare as many laundered clean towels and wash cloths as you can before leaving for the hospital, if possible, at least 20. These need to be clean every day when you get home, so load up. In my case it was also recommended to use liquid, not bar soap. Meals  Try to buy or prepare two weeks of frozen dinners and lunches. You might not feel like bending over after you return home. This also offers the opportunity eat healthy. Chair  If you have a seat to recline in, great. I didnt, and that would be one of my top recommendations. If you can afford to buy a chair or rent one of those seats that props you up, please consider that. The first few weeks after surgery, I felt like a turtle trying to roll upright after tipping over. Area restaurants and hotels  I live in Rochester, Minnesota and work at Mayo Clinic in Communications, so this experience was easier for me, but a lot of people ask for a list of hotels and restaurants. Rehab  Studies show that people who participate in rehab have an improved long-term outcome. When I came home, my wife would take me to the mall and I would shuffle from store to store until I built up enough stamina to work out. This report from our Mayo Clinic News Network on my cardiac rehab from about two years ago shows the benefits. Also, if it is offered to you, I recommend massages by an occupational therapist who can work the muscles that have been traumatized. I began this in the hospital and believe it helped me. Exhale and inhale  My biggest surprise was low lung capacity. Even though my daughters tried to make me laugh in the hospital, I could barely make a squeaking sound. I used a spirometer (not quite like the one in the picture but a smaller version) to learn how to exhale and inhale after being placed on the heart-lung machine during surgery. The goal or incentive of the spirometer is to open the air sacs in your lungs, making it easier to breathe deeply and keep your lungs clear. It is believed that proper usage may speed up your recovery time while reducing your risk of developing pneumonia or other breathing problems. Additionally, no matter how many pictures and videos as you see before your surgery, its still surprising to see wires and tubes coming out of your chest. Everyones experience is unique, so always please keep that in mind. I would go through it again in a heartbeat (pun intended) and as I have said often, the team at Mayo exceeded all of my expectations. The intense pain following surgery subsided after the first few days and today, I feel decades younger. I have high exercise tolerance and on most days, my overall energy level is very good. However, I occasionally experience bouts of low energy, and when that happens, I try to lay low and sleep. Atypically, my appetite is less than it was prior to surgery and my food tastes have changed. Thats good in that I lost a healthy amount of weight, but bad because I dont enjoy my wifes fantastic cooking like I used to. While my heart is doing well, I have experienced frequent back pain over the past few years. I have gone through physical therapy and am told my core is strong, but I continue to address this challenge. Social media was an invaluable resource to learn about HCM and preparing to make a decision about surgery. In addition to Mayo Connect and Mayos other information about HCM surgery, another great resource for this journey is the blog, HCM Beat, hosted by fellow patient, @cynaburst. I felt prepared because I read posts and blogs from other patients, conducted a lot of research, and felt informed going into this. I do wish that I would have connected with more patients to learn about the post-operative challenges after going home.

Im running sprints and have only been able to listen to my heart beat like this since open-heart surgery at Mayo Clinic. I was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (my story) a few years ago, a condition that inhibits blood flow because the heart muscle is too thick. I tried medicine, but decided that a procedure to remove a part of that muscle, a septal myectomy, was my best option. Immediately after surgery, a new sound with a steady rhythm and powerful cadence played through my body; this music to my ears was my new and improved heartbeat, which continues today, nearly three years later. Over this time, I have seen a lot of similar questions about HCM surgery on social media sites like Connect. After my positive experience, I wanted to share some HCM CARE tips to help patients and families prepare for surgery: Help  Prior to surgery; get help at home and at work. Line up a caregiver, friend, or family member for two weeks after surgery. My wife was amazing and without her, I believe I would have suffered setbacks. If you work and have a leave of absence policy, make arrangements as early as possible and try to detach from work during your recovery. In my case, that helped me recover physically and mentally. Clean  Follow wound prep instructions precisely before and after surgery. Prepare as many laundered clean towels and wash cloths as you can before leaving for the hospital, if possible, at least 20. These need to be clean every day when you get home, so load up. In my case it was also recommended to use liquid, not bar soap. Meals  Try to buy or prepare two weeks of frozen dinners and lunches. You might not feel like bending over after you return home. This also offers the opportunity eat healthy. Chair  If you have a seat to recline in, great. I didnt, and that would be one of my top recommendations. If you can afford to buy a chair or rent one of those seats that props you up, please consider that. The first few weeks after surgery, I felt like a turtle trying to roll upright after tipping over. Area restaurants and hotels  I live in Rochester, Minnesota and work at Mayo Clinic in Communications, so this experience was easier for me, but a lot of people ask for a list of hotels and restaurants. Rehab  Studies show that people who participate in rehab have an improved long-term outcome. When I came home, my wife would take me to the mall and I would shuffle from store to store until I built up enough stamina to work out. This report from our Mayo Clinic News Network on my cardiac rehab from about two years ago shows the benefits. Also, if it is offered to you, I recommend massages by an occupational therapist who can work the muscles that have been traumatized. I began this in the hospital and believe it helped me. Exhale and inhale  My biggest surprise was low lung capacity. Even though my daughters tried to make me laugh in the hospital, I could barely make a squeaking sound. I used a spirometer (not quite like the one in the picture but a smaller version) to learn how to exhale and inhale after being placed on the heart-lung machine during surgery. The goal or incentive of the spirometer is to open the air sacs in your lungs, making it easier to breathe deeply and keep your lungs clear. It is believed that proper usage may speed up your recovery time while reducing your risk of developing pneumonia or other breathing problems. Additionally, no matter how many pictures and videos as you see before your surgery, its still surprising to see wires and tubes coming out of your chest. Everyones experience is unique, so always please keep that in mind. I would go through it again in a heartbeat (pun intended) and as I have said often, the team at Mayo exceeded all of my expectations. The intense pain following surgery subsided after the first few days and today, I feel decades younger. I have high exercise tolerance and on most days, my overall energy level is very good. However, I occasionally experience bouts of low energy, and when that happens, I try to lay low and sleep. Atypically, my appetite is less than it was prior to surgery and my food tastes have changed. Thats good in that I lost a healthy amount of weight, but bad because I dont enjoy my wifes fantastic cooking like I used to. While my heart is doing well, I have experienced frequent back pain over the past few years. I have gone through physical therapy and am told my core is strong, but I continue to address this challenge. Social media was an invaluable resource to learn about HCM and preparing to make a decision about surgery. In addition to Mayo Connect and Mayos other information about HCM surgery, another great resource for this journey is the blog, HCM Beat, hosted by fellow patient, @cynaburst. I felt prepared because I read posts and blogs from other patients, conducted a lot of research, and felt informed going into this.

What follows are the notes I took from his presentation. I hope that you will find them useful. -When obstruction has been removed, patients live normal life spans and have less discharges of their ICD. -Mayo now does between 200  250 myectomies/year. (My note  This number was 50  100 lower 10 years ago). -there are 3 surgeons at Mayo who perform the surgery: Dearani, Schaff and Said. -myectomy does not leave a scar but alcohol ablation does leave a scar which shows up on MRI. -He spent some time talking about mid-ventricular obstruction and the need to extend further into the ventricle from the aortic valve and then possibly an apical approach as well. -a second myectomy is usually only needed if the initial myectomy was incomplete. -Dearani does not feel that myectomy lends itself to be performed either minimally invasively or robotically at this time. The potential for incomplete myectomy and the inability to deal with complications is too great. -EXPERIENCE OF THE SURGEON MATTERS! Choose wisely. (My note: I know I am glad that I did! I was lucky enough to have Dr. Dearani myself!) Liked by Colleen Young, Connect Director, Kanaaz Pereira, Connect Moderator, bwn369 Follow Report"

Since being released about a week later I found I had immediate shortness of breath just from standing up and walking a short distance. I have been back to the hospital near home in an attempt to identify the issue and other than a pulmonary embolism (minor) there wasnt anything specific to explain what I was experiencing. My vitals are back to normal, or as close to normal as reasonable. Its like I am hyperventilating from a panic attack, however there is no anxiety or even an expectation of anxiety prior to this occurring, so Im pretty sure this is not the issue. I have no heart pain although still have irregular heartbeats, although they seem less in frequency and intensity. Has anyone experienced this? If so, what was the cause? I was short of breath prior to surgery after minor exertion but what I am experiencing now is completely different. Kinda at my wits end so any feedback is sincerely appreciated. John Follow Report"

Im 42 year old male and was diagnosed with HCM at age 30. Initially metoprlol worked great for me as gradient (100 to 20) dropped significantly. I used to get cardiologist check up and ultrasound every year and last year I started having more symptoms. Gradient stayed high (85) and climbing stairs and walking became difficult. My cardiologist recommended a surgeon and I met him and he shocked me by recommending a heart transplant. After few days of being in denial stage, me and my wife decided to contact Mayo clinic. We went to Mayo clinic in April 2017 for consultation and met Dr. Oommen and Dr. Shaff. Finally on Sept 15th 2017 We decided to get the myectomy surgery done. Everything went well and had to stay 5 days after Surgery in hospital and flew back (3 hr flight) on 11th day. We stayed in hotel for few days after hospital discharge. In the hospital I had nausea and taking medication was a big issue. I used to throw up a lot, i had to try tablets with yogurt etc to get it inside. I recovered well and was able to walk few times a day at the hospital. Today im on the 14th day after surgery and I have stopped taking pain medication, no pain as such. My sleep is getting better each day and Im working on breathing to get my lungs do better. Overall Im so happy I did teh surgery and can already feel the difference. Follow Report"

Every oral antibiotic that I use sends me to the ER with an allergic reaction and the long term antibiotic infusion I received upon release from the hospital is doing its job but the infection persists. I am having a hard time finding much information on cellulitis online (beyond the basics) and am still under the care of the infectious disease doctors.but any insights or support would be very appreciated. This all started completely out of the blue with a very tiny cut on my finger and turned very bad very quickly. I do have lymphodema in the arm/hand from a bi lateral mastectomy 4 years ago.

So weak, he could not get out of the bed. He also had low grade fever, so since the flu started going around, we quickly got him tested so if it is the flu, we could start Tamiflu. It was negative. Day four of the same, he had a very painful neck and could barely move his head, together with fever and malaise. We rushed him to the ER to rule out meningitis. They ran blood tests and his CRP was 197 and he also had elevated white blood cells. They were saying it was not meningitis and wanted to send us home, but they quickly did a monospot test, which was positive. They sent us home, saying it was mono. We had to follow up with the pedi in a few days. When we went to see her, she looked at his blood test results and said it did not look like mono. She ordered an arrey of tests (viral panel, CMV, bartonella, blood culture, flu again, etc) and the EBV test. Everything was negative, except he still had the same elevated CRP and the EBV test showed past infection, according to her. His igG was positive, igM negative and his nuclear igG was also positive. She said it meant he did NOT have acute mono infection, but it is rather something else. We were sent home to wait and see if he gets better in a few days. Meanwhile, my kid had been sicker than ever. No cold symptoms, but no energy, fever, sweating, and a lot of discomfort. I am talking about a 16 year old who did not touch his xbox remote for 10 days. One night his fever spiked up to 103, than dropped to 95 so we went back to the ER. They were very rude and sent us home that they already told us it was mono and he will get better. The pediatrician the next day said she still doesnt believe them, so we should go and see an ID specialist. However, right after that fever episode, he started feeling better. We let him rest for 3 more days and he went back to school. He was able to go to school for a week and a half without symptoms and we were releived. Unfortunately, this past Friday night, he relapsed. Fever came back and the poor kid has been in bed ever since. He has never had a sore throat or any cold symptoms, except for a bad dry cough. His lungs are clear. The only thing we know is that he has a negative igM titer, the other two are positive, monospot positive, elevated white blood cells, liver enzyme was slightly elevated and roof high CRP. 16 days of fever, 9 days of feeling perfectly well, and now day 3 with fever. They did a blood test today and we are waiting for the results. I have been researching like crazy to try to find some explanation. If anyone has any similar experience, would appreciate the input. We will see an ID dr for sure and I would want to be prepared. Thank you! Follow Report"

She said it meant he did NOT have acute mono infection, but it is rather something else. We were sent home to wait and see if he gets better in a few days. Meanwhile, my kid had been sicker than ever. No cold symptoms, but no energy, fever, sweating, and a lot of discomfort. I am talking about a 16 year old who did not touch his xbox remote for 10 days. One night his fever spiked up to 103, than dropped to 95 so we went back to the ER. They were very rude and sent us home that they already told us it was mono and he will get better. The pediatrician the next day said she still doesnt believe them, so we should go and see an ID specialist. However, right after that fever episode, he started feeling better. We let him rest for 3 more days and he went back to school. He was able to go to school for a week and a half without symptoms and we were releived. Unfortunately, this past Friday night, he relapsed. Fever came back and the poor kid has been in bed ever since. He has never had a sore throat or any cold symptoms, except for a bad dry cough. His lungs are clear. The only thing we know is that he has a negative igM titer, the other two are positive, monospot positive, elevated white blood cells, liver enzyme was slightly elevated and roof high CRP. 16 days of fever, 9 days of feeling perfectly well, and now day 3 with fever. They did a blood test today and we are waiting for the results. I have been researching like crazy to try to find some explanation. If anyone has any similar experience, would appreciate the input.

I am a 49 year old male who is in excellent shape and started experiencing extreme fatigue 7 months ago, after a terrible cold that lasted a month. In addition to the fatigue I was having asthma like symptoms, chest pressure, pounding heart feeling and mental fog/clarity/confusion issues. A round of oral steriods knocked the symptoms out but they quickly returned once off the prednisone. Specialist visits, blood tests, tests, MRIs etc let me know what I didnt have (no cardiac issues, no asthma, no MS, etc), but no clarity on what was happening. Finally, 3 months in, in my third round of blood work I tested positive for active EBV infection (it didnt show up in the prior 2 tests but my PCP that EBV could be the cause so he kept retesting). I have found that Symbicort, which I was given early on for the potential asthma, makes my symptoms much more manageable. I am still extremely fatigued, requiring 9+ hours of sleep plus a 30-90 minute nap everyday between 2-5pm, depending on my level of activity (I know its time to sleep as my head buzzes and I get a sore throat), but I can work at my job, live life and do some level of light excercise-swimming for 15 mins, occasionally. Without the Symbicort I am non-functioning, unable to work / live daily life due to lack of mental sharpness and other symptoms. PCP says the small amount of steroids in Symbicort may be helping me address the inflammation and associated symptoms. I am concerned that by masking the symptoms I may be pushing myself too much, postponing actually getting better but Im concerned about losing job, being non-functioning for my wife/kids if I just go off of it. Even missing one dose creates a dead zone in my day. I have adjusted my diet (no alcohol, caffeine, eggs, daily, gluten) to try to improve immune system etc but curious if others have better ideas given the circumstances.

I am still extremely fatigued, requiring 9+ hours of sleep plus a 30-90 minute nap everyday between 2-5pm, depending on my level of activity (I know its time to sleep as my head buzzes and I get a sore throat), but I can work at my job, live life and do some level of light excercise-swimming for 15 mins, occasionally. Without the Symbicort I am non-functioning, unable to work / live daily life due to lack of mental sharpness and other symptoms. PCP says the small amount of steroids in Symbicort may be helping me address the inflammation and associated symptoms. I am concerned that by masking the symptoms I may be pushing myself too much, postponing actually getting better but Im concerned about losing job, being non-functioning for my wife/kids if I just go off of it. Even missing one dose creates a dead zone in my day. I have adjusted my diet (no alcohol, caffeine, eggs, daily, gluten) to try to improve immune system etc but curious if others have better ideas given the circumstances. PCP says to just wait it out and should be gone after 12 months. Thanks for any thoughts. Follow Report"

Already suffer from Depression and this is definitely making it worse. I've been having nothing but suicidal thoughts, even made a whole plan out of how to go about it. I'm scared. I'm freaking out. I'm never going to have a normal life again. I'm 25 years old and never thought something like this would happen to me. The guy who I contracted it from has ruined my life. Purposely. He knew he had it. And never told me anything. Not once was worried about me. I don't understand though. I'm asking my nurses and doctors questions and it's like they don't wanna talk about it to me. The last time this guy and I had sex was in February. His baby mama told me he had herpes. I stopped messing with him immediately. But figured she was being just a jealous baby mama. Then I had sex with a guy three months later, we had sex for four days straight multiple rounds each day. (3-4) and by the fifth day I started kinda feeling some discomfort down there. He claims he hasn't been with anyone in a very very long time. I think it came from the first guy though because his baby mama even said it's herpes. Here's the twist. He got tested at the end of March, his baby mama got tested at the end of April and both their results were negative. Is it possible for this scenario? To test for herpes, find out you're positive, take medicine for it, then retest and it come out undetected because of medication? Or will it always test positive? I know if someone has HIV they can test negative if they take their meds regularly but its still in their body. Is it the same with Herpes? What do you know of herpes and how much of my life is going to change? What's going to happen? How do I live a normal life? How will I ever be able to have a family much less find a man willing to accept me for this. I feel worthless and disgusting and I hate myself.

Within a couple of days it had grown in size/depth and was increasingly more painful. I had a previous history with MRSA, but hadn't had a lesion in years, and assumed that it was back. I had an appointment scheduled with my OBGYN and asked her to look at it. She agreed it looked like MRSA in appearance & based on my history, so cultured it and started me on Bactrim. By day 5 the pain was so unbearable and the spot had grown and was so inflamed (at this point larger than a golf ball in depth with inflammation spreading from it the size of a pancake) that I had to go in to have it lanced and drained. All that to say, it turned out to not be MRSA, but GROUP B STREP. My awareness to GBS was limited to pregnant women, but apparently it can occur in nonpregnant adults and can occur on the skin.

On some days, I feel that she is getting better (though its difficult to measure, and the more deeply-rooted issues appear to still be), on others Im concerned that her state may be affecting her endocrine system and could affect her neurological health and thus bodys ability to self-heal and her mental health and hence her willingness to self-heal. She has had a number of problems with recurrent infections (throat, constant phlegm etc.) throughout her life as well as sensitivities to a variety of foods as well as environmental factors  cant drink cold liquids, seems to have a strong response to sunshine (nb oddly this is not just light, she is fine indoors and with artifical lighting, it only seems to be a problem outdoors and is a more recent development, last year or so). She is unable to work and increasingly rarely goes outside, but Im fairly certain that due to the presence of infected phlegm and certain other concrete symptoms (a feeling of heaviness like stones on her chest and occasionally on her sinuses) that the problem is not neurological in origin, although some symptoms may be the result of consequent neurological issues. She has numbness down side of her body sometimes, and a lot of trouble sleeping (she wakes up frequently at night to pee, each time she passes a lot of urine so it doesnt seem to be anxiety-related). The problem is that she is now very reluctant to travel to the doctors because a) she finds it very tiring b) she believes their actions/misdiagnoses in the past have made her situation worse c) she thinks they are only treating the superfices and not the root cause, and I think she has a strong case for this. When she suffered from acne some time ago (about 5 years), she was on a course of antibiotics that made her temporarily feel better (and helped clear the acne up), but then got much worse soon after. I imagine this could be something to do with not being advised to take the right probiotics, or a badly managed regime generally (I dont know the details). Her fairly reasonable interpretation is that she essentially nuked (or imbalanced) her gut fauna leading to a whole host of other problems including infections and subsequent anxiety. Trips to the doctor resulted in her being put on antidepressants (sertraline, cant remember the initial dosage but I believe it was less than 100mg), which helped her enough to just about be able to work (which seems to be the main aim of antidepressants) but led to her feeling like she was in a kind of artificial bubble. The positive feelings did not feel real, and meanwhile the other problems suggestive of infection worsened. Doctors, apparently, could never find signs of infection though. She weaned herself off antidepressants over a course of about 6 months, slightly reducing the dose at regular intervals until she hit 0 around 18 months ago. About 6 months prior (around the same time she tried cutting down) she had begun a Candida diet too, as a number of tests had suggested she had overgrowth. I was skeptical of a lot of these tests (as I still am to a lesser degree) but thought it was worth trying with a pinch of salt as Id also become rather skeptical of and disillusioned with mainstream medicine, or at least that I had experienced (in addition to the above, I had been prescribed treatments for migraines and anxiety which turned out to be manageable purely by introducing a more restricted diet). A few months later (approximately a year to the day) her period stopped, which may have been because her weight was quite low, or could have been because of stress. A lot of the controversial buzz theories  adrenal fatigue etc.  came into diagnosis, and why not? We had yet to find a convincing theory elsewhere, even if this one was ambiguous  at least the treatment seemed to be largely dietary. Regarding the periods, she was referred to a gynaecologist who organised a few tests and bone scans. The latter found that her bone density was slightly low, the former found that she had low estrogen and so was prescribed Femoston Conti. She has not taken these for two reasons a) she does not feel her system is strong enough (and hence is afraid of a negative reaction, which is perfectly understandable given her hypersensitivity, even if it might not be the right decision objectively) b) she believes that the treatment isnt missing the root of the issue. We have another gynaecologist appointment in January where well be able to discuss this in greater depth (the one in May seemed to serve the dual purpose of being instruction to two trainee doctors, thus we didnt really feel able to make our points and enter into discussion as wed have liked to). The last six months or so have been relatively quiet and its difficult to tell whether shes making any improvement based on her diet regime (pretty much a paleo/FODMAPs with certain irritants excluding), at least no new symptoms have emerged. To summarise the main current symptoms (in approximate order of severity as I see it): * Insomnia  or, rather, broken sleep due to the need to urinate large amounts relatively frequently resulting in around 4 or 5 hours actual sleep in 8 or 9 hours bedtime. * Weight loss  She had dropped from around 52kg to around 45kg over the past 15 months or so (the degree drop in itself isnt worrying, but her present BMI is  late teens). * Constipation  she eats quite a healthy amount (no sugars though) as she doesnt want to lose any more weight. This, it seems to me coupled with the general sluggishness and malabsorption of her system, might lead to her being backed up, and she often eats despite having no appetite. She reports that she feels irritable/depressed often, and feels much better when she managed to offload cargo, leading her to feel that toxins are causing her to feel in such a way, though this may be rather naive/simplistic (though my skeptical position works both ways). * Sensitivity to smells  notably cleaning products and foods with antibacterial properties (onion, garlic, spices etc.)  certain foods, and sunshine. * Difficulty breathing  at times she struggles to get full breaths in, especially when/after eating. * Mood problems  she often feels very down and can become anxious (though not acutely), or argumentative (more acutely) as a consequence of the above symptoms. This is compounded by a sense of hopelessness that she might ever recover. * General aches and pains  particularly in her back. * Excessive mucous creation  especially in the morning, she often has to hack up phlegm.

Ill finish by adding that she has done a number of tests through a range of providers from those supposedly less reputable (Cambridge Nutrition) to those who are slightly more reputable (Cyrex, Genova, Acumen), at least among those who give credence to any of such services. The tests which she has taken include: * Cyrex Array 12  pathogen associated immunity screening, which suggests that she has excessive (though not necessarily to the point of acute infection) numbers of acinobacter, strepococcus mutans, citrullinated EBV, klebsiella, and babesia + ehrlichia + bartonella (or presumably just one of these?). We only got the results of this test last week, so were still processing what exactly it means. * DNA adducts  notably some type of benzyl/benzoate and parabens, which might explain the sensitivity to chemicals (and subsequent moodiness)? * IgG tests  I realise the validity of these is still under question, but she has nonetheless taken them and they do generally match with her personal feeling of what she has problems with (with a couple of oddities), and also seem to have slightly improved in the 2017 result compared to the 2016 one. Particularly re the pathogen test, it might be of use to know that she grew up on a farm (relevant assuming obviously that our hypothesis about the infections largely stemming from the antibiotic treatment is incorrect) and did not always receive cutting edge medical treatment for e.g. being bitten by a stray cat when she was young, and also lived in a house which had damp problems with people who had/have their own health problems (some of her fathers are very similar, in fact). There are more tests (and were planning to take Cyrexs Array 5  autoimmune issues), but I realise Im writing a plea for help, not a book, so Ill stop there.

On some days, I feel that she is getting better (though its difficult to measure, and the more deeply-rooted issues appear to still be), on others Im concerned that her state may be affecting her endocrine system and could affect her neurological health and thus bodys ability to self-heal and her mental health and hence her willingness to self-heal. She has had a number of problems with recurrent infections (throat, constant phlegm etc.) throughout her life as well as sensitivities to a variety of foods as well as environmental factors  cant drink cold liquids, seems to have a strong response to sunshine (nb oddly this is not just light, she is fine indoors and with artifical lighting, it only seems to be a problem outdoors and is a more recent development, last year or so). She is unable to work and increasingly rarely goes outside, but Im fairly certain that due to the presence of infected phlegm and certain other concrete symptoms (a feeling of heaviness like stones on her chest and occasionally on her sinuses) that the problem is not neurological in origin, although some symptoms may be the result of consequent neurological issues. She has numbness down side of her body sometimes, and a lot of trouble sleeping (she wakes up frequently at night to pee, each time she passes a lot of urine so it doesnt seem to be anxiety-related). The problem is that she is now very reluctant to travel to the doctors because a) she finds it very tiring b) she believes their actions/misdiagnoses in the past have made her situation worse c) she thinks they are only treating the superfices and not the root cause, and I think she has a strong case for this. When she suffered from acne some time ago (about 5 years), she was on a course of antibiotics that made her temporarily feel better (and helped clear the acne up), but then got much worse soon after. I imagine this could be something to do with not being advised to take the right probiotics, or a badly managed regime generally (I dont know the details). Her fairly reasonable interpretation is that she essentially nuked (or imbalanced) her gut fauna leading to a whole host of other problems including infections and subsequent anxiety. Trips to the doctor resulted in her being put on antidepressants (sertraline, cant remember the initial dosage but I believe it was less than 100mg), which helped her enough to just about be able to work (which seems to be the main aim of antidepressants) but led to her feeling like she was in a kind of artificial bubble. The positive feelings did not feel real, and meanwhile the other problems suggestive of infection worsened. Doctors, apparently, could never find signs of infection though. She weaned herself off antidepressants over a course of about 6 months, slightly reducing the dose at regular intervals until she hit 0 around 18 months ago. About 6 months prior (around the same time she tried cutting down) she had begun a Candida diet too, as a number of tests had suggested she had overgrowth. I was skeptical of a lot of these tests (as I still am to a lesser degree) but thought it was worth trying with a pinch of salt as Id also become rather skeptical of and disillusioned with mainstream medicine, or at least that I had experienced (in addition to the above, I had been prescribed treatments for migraines and anxiety which turned out to be manageable purely by introducing a more restricted diet). A few months later (approximately a year to the day) her period stopped, which may have been because her weight was quite low, or could have been because of stress. A lot of the controversial buzz theories  adrenal fatigue etc.  came into diagnosis, and why not? We had yet to find a convincing theory elsewhere, even if this one was ambiguous  at least the treatment seemed to be largely dietary. Regarding the periods, she was referred to a gynaecologist who organised a few tests and bone scans. The latter found that her bone density was slightly low, the former found that she had low estrogen and so was prescribed Femoston Conti. She has not taken these for two reasons a) she does not feel her system is strong enough (and hence is afraid of a negative reaction, which is perfectly understandable given her hypersensitivity, even if it might not be the right decision objectively) b) she believes that the treatment isnt missing the root of the issue. We have another gynaecologist appointment in January where well be able to discuss this in greater depth (the one in May seemed to serve the dual purpose of being instruction to two trainee doctors, thus we didnt really feel able to make our points and enter into discussion as wed have liked to). The last six months or so have been relatively quiet and its difficult to tell whether shes making any improvement based on her diet regime (pretty much a paleo/FODMAPs with certain irritants excluding), at least no new symptoms have emerged. To summarise the main current symptoms (in approximate order of severity as I see it): * Insomnia  or, rather, broken sleep due to the need to urinate large amounts relatively frequently resulting in around 4 or 5 hours actual sleep in 8 or 9 hours bedtime. * Weight loss  She had dropped from around 52kg to around 45kg over the past 15 months or so (the degree drop in itself isnt worrying, but her present BMI is  late teens). * Constipation  she eats quite a healthy amount (no sugars though) as she doesnt want to lose any more weight. This, it seems to me coupled with the general sluggishness and malabsorption of her system, might lead to her being backed up, and she often eats despite having no appetite. She reports that she feels irritable/depressed often, and feels much better when she managed to offload cargo, leading her to feel that toxins are causing her to feel in such a way, though this may be rather naive/simplistic (though my skeptical position works both ways). * Sensitivity to smells  notably cleaning products and foods with antibacterial properties (onion, garlic, spices etc.)  certain foods, and sunshine. * Difficulty breathing  at times she struggles to get full breaths in, especially when/after eating. * Mood problems  she often feels very down and can become anxious (though not acutely), or argumentative (more acutely) as a consequence of the above symptoms. This is compounded by a sense of hopelessness that she might ever recover. * General aches and pains  particularly in her back. * Excessive mucous creation  especially in the morning, she often has to hack up phlegm. It is interesting to note that her acne has almost completely cleared up since she started her diet, and other issues which were more severe in the past seem less so now, though its important to recognise that shes also cut out a number of the known irritants.

Trips to the doctor resulted in her being put on antidepressants (sertraline, cant remember the initial dosage but I believe it was less than 100mg), which helped her enough to just about be able to work (which seems to be the main aim of antidepressants) but led to her feeling like she was in a kind of artificial bubble. The positive feelings did not feel real, and meanwhile the other problems suggestive of infection worsened. Doctors, apparently, could never find signs of infection though. She weaned herself off antidepressants over a course of about 6 months, slightly reducing the dose at regular intervals until she hit 0 around 18 months ago. About 6 months prior (around the same time she tried cutting down) she had begun a Candida diet too, as a number of tests had suggested she had overgrowth. I was skeptical of a lot of these tests (as I still am to a lesser degree) but thought it was worth trying with a pinch of salt as Id also become rather skeptical of and disillusioned with mainstream medicine, or at least that I had experienced (in addition to the above, I had been prescribed treatments for migraines and anxiety which turned out to be manageable purely by introducing a more restricted diet). A few months later (approximately a year to the day) her period stopped, which may have been because her weight was quite low, or could have been because of stress. A lot of the controversial buzz theories  adrenal fatigue etc.  came into diagnosis, and why not? We had yet to find a convincing theory elsewhere, even if this one was ambiguous  at least the treatment seemed to be largely dietary. Regarding the periods, she was referred to a gynaecologist who organised a few tests and bone scans. The latter found that her bone density was slightly low, the former found that she had low estrogen and so was prescribed Femoston Conti. She has not taken these for two reasons a) she does not feel her system is strong enough (and hence is afraid of a negative reaction, which is perfectly understandable given her hypersensitivity, even if it might not be the right decision objectively) b) she believes that the treatment isnt missing the root of the issue. We have another gynaecologist appointment in January where well be able to discuss this in greater depth (the one in May seemed to serve the dual purpose of being instruction to two trainee doctors, thus we didnt really feel able to make our points and enter into discussion as wed have liked to). The last six months or so have been relatively quiet and its difficult to tell whether shes making any improvement based on her diet regime (pretty much a paleo/FODMAPs with certain irritants excluding), at least no new symptoms have emerged. To summarise the main current symptoms (in approximate order of severity as I see it): * Insomnia  or, rather, broken sleep due to the need to urinate large amounts relatively frequently resulting in around 4 or 5 hours actual sleep in 8 or 9 hours bedtime. * Weight loss  She had dropped from around 52kg to around 45kg over the past 15 months or so (the degree drop in itself isnt worrying, but her present BMI is  late teens). * Constipation  she eats quite a healthy amount (no sugars though) as she doesnt want to lose any more weight. This, it seems to me coupled with the general sluggishness and malabsorption of her system, might lead to her being backed up, and she often eats despite having no appetite. She reports that she feels irritable/depressed often, and feels much better when she managed to offload cargo, leading her to feel that toxins are causing her to feel in such a way, though this may be rather naive/simplistic (though my skeptical position works both ways). * Sensitivity to smells  notably cleaning products and foods with antibacterial properties (onion, garlic, spices etc.)  certain foods, and sunshine. * Difficulty breathing  at times she struggles to get full breaths in, especially when/after eating. * Mood problems  she often feels very down and can become anxious (though not acutely), or argumentative (more acutely) as a consequence of the above symptoms. This is compounded by a sense of hopelessness that she might ever recover. * General aches and pains  particularly in her back. * Excessive mucous creation  especially in the morning, she often has to hack up phlegm. It is interesting to note that her acne has almost completely cleared up since she started her diet, and other issues which were more severe in the past seem less so now, though its important to recognise that shes also cut out a number of the known irritants. Ill finish by adding that she has done a number of tests through a range of providers from those supposedly less reputable (Cambridge Nutrition) to those who are slightly more reputable (Cyrex, Genova, Acumen), at least among those who give credence to any of such services. The tests which she has taken include: * Cyrex Array 12  pathogen associated immunity screening, which suggests that she has excessive (though not necessarily to the point of acute infection) numbers of acinobacter, strepococcus mutans, citrullinated EBV, klebsiella, and babesia + ehrlichia + bartonella (or presumably just one of these?). We only got the results of this test last week, so were still processing what exactly it means. * DNA adducts  notably some type of benzyl/benzoate and parabens, which might explain the sensitivity to chemicals (and subsequent moodiness)? * IgG tests  I realise the validity of these is still under question, but she has nonetheless taken them and they do generally match with her personal feeling of what she has problems with (with a couple of oddities), and also seem to have slightly improved in the 2017 result compared to the 2016 one. Particularly re the pathogen test, it might be of use to know that she grew up on a farm (relevant assuming obviously that our hypothesis about the infections largely stemming from the antibiotic treatment is incorrect) and did not always receive cutting edge medical treatment for e.g. being bitten by a stray cat when she was young, and also lived in a house which had damp problems with people who had/have their own health problems (some of her fathers are very similar, in fact). There are more tests (and were planning to take Cyrexs Array 5  autoimmune issues), but I realise Im writing a plea for help, not a book, so Ill stop there. Obviously my concern is that I want to help her get better, and thus am seeking open-minded advice of a holistic nature, at the risk of coming across a bit alternative (my point is that consideration of the whole situation is important, rather than narrowing in lazily on certain details, as weve felt people have in the past). Any advice on a direction to take, preferably accompanied by a convincing-yet-sympathetic argument (a difficult ask, admittedly), would be much appreciated. I realise that some of the narrative we have constructed may be contradictory (i.e. potential origins suggested at different times), but Im just trying to be as objective and open-minded as possible.

On some days, I feel that she is getting better (though its difficult to measure, and the more deeply-rooted issues appear to still be), on others Im concerned that her state may be affecting her endocrine system and could affect her neurological health and thus bodys ability to self-heal and her mental health and hence her willingness to self-heal.

She is unable to work and increasingly rarely goes outside, but Im fairly certain that due to the presence of infected phlegm and certain other concrete symptoms (a feeling of heaviness like stones on her chest and occasionally on her sinuses) that the problem is not neurological in origin, although some symptoms may be the result of consequent neurological issues. She has numbness down side of her body sometimes, and a lot of trouble sleeping (she wakes up frequently at night to pee, each time she passes a lot of urine so it doesnt seem to be anxiety-related). The problem is that she is now very reluctant to travel to the doctors because a) she finds it very tiring b) she believes their actions/misdiagnoses in the past have made her situation worse c) she thinks they are only treating the superfices and not the root cause, and I think she has a strong case for this.

Harvoni has injured many as outlined in the FDAs own adverse events reports. The FDA is not reporting this and doctors seem to be very uninformed. This direct acting antiviral can change a persons DNA and does with unknown consequences. There are many adults who are now bedridden, in constant pain (me), have swollen and painful joints, have lost hair (me), have liver cancer, have died, are suicidal, have rashes, have tinnitus (me), constant headache(me), breathing issues(me), heart problems, just to name a few. I know this as I am an advocate for those who have taken Harvoni and have lost their quality of life as a result and have spoken directly to these patients. Giving Harvoni to a developing young adult is absolutely ridiculous. Parents, do your homework BEFORE you even think about providing this drug to your child. It is possible you may be condemning them to a long and painful life. Hep C is NOT an automatic death sentence!!! I had it for 40 years with very little liver damage and excellent bloodwork. I was talked into taking it by my GI who told me it was absolutely safe. After two visits to the ER and now two years post treatment and in constant pain, apparently it is not safe for all.

I began getting sick around April of 2013 after ingesting water i unknowingly witnessed being contaminated on a daily basis by a herd of cattle which drank from, defecated into a broken water main which delivered the only water supply to the home in which i lived at the time. Being oblivious to the contamination i noticed i was having problems with constipation, next extreme bouts of intestinal gas and rumbling in my stomach to the point of confinement due to the frequency and embarrassment, not to mention the discomfort. After taking every laxative i could find oral and suppositories and spending hours and hours daily in the bathroom and only producing a bloody mucous for a bowl movement and actually prolapsing my rectum from straining i found my self extremely ill although i felt as if i was starving to death and ate everything i could find i had lost so much weight i ended up at around 90lbs. I was lethargic. I was dying and i knew and still know this. I was admitted to my local hospital where i underwent the first of multiple ct scans with and without contrast, colonoscopies, scoped down the throat, had a kub, ecg, chest xray, blood draws almost hourly. From the beginning i have and still believe i have an infestation of some type of parasite. Ive been to three hospitals seen about fifteen different Drs who Ive begged along with nurses to please just run the test or give me the meds to kill parasites but they just act like Im crazy. In May of 2015 i was admitted into ICU with a hgb of 4 given 4 units of blood and scheduled for a colon resection surgery. I had three IVs in each arm until three days before surgery i was given apic line. The following day and the day a nurse came in fully gloved and gowned and informed me i was under quarantine that i had been dx with ecoli 0157:H7 and the dr was on the phone with the pharmacy trying to figure out the best antibiotic to b administered. I was also informed that the health department would b contacting me because of my dx. The following day, the day before my scheduled surgery the dr finally came in, not to discuss or even officially give me my dx but to discharge me. Never discussing anything with me as far as my dx or prognosis or any treatment plan she handed me a hand written note stating i was non compliant and was being discharged the PIC line was removed and i was told to leave. I was again hospitalized 5 months later in Oct of 2015 needing 4 more units of blood in the hospital that i had been originally admitted to during my first, second and third hospital stays.

Then about 12 days after the procedure I woke up early on a Sunday with a Temp of 103.8. I took 2 Motrin and fever went down rather fast and I was back down to normal within 90 mins or so. I went to emergency room to make sure I did not have a blood clot in my leg. I also had a little leakage near the surgery site and the dr. on duty did a swab. Monday was labor day so the hospital called me on Tes am to tell me the culture came back and I have a staph infection. They also said they contacted my dr.that did the surgery and his office would be calling me shortly. They called me about an hour later and told me the Dr. has me scheduled for surgery on thurs. I asked why I needed surgery and I was told the Dr. needs to get the infection out out of my ankle. I did as instructed and reported for surgery on Thurs. I was in hospital for 4 days after surgery, then sent home to admimster and anti-biotic through a pick-line. I did this 3 times a day for 71/2 wks. My ankle has never been the same. I have a bad limp and stabbing pain. Front half of my foot feels like its half asleep or numb. Dr. told me it takes up to a year for bone to heal after being scrubbed to remove staph infection. Well, I founf a new Dr. & he ordered an imaging test to ckeck if there was any infection remaining. The imaging test showed an infection in the Talis Bone. Dr. told me I need surgery to geta biopsy on a pc on the Talis bone. Did that on 11-16-11 and results came back negative. I will be going in on 12-7-11 for a Fusion which is supposed to be the cure all.

My sister was admitted to the hospital on Nov. 1st with severe abdominal pain. Test found that she had a mass blocking her intestines. I will try to keep this shortshe had surgery to remove part of her colon and large & small intestine and the tumor that originated in her appendix, (appendiceal cancer is rare) things were fine for a few days, until the sutures in the intestines let loose, the resulting bile leaking into the stomach cavity caused her to be septic. A colostomy was performed, and she survived the septic shock. She is now home, and trying to recover from the sepsis. She is very frustrated by the lack of strength and energy that she is experiencing. We know so little about this. We do know that it is extremely serious. Is there anyone out there who can share there experience with sepsis? Follow Report"

In December I will be a 2 year post-sepsis survivor  My question is regarding medical questionnaires that you fill out when you go to the doctor- example Have you ever or do you currently have kidney, heart, etc issues . When can I stop answering yes? As of June 2018 all of my blood work and all other tests have been normal. I feel like I should be able to answer these questions as I did before my illness  which were all Nos. Its kind of a pain to answer Yes with explaining what it was.

My surgery (anterior incision) was at Mayo in November, 2019. For the first 3 months after surgery, I followed the physical therapist's recommendations for exercises (range of motion, walking, stationary bike) and added no leg bands or weights to my lower body. I even went snowshoeing and that was great! Let me note that I've been lifting weights for almost 30 years and was physically active until the hip pain became worse over the past few years. Thus, the decision to do the recommended total hip replacement. At the 3 month follow-up on February 20, 2020, the surgeon said there are no restrictions on my physical activity but to take it slow. I've still trying to figure out what ""taking it slow"" means. I'm lifting light weights (10-15 pounds) on machines (hamstring curls, leg extensions, leg press). I've added these just since returning from that February 20 appointment at Mayo and go to the gym twice a week. I have osteoporosis so weight lifting is important. But here's the thing  I have more pain and discomfort in my surgical leg and lower back than before February 20. What is everyone else doing for their rehab post surgery at the 3 month mark?

Along the surgery and rehab path, we encounter decision points. The answers come from shared decision making with medical providers and clinicians, family and caregivers, and of course, your surgeon. How do you prepare your body for TKR so that it is ready for rehab exercises and treatments? Thats easy..be in the best shape you can be and dont put it off so long that your leg becomes unsupportive. How do you manage post-surgery pain and care for the best outcome? What is recommended and what works? How long? What if it is too painful? How can I get my ROM to be better NOW? It is essential to make sure that we understand the treatment for scar mobilization to keep the scar and tissue moving. Failure to do that means the scar will reach to surrounding tissue and grow bigger and bigger, causing decreased ROM and increased pain. And what is the most important decision you will make? When I was ready to leave the hospital, my surgeon sat down with me and said, Chris you have a decision to make. You must decide whether you want your new knee to last 5 years or the rest of your life? I chose the rest of my life and then I learned about returning to my normal activities as slowly as possible, e.g. at least one year to be totally safe. He also told me that he would communicate with the physical therapist and approach exercise gently. As far as getting ready for a mountain hike, he simply said..you can go up..just dont come down.too hard on your knee. Guess that says it all. Choose your answer carefully. What did you do to have the best recovery possible? What tips would you share with others? Liked by JK, Volunteer Mentor, kidsmomof9, Paul Follow Report"

On the positive side, I got to 136 flexion today. My data from the pressure-sensitive treadmill shows I am doing much better in terms of equally weighting my two legs in a walk, and rolling through my foot. I don't really experience anything that can be called pain anymore, although I'll explain that more below. I'm able to walk quite a bit and am exercising almost daily, with a 30 minute walk, and either 45 minutes on the bike or 45 minutes on weights, as well as the exercises the PT has given me. On the negative side, although I get 0 degree extension on the table, when I walk, my knee is still slightly bent. PT and I discussed today the difference between ability to do something and ease of use. We want me to get to the point where it is easy for me to extend and bend my leg without thinking or trying. I am going to keep working on the extension with that in mind, even though technically I'm at 0. I notice when turning from side to side in bed that I have to be very careful to avoid something at the low level of the pain scale (not really pain but discomfort), and even pulling my leg up while lying down (sliding foot toward butt) is not without some unpleasant sensations. So although there is no real pain, there is some discomfort. I am working hard on the rehabilitation but wondering how long this will continue to be the case. @ellerbracke in terms of whether the knee is made to go beyond 135 deg, Alex said he has not heard anything about that but that could be because people rarely get that far when they see him  their benefits run out, so how far they continue after 120 or 125 is not known to him. However, he is going to ask around and see if anyone knows. I guess if your friend can put her foot against her butt in the water, it must be okay! Liked by JK, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"
998,C0745687,leg infection,C0455270,Sharp pain,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/jamming-sensation-after-knee-replacement/,Jamming sensation after knee replacement,"I had a right knee replacement in April 2019 with complications. There was nerve damage from the knee into the foot and to help with the partial foot drop the hospital PT tried to put me in an AFO brace, but was not done properly and it resulted in a large blister on the outer side of my leg just above my ankle. You can imagine the terror I felt and even after that blister healed I kept breaking out in blisters on the outer side of my leg, the same side that most of the nerve damage was on so I thought there was connection, saw the surgeon multiple times, my primary and went to the wound care center every week for 8 months only to find out 8 months later and one visit to a dermatologist that there was an infection in my leg that no one bothered to test for. But during this time because we were not sure what was causing the blisters we backed off on my rehab which resulted in some scar tissue forming. But the one thing that I have had ever since surgery (and the surgeon says my x-rays look fine) is a jamming feeling in my knee if I try and press up with my foot and my knee is flexed close to 90 degrees and it can be like a sharp pain at times. I have now lost some flexion and am back down to about 85 degrees but has anyone else had that jamming sensation? is it just due to the scar tissue which the surgeon says is permanent and won't suggest any invasive measures to break up? Also has anyone tried vibration to help break up scar tissue? Follow Report"
