In June of 2016 developed pain in abdomen, new pet scanned showed 3 hot spots, 1 lymph node in groin, mass on the outside of my colon wall, and a area around my belly button. Restarted chem in August of 2016, just had a fresh pet scan done 1 week ago it shows no decrease in size of the cancer but it shows a new lump ode that is involved . I do not understand why a reoccurring cancer is happening, Im not handling this well and the stress on my wire and family is sky rocketing .

In the rectum there was a 2.5cm submucosal mass starting at about 10cm from the anal margin. It does not look like a primary rectal adenocarcinoma. The distal terminal ileum is compressed and there is an impression of a mass in the area. I intubated the TI nut it would not distend at all despite air insufflation suggestive of extrinsic compression more than a primary terminal ileal neoplasm. In view of the position a neuroendocrine tumour should be on the differential diagnosis list. The original endoscopy I was told was clear so Im a bit confused. The only symptoms are high blood pressure and abdominal pain along with a lump in the groin which they took a biopsy from. The results of this were showed signet cells and the diagnosis is signet cell cancer of unknown primary. If anyone could shed any light of what this latest colonoscopy indicates I would be grateful.

I had colorectal cancer in 2004 and now have a permanent colostomy. My problem is that i have chronic abdominal and back pain. My dr says the pain is probably from the damage of scarred tissue due to the radiation treatment and the surgery i had to undergo. But probably isnt a real answer and there is no real cure. I have had many tests done to find the problem, but because they see no cancer, they assume it is scarred tissue from the treatments. It has become worse each year. I cant even live my life like i would like. There are days that the pain is so severe that my pain meds dont take care of it and my body reacts by vomitting. Then I have to take a trip to the hospital where they admitt me so give me meds and fluid thru IV. Im miserable and too young to have my life altered in such a way. There are days I want to just give up. Does anyone have this problem or these symptoms? I really dont know what else to do. I was told that a friend of a friend had radiation damage that resulted in parts of her bowel dyingThe Mayo clinic is the only one that found it after going to a few different drs where we live that have told her what they are telling me.

Im trying to get current information on when it is safe to move my son out of covid 19 quarantine and bring him home to St. Paul. He is currently in San Jose on a college internship. He was advised to self quarantine 4 weeks ago as he had sore throat, dry cough, and mild chest pain. He did not have and has not had a fever. He did not qualify to get a test for the virus. We were advised to wait until ALL symptoms cleared completely before transporting him. I intend to do so by car, rather than a flight home. It is incredibly hard to get an answer on what is safe  for him and others. Chest pain and dry cough have resolved, sore throat has improved but has not resolved. CDC now says only fever has to resolve (for 3 days sans meds) and upper respiratory symptoms improve (not resolve) provided first symptoms started more than 7 days previously before it is safe to come out of isolation. Unfortunately, not certain if this change in recommendation is science-based or politically influenced by the white house. Want to find legitimate, science-based medical recommendations as well as any recommendations for safe transport  do I need to mask up my son or myself as I transport him? Thanks!!

Don't post store names.,"There are those who have to be out there to some degree. We are not under stay-at-home order where I am (yet). We are limiting our trips out to essentials and few locations as possible. Some items remain totally out of stock in the two places I checked: Toilet paper (although I did find a small out of the way place that had some and got some cheap stuff in) Disinfectant spray Disinfectant wipes Alcohol Gallon jugs of water (I did find some distilled in small quantities)  Some items I did see in-stock: Milk (full refrigeration units this afternoon) Frozen pizza (even some on-sale) General refrigerated aisle in small store had a lot of food & drinks General packaged foods  People: Sparse traffic on roads Few cars at stores Clerks are tired and stressed. One store built a clear plastic barrier in front of the cash register with a square hole in it for products and payment. Good idea and well-executed. Looked like a homemade bank window. I like that.  General public  I encountered silent and unfriendly attitudes, like being snotty with people might fend off the virus. People, that's not what social distancing means. It means to keep physical distance between you and others. A friendly attitude or greeting would be a good practise right now, not a cold glare that says, ""You're in my world and you don't belong there.""

Think of protecting everyone else too:  DO NOT handle items in stores then put them back on the shelf. ESPECIALLY unprotected items like produce. Touch only what you are going to buy, put it in your cart an do not put it back on the shelf after you handled it.  DO NOT wear your potentially contaminated gloves into another area or store. You will just spread anything that is on them.  Follow safe donning and removal procedures to get the most out of your PPE and prevent contaminating yourself or others.  These are for medical personnel use, but the methods apply to anyone using PPE:  How to remove gloves without getting what's on the outside of the gloves on you:   How to don and remove a N95 respirator mask:   PPE sequence for providers: (NO, the public does not need gowns.}  https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/ppe/PPE-Sequence.pdf  The above are geared toward medical providers, but you can take away the methodology for your own use, in how to fit and use a mask if you need to, how to safely remove PPE gear without contaminating yourself.

I would like to offer them the best suggestions for staying healthy. But just as we are about to conquer our travel fears of getting sick, a whole new virus pops up  the coronavirus. That is by far, in all my years, the scariest of them all. When I think of all the viruses that people have feared when traveling, these come to mind, HIV/AIDS, Legionnaires disease, avian influenza, Chikungunya, H5N1-chicken flu, ebola, norovirus, SARS  not counting Montezuma revenge. Typhoid, Measles, Hep A and B, malaria. I know I am leaving out many more that you can catch from mosquitoes such as Zika. The list just keeps growing. The latest is the coronavirus, I cannot even imagine what this disease does to the body. The early reports coming out of China are scary. It has even caused many airlines to cease flying to China. How do we stay safe when we TRAVEL? Getting your travel immunizations and hand sanitizer, are those the only things to prevent us from not getting sick? Face masks on flights, do they really give the right protection? Can you just use any face mask? Or are some better than others to filter the air we breath? Should we wear gloves? Another question, could we be get sick playing with animals in different countries? I myself have on my last two trips, was this just a coincidence or not? I played with a puppy in the Dominican Republic who I noticed in photos, touched my right ear. I ended up with a virus in my inner right ear, which got diagnosed as Menieres disease?? I just was in Cozumel were I took a photo kissing a Macaw Bird. Now I have severe Laryngitis. Coincidence or not? I have also caught H-Pylori traveling. Which ended up saving my life by catching an early stage 1 Cecum cancer. I would love to hear everyones way that they stay healthy when traveling the world. I dont want to stop traveling.

I played with a puppy in the Dominican Republic who I noticed in photos, touched my right ear. I ended up with a virus in my inner right ear, which got diagnosed as Menieres disease?? I just was in Cozumel were I took a photo kissing a Macaw Bird. Now I have severe Laryngitis. Coincidence or not? I have also caught H-Pylori traveling. Which ended up saving my life by catching an early stage 1 Cecum cancer. I would love to hear everyones way that they stay healthy when traveling the world. I dont want to stop traveling. Looking forward to your comments,Travel Girl. How do you stay healthy when traveling? Liked by Ethan McConkey, Moderator Follow Report"

Help,"Hello, I posted before in another group in its entirety but I think its too broad and there could be a multitude of theories and explanations. So Im going to break my story down into my most bothersome episodic symptoms. To start, everything on the surface looks like panic disorder or anxiety. However, my different episodes seem to be helping each other keep me feeling frantic more days than not so on the surface it looks like anxiety. Ive had lots of lab work testing including thyroid, Lyme, sleep apnea home test, brain MRI, spine MRI, abdominal ct scan, and way too many doctor visits with no answer, but they do agree on one thing. The symptoms are weird and seem to be more than just anxiety. There are little bits here and there but unfortunately not enough to go on. Keep in mind these episodes arent all going on at the same time but theyre not giving me any recovery time and feel like im sinking further down the hole. Its like fighting 5 bullies one at a time and losing. Just as you feel like you can get up another bully hops in. Episode 1: After waking up with head pressure, teeth chattering, shivering, lower back pain, and sweating. Oral temperature is ALWAYS between 93.8 F and 94.8 during these episodes. Also, every day is constant cold hands and feet that never happened until all of these episodes started. Episode 2: Brain fog, head pressure that feels like youre being pushed down when standing (like when youve had one too many drinks), usually later in the day when that feeling wears off, Ill have adrenaline body tingling, uncontrollable thoughts of self-harm and head chatter. (Not dwelling on things or worried about things, its just the mind doing what it does and I have no control.) Also, my eye will twitch like crazy before and during these. Episode 3: When standing for a long period of time, like cooking or washing dishes, and sweating starts to happen my heart rate increases and get extremely dizzy and feels like Im being physically pulled down. Episode 4: An overly excited feeling, almost like needing to yell or run to get adrenaline out, Heart rate is low. Episode 5. Sharp colon pain, yellow stools (frequently), stools that look sickly or unhealthy, and constipation more often than not. I had a colonoscopy recently and I was told everything looks good. Ive tried SSRIs and benzodiazepines and they dont stop these episodes from occurring. Ive tried strict diets and those dont help. If you have any thought about even one of these episodes please dont be shy to comment. Thank you so much for taking the time to read.

Ive had all my blood work done Ive been tested by several different doctors everything is coming out normal so I think this has to do with a neurological disorder Im not exactly sure how to describe what happened to me but I do know that I have these horrific symptoms that dont go away. I had a very normal active sex life before all this happened when I went cold turkey off of the 5-HTP supplement I woke up one morning and I was completely numb my entire genital region has no feeling in it I couldnt even feel when I had to urinate that has lately returned in the past year but the erogenous Sensations any type of pleasure from that area is completely gone and sex is completely lifeless. Theres so much Social stigma surrounding this issue I have been told I am crazy Ive been told that Im not experiencing this nobody has any answers I am sending out a plea to this community if anyone has heard of this disorder happening in anybody else please let me know. I know that mine was not caused by an SSRI type drug reaction but I was taking a serotonergic supplement for a long. Of time that is not been tested for long-term use and I feel like maybe something happened. I know there are risks with any supplements and pharmaceuticals that you take but I was not expecting this big of a risk. It has affected my social life and has affected my sex life my life with my partner that Im completely in love with its causing me severe PTSD anxiety depression and I am unable to function in reality I dont have a job I dont see my friends anymore Ive made a complete 180 from the person that I used to be I feel like my life was taken from me in a way. I dont know who to turn to I dont know what medications to get on Im so depressed I can barely get out of bed for an entire year I lost a lot of weight I used to be very athletic and very motivated in my life. I have a masters degree I was on track to have a very fulfilling life with my partner and my education and my career and everything has basically stopped because I feel like my life force is gone. I know this is very hard to understand people who have never been through this this is more than just a simple sexual dysfunction this is almost like a loss of a drive for life and its a complete numbness in your brain and genitals both theres just no connection theres no desire for the life spark theres no desire for the creative Spark Its almost like its just been erased.

My symptoms have maybe gotten 3% better since January when I was completely numb and I couldnt even feel urination now I can at least feel urination but none of my libido arousal or general feelings have returned its almost like that entire area is just rubbery and numb. I know many of you may have never heard of anything like this and this may be disturbing for you but this is actually a disease that can happen to people and I think we need to raise more awareness about it because doctors and psychiatrists and therapists simply do not believe this is possible which in fact it is because it is a neurological and brain disorder that can be brought on by pharmaceutical drugs and supplements in my opinion and from my experience.

If so how was it done? And if it was by way of switching to other drugs, were you then able to taper off of those entirely under a doctor's guidance? My husband has been on Lorazepam for 16 years He did well for 14 years, but dragged his feet about trying to withdraw while he was feeling better. In May he had a relapse of anxiety, and insomnia, with brain fog, heart palpitations, and more. Currently he's doing better, thinking better, but still feels like crap a large part of the time, can't sleep without the drug, can't nap.and still struggles with anxiety. At this point, I believe it's the drug that is actually causing the problem. Currently he's doing 1 mg at bedtime and 3/4 mg when he wakes up at 2:30 am. I know it takes 2 years for the brains GABA receptors to normalize after taking Benzodiazepines. Also know it's really hard to withdraw, has to be done extremely slowly, and the side effects are exactly the same as the symptoms it is meant to help. My goal is to eventually wean him off of all drugs as functional health tests show they block his nutritional absorption and may be damaging his intestinal lining. I would like to be able to repair his health using nutrition, supplements, and neurotransmitter amino acids. All feedback is welcomed! . Follow Report"

Symptoms are heightened anxiety, panic attacks, episodes of racing heart with hypertension, full body aches, epsidoes of extreme cold or feeling feverish, Jitteryness, internal vibrations, tightness in my chest. The worst symptom is a stressful feeling that comes over my body , almost the feeling if you got done doing something strenuous or had a very heated argument with someone but all Im doing at time is watching TV  the feeling makes my chest tight and my bp going high. Ive had countless blood work in months that all returned normal. Countless ekgs that return normal. A normal MRI and EEG. iam hypothyroid and initially the syntpoms felt very hyperthyroid BC I had tooo much energy but after seeing 5 different endos the bloodwork shows iam still hypothyroid with inactive graves disease and was told there is no way whats happening to me is thyroid related. It honestly feels like more stress related than anxiety when it comes on. And its not an all day feeling either. It comes in episodes. It happens evening single evening.

She had a spiral notebook between her leg and the arm of the chair. She reached for it often and was anxiously writing things down. At one point she asked me if I knew what she was writing down and I replied: probably  so she asked me what I thought she was writing down and I told her the most likely she was writing down things that I was saying otherwise she was writing down comments or thoughts based on things I was saying. She said  both  I nodded affirmatively and she asked me if that happened often. I replied: it depends on my audience  That seemed to surprise her some.I mentioned what my grandmother told me and how I realized that reality and truth were often used interchangeably and that a lot of our language was used unilaterally meaning that many people think or assume that others know what they mean. So if theres a thread of truth to that thought how can we know what everyone means? Its easy to be confused which means we are often lost in our own world of wondering what a persons means by what they say?If Im ON then I can read my audience but depending on many things Im just as lost as the next guy so here I am with you because someone read me and thinks you can figure me out. I really like it that youre taking notes  and we both laughed at the same time. That made me feel good and it looked like it made here feel good. Liked by johnhans Follow Report

Last saw it on the couch, before my son got home from school i think I hid it somewhere and dont remember where I put it. The reason I hid it (i think) is my husband was gonna come by and pick me to go to the store and my son (hes 13) and his friend were going to be here and i didnt want them to see it just laying on couch. So i havent taken it in almost 2 weeks and i also have epilepsy and take Briviact, Onfi, Lyrica, Buspar(anxiety) and medical cannibas for epilepsy. I have been having many seizures..complex partials, extreme anxiety, racing thoughts, alot about dying whether its me, or my husband, my sons, my chihuahua, my momsomebody close to me and it just wont stop!! My heart feels like its going to jump out of my chest, its just a roller coaster of ups and downs all day all night long. I dont work because of my uncontrolled seizures and im home all day by myself. Ive torn my house apart looking for that med. My memory is awful from having brain surgery, seizures, the meds im on doesnt help at all im sure. Ive talked to my neuro about it to see if theres anything she can do for me or have any suggestions andnothing! I cant get it refilled until April 2nd. Im trying to get through this until then but I dont know how much longer I can do this..has this happened to anybody else? The buspar doesnt do anything the medical cannabis does absolutely nothing for my seizures anxiety..im so scared!!!! Thank you in advance for letting me ramble on. Please help!!!

I haven't stopped taking my meds though. I've been on the hunt because it's driving me crazy. Only variables that are different is the fact that I've caught either a bacterial or viral infection and have had a fever for a few days, or my home made remedy of ginger, tumeric, honey, lemon and pepper that I've been drinking to naturally ease the fever, inflammation and kill the bad stuff.

Ive always enjoyed them as pets, and my wife has usually had a cat.My life went upside down in 2005. I was falling into a really deep depression and made multiple suicide attempts. I kept thinking Id hit bottom, but then Id go down deeper and darker. I admitted myself to a small facility for survivors of suicide attempts, and stayed for 6 weeks, until I felt like Id be safe again. I wasnt really, but life went on. I retired and began therapy, and after a couple of years I talked with my therapist about training my dog to be a service dog. I had an Aussie/Border Collie mix, who was a wonderful dog, and after working with him for over a year, he became my service animal.Barnabas went everywhere with me, and was of great service to me with depression, PTSD and suicidal thoughts. Everybody loved him. But last year at Valentines, he had a stroke or some other brain event, a week after a checkup at the vets, where I was told he had years left in him (he was only 9). That was really hard, especially since I didnt have a therapist right then, and couldnt get one until a year later. That was an 18 month stretch without a therapist, and the last six were pretty dark. I was fortunate to find my next dog at our local humane shelter, a few weeks after Barnabas died. Sadie had just been brought in that day because the people had too many dogs, and decided to return her to the shelter. She was fearful and skittish, but I felt an immediate bond with her. We left her alone for a couple of days, so she could become comfortable in our home, with us, and with my wifes little dog, Pete. After a year, shes joined to me at the hip. If I go outside, she follows, and comes in when I do. We have ten acres, so she has lots of room to run, rodents to catch, cows and horses to herd  they either ignore her or run her off  but she always comes back to me and sits down near me and watches me work in the yard. If Im kneeling, she sits right in front of me for some petting. Shes very attentive, obedient and therapeutic for me. When Im extra depressed or feeling the anxiety level rising, she lies in my lap and the pressure of the weight of her body provides calming therapy on my torso, for as long as I need her.One challenge of having a service dog is public ignorance. Everytime we go out, someone asks if they can pet her (No), or just pets her without asking. If they dont pet her, they talk to her, which is pretty much the same as petting because theyre drawing her attention away from me. Cesar teaches dont touch, dont talk, dont make eye contact.An issue Ive been dealing with is lack of understanding of the difference between service and therapy dogs. A service dog serves only its handler. A therapy dog is trained to serve others, such as in hospitals, to provide calming therapy for people. I was asked to have Sadie certified as a therapy dog, but I couldnt agree to it because of the differing purposes of the service and therapy animals. For 5 years, I was a Hospice volunteer, visiting patients for an hour a week, in their homes, in the hospital, in care homes  wherever they were. A few had house pets, so I left my dog in the car during the visit (always in safe, shaded places, with water). Every other patient loved having my dog come with me to visit them. I made an exception to the no pet rule with hospice patients because it meant so much to them. I had to resign a few months ago because they wrote a set of guidelines that specifies only certified therapy dogs could go with volunteers. I hated to give up that volunteer job. I think it helped me get out and interact with others, and it gave me a chance to give out to those who have a real need. How has a pet or animal helped you? Share your story with us. Of course, Sadies more than a pet, though she is that, too, but she provides the companionship of a pet, the devotion and unconditional love. Ill try to share pictures of Barnabas (brown and white) and Sadie (black and white). (Sorry I couldnt change the orientation of the picture of Sadie.)

I have been diagnosed with depression. I am perfectionist. My family is perfectionist ONLY WHEN TOWARDS ME! They are not perfectionists in their only lives at all as I see them. However, if I do the task with with a trivial, small mistake, they come to look at this mistake, exaggerate it and then ignore the success I made. They look at the 0.00001% mistake and ignore the 99.99999% success. As I said earlier, I am myself is a perfectionist and have unreasonable criteria but the matter is even worse when having a perfectionist family, and it is even worse when they are perfectionists only towards me!! I cannot believe that I will be criticized if I got an A in a course rather than an A+!! If I look at this family member who criticized me about getting an A, I see my grades are much much better than him! Is it reasonable?! 2. What is causing me much stressed and anxious in the matter is the following. I do my best to help my brothers. If I made a small mistake they would inform my mother. The problem is she is and elderly lady and diagnosed with a heart disease! I do my best to follow her commands and make her feel happy towards me. She is very lovely towards me. When we talk about such problems, she always realized that my brothers are unrealistic and she would say to me be patient towards them. Everything with that is ok to me. What is not ok is the irritation caused to my mother when they go and scream at her: Look what your stupid son has done!! I can feel her paining immediately and as I said earlier she is diagnosed with a heart disease. I have told them such a statement: I am a bad person. My mistakes are unlimited and countless. But I see your kindness which will make you conceal my bad deeds, not because I deserve that, but because of your kindness ! While I do not believe in this statement, I have said it again and again. Why? Because I love my mother and want her to live in peace. What is their response to me is the following: We will keep telling her your mistakes regardless of her heart disease!! Note that my mistakes are not intentional because they are perfectionist! I feel pain while typing those words, anxious, exhausted and irritated! I think you can feel what I feel when you read those words. In an attempt to stop the issue from escalating, I said to my brothers: If you think you are right and I am doing wrong, then lets go to ask our uncle about the matter . They immediately REJECTED and said there no problem at all to be solved!! I can see that they believe in themselves how they are doing wrong and are worried from the disclosure of this matter among the relatives! However, my mother felt irritated towards the idea and then I rejected it also . So what should I do? I think you that if someone talks too many then he may be very irritated!

I ve been having hand tremors for a few years now and I reckon its getting worse. I have been on Chlolipmarine Hydrochloride for about 20 years for anxiety, depression and obsessive thinking. They have always worked for me but i think one of the side effects is hand tremors. Ive had blood tests and all ok there. the Doctor suggested coming off the CH and trying Sertraline, which I did but just felt like sleeping all the time, so back to CH. Its like Ive got too much adrenaline! It is worse in company and at work even though Im not stressed or anxious. As Im typing this my hands are shaking. It doesnt stop me doing anything but its annoying and I often have to drink holding the cup or glass with both hands and my writing is awful.

Guess Ill get straight to the point 13 year old female (turning 14 soon) who has undiagnosed ADHD and shows possible depression symptoms. Parents both are diagnosed with ADHD, have shown ADHD symptoms before the age of 12, and still struggle with symptoms as of now. If I had to guess, Id say I have the Combination Presentation (Inattention & Hyperactivity/Impulsive). I show symptoms of both inattention and hyperactivity  the former being unable to properly focus often, getting distracted easily (even when its something I have to get done), and daydreaming far more than should be appropriate (waste hours of my life doing this, even when theres more important things to be done). Pace often (coupled with daydreaming), cant sit still, mind is always racing, and tend to blurt whatevers on my mind, along with a lot of extreme gestures while talking. With that ADHD note, I am uncertain where my constant daydreaming is a symptom of my ADHD, perhaps a larger issue, or both. As I mentioned before, I waste hours of my life daydreaming, even if theres things I need to get done. I blast music in my earbuds and pace. Im told I make facial expressions and sounds while daydreaming, which isnt something that people with ADHD seem to complain about  although it seems like something I would be more likely to struggle with, due to my ADHD. Ive heard of the term Maladaptive Daydreaming, but I dont daydream of worlds or make up entire storylines or plot. I dont make my own fictional characters in my head, nor do I imagine an idealized version of myself. I would say I daydream of fictional characters Ive read or watched through media going through emotional conflicts  it is not a storyline or a full plot; it is a section of a plot, the climax, with no other added details. I would like to know what other people think of this issue, and if theres anything that can be done to improve it. I think I may have developed it as an unhealthy coping mechanism, but Im unsure how to go about improving it. I have nothing against daydreaming in itself; its a wonderful thing. But now it is interfering with my schoolwork and daily life, as I find myself procrastinating both relationships and work in order to daydream. Finally, the main crux of what I want to talk about: My depression symptoms. Im not comfortable with self-diagnosing depression. It is a very real, serious condition that hurts people  even people that I currently know and love  and I would hate to invalidate the struggles of people who go through it if I dont actually suffer from it. Its why I am so hesitant in even professing the idea that I could have depression, perhaps a mild form of it, because Im scared of invalidating other peoples experiences. The fact of it is that Ive been showing depression symptoms for a while now, and Im not sure how to feel about it. Ive gone through a lot as of late, so I would be valid in being stressed or sad about recent events. To tl;dr of it: Briefly moved to another country, withdrew from an online community of friends after an argument with one of the main friends in said community (didnt feel comfortable there anymore), learned about my ADHD when my parents told me that I most likely had it but never knew before that time, got into a relationship that inevitably failed once said guy got into another relationship and told me after the fact (he was polyamorous and we never had the conversation about it until then), and am currently in a very unstable living situation, as I am unsure of where my parents and I are going to travel next or where well be staying long-term. With all that, it would be natural for me to be upset or stressed or sad. Im aware of that. And yet, when I think about whats causing me distress, its not those things  Its me. Im upset, not because of what Im going through (although I am not fine with these events, they arent the main struggle), but because of who I am as a person. I feel like a failure, useless, a burden, and that all I can do is take from other people, no matter how hard I try to do good.  That last one probably stems from my falling out with the friend I mentioned earlier. They told me I was untrustworthy, unintentionally two-faced, and a person who takes from others in her pursuit to try to help everyone. I feel like their words have become a part of my mental dialogue, now. I dont know. I think Ive been oversleeping, eating more than usual, and I feel tired, all the time. But not a physical tiredness; a mental tiredness that doesnt go away, no matter what. Its a heavy nothing that follows me everywhere, and theres moments where Ill feel better  distracting myself with friends or my daydreaming habit  but the second those things stop, it washes over me all over again. I dont know what to do about it. I feel worthless, like a waste of space. Im guilty a lot, even for things Ive got no reason to be. Ive gotten passive suicidal ideation, different from active. And I dont know, because Im terrible at self-awareness. I dont know, because with all my distractions, its possible that this has worsened over time, with the more I ignored it and the more I used my daydreaming as a coping mechanism to feel better, instead of actually addressing what was going on. And now Now, Im overdue on schoolwork, on the brink of tears because I feel so pathetic, and I just. Need advice, help, something. My friends who I have talked to about this comment that it seems like a very mild form of depression, considering that Im still able to function, but still showcase these depression symptoms. Heck, despite being told by two of my friends who suffer from depression themselves that its okay for me to call it such or that they even think its possible I have it and that that it doesnt invalidate their experiences at all, Im scared. I got a therapist appointment in June, I think, but my parents seem to be of the impression thats its for an ADHD diagnosis only. Its only an hour long, and I dont think Ill have future, consistent ones besides that one, considering how shaky my living situation is right now. Should I talk to them about me showcasing depression symptoms, as well? I dont know if well have time to really go over it, or if Ill be able to find help right away, though. I would say the depression symptoms began a year ago, got better with the relationship I had, and then fell right back into that hole of darkness again. And then I had a period where I felt better, and then crashed for no particular reason, and am now right back here again. What should I do? What should I think? What do you guys think? I need some outside advice here.I would really appreciate any input, so thanks in advance for anyone who bothers to reply to this mess, haaaa.If more context or information is needed, just let me know.

I have fought the demons of depression for years. Some days are better than others, but finding the emotional energy to do anything other than go to work and do the job is next to impossible most of the time now. I have been on several different medications over the years. I cant say that any particular one made a notable difference at all. I am continually frustrated with a lack of energy and a lack of desire to do the things that I once enjoyed, and that I had looked forward to at this stage of life. Every day, I pretty much feel like this is it  as good as it is ever going to get  and the opportunity of any meaningful contribution of life is over  done  finished. Retirement is something that I longed for over the years. As it draws nearer, I fear it because I see myself just fading away and soon gone. So, I ask about TMS therapy. It is very expensive, requires a huge time committement, and is not covered by medical insurance. I have spoken with doctors (psychiatrists) at a couple of top hospitals in the nation and have not gotten stellar reports from them. The consensus was that it works for some but not for others and the success rates are fair at best overall. Having said that, my doc says they have seen amazing results from the therapy and people complete it and the negative thoughts are pretty much gone. He says their success rate is extremely high. I have not done it because: a) too much time away from work; b) too costly and not covered by medical insurance; c) the reports from two docs from world known excellent institutions which were not glowing. I have searched for answers for years, with none. Now, I have developed chronic pain in the lumbar area, legs, neck, shoulders, arms, etc. I am working on the back with a major pain managment group with some injections which I hope will help.

HOW IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE SWITCH FOR A GENERIC TO A BRAND NAME? Actually I cant find this topic on Google; the topic I found is the switch from BRAND NAME TO GENERIC; but I am inquiring about the exact OPPOSITE! Did you experience a depression relapse OR the antidepressant withdrawal symptoms? Follow Report

The brand name I am taking is no longer MANUFACTURED but I can find it in pharmacies nearby. The hospital offered me another generic FOR FREE, but I felt sick when I took it just one time! I then purchased the brand name which costed me a lot. The physician said the symptoms of new generic will disappear within ten days or so. BUT I REALLY DOUBT AND FEEL AFRAID TO GIVE IT A TRY! I do not want to experience a tough relapse anymore! What can you tell me about it? What should I do? The brand name is about to be out of stock, while the generic causes me to feel overwhelming depression. The generic is for free, while the brand name is to be purchased.Did you ever try to change from a brand name to a generic? How was your experience? Follow Report"

They all seem to meld into a big fat pain in the butt, an uncomfortable jumbled feeling. When I feeling depressed and angry, my PTSD raises its ugly head. And I feel as if things are piling up on me. I feel overwhelmed, wondering if I'll ever feel in control of my feelings and reactions again. There are both primary and secondary emotions and they piggyback on each other-even tertiary feelings add to this, looking like a frog free-for-all. For example- If you are afraid that an ex will show up you might feel fearful and then become angry and this can feed another feeling like fight or flight reactions. Or you are told that you have cancer. You first feel shocked and frightened, then angry and resentful. Why me? Im afraid that Ill die. One late afternoon I got angry at my husband for calling for me from another room to go see him. {{{MERRY}}} I became angry and fearful and resentful. I reacted with feeling very anxious because it reminded me of how my mother would call for me so she could blame me for something that my twin did, or for something that I didnt do well enough. It made me feel as if everything I did was wrong. It made me feel like a failure and I hated her for it. Anger seems to be the beginning of a lot of these piggyback emotions. They are like jigsaw puzzles, all fitting into each other to make one big picture. I know that Im most vulnerable when things arent going my way, or the way I think that they should be. Feelings perplex and confuse and stump us- and many times we dont stop and think why we react and feel the way we do, we just want to hide. And there are many more feelings than anger and fear that are negative that can hurt us and can make us feel horrible. Here are some: Apathetic, bad, frustrated, guilty, depressed, gloomy, irritated, restless and sad. And there are more. What feelings piggyback on you? Have you felt other emotions that I didnt list.

Fifteen years ago I was diagnosed with Depression and was put on Zoloft. Then I was switched over to 150 mg of Effexor for about ten years ago. Five year ago I started a consistent mindful meditation practice and due to a major increase in my overall happiness I started a tapering off process that would take about 3 years. First it was 75mg for about 1-1/2 years and then 35 mg for about the same amount of time. Each time I changed to a lower dosage the symptoms were the same, i.e. nausea, brain zaps and extreme irritability which caused problems at home and at work. The irritability was a major concern each time and I was not sure if the irritability was a withdrawal symptom or just the way things would be for me at this new dosage level. Each time I hung in there only to find myself stabilizing back to myself gradually after about two months. About five weeks ago I went cold turkey off the 35 mg of Effexor. For the first week the symptoms were as mentioned above. I anticipated the irritability knowing what kind of trouble it can produce. It was not that bad since I had been through it before. However at the start of the 2nd week I caused a major fight with my wife over the smallest thing, then I said some pretty nasty things to my neighbor over another small issue and again another fight with my wife at the end of the week. Then I fell into a deep hole of depression, an experience that I would not wish on anyone. The third week I went to a one week silent meditation retreat that I had scheduled earlier in the year. That entire week was awesome. Not one brain zap or irritable feeling the whole time, so I honestly felt like I was out of the woods. After returning home the brain zap started reoccurring as well as some irritability. I guess the meditation was counteracting the biological changes that were occurring within my nervous system. The fourth and fifth week I notice I felt flat emotionally but on a positive note I was now experiencing very few brain zap. Over the last three days joyfulness has started to arise particularly after meditation and exercise which is a state I normally feel quite often. I cant say for sure yet but I think I am starting to stabilize; only time will tell. The main purpose that I am trying to convey is that the symptoms in my case were quite horrible and that I was tempted each time I reduced my medication to give up and just accept the fact that I needed to take the mediation for the rest of my life but for some reason I persisted and in the end I am so happy I did. I am not saying this will be the case for you, but for sure I would recommend hanging in there for a while before giving up and to do this while keeping your doctor in the loop. Good Luck!!

I have often wondered if those 2 incidents could have caused brain damage hence being a big part of why I developed depression. I am wondering if I should have a brain scan to find out, and if I did and there is some damage if anything could be done.

Have been on antidepressants since August of 1992. This summer I had the opportunity to have a genetic profile done on how my body processes medications. After years and years of battling severe depression and suicidal ideation, this genetic profile shows that I literally can not metabolize antidepressants and the report suggested Pristiq Nightmare from Hell, that was. After being on Cynbalta for three or four years, the psychiatrist took me from a 120 mg per day dose to a 60 mg per day dose for five days. Then threw me directly into Pristiq 50 mgs. It made me highly manic and I had to take clonopin just to slow my brain down to be able to think. I was advised to cut the 50 mg Pristiq in half to a 25 mg dose. That was an even worse nightmare. Apparently no one understood how vital that lightweight time release coating is. I thought I was going to die on the second day of this. So basically I went almost cold turkey off of Pristiq, and this was UNDER DOCTOR SUPERVISION! Needless to say, I feel lost.

Have been on antidepressants since August of 1992. This summer I had the opportunity to have a genetic profile done on how my body processes medications. After years and years of battling severe depression and suicidal ideation, this genetic profile shows that I literally can not metabolize antidepressants and the report suggested Pristiq Nightmare from Hell, that was. After being on Cynbalta for three or four years, the psychiatrist took me from a 120 mg per day dose to a 60 mg per day dose for five days. Then threw me directly into Pristiq 50 mgs. It made me highly manic and I had to take clonopin just to slow my brain down to be able to think. I was advised to cut the 50 mg Pristiq in half to a 25 mg dose. That was an even worse nightmare. Apparently no one understood how vital that lightweight time release coating is. I thought I was going to die on the second day of this. So basically I went almost cold turkey off of Pristiq, and this was UNDER DOCTOR SUPERVISION! Needless to say, I feel lost. Today I am now seven days clean from antidepressants but am having horrendous trailers. They are better this week, but still plaguing me and making every day tasks a challenge. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO GET THIS GARBAGE OUT OF THE SYSTEM? ANY SUGGESTIONS? DIET? AM DESPERATE HERE.

I suffer from clinical depression and mine is certainly affected by seasons and the immediate aftermath of the holidays and combination of many short, cloudy days are my worst season. It became obvious with my last visit to my psychiatrist that it was time for me to change providers. The fact of the matter in my area is that it is very easy to get an appointment with a bad Psych and a very long wait to see a good one. I was a bit discouraged that I thought there was help out there, but that I may not be able to access it for several months, soI have started reading and practicing Mindfulness: An eight week plan for Finding Peace in a Frantic World by Mark Williams and Danny Penman. If you had known me 15 years ago you would have heard me compare meditation to voodoo, probably unfavorably. I was not impressed by any claims made toward alternative treatment for anything. I have always imagined the worst of every situation and my perception and imagination would have produced Armageddon years ago. My thinking was that even if mindfulness did not have a positive effect on my depression, it may help my near and long-term outlook. I am only one week in, but I can already see times where my reaction to something that may have made me more depressed have not had that effect at all. I dont know if everyone else will have the same experience, but it is something that those of who have battled this debilitating disease can do proactively that does not include a new medicine. Please do not start this and stop taking any antidepressant or other anxiety medication before discussing with your doctor  for me, I see it as a complimentary approach to my disease.

I flew out of bed in a sleep stupor, for some reason ran to my closet door and opened it, and thought in the dark that I saw two big figures standing in there (it was clothing racks). I screamed and went, having a full blown panic attack to the living room, curled up on the sofa and prayed. Once the panic attack passed to some degree, I stayed there for the night, curled up in a ball. After that, the next two days I had flashbacks of my mother, those sounds, watching her vomit blood, and I couldnt get away from it. I had no where to go to get away from it. I made a cup of tea, and stayed there trying to sleep to no avail. This morning is better, but Im extremely nervous and cant get her image out of my mind.

Please let me vent a bit. I think some of you know my kids hounded me for 5 years to move down here (from MD to VA) to be closer to them. I didnt want to move. I was only 3 hours away, a trip they or I can easily make, had my own condo in a town I loved and had lived in for 30 years. It was my nest . doctors, church, good friends, knew my way all around and was very happy. Well, because Im 72 I thought well, maybe I should since Im sure not getting any younger. So 1-1/2 years ago I made the move. The first town in which I had an apartment I hated. So, now Im living in a limited income apartment in Staunton, VA. The move cost me, what I consider a fortune, and Im still paying it off  $11,000 for the move, and $3000 for the new carpeting I had put in my condo to sell it. I sold it all right, but since it was under water I had to pay the buyers $6,000. Go figure. Well, here comes Christmas  my most difficult time of the year  and I mentioned to my son that I was looking to find a rescue dog  a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. I had mine, sweet Molly, since she was 4 and at 11 she had to be put down because of the typical congestive heart failure. She was my pal, my friend, and just a little love bug. My son tells me oh no Mom, you dont want to get another dog. Theyre so much work. Really? Well, considering I have 2 cats and have for years, and have had a dog, live on the first floor, they would be so much work? How so? Molly has only been gone a year, and I miss that little face terribly. They are such companions and since I cant seem to feel at home here, it would help get me out, take her for walks, meet some new people, and get some exercise, instead of sitting here on my fat tush all the time. Since its a limited income community, lots of people do not speak to you even when you say hi. My floor is OK  theres 4 apts., but no one that I would be close to. Im having trouble finding a church  Im Western Orthodox and the only 2 Ortho churches down here are Eastern . same beliefs, but very different worship styles. And, on top of that, my X-husband lives about 15-20 miles down the road, so he is king of the grandkids. (or so he thinks). I am very depressed about all this  my family is against my having a dog, I do not like it here at all (I cant tell you how many times Ive been called a Yankee), and I just want to go home. I know my condo isnt an option (sure wish I had not sold it), but someplace to rent. My two main reasons for not wanting to move down here were 1- I didnt want to leave a place that had been home for all that time and I was very happy, and 2  I did not want my kids telling me what to do. I told them before I moved that Since the divorce, I have been very independent, and I intend to keep it that way as long as possible. I know the time will come when I will need more help, but that time is NOT now. Oh my . first Christmas, now this .. what a depressing time of year.

I always felt I have nothing valuable to say. Anyway, now I feel the need to join. Events that have happened recently moved me to reach out either for support and to try to be helpful to other people. I suffer from depression and taking medicine for years. I have experienced ups and downs, sometimes better sometimes worse times. You know it. In October I had to be hospitalized in psychiatric hospital. It was my third time to be there. The reason was that I tried to commit suicide. Weeks before that I felt totally desperate. My condition got worse and worse. I experienced big disappointments with some people who are close to me and I think that was the trigger for depression attack. I could barely sleep abut I always felt tired. I couldnt even cry, And I saw I getting on my wifes nerves. I just came to conclusion that it would be better if I stop all that. Luckily, in the hospital they saved my life (I was 2 days in coma). After ER, I was sent to psychiatric hospital. I stayed there for 5 weeks. I know I almost died then and now, even I still have problems with my mood and lack of energy, I want to reach for help and for support. My depression is coming from my childhood. As a child, I was abused by my father and bullied in school. Maybe later I can tell more about it, I dont want to write it now. All those things marked me for life. I was 19, when I was able to leave home and I thought all bad is left behind, but it is not that easy. True, I know how to communicate now, I can find friends already but I still carry it with me wherever I go. The fears I have are reflected everywhere, when I talk to others, even when I doing as simple things as shopping. Many times memories come back to me, even as the nightmares, many times I have woke up with screaming. There are many I would like to say, maybe by time I will be able. Another reason I joined this forum is that I would like to be in some way helpful to others. We all have problems and I would like to be supportive to others because I know what does it mean to suffer. I hope i can contribute.

I havent told anyone here, I dont think, the real reason(s) for my depression. Yeah, I was molested by my dad, one brother doesnt believe me. Why would I lie? No benefit to it. Anyway, I was married for 22 years to a man whom I loved very much. I fell in love with him because he treated me so well. I had never felt that before, especially from my first husband. However, I should have fallen in love with him because he treated my kids well. I didnt see it at first. (Blind?) But he was short with my kids, impatient, and rigid. His kids were good as gold, of course, not. Over the years he became mocking, silent, sullen, and harsh with them. I stood in the middle and played referee as long as I could until one night when my daughter became afraid that he was going to hit her. I was awakened by her loud, terrified, crying and yelling. She had hidden in my bathroom with the phone ready to call 911. It seems he had gotten so angry because my daughter and I had gone out earlier in the day shopping and spent too much money. No, we didnt, but he exploded nevertheless. That was 2005. In 2006 we divorced. I still loved him. We tried for 8 more years to get back together, my moving in and back out with him. It was painful and tiresome. His grandson seemed always to be around. Finally, in 2012, his grandson got a job with a security company under contract with the Department of Homeland Security. Yay, I was hoping he would move out. But, no. At some point he came home upset and was talking to my ex. I found out later that his grandson had told him there had been a fire fight in a building somewhere, I forget where, and a few people had been killed, including his immediate supervisor, who was his mentor. Over several months, I was told I couldnt talk about it, but I needed to talk about it. This kind of thing didnt happen to real people. But I was told, yes it does, it happens more than you think. Military or FBI, CIA, go into peoples homes and they just disappear, theyre never heard from again. I rebelled. I talked about it all the time, to them and my kids. I was told, shhh, theyre listening, they had our houses bugged. They wanted me dead because I was talking too much. This all happened over many months, with his grandson constantly running to the windows to check the surroundings. One night I was standing in the dining room and heard someone whisper from the carport, a derogatory remark. Heard it plain as day. It only added to my fear. I was terrified. So I finally moved out in the latter part of 2012. I was staying with my kids. My ex dropped all of my belongings, minus any furniture, on my front porch. We had decided that he would take them to a storage area. I was so angry, frustrated, and hurt that he did this that I slapped him on the face and broke down crying. An hour later I was being arrested, and handcuffed by the police. He had called and initiated a restraining order. I had no contact whatsoever with him for an entire year, all the while being in fear for my familys lives. I still couldnt talk about it because I was convinced it was all real. I waited for some people to break down my sliding glass door, or for a knock on our front door. Thats where my Harley comes in. If I hadnt had him I sincerely believe I would have lost my mind, all of it, not just the part Im missing now. I still havent been able to talk to a therapist about it. Of course, now I know it was all a lie, an elaborate, heinous, lie, for my benefit. There is the fact that my exs grandson was bipolar, and possibly schizophrenic. But I did hear a voice on the carport. And, if my ex wanted me to leave all he had to do is ask. Did he believe his grandson? I dont know and never will. I was hurt so much by him by such a cruel lie.. But, I still ask myself, what if it was real? Dany Any thoughts Liked by Jim, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

I have to be extremely careful or I will fall, and some of them have been real hurtful oneslike on the garage floor which is concrete and I landed on my back, hitting my head, into the coffee table sending everything there flying, including my water and tea, walking up a slight hill on some grass, and many, many, more times. I havent said anything to you all because I was terrified it was something awful . a brain tumor, Parkinsons . Well . I got the Mayo Clinic Guide to Integrative Medicine and in the section on Stress and Mood Disorders, page 177, it talks about anti-anxiety medications. It says side effects include unsteadiness, drowsiness, reduced muscle coordination, and problems with balance. These medications can also cause memory problems. I cannot tell you how relieved I was . these side effects are primarily from the anti-anxiety meds. I know that taking Lamictal, causes my hands to shake, and for that (they call them essential tremors) I have to take a small dose of propanalol, which is a beta blocker. Anyhow, if any of you folks are experiencing any of this, as I have been, take heart . it may not be at all what you think. abby Liked by Teresa, Volunteer Mentor, Kanaaz Pereira, Connect Moderator, Parus Follow Report"

Always having to push myself to do things. Ive been on every med for depression. Some helped with the sadness but nothing has ever helped in other ways, ie constant fatigue, low self esteem, no drive, i have to push myself to do basic things but lately cant even really do that. I start things occasionally but never finish. Finally on my last visit with my psychiatrist he told me that he thinks the one thing that would help is taking adderal. He said that he cant prescribe it to me because he is at the limit for prescribing this medication. He told me to find another dr to prescribe it. To tell the dr yhat he believes this will finally give me some relief. I am so desperate because i feel i am alive but do not have the strength to actually live. This is my only option now. I live in Philadelphia Pa and need to find a dr asap because i cannot go on like this any longer. I have a job but have been unable to go for 3 weeks now. Is there anyone who can recommend a dr where i live? Please help.. i am osing hope. Follow Report"

I am very sensitive to medications because I have a sensory processing disorder and Im also very chemically sensitive. I have been highly emotional empathic and intuitive my entire life and it also spills over into how I can handle vitamins and drugs. Feel like my depression has gotten completely out of control and I have tried Cymbalta Remeron Wellbutrin and Lexapro and nothing is helping at all it is not giving me any relief. I have not been able to work or have a social life in over a year I stayed in bed most of the day I lost about 20 pounds and my parents are taking care of me. I see a new psychiatrist on Wednesday I almost feel like nobody believes me these doctors wont listen to me. Ive gotten all of my blood work done I dont have a thyroid problem I dont have any other serious diseases my blood work and vitamin levels came out fine. In fact Im a bit of a health nut and I eat very healthy mostly organic food and I was doing yoga up until I got severely depressed in January. I havent seen a psychiatrist right now that is very demeaning to me and he doesnt listen to me at all or my concerns. I dont know what to do at this point I dont know what to tell this new psychiatrist Ive heard of something called treatment-resistant depression and Ive talked to a doctor in Australia hes retired name Dr Gillman who recommends an SSRI and TCA combination to treat resistant depression. Ive tried all the natural route I take a ton of fish oil and krill oil I take magnesium I take alpha lipoic acid and basically everything else people say is good for depression Ive tried. I was even prescribed 5-HTP for over 2 years and I feel like I really messed up my nervous system somehow. How do I get these doctors to listen to me and help me why do I seem to just be invisible to them and my problems are nothing even though I have not worked or been able to have a normal life and over a year isnt that a sign of severe dysfunction? Thanks again for reading I hope to get more information as I contribute and participate in this group I really need support right now I feel very alone Im fighting with my entire family nobody believes that Im sick nobody understands what happened to me I just feel completely lost.

In the early 2000s I was diagnosed with Depression and was placed on Ativan. After moving to a new location and getting a new psychiatrist, he started to wean me off of the Ativan. He didnt do it right and I went into a very bad withdrawal. I dropped that psychiatrist (had him fired) and ended up with my current female psychiatrist. Since then I have had two hospitalizations and have multiple drugs prescribed and changed to where I am no longer on any anti-depressants. I have suffered multiple serious side effects from taking and going off of these drugs. Sleeping is very difficult for me and I am taking Clonzepam 1mg along with 300mg of Trazadone for sleep. I am very restless sleeping and dont feel like I slept well when I wake up. I havent felt like myself for years now and my psychiatrist says I wont feel like I did when I was on Ativan. When I was on that for several years and had energy and the will to live life to the fullest. Now I think of dying every day (wont do that as I am afraid of dying) and just dont have the desire to do anything. I used to have pride in the way I looked and dressed and now I dont care. The drugs I was on made me gain weight so my clothes dont fit right and I havent had the desire to go shopping. My husband is now my caretaker in some respects as I have no desire to do anything. I have to force myself to get up from my chair everyday to just do the smallest of tasks. My feeling is that there isnt any medication or therapy that has helped me and I am about at the end of my rope. There isnt any true information that my Multiple Sclerosis is contributing to what is going on with me at least that is what my neurologist ang psychiatrist say. They just dont know. I have what they call Benign MS so I am not wheelchair bound. Is there any hope for me? I need help but I dont know what to do. Can anyone out there help me? Follow Report"

I am hoping that you are doing everything within your power to recover from whatever ails you because we all deserve to be at peace, live our life to the fullest and even get the best treatment possible for our illnesses. I am a woman in my 40s with a chronic history of depression, anxiety, PTSD and recently became agoraphobic because I only felt safe at home. I have tried so many medications, most did not even touch my depression, but one did (Remeron) and of course I gained over 30 pounds in 1 year so my medical doctor was not pleased. Then, a cruel person, or shall I say a person with her own issues became emotionally abusive with me and she stirred up so many unresolved feelings that I became very ill to the point of incapacitation. I was really scared, desperate and almost gave up but my treatment team would not give up on me. The discussion of ECT came up and I thought that I was going to throw up. I have heard some horror stories about ECT so ambivalence and mistrust was my initial reaction. Then, I agreed to do it and after my physical exam cleared me for the procedures I did it. Now, I am a huge chicken when it come to dentist and being put to sleep. My first ECT visitwell prior to going, I genuinely thought that I was going to have a heart attack. However, I wanted to get better so I did it! This big chicken did it but before I did my doctor from Yale, Dr. Ostroff and his team explained everything to me. There are 2 ways to do ECT. One is bilateral where both sides of the brain receive the treatment and then there is unilateral which is only on the right side of the brain where there is minimal cognitive damage, less side effects and virtually no memory loss..for me anyway. My only complaint would have to be headaches but this is questionable because I suffer from migraines and need a darn root canal. Anyway, once you arrive for your session this is what happens; 1) You go to the ECT suite 2) Take off your shoes 3) Lay in bed 4) Vitals are monitered 5) If***heart rate is too fast due to nerves or other issues one is pre-medicated to control heart rate. 6) IV is put in as this is how you are put to sleep 7) You are then transferred to the small ECT room. 8) You are made comfortable with a small pillow 9) You are then asked are you ready? 10) You are then told..ok you are about to get very sleepy and have a funny taste in your mouth 11) You wake up, did not feel a thing, and feel sleepy 12) You are back in the ECT suite 13) Your vitals are being monitered again 14) You are given something to drink if you asked~no food or drinks after midnight the night before. 15) You are told to get up from the bed and sit in a small seating area where you put your shoes on. 16) After being observed for a few minutes, you are taken to the waiting area where someone should be waiting for you because you are not allowed to drive the day of the procedure. This is a wise thing to do because after the induced seizure, medications, and brief nap one awakes a little woozy and tired. 17) You leave with your next appointment in hand, go home, rest, eat, drink and can take ibuprofen a couple of hours after the treatment. 18) FYI**** After the first session, due to having your first seizure and muscle relaxants one can be a little sore but this is only after the first session. Its not the baberic treatment many report. I am not forced to have the procedures done and after 8 sessions I am no longer living in darkness. Yesterday, my memory was tested and I scored perfectly. The unilateral approach is the best approach for me because I want to return to work soon and need to be able to continue remembering things and focus on my work. I have a wonderful treatment team. However, I wont lie. I still get scared because no one really knows how the procedure really works but there is enough research that demonstrates that it does work. There is also word of mouth. I am proof that ECT works and although I dont enjoy the feeling of being put to sleep, I know it is done safely and I know that slowly but surely I am recovering. Recovery is our ultimate goal! I hope this was helpful. I understand not everyone has had my experience with this procedure but I must say people are tired of barely living because of their mental ilnesses and everytime I go, 3 xs per week, there are 12-20 individuals waiting for their ECT treatments. If nothing else is helping you, please do not give up. If the biggest chicken on this planet can do it and reports an improved mood, no suicidal ideations, am cooking again and can laugh once again, it is at least worth discussing.

The unilateral approach is the best approach for me because I want to return to work soon and need to be able to continue remembering things and focus on my work. I have a wonderful treatment team. However, I wont lie. I still get scared because no one really knows how the procedure really works but there is enough research that demonstrates that it does work. There is also word of mouth. I am proof that ECT works and although I dont enjoy the feeling of being put to sleep, I know it is done safely and I know that slowly but surely I am recovering. Recovery is our ultimate goal! I hope this was helpful. I understand not everyone has had my experience with this procedure but I must say people are tired of barely living because of their mental ilnesses and everytime I go, 3 xs per week, there are 12-20 individuals waiting for their ECT treatments. If nothing else is helping you, please do not give up. If the biggest chicken on this planet can do it and reports an improved mood, no suicidal ideations, am cooking again and can laugh once again, it is at least worth discussing. Best of luck to all & god bless you all during this holiday season and beyond  Liked by Kit, Roxie43, kstuhld2, marylynette ... see all Follow Report"

Im a 54 year old female and I just dont know how to live my life anymore. I know Ive always had depression and anxiety, but now I cant seem to do anything. I love reading but cant focus anymore, Im tired all the time, I eat when I have to and I worry all the time. Maybe this is a mid-life crises but it feels so much worse. I know I isolate, I dont want to talk to anyone, I want to run away but I dont know to where. Even if I wanted to talk to someone, there just isnt anyone. A couple months ago I lost my job at the library which I loved but couldnt get to work because I was constantly worried about my 26 year old son. He graduated from college and is trying to find himself, but is floundering, getting tickets, not working  he was doing drugs, but I think he stopped. I constantly worry if hes okay, constantly in fear something will happen to him  I know this isnt normal. And me, I dont know if its too late for me to do anything meaningful with my life. Im fairly intelligent but never finished college  I simply dont know what to do with anything. Im lost. No money, no job, living with parents(one has Alzheimers), need to leave, need a change, need a life. Im reading books by the Dalai Lama, taking Paxil, have no counselor, trying meditation and yoga  every day just feels the same. The friends I thought I made  no ones called. The thing is I know no one can do this for me, I just cant seem to do it either. And running away seems such a good option, but to where and who and without any money. I dont know how to change this, I dont know where to go, what to do. Im not married- Ive been a single mom for years. If anyone out there has any suggestions of what to do when you get bogged down like this , please, please tell me, Im so sad all the time , Ive made such a mess of things, what do I do?

I am 44 and moved from my home state 3 years ago following my husbands career. I had a really crappy childhood with a father diagnosed as a sexual addict and a mother who physically abused us  but the worst abuse was the mental abuse that both parents played with their hatred and lies. Sexual, physical and mental abuse was my norm  much of which I let continue even through my adult years. I grew up with a strong attitude of Ill prove to the world that Im not trash like my parents and I will be successful .. so I married young to a man who was OCD (but had money) and had a huge temper but being abused was all I knew  so I thought it was great and really the best I could do. At least I was out of my abusive childhood home. We had two beautiful children.. I was a straight A student and a role model employee  and a good mom  not great  but good. I finally divorced him after years of his control when my girls were 11 and 14 and my career was bringing me a lot of self esteem. Unfortunately, my ex told my girls I cheated on him with a co-workers which was a total lie but my girls didnt want to live with me anymore. I did NOT cheat on him. I was left totally distraught. My whole life, the only family I had, was my two girls  but I lost them by finally standing up for myself. All I had left was my career - and so I started my work addiction. My mother was back in my life at this point  with her neverending self-esteem eliminating comments. My Ex was out to make my life hell, and my two teenage daughters didnt know whether to believe me or not. They knew my mom and my dad were both crazies and so their dad told them I was crazy too. My girls now know I did not cheat on their dad, but they both know I have some mental health issues  so they stay away from me. But  the divorce is when I believe my depression started and grew painfully worse day by day  although I wasnt diagnosed and didnt see a Dr. My constant crying pushed my girls away even more . they didnt know what to do with me. My girls are 21 and 24 now and have their own lives. I only see them a couple times a year now and my heart aches. Shortly after we (my 2nd husband and I) moved 3 years ago, I was robbed in our church parking lot and had my purse and my identify stolen. My new husbands son, who was 17 and a total terror with drugs and alcohol and verbal abuse, moved with us. He and I fought all the time. The nightmares started immediately after that and memories of my childhood and sexual abuse came back strong  stuff I had buried deep and kept fighting through life to su overcome and forget cae back with extreme shame and hurt. I had nightmares that my girls were being killed in terrible ways  both natural and by human criminal hands. I was doing great in my career though. I Made a huge bonus this year but I was doing nothing but working 100 hours a week out of my home  even at night so I wouldnt sleep. It was the only thing I had. My marriage was suffering. I had no friends. Didnt leave my house and my depression got much worse. My new husband and I were trying to make new friends by frequenting some local bars. I slowly started drinking more and more when we would go out on the weekends. I began volunteering at a local Legion which was great but not great at the same time because it gave me more time to drink. My drinking was binge drinking in trying to feel comfortable enough to make friends . and forget. I didnt drink at home or when I was alone so I didnt see myself as an alcoholic. I just couldnt function in public without a drink. finally, I tried to kill myself the day after St Patricks Day thisyear following two days of totally binge drinking. Luckily, it didnt work  so I quickly started plan B  a very well planned funeral and suicide all arranged and organized as to make sure I didnt fail this time  but my husband found out and took me to the hospital to have me committed. I was so angry at him for days  until I had been sober long enough to realize what I mess I had become. Im on meds now and WAS doing better, but not back to normal but I thought I could drink a little again. I cant. I have one drink and it impacts me so bad for 2-3 days. If I dont fully recover and binge or drink a few again, it knocks me back to suicidal thoughts. If I cant get it together, I know I will end up killing myself or doing something stupid to get myself in trouble and or lose my marriage. My girls aready have a grandfather and greatgrandfather who killed themselves. They dont need me to do that as well. Ive messed up my brain so bad, i cant work any more. I cant do simple numerical processing and I switch words around both written and verbally. Im very embarassed and sensitive to it because its not like me to not be perfect and smart as a qhip  So  I quit my long-time career two months ago because I didnt want to even give them the chance of giving me a bad review (even though they were being great and told me to take the time I need to recover.) I thought I would start my own business. I dont have the passoin to start it though now that Ive quit and have absolutely nothing to do.. I am a HUGE mess right now. Marriage is rocky. I have no job. Im eating non-stop and have gained 40 pounds in the past 8-9 months. I just sit in my house and sleep 12+ hours a day. I tried volunteering full time but being around alcohol is not a good thing. Being around military personnel who are also depressed helps but doesnt help at the same time. I am a total mental mess but in reality, I know things arent that bad  but I just cant get through it all. I am going back to see my psych this week for more help but money is tight and hes expensive. I know this is a long post  but it makes me feel better to throw it out there. It makes it real to me. Hopefully my story will help someone else to know they arent alone. The journey to heal is not an easy one  even for someone who had it all just a few months ago. I dont do well at making friends . I know how to have good working relationships  but not personal relationships or friends. So far, the two closest friends Ive made ended up being either a drug addict or super bipilor person which doesnt help me. I tried opening up to a third person but they told my story out of context so now I feel everyone is looking at me either like Im nuts, an alcoholic  or just a poor pitiful person. SO  now I dont even like going to the place where I use to volunteer. Its better I just stay in my bedrom. Going to AA or group meetings makes me anxious. I hate them too. Im an awful person because I look at others in those meetings and think Im not that bad. What the hell am I doing here? I dont want to eat because Im fat so Ill not eat for two days  Then Ill be so hungry Ill do nothing but eat for two days. I can sit and eat an entire box of candy bars and still be hungry and sad. I try to get a schedule written and try to make myself get out of the house  but it isnt easy. I get sick at my stomach. I run a fever. I get chills. I need a program where I can live somewhere with someone who will force me to be accountable, force me to get up and also allow me to talk. I need someone who can be a good listener and help me process everything going on in my head so I can deal with me. A one hour discussion once a week isnt enough to help me. BUT  living in a home with nothing but heroin attiics in a place that doesnt feel clean and sanitary  not a warm loving home  sucks and doesnt help either. I have no family to turn to. My husband had to work many hours to keep making the money to pay for all my meds and keep a roof over our heads. He, unfortunately, has his own drinking problem, which doesnt help support me  but I dont want to lose him. Hes all I have. How can I get help? Where can I get help?

Problem communicating with others and forming friendships. He is also experiencing anxiety as well as difficulty concentrating, fatigue, recent significant weight loss ( 95 pounds in 14 months.he is 6 feet tall) and difficulty being around anyone (prefers being alone in his room). He also lost consciousness prompting a fall while showering twice Some history: He was bullied emotionally his junior year in High School which then led to extremely low self esteem and withdrawal from activities he enjoyed. He went to a psychologist for a year and was diagnosed with depression and placed on medication. The medication prompted weight gain (45 lbs) within 6 months. He decided to go off the medication because he did not like how it made him feel nor did he like the weight gain; however he remained in therapy. Medical tests given: Blood work checking for anemia, kidney and liver function and thyroid all normal. Cholesterol tests normal. A brain scan checking for tumors normal. At this point he refuses to go to a psychologist and will not go on antidepressant or anxiety medication. However, he has recently started cutting himself ( 3 times that I know of the last 7 months). I do not know what to do. He will not discuss his feelings with anyone: however I think he would be open to more medical tests. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Follow Report"

New to this great forum and hoping someone here can help me. Im a 38 year old guy, 64, 178 pounds. Ive been having incessant early morning insomnia for months, and am struggling to pinpoint the cause. I should clarify what I mean by early morning: Im a night owl, and have gone to bed at around 2:30 AM for at least the last twenty years. (There was a period of a couple years when I was working on Asian time and had to go to bed even later (4:30 to 5:00 AM), but Im back to my druthers of 2:30 AM.) My body seems to function best on about 7.5 hours of sleep, so if my circadian rhythms are in tune, I go to bed around 2:30 AM and wake up around 10 AM with a song in my heart and hope for the day, but I can function reasonably well on about 6.5-7 hours of sleep *provided that I wake up around 10*. (Waking up at my normal time seems to be more important than going to sleep at my normal time.) But since last summer, Ive been waking up around 8 AM every morning, and with a BANG  not gradual, groggy wakeups, but with a surge of energy and a pounding heart that casts me impossibly out of sleep in an instant. My initial self-diagnosis was that this was some consequence of overcardio and undernutrition. For most of my late 20s and early 30s I was pretty fit, doing HIIT cardio sessions for about 90 minutes a day, 4-5 days a week, and everything was dandy. Work and marriage kept me couchbound for my mid-30s, however, and I grew chubby, sulky, and TIRED  like the less I moved, the more worn out and depressed I got  and I couldnt live with the person I was becoming. For New Years 2019 I resolved to get back into shape, so I resumed the HIIT and radically cleaned up my diet: no sugar, no caffeine, and no flour or refined grain. (Im also a vegan of 15 years and a teetotaler whos never had alcohol more than once or twice a year at any age.) Anyway, I felt GREAT, and unfortunately started to overcook the training, letting my normal 90 minute sessions spiral outward into 180 and even 240 minute grindfests. I was obsessed with reclaiming a six pack, and underate, underhydrated, and overtrained, ignoring all the warning signs of system collapse. I stopped losing weight, even though I was eating less and working out more, and a few DexaScans revealed that I was putting on body fat in general and visceral fat in particular month after month despite a total lack of sugar intake and a mammoth calorie deficit. I also had what Id call permanent dude PMS, getting irritated by seemingly everything and taking all sorts of trivial slights deeply to heart, and I was fantasizing about food, especially junk food, every night. Sometime in the summer of 2019 I started to have the sleep disturbances, but they were intermittent at first: some mornings Id wake up at 8 and struggle, but I often could get back to sleep, and even when I couldnt, Id be fine the next night. Then, in September, my beloved cat, who Id had for a decade and was the last pet of mine from my bachelor days, was suddenly diagnosed with malignant lymphoma and given six weeks to live. From that day on, I was up at 8 AM every day, no matter what, and couldnt get back to sleep under my own power no matter what I tried. Since then nothing has changed. If I go to bed at my normal time, Im up at 8 AM with what feels like an adrenaline rush, and if I go to bed earlier I wake up earlier and *still* have the 8 AM adrenaline rush (or whatever it is) when Im out and about in my morning routine. The morning wake up is so jarring that sleep vanishes completely, and the idea of just breathing and going back to bed is laughable. The insomnia feelings dont kick in for several hours, but then inevitably hit me like a truck. I tried doxepin for several months and it did help me sleep. Id still wake up at 8 AM with the same horrible energy burst, but the doxepin would overpower it and drag me back down till my normal 10 AM wake up. Unfortunately the doxepin stopped working, but it was obviously treating the symptoms, not the cause, so it was always going to be a band aid and I kinda knew its day would come. Two other notes: * My testosterone is much lower than it used to be. In 2018 (before the overtraining) it was 493 ng/Dl, now its 290. My sex drive/libido is basically zero  the machinery still works, but I never want to turn it on. This has been the case since last summer  about when the insomnia started to creep in  and has not improved in any way. Id love to get my testosterone back, and feel like the insomnia must be related somehow, but I can live without it if need be. The insomnia is a much more pressing issue. * Ive tried a lot of the holistic supplements (Seriphos, holy basil, kava, ashwaghanda), thinking that I was suffering from high cortisol, but none of these has worked, and if anything theyve each had the OPPOSITE effect: they seem to give me heart palpitations and some physical unrest/agitation. Seriphos is particularly rough: if I take it before bed, as most naturopaths suggest, I wake up about three hours later and cant fall back asleep for love or money. Kava used to be one of my favorite relaxants, and now it makes me feel like Im one step closer to a heart attack  tight chest and shortness of breath. (Not nearly extreme enough to require a doctor, of course, but still bad.) My endocrinologist at Kaiser wont run any tests on me beyond a catchall blood panel because my testosterone is still in the normal range, no matter how crazy the loss of libido is, and my TSH level is normal so any thyroid-related insomnia is impossible, a statement which seems flatly contradicted by a lot of the medical literature Ive looked into. I need a better doctor and a place to start  can anyone help? At this point Im ready to bestow half my kingdom  which amounts to a used car, a couch, and a medium sized TV, but hey   on anyone who can save me from this. Follow Report"

New to this great forum and hoping someone here can help me. Im a 38 year old guy, 64, 178 pounds. Ive been having incessant early morning insomnia for months, and am struggling to pinpoint the cause. I should clarify what I mean by early morning: Im a night owl, and have gone to bed at around 2:30 AM for at least the last twenty years. (There was a period of a couple years when I was working on Asian time and had to go to bed even later (4:30 to 5:00 AM), but Im back to my druthers of 2:30 AM.) My body seems to function best on about 7.5 hours of sleep, so if my circadian rhythms are in tune, I go to bed around 2:30 AM and wake up around 10 AM with a song in my heart and hope for the day, but I can function reasonably well on about 6.5-7 hours of sleep *provided that I wake up around 10*. (Waking up at my normal time seems to be more important than going to sleep at my normal time.) But since last summer, Ive been waking up around 8 AM every morning, and with a BANG  not gradual, groggy wakeups, but with a surge of energy and a pounding heart that casts me impossibly out of sleep in an instant. My initial self-diagnosis was that this was some consequence of overcardio and undernutrition. For most of my late 20s and early 30s I was pretty fit, doing HIIT cardio sessions for about 90 minutes a day, 4-5 days a week, and everything was dandy. Work and marriage kept me couchbound for my mid-30s, however, and I grew chubby, sulky, and TIRED  like the less I moved, the more worn out and depressed I got  and I couldnt live with the person I was becoming. For New Years 2019 I resolved to get back into shape, so I resumed the HIIT and radically cleaned up my diet: no sugar, no caffeine, and no flour or refined grain. (Im also a vegan of 15 years and a teetotaler whos never had alcohol more than once or twice a year at any age.) Anyway, I felt GREAT, and unfortunately started to overcook the training, letting my normal 90 minute sessions spiral outward into 180 and even 240 minute grindfests. I was obsessed with reclaiming a six pack, and underate, underhydrated, and overtrained, ignoring all the warning signs of system collapse. I stopped losing weight, even though I was eating less and working out more, and a few DexaScans revealed that I was putting on body fat in general and visceral fat in particular month after month despite a total lack of sugar intake and a mammoth calorie deficit. I also had what Id call permanent dude PMS, getting irritated by seemingly everything and taking all sorts of trivial slights deeply to heart, and I was fantasizing about food, especially junk food, every night. Sometime in the summer of 2019 I started to have the sleep disturbances, but they were intermittent at first: some mornings Id wake up at 8 and struggle, but I often could get back to sleep, and even when I couldnt, Id be fine the next night. Then, in September, my beloved cat, who Id had for a decade and was the last pet of mine from my bachelor days, was suddenly diagnosed with malignant lymphoma and given six weeks to live. From that day on, I was up at 8 AM every day, no matter what, and couldnt get back to sleep under my own power no matter what I tried. Since then nothing has changed. If I go to bed at my normal time, Im up at 8 AM with what feels like an adrenaline rush, and if I go to bed earlier I wake up earlier and *still* have the 8 AM adrenaline rush (or whatever it is) when Im out and about in my morning routine. The morning wake up is so jarring that sleep vanishes completely, and the idea of just breathing and going back to bed is laughable. The insomnia feelings dont kick in for several hours, but then inevitably hit me like a truck. I tried doxepin for several months and it did help me sleep. Id still wake up at 8 AM with the same horrible energy burst, but the doxepin would overpower it and drag me back down till my normal 10 AM wake up. Unfortunately the doxepin stopped working, but it was obviously treating the symptoms, not the cause, so it was always going to be a band aid and I kinda knew its day would come. Two other notes: * My testosterone is much lower than it used to be. In 2018 (before the overtraining) it was 493 ng/Dl, now its 290. My sex drive/libido is basically zero  the machinery still works, but I never want to turn it on. This has been the case since last summer  about when the insomnia started to creep in  and has not improved in any way. Id love to get my testosterone back, and feel like the insomnia must be related somehow, but I can live without it if need be. The insomnia is a much more pressing issue. * Ive tried a lot of the holistic supplements (Seriphos, holy basil, kava, ashwaghanda), thinking that I was suffering from high cortisol, but none of these has worked, and if anything theyve each had the OPPOSITE effect: they seem to give me heart palpitations and some physical unrest/agitation. Seriphos is particularly rough: if I take it before bed, as most naturopaths suggest, I wake up about three hours later and cant fall back asleep for love or money. Kava used to be one of my favorite relaxants, and now it makes me feel like Im one step closer to a heart attack  tight chest and shortness of breath. (Not nearly extreme enough to require a doctor, of course, but still bad.) My endocrinologist at Kaiser wont run any tests on me beyond a catchall blood panel because my testosterone is still in the normal range, no matter how crazy the loss of libido is, and my TSH level is normal so any thyroid-related insomnia is impossible, a statement which seems flatly contradicted by a lot of the medical literature Ive looked into. I need a better doctor and a place to start  can anyone help? At this point Im ready to bestow half my kingdom  which amounts to a used car, a couch, and a medium sized TV, but hey   on anyone who can save me from this. Follow Report"

I did not have a FNA although the clinic wanted me to. (A hospital clinic.) I resisted. But now the time has come for me to go further. I am not feeling particularly sick, but with such a large nodule (almost 2 inches), I realize it could be cancer or something else and I am coming to terms with that. I guess they will want to do a FNA, but I know that is not always a correct indicator of cancer. The endocrinologist wants to do a radioscan of my nearby glands before the FNA. I guess she wants to see if I have nodules elsewhere nearby.I have a couple of questions, but lets say they dont find cancer cells if they give me a FNA.

I take some other meds so it is hard to know if this is the culprit but it is the one I began most recently and seems most likely the cause at least to me. I should probably get tested again but is it possible that even if your TSH is where they want it to be (they tested the free T3, T4 and some other things as well) that this particular medication just doesn't agree with me?

I was told to follow up with my regular doctor in three months, which I just did, to have another cortisol test. My doctor said if it came back low again I would be referred to an endocrinologist. This time it came back a 4.8, even lower than last time. Blood was drawn at 8:30am. However, I just got a letter from my doctor saying my cortisol looks like its back within normal range, with the reference range listed at 4.8-20. Can someone maybe explain to me how the reference range changed? This isnt me being sarcastic, I genuinely want to know how the reference range could change like that. I know cortisol levels vary throughout the day but I was told they are supposed to be highest that early in the morning or something like that. Im too afraid to ask my doctor about it because I have gone through so many doctors now trying to figure out what is wrong and I dont want my doctor to think Im a hypochondriac or something so I figured I would ask here.

I'm having some very strange and unsettling episodes in the middle of the night, during sleep, that feel like a cross between a hypoglycemic episode and tremors/vibrations, but my body isn't visibly shaking, i'm shaking on the inside? They wake me up by what I assume is adrenaline, but my heart isn't racing, just a light jolt that arouses me. These began last April after a rather taxing ski mountaineering excursion where I suffered sun poisoning with facial swelling. The onset of these episodes where either coincidental, or a resultI'm not sure. Because of my hypoglycemic history, I immediately check my sugars when this wakes me as it feels quite similar to a low, but I'm usually in the 70's and fine. I keep a very, very strict diet to avoid lows and have learned to manage my RH quite well, with remaining active.

Two years ago this month I noticed the beginning of facial swelling. It started on both eyelids and then migrated to both cheeks and then to my Parotid glands. Within two months my face was noticeably puffy and swollen. To this day, the facial swelling is still there and NO other parts of my body have been affected. Initial trips to my primary care physician, Emergency Room visits, two ENTs and an allergist yielded zero results and no opinions of what was possibly wrong. Following that I made the decision to go to a holistic doctor. He ran multiple blood tests, allergy tests(high yeast count which prompted him to put me on the Candida diet; this did nothing), thyroid tests (low Normal results, he suggested Synthroid but recommended the diet initially). Acknowledging that there may be something bigger than he could handle he recommended me to a special diagnostic clinic at Emory Hospital in Atlanta. The unit at Emory consisted of a number of specialists who saw patients with undiagnosed conditions. The disciplines they represented included; ENT, Hematologist, Rheumatologist, Endocrinologist, Immunologist. Over the course of three months I had individual appointments with each group. The bloodwork that each doctor ordered came back with no indication of any illness outside of a low white blood count and low platelet count. As part of this process I also had chest x-rays, biopsy of sub-mandibular gland, head and neck CT scan, Bone marrow biopsy which also came back normal. I left Emory because they told me that they couldnt identify what was wrong with me and frankly didnt have any defined next steps. I then decided to go to an infectious disease doctor and all of the tests that were run came back negative; Lymes disease, infections etc The doctor could clearly see my facial swelling and she recommended that I go back to a rheumatologist, which I did. The Rheumy, who I have been going to for the last 5 months, reviewed all of my past history of blood test results and previous doctors notes. He diagnosed me with what he termed an immune deficiency which he felt was manifesting as an auto-immune disease, even though all my blood work never revealed any markers for any known auto-immune diseases and I dont exhibit any symptoms from the neck down. He prescribed a course of Prednisone over a 6-week period/20mg/10mg/5mg (facial swelling was extremely responsive and face looked normal BUT swelling returned within three days of going off the steroids). He then prescribed plaquenol with a low dose of prednisone(5mg) which I have been on for 90 days now and the swelling has not gone away. My Rheumy has mentioned going on either, Azathioprine, Methatrexate or Sulfasalazine to see what that would do but I have opted not to because I feel that I need a valid diagnosis prior to taking any drug like that. I am not sure if this is truly a rheumatological or an endocrine issue. I have exhibited zero markers for a rheumatological disease and only a low normal for thyroid disease.

I have had live-changing, wicked fatigue for 2 years. It has also happened in my twenties and 1 year in my thirties. This round hit at age 43. I was working full-time, working out, and loving life. I had an endocrine work-up and was told everything was negative except for reactive hypoglycemia. However, in doing my own research (from reputable medical sources), I have found some things that contradict what my endo told me. He thinks my symptoms are related to elevated Epstein-Barr titers. However, I was told by an infectious disease doctor that I do not have EBV. So, the endo recommended Mayo Clinic. Has anyone had experience with going to Mayo for these symptoms (extreme fatigue, hypoglycemia, salt cravings, increased thirst, decrease appetite)? It seems like most doctors just write it off as depression, not exercising, not eating right. But I'm probably one of the few patients that actually eats tofu and sardines!

I've been dealing with dizziness, nausea, and fatigue for about 2 years. Went to my PCP a couple of times but he basically said get more rest.

However, I started going to specialists, one after another looking for answers. In that time, a friend my same age (44 yrs) passed away from stomach cancer.

I was waiting for test results, afraid of the answers, not getting answers, rinse and repeat. At one point I was having multiple panic attacks a day.

Ive been through the wringer as Im sure we all have. Im new to this community so if someone could direct me to the right forum or. Connect me to similar users that would be incredible. Here is my situation. Several years ago I started having low blood sugar. I passed out and got carted off in an ambulance. I also have a heart arrhythmia and the symptoms are similar. Sweaty, nausea, pale clammy skin. Might pass out. Hard to tell the difference between the two if you arent used to it. So the first time it happened I went and laid down like I usually do when Im having palpitations. Woke up in an ambulance with low blood sugar. Took me almost 2 years to get to an endocrinologist and he ran a lot of tests on me. During this time I started gaining weight despite a healthy diet. My cortisol levels were normal most of the time. But I had persistently high acth. He decided to do a glucose implant. My blood sugar was low 24/7 sometimes dangerously. He decided my pancreas must be making too much insulin but the excess acth made no sense so he referred me to a doctor at a state hospital who teaches endocrinology. This doctor also ran a bajillion tests. Through him I found out I have a growth or possible hyperplasia on my left adrenal gland only. I also have a flattened pituitary gland. And my acth is continued to be elevated. Nor did it suppress during a long high dose dexamethasone supression test. He suspected that I had an ectopic production of acth but my ct scan didnt find anything in my chest. Meanwhile Ive gained 80 pounds in the last year and my energy had tanked to nothing. I also have extreme cold spells where my temperature drops and I need multiple blankets to bring my temperature back up. I now have chronic mild abdominal pain, Indigestion, nausea and low appetite. In my last labs in early December my thyroid was normal but my electrolytes werent and my calcium was low. This is where Im at. Currently waiting for insurance to decide my fate. Scared to be honest. This whole situation has spiraled and I feel worse and worse the more time passes. Im also nervous about waiting 6 months to be seen at mayo. I had an appointment last week but couldnt get insurance to get their act together in time. Ugh. Such a stressful situation. Thank you all for listening and understanding. Heck even if no one reads just typing it all out in a place I know other people might understand felt nice. Thank you Liked by Teresa, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

Lots of problems, Many years now. Please help","Hello Community, I have just joined the discussions board. I have had health problems for 20 years now and really need help with my endocrine situation. Can I start at the beginning? 20 years ago I was extremely healthy, active, thin, energetic, was in the military, ran twice a day. Somehow it has all changed. I am a bloated shell of the woman I was back then. Completely different. I am having problems getting diagnoses and treatment. 1998 Sexual assault with strangulation. Some issues after this. My hair grew lank and fell out some within the next month. Anxiety/depression started. Dysphagia. 2000 I left the military. I had a very fast weight gain of about 25 or 30 lbs within 6 months due to stopping my running regimen. Still felt fairly good though. Just had a larger waistline. Labs show cholesterol very high though I eat moderately healthy. 2004 Had less energy, but health still fair to good. Did notice hormonal problems start. Was shocked to find long hairs growing where us girls shouldn't get hair like that 2006 Abdominal pain, more hormonal problems, heavy periods. Was in the ER, they did a transvaginal ultrasound, large cyst on ovary, was diagnosed PCOS. But no treatment, no followup. Had labs done, told them my hormones were not right. They tested estrogen and testosterone and those were completely normal. Was also in ER for dizziness. 2008 More changes. My weight had stayed at about 40 lbs over my healthy weight for years now. No amount of dieting or exercise could change my weight. My hair texture had slowly changed over the years. From sleek, smooth and straight blonde, to dry, thin, breakable, frizzy, whispy and darker. My skin changed, it was now very thin, dry and cracked. If I bump a doorway or anything, my hand or arms will bleed. The bottom of my feet have deep cracks that I cannot heal. My facial appearance changed. My chin was square, my face puffy, my eyelids droop, features are coarsened. I feel very worn out. I have problems getting out of bed or out of the chair. Exhaustion. Had a massive grand mal seizure, was in the hospital. No explanation for it. I begin to be extremely heat intolerant. If it is more than 90 degrees I am sick, sick, sick 2010 Many more health problems cropping up including worsened hormonal issues. My scalp is always heavy with wax, even if I wash my hair daily. Hair is sparse and looks fried out. Face is round. Body proportions are ""off"". I am very round in the middle and shoulders but thin in arms and legs. Begin to be sick when I try to eat. Fatigue. Dizziness. Trouble driving because I get very dizzy. Arthritis in hip from old injury 2011 I try to get care from different doctors. My hormonal complaints fall on dead ears. Abdominal pain. Very heavy periods to the point of getting iron deficient anemia. Trouble concentrating. Trouble sleeping. I crave salt in a bad way. When I fall asleep, I sleep walk to the kitchen and wake up eating salty chips or just out of the salt shaker. Aches and pains. Diagnosed fibromyalgia. 2014 There is a new weight loss clinic and I go with high hopes. I am 40 lbs overweight, all in the middle, like a 6 month pregnant body. I tell them my issues, they just keep telling me I need portion control. I tell them I eat way less than 1200 calories a day. I get nowhere at the weight loss clinic. More reproductive problems. Extreme fatigue. Am diagnosed ""borderline"" type 2 diabetes, and insulin resistance. I am put on metformin and my a1c drops 2016 It is summer and I feel extremely bad. I go to a walkin clinic with severe dizziness and am given motion sickness pills and kicked out. Then a few days later, my kidneys fail. I have to have emergency surgery and a stent put in. A few months later I have another seizure, and drop a tray of glasses, and am cut up. Still trying to work, but barely. Severe emotional issues. Severe exhaustion. I do fairly okay early in the morning, but by noon or a little later I am completely wiped out. I get weird problems like muscle tics or mini-seizures, I lose sensation in my arms or legs, me legs give out, I fall now, I am clumsy. I break a toe, I break a finger during falls. Doctors try to medicate me, but strangely, I am very sensitive to meds now. If I get a flu shot, or an antibiotic, it doesnt matter, I cant tell what side effects I might have from a med. I get very sick from an antibiotic and back in ER 2017 I am in and out of the emergency room and urgent care clinics. in November, I begin getting terrible pain in my lower left abdomen. This pain goes on non-stop for months until in May of 2018 I finally have surgery and a large fibroid removed, the left ovary with the large cyst removed, and have an ablation done to stop the heavy bleeding. Sept 2017, chest pain, and left shoulder pain. Cardiology visits. Potassium is low. I stop working when palpitations, chest pain, and exhaustion become too much. 2018 After all these years of hormonal problems, I am finally tested for Cushings / cortisol. It is hard to get endocrine care in my small town. The Dr even recommends I go somewhere else. Cortisol tests at 80mcg/ 24 hr. Way more than the standard of 0-50mcg. The hospital is sick and tired of me going in there. They even make fun of me if I try to walk in the door. I look up Cushing's disease and have every symptom. I wonder why I was never tested or diagnosed before. The doctor does not know where the cortisol is originating from. Pituitary or adrenal. But even with my body ravaged by the high cortisol, I am not given any treatment, just 6 month followups. Nov 2018 I write to Mayo clinic in AZ and am told they are not taking people with my conditions who are on state insurance. So I am here now. Very sick. Jobless. Exhausted, dizzy, in pain. Does anyone else have Cushings? How did they diagnose where it was originating from? What was the treatment? Should I be on treatment now? I don't even recognize myself anymore  Follow Report"

Lots of problems, Many years now. Please help","Hello Community, I have just joined the discussions board. I have had health problems for 20 years now and really need help with my endocrine situation. Can I start at the beginning? 20 years ago I was extremely healthy, active, thin, energetic, was in the military, ran twice a day. Somehow it has all changed. I am a bloated shell of the woman I was back then. Completely different. I am having problems getting diagnoses and treatment. 1998 Sexual assault with strangulation. Some issues after this. My hair grew lank and fell out some within the next month. Anxiety/depression started. Dysphagia. 2000 I left the military. I had a very fast weight gain of about 25 or 30 lbs within 6 months due to stopping my running regimen. Still felt fairly good though. Just had a larger waistline. Labs show cholesterol very high though I eat moderately healthy. 2004 Had less energy, but health still fair to good. Did notice hormonal problems start. Was shocked to find long hairs growing where us girls shouldn't get hair like that 2006 Abdominal pain, more hormonal problems, heavy periods. Was in the ER, they did a transvaginal ultrasound, large cyst on ovary, was diagnosed PCOS. But no treatment, no followup. Had labs done, told them my hormones were not right. They tested estrogen and testosterone and those were completely normal. Was also in ER for dizziness. 2008 More changes. My weight had stayed at about 40 lbs over my healthy weight for years now. No amount of dieting or exercise could change my weight. My hair texture had slowly changed over the years. From sleek, smooth and straight blonde, to dry, thin, breakable, frizzy, whispy and darker. My skin changed, it was now very thin, dry and cracked. If I bump a doorway or anything, my hand or arms will bleed. The bottom of my feet have deep cracks that I cannot heal. My facial appearance changed. My chin was square, my face puffy, my eyelids droop, features are coarsened. I feel very worn out. I have problems getting out of bed or out of the chair. Exhaustion. Had a massive grand mal seizure, was in the hospital. No explanation for it. I begin to be extremely heat intolerant. If it is more than 90 degrees I am sick, sick, sick 2010 Many more health problems cropping up including worsened hormonal issues. My scalp is always heavy with wax, even if I wash my hair daily. Hair is sparse and looks fried out. Face is round. Body proportions are ""off"". I am very round in the middle and shoulders but thin in arms and legs. Begin to be sick when I try to eat. Fatigue. Dizziness. Trouble driving because I get very dizzy. Arthritis in hip from old injury 2011 I try to get care from different doctors. My hormonal complaints fall on dead ears. Abdominal pain. Very heavy periods to the point of getting iron deficient anemia. Trouble concentrating. Trouble sleeping. I crave salt in a bad way. When I fall asleep, I sleep walk to the kitchen and wake up eating salty chips or just out of the salt shaker. Aches and pains. Diagnosed fibromyalgia. 2014 There is a new weight loss clinic and I go with high hopes. I am 40 lbs overweight, all in the middle, like a 6 month pregnant body. I tell them my issues, they just keep telling me I need portion control. I tell them I eat way less than 1200 calories a day. I get nowhere at the weight loss clinic. More reproductive problems. Extreme fatigue. Am diagnosed ""borderline"" type 2 diabetes, and insulin resistance. I am put on metformin and my a1c drops 2016 It is summer and I feel extremely bad. I go to a walkin clinic with severe dizziness and am given motion sickness pills and kicked out. Then a few days later, my kidneys fail. I have to have emergency surgery and a stent put in. A few months later I have another seizure, and drop a tray of glasses, and am cut up. Still trying to work, but barely. Severe emotional issues. Severe exhaustion. I do fairly okay early in the morning, but by noon or a little later I am completely wiped out. I get weird problems like muscle tics or mini-seizures, I lose sensation in my arms or legs, me legs give out, I fall now, I am clumsy. I break a toe, I break a finger during falls. Doctors try to medicate me, but strangely, I am very sensitive to meds now. If I get a flu shot, or an antibiotic, it doesnt matter, I cant tell what side effects I might have from a med. I get very sick from an antibiotic and back in ER 2017 I am in and out of the emergency room and urgent care clinics. in November, I begin getting terrible pain in my lower left abdomen. This pain goes on non-stop for months until in May of 2018 I finally have surgery and a large fibroid removed, the left ovary with the large cyst removed, and have an ablation done to stop the heavy bleeding. Sept 2017, chest pain, and left shoulder pain. Cardiology visits. Potassium is low. I stop working when palpitations, chest pain, and exhaustion become too much. 2018 After all these years of hormonal problems, I am finally tested for Cushings / cortisol. It is hard to get endocrine care in my small town. The Dr even recommends I go somewhere else. Cortisol tests at 80mcg/ 24 hr. Way more than the standard of 0-50mcg. The hospital is sick and tired of me going in there. They even make fun of me if I try to walk in the door. I look up Cushing's disease and have every symptom. I wonder why I was never tested or diagnosed before. The doctor does not know where the cortisol is originating from. Pituitary or adrenal. But even with my body ravaged by the high cortisol, I am not given any treatment, just 6 month followups. Nov 2018 I write to Mayo clinic in AZ and am told they are not taking people with my conditions who are on state insurance. So I am here now. Very sick. Jobless. Exhausted, dizzy, in pain.

Doctors try to medicate me, but strangely, I am very sensitive to meds now. If I get a flu shot, or an antibiotic, it doesnt matter, I cant tell what side effects I might have from a med. I get very sick from an antibiotic and back in ER 2017 I am in and out of the emergency room and urgent care clinics. in November, I begin getting terrible pain in my lower left abdomen. This pain goes on non-stop for months until in May of 2018 I finally have surgery and a large fibroid removed, the left ovary with the large cyst removed, and have an ablation done to stop the heavy bleeding. Sept 2017, chest pain, and left shoulder pain. Cardiology visits. Potassium is low. I stop working when palpitations, chest pain, and exhaustion become too much. 2018 After all these years of hormonal problems, I am finally tested for Cushings / cortisol. It is hard to get endocrine care in my small town. The Dr even recommends I go somewhere else. Cortisol tests at 80mcg/ 24 hr. Way more than the standard of 0-50mcg. The hospital is sick and tired of me going in there. They even make fun of me if I try to walk in the door. I look up Cushing's disease and have every symptom. I wonder why I was never tested or diagnosed before. The doctor does not know where the cortisol is originating from. Pituitary or adrenal. But even with my body ravaged by the high cortisol, I am not given any treatment, just 6 month followups. Nov 2018 I write to Mayo clinic in AZ and am told they are not taking people with my conditions who are on state insurance. So I am here now. Very sick. Jobless. Exhausted, dizzy, in pain. Does anyone else have Cushings? How did they diagnose where it was originating from? What was the treatment? Should I be on treatment now? I don't even recognize myself anymore  Follow Report"

Lots of problems, Many years now. Please help","Hello Community, I have just joined the discussions board. I have had health problems for 20 years now and really need help with my endocrine situation. Can I start at the beginning? 20 years ago I was extremely healthy, active, thin, energetic, was in the military, ran twice a day. Somehow it has all changed. I am a bloated shell of the woman I was back then. Completely different. I am having problems getting diagnoses and treatment. 1998 Sexual assault with strangulation. Some issues after this. My hair grew lank and fell out some within the next month. Anxiety/depression started. Dysphagia. 2000 I left the military. I had a very fast weight gain of about 25 or 30 lbs within 6 months due to stopping my running regimen. Still felt fairly good though. Just had a larger waistline. Labs show cholesterol very high though I eat moderately healthy. 2004 Had less energy, but health still fair to good. Did notice hormonal problems start. Was shocked to find long hairs growing where us girls shouldn't get hair like that 2006 Abdominal pain, more hormonal problems, heavy periods. Was in the ER, they did a transvaginal ultrasound, large cyst on ovary, was diagnosed PCOS. But no treatment, no followup. Had labs done, told them my hormones were not right. They tested estrogen and testosterone and those were completely normal. Was also in ER for dizziness. 2008 More changes. My weight had stayed at about 40 lbs over my healthy weight for years now. No amount of dieting or exercise could change my weight. My hair texture had slowly changed over the years. From sleek, smooth and straight blonde, to dry, thin, breakable, frizzy, whispy and darker. My skin changed, it was now very thin, dry and cracked. If I bump a doorway or anything, my hand or arms will bleed. The bottom of my feet have deep cracks that I cannot heal. My facial appearance changed. My chin was square, my face puffy, my eyelids droop, features are coarsened. I feel very worn out. I have problems getting out of bed or out of the chair. Exhaustion. Had a massive grand mal seizure, was in the hospital. No explanation for it. I begin to be extremely heat intolerant. If it is more than 90 degrees I am sick, sick, sick 2010 Many more health problems cropping up including worsened hormonal issues. My scalp is always heavy with wax, even if I wash my hair daily. Hair is sparse and looks fried out. Face is round. Body proportions are ""off"". I am very round in the middle and shoulders but thin in arms and legs. Begin to be sick when I try to eat. Fatigue. Dizziness. Trouble driving because I get very dizzy. Arthritis in hip from old injury 2011 I try to get care from different doctors. My hormonal complaints fall on dead ears. Abdominal pain. Very heavy periods to the point of getting iron deficient anemia. Trouble concentrating. Trouble sleeping. I crave salt in a bad way. When I fall asleep, I sleep walk to the kitchen and wake up eating salty chips or just out of the salt shaker. Aches and pains. Diagnosed fibromyalgia. 2014 There is a new weight loss clinic and I go with high hopes. I am 40 lbs overweight, all in the middle, like a 6 month pregnant body. I tell them my issues, they just keep telling me I need portion control. I tell them I eat way less than 1200 calories a day. I get nowhere at the weight loss clinic. More reproductive problems. Extreme fatigue. Am diagnosed ""borderline"" type 2 diabetes, and insulin resistance. I am put on metformin and my a1c drops 2016 It is summer and I feel extremely bad. I go to a walkin clinic with severe dizziness and am given motion sickness pills and kicked out. Then a few days later, my kidneys fail. I have to have emergency surgery and a stent put in. A few months later I have another seizure, and drop a tray of glasses, and am cut up. Still trying to work, but barely. Severe emotional issues. Severe exhaustion.

Hair is sparse and looks fried out. Face is round. Body proportions are ""off"". I am very round in the middle and shoulders but thin in arms and legs. Begin to be sick when I try to eat. Fatigue. Dizziness. Trouble driving because I get very dizzy. Arthritis in hip from old injury 2011 I try to get care from different doctors. My hormonal complaints fall on dead ears. Abdominal pain. Very heavy periods to the point of getting iron deficient anemia. Trouble concentrating. Trouble sleeping. I crave salt in a bad way. When I fall asleep, I sleep walk to the kitchen and wake up eating salty chips or just out of the salt shaker. Aches and pains. Diagnosed fibromyalgia. 2014 There is a new weight loss clinic and I go with high hopes. I am 40 lbs overweight, all in the middle, like a 6 month pregnant body. I tell them my issues, they just keep telling me I need portion control. I tell them I eat way less than 1200 calories a day. I get nowhere at the weight loss clinic. More reproductive problems. Extreme fatigue. Am diagnosed ""borderline"" type 2 diabetes, and insulin resistance. I am put on metformin and my a1c drops 2016 It is summer and I feel extremely bad. I go to a walkin clinic with severe dizziness and am given motion sickness pills and kicked out. Then a few days later, my kidneys fail. I have to have emergency surgery and a stent put in. A few months later I have another seizure, and drop a tray of glasses, and am cut up. Still trying to work, but barely. Severe emotional issues. Severe exhaustion. I do fairly okay early in the morning, but by noon or a little later I am completely wiped out. I get weird problems like muscle tics or mini-seizures, I lose sensation in my arms or legs, me legs give out, I fall now, I am clumsy. I break a toe, I break a finger during falls. Doctors try to medicate me, but strangely, I am very sensitive to meds now. If I get a flu shot, or an antibiotic, it doesnt matter, I cant tell what side effects I might have from a med. I get very sick from an antibiotic and back in ER 2017 I am in and out of the emergency room and urgent care clinics. in November, I begin getting terrible pain in my lower left abdomen. This pain goes on non-stop for months until in May of 2018 I finally have surgery and a large fibroid removed, the left ovary with the large cyst removed, and have an ablation done to stop the heavy bleeding. Sept 2017, chest pain, and left shoulder pain. Cardiology visits. Potassium is low. I stop working when palpitations, chest pain, and exhaustion become too much. 2018 After all these years of hormonal problems, I am finally tested for Cushings / cortisol. It is hard to get endocrine care in my small town. The Dr even recommends I go somewhere else. Cortisol tests at 80mcg/ 24 hr. Way more than the standard of 0-50mcg. The hospital is sick and tired of me going in there. They even make fun of me if I try to walk in the door. I look up Cushing's disease and have every symptom. I wonder why I was never tested or diagnosed before. The doctor does not know where the cortisol is originating from. Pituitary or adrenal. But even with my body ravaged by the high cortisol, I am not given any treatment, just 6 month followups. Nov 2018 I write to Mayo clinic in AZ and am told they are not taking people with my conditions who are on state insurance. So I am here now. Very sick. Jobless. Exhausted, dizzy, in pain. Does anyone else have Cushings? How did they diagnose where it was originating from? What was the treatment? Should I be on treatment now? I don't even recognize myself anymore  Follow Report"

At first I thought she may be depressed, but I asked for a number of blood tests, including TSH. I have Hashimoto's (and 2 other autoimmune disorders). Her TSH came back at 3.43 (high end of normal on non age or gender specific range), but the median for 15-18 is 1.7. So, next the doc ordered free T3 and free T4. Oddly, they are also on the high end of or above normal. T3 is 6.2 and T4 is 19. Today we went for a thyroid antibodies blood test. Her symptoms are definitely hypo and not hyper. Doc is referring to an endocrinologist, but has no idea how long that will take. Follow Report"

Years ago I had a doctor tell me I was insulin resistant. He said it in passing like it wasn't any big deal and never said another word about it. So, not knowing alot about it I just assumed I needed to watch what a ate a little better, cut out the cokes and M&Ms and I would be good. I have had other doctors since then and new endocrinologists who periodically check my blood glucose levels when they run other tests and always say everything looks good. But for the past year when I eat anything, especially in the morning but anytime I haven't eaten in several hours that is carb heavy like toast, within a very short time I crashlike can't keep my eyes open have to lay down kind of crash. When I wake up I am always so dehydrated and crave salt, anything with salt. Can someone please educate me a little in this? No one in my family has or has ever had blood sugar issues and it's not like you can search ""carb crash sleep with salt cravings."" Thanks in advance. Liked by chocolate5lover Follow Report"

Complete numbness in toes I have to put them in warm/hot water at least 1 a day. Occasionally chest pains which have been diagnosed as pericardidtis seems to flare up if I dont take diuretics. Also have a small tissue on a valve in heart that seems to stay stable. Ive also started gaining weight around my waist at a crazy rate. So my conversation is, Ive been a mess since 2011 only seem to be getting worse. I have seen. Cardiology, GI specialist, rheumatologist, endocrinologist, ENT, neurologist and my pcp. numerous scans and blood tests. Almost everthing comes back abnormal but not enough to do anything about. So I just keep getting scanned and my blood drawn while all these drs just wait. I understand for some of these issues thats what they think is best. Just unbelievably frustrated and sad I have 3 children and cant work we are all very happy and have a wonderful life besides my health issues, some days Im just over it all and feel depressed and helpless I just want to beg anyone for help. I eat very healthy do low impact exercise for at least 20min a day. Drink plenty of water take vitamins. I do what I can. Follow Report"

She wants to put me on a prescription vitamin D pill, and have me do B12 shots every two weeks for three months (I had been on a B12 oral supplement the month of August, but this most recent reading was even lower  200 on 10/5 vs. 281 on 8/2). When I mention this, she tells me she suspects I'm not absorbing it, possibly because I'm on Pantoprazole, which is why the supplement didn't help and she wants me to do shots. Ok, cool. I have her fax the order and results to my primary care to get the shots there since I'm closer. But when I talk to my primary care doctor today, she says no, she she doesn't want me to take the shots, I should do two tablets daily. I try to explain to the nurse the other doctor's reasoning on the shots, or offer to give her the phone number to call the other doctor, but I just get a call back that ""Nope, she wants me to take two tablets daily and retest in four weeks."" What on earth are you supposed to do when two of your doctors disagree on treatment?! Any advice on how to get the two of them to just talk to each other and come to a consensus on what they want me to do, or anyone with experience with B12 shots vs. tablets? I'm just too tired to deal with this nonsense! Liked by Teresa, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

I found this website and hoping someone may have some suggestions. Issue # 1  Low PTH level with normal Calcium level. o Discovered in 2008 prior to a total thyroidectomy which was done due to nodules in 3 of the 4 lobes that were large enough to cause issues with swallowing. o I have not been able to find information on causes of low PTH with a normal calcium, and one of my endocrinologist was at a loss as well. Issue # 2  Elevated ACTH with elevated Urinary Free Cortisol and salivary cortisol. o This has been investigated at two of the top healthcare organizations in the country and no reason has been found, after many different tests like MRI, CT, PET scan, octreotide scan, Dexamethasone suppression test, etc. o This has been elevated since 2012. o Both doctors at these organizations have told me they had not ever seen anything like this before. The missing part of the puzzle in order to be able to diagnosis me with Cushings is to find a tumor, however no one has been able to find a tumor or determine the source of why these have been elevated. Issue # 3  Developed hypoglycemia problems. o This started end of 2015 where blood glucose all the sudden drops, sometimes in the 20s. o This has been investigated from review of diet issues, to a gastric emptying study, to a glucose tolerance test (2hour glucose was low at 64), insulin levels, etc. o Currently again as with the above two issues no explanation as to the cause. I have been a Type 2 Diabetic since 2008, but diet controlled for the last 4 years, with last A1C of 5.0. Issue # 4  Elevated testosterone, and SBHG. o This has been elevated off and on since 2012, which was one of the things that lead to finding out about the ACTH and cortisol levels. o At last check in November this was high again. The total testosterone was almost 1500, which is 160% of the highest allowed at the lab, and the SBHG was over 600. I have been scanned in so many different ways but so far the doctors have not been able to find a tumor or other reason for all of these different abnormalitys. It seems to me that the control functions and/or feedback mechanisms in my endocrine system are having all sorts of issues with keeping my hormones regulated. I have been on Synthroid since 2008 following my thyroidectomy with my TSH levels being evaluated regularly and it has been stable throughout all this. My self-education over the years leads me to believe that the issues have to do with my hypothalamus and/or pituitary. My reasoning is because almost all of these hormones can be traced back to these two glands in their feedback loop.

Ive had one stim test and it was abnormal. She wants to do another 30 days out from the kenalog. She started me on hydrocort and it has helped some. However I am draggy and my body feels heavy. The weirdness of all of it besides the obvious is I havent lost weight. I havent been eating very much, and usually dont feel like eating anything until about noon, but my weight has stayed stable. I have so many questions and there is so little information and it all seems so complicated and overwhelming. Has anyone else been diagnosed with SAI that didnt lose weight?

By the way this all started when I got on an elliptical for 10 minutes. My heart rate shot up and my entire chest cavity exploded with pain. That chest pain lasted for nearly two weeks and was not heart disease related. I had that checked out because of my history.

I also wear socks at all times so that if I step on something and my foot bleeds Im going to see it (white short crew socks at night). Its funny looking back at the incident but it was a little scary when it happened, especially when the paramedics were taking me out of the house on a stretcher and wanted to cover my head with a blanket to keep the sleet off my head. I saw my neighbors lights on and told the paramedics please dont cover me up  dont want the neighbors to get the wrong idea. Anyone else have any taking care of the feet tips?

Im not sure what way is bestpills or powder mixed with water. I read the entry of turmeric with synthroid, but what about a diabetic taking it to help with joint pain? I have taken glucosamine, and that helps a little bit, but people who take turmeric say it basically does away with the pain. I know its not a cure, but if it helps the pain, I would like to try it. I read where turmeric has to have pepper with it. I know there are quacks and faux products, but the good ones are natural, herbal and have been used for years for joint pain and other problems.

Anyone out there who has had. A diabetic coma and knows ther course of treatment and how long it takes to have normal sugars Liked by Gail, Alumna Mentor Follow Report"

However, he told me he was unable to facilitate the test, and that I may have to go to Mayo to get it done. Since the supervised fast only involves blood work and observation this seemed strange to me. However, after checking with several local doctors and hospitals, I have been informed that none of them will conduct the test, due to the inherent risks (severe symptoms induced by hypoglycemia). Basically it sounds like they are concerned about liability. How common is it for patients to come to Mayo for specific testing (pre-diagnosis)? Ive read that a doctors referral goes a long way towards expediting the appointment process. Does this apply in this sort of scenario as well? Also, if there is anyone reading this who has been tested for or diagnosed with an insulinoma, I would love to hear how coordinating the testing worked for you. A little history: I am a 27 year old female. For 2 1/2 years now I have been experiencing periodic episodes of low blood sugar during fasting. Each is accompanied by symptoms (hunger, shakiness, dizziness, palpitations, clumsiness, tingling, nausea, headache, abdominal discomfort, confusion), and relieved by glucose administration. When the episodes first began, they were very frequent, and waking me up from sleep. I had to get up every few hours to have a snack. Since then I have since been able to reduce and manage them by strictly adhering to a low glycemic index diet and eating small meals every 2-3 hours. Follow Report"

Swollen all over, fat up top, buffalo hump, supra-ventricular fat pads, horible stretch marks all over. Red face which is now forming little vericose veins. I havent been able to wear my wedding ring for 3 year. My shoe size has gone from 7 1/2 narrow to 8 wide. I hardle ever eat. I should not be fat. I have crushing fatigue ALL the TIME!!! I have a sleep disorder, multiple arousals during the night so I get no deep sleep. I have hypnogogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis, not to mention dreaming bad dreams ALL night EVERY night. I have tachycardia. RHR 90-110 all the time. I went to an ENT today for swollen glands and my BP was 130/90. I usually have a dastolic around 70.All I want to do is sleep. I am weak and have no energy. I cnat even get my house cleaned anymore. I am missing out on my kids lives. I have been thrown from doctor to doctor. I have been diagnosed with SR-MDD and anxiety. I am on meds (no steroids). I have migrains all the time about 4-5 a week. I was told today by the ENT that he sees nothing alarming with my swollen glands, he said that I have a lump of myositis? at the base of my skull (inflammation of muscle fibers). Check back in 2 months. My PCP has ordered a complete metabolic panel, checking for mono, thyroid, and cortisol levels. I have all of this in the past. All inconclusive. But over the past year my body shape has changed DRAMATICALLY! And my energy level is CRAP. And I feel sick ALL THE TIME!! I have fever spikes throughout the dday. I am normal temp then BAM 101! Then back down. I am so freakin frustrated and sick of being told nothing is wrong with you! They say diet and exercise. Well I have done that, Weight Watchers, Atkins, Cabbage Soup Diet, Jenny Craig. Jogging, recently P90X with diet. I will lose about 6-8 pounds and it comes right back. I used to have a waist with more fat distributed in my hips and butt. This past year my thighs and but have shrunk and I have become a fat blob up top. I am humiliated. This change occured while I was jogging 2 miles a day and drinking a ton of water. I dont know what to do. I feel like I am rapidly falling apart. I am afraid if someone doesnt take me seriously and figure out what is going on I will be dead soon. I want to LIVE AGAIN! I WANT TO WATCH MY GIRLS GROW UP! I WANT TO LIVE A LONG HEALTHY LIFE WITH MY HUSBAND. I NEEEEEEED HELP!!!! SOMEBODY PLEEEAAASE HELP ME!!!!! PLEASE! Follow Report"

So far Ive been to several doctors. My original treatment plan was Levothyroxine and Levothyronine (thyroid hormone) along with other hormones and supplements. I was put on 10K of Vitamin D3, DHEA, testesterone, estrodial, etc. I am no longer on that much of a regime. Our family had aleady been to a nutritionist before the diagnosis and were well on our way to improving our general health & diet. Ive read the book, Thyroid Power by Shames & Shames, which is a great resource (also a book called, The Thyroid Diet, which has some good information). When I learned of the classic thyroid symptoms, I realized I have experienced many of them all my life. In the late 80s, I had a hysterectomy for fibroids & excessive bleeding/clotting/enemia. I wonder now if that condition was really undetected thyroid issues? I am 61, I have studied and practiced good nutrition (as it has evolved over the years) most of my adult life. I have had weight issues since my first child was born in 1968. I had a kidney infection with that pregnancy, and in about the 7th month had kidney XRay and had an allergic reaction to the contact dye I was given to drink beforehand. I never gave it much more thought. I tried using iodine about a year ago, on the advice of a healing practioner, and had a funny, allergic reaction to it (1 drop in water!) and so discontinued . . . . (my face heated up, chest got all red and I felt sweaty and stressed) so I do have some kind of sensitivity to iodine. She suggested later that I might have been needing more iodine, not allergic to it but I have not explored it any further at this point! Sometime in May 2011, I think, I switched from the synthetic Levothyroxine to Armour (natural harmone derived from pig thyroid). In June 2011, I had two incidents  first, I had a bad fall off of a porch step onto concrete (shocking) and about a week later, my first recognizable Thyroid Storm and experienced scary heart palpatations and ended up in the ER overnight for observation. My pulse went up to 126. . . normally for me its around 94-100 (still high but not nearly as scary!). When I was first diagnosed with Hashomotos Thyroiditis, my labwork showed that my antibodies were 59 (high). During the Thyroid Storm the bloodwork showed they were at 186. This shows that ones autimmune system is attacking the thyroid. The naturopath prescribed a Thyroid Tincture (combo of healing herbe) which I feel did a good job of reducing the pulse and quieting the antibody activity (though I dont at this point understand exactly how that works with the tincture?). I was grateful to have that to take 3x/day during the worst of the storm. I still am very new to this disorder and some of it is confusing to me. Would sure help to hear from others who are going thru similar issues with thyroid, especially those who have more experience with it than I and some suggestions or resources, and have things to share about the mainstream medical or alternative medical points of view. I feel I have some important decisions to make soon and need all the information I can gather. Hopefully some of this will be helpful to others. I want to point out the subject of being an overweight person most of my adult life, dealing with symptoms I didnt always understand (like edema, depression, weight gain, insomnia for instance), and the stress physically, and distress of feeling judged for my appearance when in fact I had a definite disorder. I was never a yo-yo dieter, but did try a few programs like Pritikin, Low Carb, but executed the plans with common sense, not overboard. In all honesty, my dietary habits (young working mom) were not always pristine and Ive downed many a pizza/ice cream dinner in my lifetime . . . and lets not even go to chocolate!!  The truth is in recent years I have done a much better job with it all, but nothing seemed to really help. Thyroid Power talks about how underlying thyroid conditions can influence other physical challenges, and go unnoticed by the medical profession for what it is. One good thing the cardiologist said to me was that the thyroid condition (in my case) is genetic and that my heart is an innocent bystander to what the thyroid is doing. He helped me see that I cant just sit back and pretend this doesnt exist. I would like to live out my life as healthily and happily as I possibly can. Yesterday I went to a cardiologist for the first time, just as a followup to my recent hospital stay. He is increasing my Metropolol (blood pressure med) for now, to protect my heart, and recommends I see an endrocrinolgist. Talked to me about thyroid ablation (whew, scary!). I read on this site where beta blockers actually masque the symptoms of thyroid, so I dont know what that means to my body/heart overall. If increasing the meds gives my heart a break while I find other answers, then that is a good thing. To just increase the meds and do no more research would be to my detriment, espcially if the beta blockers are just masquing the symptoms (logical but of course Im no doctor so dont really know for sure). One last bit of info, Ive been maintaining a fasting glucose of about 99-105 in recent months, without medication. While not the best numbers, Im fully aware that Im heading for more medical problems without the proper guidance. Good health to all! A diet doctor I saw taught me this formula: Carbs  fiber divided by 5 (because there are 5 carbs in every tsp of sugar) This gives you the amount of sugar in anything you eat and a good guideline for planning ones daily menu. I think, by the way, that there are 10-12 tsps of sugar in ever serving of soda. My son with Downs has lost 45 lbs. this year and one of the main things he cut was steady drinking of soda. Im just sayin this is worth your conscious consideration. Some additional information. Ive had one knee replacement, Osteoarthritis symptoms, and weigh 296 as of my last step onto the scale. I am not proud of my weight, but it also shows how out of balance my body must be, especially when Ive been following a sensible, low carb, organic, healthy diet. Im working on improving sleep, and also exercise. I am usually fairly consistent with exercise (Curves and walking) but have been going slower since the Thyroid Storm. 20-30 minutes of walking seems really helpful and Im starting back to Curves with a bit less exuberance until I know more about what is happeneing to me. Well, thats part of my story anyway. My adult son also has thyroid issues. He was born with Down Syndrome. My neice was just diagnosed with Hashimotos as well and I have a few other relatives I need to convince to go get testes. If you made if this far, thanks for staying with me while I told my basic story and please share your experience. Follow Report"

To just increase the meds and do no more research would be to my detriment, espcially if the beta blockers are just masquing the symptoms (logical but of course Im no doctor so dont really know for sure). One last bit of info, Ive been maintaining a fasting glucose of about 99-105 in recent months, without medication. While not the best numbers, Im fully aware that Im heading for more medical problems without the proper guidance. Good health to all! A diet doctor I saw taught me this formula: Carbs  fiber divided by 5 (because there are 5 carbs in every tsp of sugar) This gives you the amount of sugar in anything you eat and a good guideline for planning ones daily menu. I think, by the way, that there are 10-12 tsps of sugar in ever serving of soda. My son with Downs has lost 45 lbs. this year and one of the main things he cut was steady drinking of soda. Im just sayin this is worth your conscious consideration. Some additional information. Ive had one knee replacement, Osteoarthritis symptoms, and weigh 296 as of my last step onto the scale. I am not proud of my weight, but it also shows how out of balance my body must be, especially when Ive been following a sensible, low carb, organic, healthy diet. Im working on improving sleep, and also exercise. I am usually fairly consistent with exercise (Curves and walking) but have been going slower since the Thyroid Storm. 20-30 minutes of walking seems really helpful and Im starting back to Curves with a bit less exuberance until I know more about what is happeneing to me. Well, thats part of my story anyway. My adult son also has thyroid issues. He was born with Down Syndrome. My neice was just diagnosed with Hashimotos as well and I have a few other relatives I need to convince to go get testes.

So far Ive been to several doctors. My original treatment plan was Levothyroxine and Levothyronine (thyroid hormone) along with other hormones and supplements. I was put on 10K of Vitamin D3, DHEA, testesterone, estrodial, etc. I am no longer on that much of a regime. Our family had aleady been to a nutritionist before the diagnosis and were well on our way to improving our general health & diet. Ive read the book, Thyroid Power by Shames & Shames, which is a great resource (also a book called, The Thyroid Diet, which has some good information). When I learned of the classic thyroid symptoms, I realized I have experienced many of them all my life. In the late 80s, I had a hysterectomy for fibroids & excessive bleeding/clotting/enemia. I wonder now if that condition was really undetected thyroid issues? I am 61, I have studied and practiced good nutrition (as it has evolved over the years) most of my adult life. I have had weight issues since my first child was born in 1968. I had a kidney infection with that pregnancy, and in about the 7th month had kidney XRay and had an allergic reaction to the contact dye I was given to drink beforehand. I never gave it much more thought. I tried using iodine about a year ago, on the advice of a healing practioner, and had a funny, allergic reaction to it (1 drop in water!) and so discontinued . . . . (my face heated up, chest got all red and I felt sweaty and stressed) so I do have some kind of sensitivity to iodine. She suggested later that I might have been needing more iodine, not allergic to it but I have not explored it any further at this point! Sometime in May 2011, I think, I switched from the synthetic Levothyroxine to Armour (natural harmone derived from pig thyroid). In June 2011, I had two incidents  first, I had a bad fall off of a porch step onto concrete (shocking) and about a week later, my first recognizable Thyroid Storm and experienced scary heart palpatations and ended up in the ER overnight for observation. My pulse went up to 126. . . normally for me its around 94-100 (still high but not nearly as scary!). When I was first diagnosed with Hashomotos Thyroiditis, my labwork showed that my antibodies were 59 (high). During the Thyroid Storm the bloodwork showed they were at 186. This shows that ones autimmune system is attacking the thyroid. The naturopath prescribed a Thyroid Tincture (combo of healing herbe) which I feel did a good job of reducing the pulse and quieting the antibody activity (though I dont at this point understand exactly how that works with the tincture?). I was grateful to have that to take 3x/day during the worst of the storm. I still am very new to this disorder and some of it is confusing to me. Would sure help to hear from others who are going thru similar issues with thyroid, especially those who have more experience with it than I and some suggestions or resources, and have things to share about the mainstream medical or alternative medical points of view. I feel I have some important decisions to make soon and need all the information I can gather. Hopefully some of this will be helpful to others. I want to point out the subject of being an overweight person most of my adult life, dealing with symptoms I didnt always understand (like edema, depression, weight gain, insomnia for instance), and the stress physically, and distress of feeling judged for my appearance when in fact I had a definite disorder. I was never a yo-yo dieter, but did try a few programs like Pritikin, Low Carb, but executed the plans with common sense, not overboard. In all honesty, my dietary habits (young working mom) were not always pristine and Ive downed many a pizza/ice cream dinner in my lifetime . . . and lets not even go to chocolate!!  The truth is in recent years I have done a much better job with it all, but nothing seemed to really help. Thyroid Power talks about how underlying thyroid conditions can influence other physical challenges, and go unnoticed by the medical profession for what it is. One good thing the cardiologist said to me was that the thyroid condition (in my case) is genetic and that my heart is an innocent bystander to what the thyroid is doing. He helped me see that I cant just sit back and pretend this doesnt exist. I would like to live out my life as healthily and happily as I possibly can. Yesterday I went to a cardiologist for the first time, just as a followup to my recent hospital stay. He is increasing my Metropolol (blood pressure med) for now, to protect my heart, and recommends I see an endrocrinolgist. Talked to me about thyroid ablation (whew, scary!).

Would sure help to hear from others who are going thru similar issues with thyroid, especially those who have more experience with it than I and some suggestions or resources, and have things to share about the mainstream medical or alternative medical points of view. I feel I have some important decisions to make soon and need all the information I can gather. Hopefully some of this will be helpful to others. I want to point out the subject of being an overweight person most of my adult life, dealing with symptoms I didnt always understand (like edema, depression, weight gain, insomnia for instance), and the stress physically, and distress of feeling judged for my appearance when in fact I had a definite disorder. I was never a yo-yo dieter, but did try a few programs like Pritikin, Low Carb, but executed the plans with common sense, not overboard. In all honesty, my dietary habits (young working mom) were not always pristine and Ive downed many a pizza/ice cream dinner in my lifetime . . . and lets not even go to chocolate!!  The truth is in recent years I have done a much better job with it all, but nothing seemed to really help. Thyroid Power talks about how underlying thyroid conditions can influence other physical challenges, and go unnoticed by the medical profession for what it is. One good thing the cardiologist said to me was that the thyroid condition (in my case) is genetic and that my heart is an innocent bystander to what the thyroid is doing. He helped me see that I cant just sit back and pretend this doesnt exist. I would like to live out my life as healthily and happily as I possibly can. Yesterday I went to a cardiologist for the first time, just as a followup to my recent hospital stay. He is increasing my Metropolol (blood pressure med) for now, to protect my heart, and recommends I see an endrocrinolgist. Talked to me about thyroid ablation (whew, scary!). I read on this site where beta blockers actually masque the symptoms of thyroid, so I dont know what that means to my body/heart overall. If increasing the meds gives my heart a break while I find other answers, then that is a good thing. To just increase the meds and do no more research would be to my detriment, espcially if the beta blockers are just masquing the symptoms (logical but of course Im no doctor so dont really know for sure). One last bit of info, Ive been maintaining a fasting glucose of about 99-105 in recent months, without medication. While not the best numbers, Im fully aware that Im heading for more medical problems without the proper guidance. Good health to all! A diet doctor I saw taught me this formula: Carbs  fiber divided by 5 (because there are 5 carbs in every tsp of sugar) This gives you the amount of sugar in anything you eat and a good guideline for planning ones daily menu. I think, by the way, that there are 10-12 tsps of sugar in ever serving of soda. My son with Downs has lost 45 lbs. this year and one of the main things he cut was steady drinking of soda. Im just sayin this is worth your conscious consideration. Some additional information. Ive had one knee replacement, Osteoarthritis symptoms, and weigh 296 as of my last step onto the scale. I am not proud of my weight, but it also shows how out of balance my body must be, especially when Ive been following a sensible, low carb, organic, healthy diet. Im working on improving sleep, and also exercise. I am usually fairly consistent with exercise (Curves and walking) but have been going slower since the Thyroid Storm. 20-30 minutes of walking seems really helpful and Im starting back to Curves with a bit less exuberance until I know more about what is happeneing to me. Well, thats part of my story anyway. My adult son also has thyroid issues. He was born with Down Syndrome. My neice was just diagnosed with Hashimotos as well and I have a few other relatives I need to convince to go get testes. If you made if this far, thanks for staying with me while I told my basic story and please share your experience. Follow Report"

I'm hoping you could help me with a problem I've been dealing with since a very early age, for as long as I can remember. The problem is : I have a distended abdomen, really distended, it makes me look pregnant. The thing is, I always had this stomach, at fist when I was young I thought (as my mum told me) that it was a baby belly and it would go away, the problem is that it never did. I'm now 25 years old and always with the distended abdomen, though I'm not really fat (I do have minor weight fluctuations, but the stomach always stuck with me even when I underweight) , I also have a very active work, and I don't drive so usually I walk a lot during the day (present situation excluded) . Usually ( around 90% of the time) I contract my stomach, and it looks flat, I do have some fat in it, it isn't top model flat but it is flat. For obvious reasons I cannot do it when I'm sleeping which is pretty much the only time I let go, or if I'm laying on my stomach. I've also discovered that if I'm standing and I try to let go and not contract my abdomen anymore I start to feel very dizzy very quickly, as if my heart beat got slower and the air couldn't get it. As an addition to that sometimes (I wouldn't say often but not rarely neither) I experience a shooting pain in the area around my ribs everytime I breathe, and more often that not I feel like air is getting properly to my lungs, when I take a deep breath specially. I've already told doctors about this two symptoms ( except for the distended stomach which I know I should have ) but they've concluded I was too stressed out, although it is sometimes true, it isn't always the case.This is a big issue for me, and couldn't even talk about it with no one, I'm sincerely hoping to find answers here.

Anyway, the issue is I have intermittent odors when I talk (yes, Ive been to the dentist 10+ times all say my oral hygiene is on point and xrays and inspections showed nothing). The only time its practically non-existent is when I eat an unhealthily low-carb diet. Like others online, Ive had CT scans, Barium swallows, endosocopy/colonoscopy, screening for parasites (getting one more from an IDS before crossing that off my list). All showed up negative. I tested positive for SIBO, but after researching that for the past 3 years, Im certain SIBO is more of a symptom than a primary causal problem. Furthermore, even when I treated SIBO with heavy antibiotics, it did absolutely nothing for my breath and yes I was cleared of SIBO after a couple rounds of work. yet, the moment I eat carbs, I still get a did someone just s*it themselves? comment. I guess what Im getting at is Im tired of doctors just saying its IBS and SIBO and then proceeding to do zero investigating afterwards. I want to get down to the root cause of this, but most doctors are either too apathetic or too incompetent to do anything. Are there any researchers who specialize in studying and diagnosing hard to find problems in the GI tract? Between the 3 GI docs, 2 ENTs, 2 NDs and 1 IDS, I just cant take normal doctors anymore. I want my life back and I want a specific root cause so I can work on progressing from there. Further notes: Diarrhea actually cleared up when I ate junk food and I had zero bloating, albeit the odor remained. Xifaxan and neomycin did nothing for the odor, nor did the elemental diet. I actually think the elemental diet made the smell as bad or worse than before. *******Nitazoxanide********** worked wonders for the month I was on it.

Anyway, the issue is I have intermittent odors when I talk (yes, Ive been to the dentist 10+ times all say my oral hygiene is on point and xrays and inspections showed nothing). The only time its practically non-existent is when I eat an unhealthily low-carb diet. Like others online, Ive had CT scans, Barium swallows, endosocopy/colonoscopy, screening for parasites (getting one more from an IDS before crossing that off my list). All showed up negative. I tested positive for SIBO, but after researching that for the past 3 years, Im certain SIBO is more of a symptom than a primary causal problem. Furthermore, even when I treated SIBO with heavy antibiotics, it did absolutely nothing for my breath and yes I was cleared of SIBO after a couple rounds of work. yet, the moment I eat carbs, I still get a did someone just s*it themselves? comment. I guess what Im getting at is Im tired of doctors just saying its IBS and SIBO and then proceeding to do zero investigating afterwards. I want to get down to the root cause of this, but most doctors are either too apathetic or too incompetent to do anything. Are there any researchers who specialize in studying and diagnosing hard to find problems in the GI tract? Between the 3 GI docs, 2 ENTs, 2 NDs and 1 IDS, I just cant take normal doctors anymore. I want my life back and I want a specific root cause so I can work on progressing from there. Further notes: Diarrhea actually cleared up when I ate junk food and I had zero bloating, albeit the odor remained. Xifaxan and neomycin did nothing for the odor, nor did the elemental diet. I actually think the elemental diet made the smell as bad or worse than before. *******Nitazoxanide********** worked wonders for the month I was on it.

It was coming and going on a daily basis, and seemed to feel better when I would eat food, but then come back. Some background Im a 26 year old female, no underlying health issues, and while I do eat fast food or junk food, I mostly have a healthy diet. About a week after that pain started, it shifted into a pain that felt like it was moreso in my lungs, and I started to feel a dull pain sometimes when breathing in deeply. Again comes and goes, but for the most part its a consistent annoying pain throughout the day (felt moreso with deep breaths). Since it turned into more of a lung pain (I use quotation marks because Im not sure if its my lungs or just feels like my lungs Ive had no trouble breathing) it hasnt seemed to improve when eating food as much as it did before. As of right now, it bothers me dully throughout the day, but Im still getting the pain when breathing deeply, some days worse than others. Again, no trouble breathing or any other symptoms, and Im sleeping well. What bothers me most is that its gone on this long (4 weeks now) which seems unusual, and with whats going on now, I dont want to go see a doctor unless absolutely necessary. A lot of what Ive seen online tends to point to it having to do with acid reflux (which I do get sometimes based on what I eat) but again, could that cause a constant chest issue for 4+ weeks now? It seemed to come on suddenly without any major diet change, which is what steers me away from that a bit. Thank you in advance for any and all input! And I do plan to see a doctor once the COVID-19 pandemic starts to slow down (hopefully), if it keeps persisting. Liked by Merry, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

Help,"Hello, I posted before in another group in its entirety but I think its too broad and there could be a multitude of theories and explanations. So Im going to break my story down into my most bothersome episodic symptoms. To start, everything on the surface looks like panic disorder or anxiety. However, my different episodes seem to be helping each other keep me feeling frantic more days than not so on the surface it looks like anxiety. Ive had lots of lab work testing including thyroid, Lyme, sleep apnea home test, brain MRI, spine MRI, abdominal ct scan, and way too many doctor visits with no answer, but they do agree on one thing. The symptoms are weird and seem to be more than just anxiety. There are little bits here and there but unfortunately not enough to go on. Keep in mind these episodes arent all going on at the same time but theyre not giving me any recovery time and feel like im sinking further down the hole. Its like fighting 5 bullies one at a time and losing. Just as you feel like you can get up another bully hops in. Episode 1: After waking up with head pressure, teeth chattering, shivering, lower back pain, and sweating. Oral temperature is ALWAYS between 93.8 F and 94.8 during these episodes. Also, every day is constant cold hands and feet that never happened until all of these episodes started. Episode 2: Brain fog, head pressure that feels like youre being pushed down when standing (like when youve had one too many drinks), usually later in the day when that feeling wears off, Ill have adrenaline body tingling, uncontrollable thoughts of self-harm and head chatter. (Not dwelling on things or worried about things, its just the mind doing what it does and I have no control.) Also, my eye will twitch like crazy before and during these. Episode 3: When standing for a long period of time, like cooking or washing dishes, and sweating starts to happen my heart rate increases and get extremely dizzy and feels like Im being physically pulled down. Episode 4: An overly excited feeling, almost like needing to yell or run to get adrenaline out, Heart rate is low. Episode 5. Sharp colon pain, yellow stools (frequently), stools that look sickly or unhealthy, and constipation more often than not. I had a colonoscopy recently and I was told everything looks good. Ive tried SSRIs and benzodiazepines and they dont stop these episodes from occurring. Ive tried strict diets and those dont help. If you have any thought about even one of these episodes please dont be shy to comment. Thank you so much for taking the time to read.

I am a 16 year old girl from Canada who eats very healthy and balanced meals, I am active, I am on no medications and have never had any issues before now. I struggled with depression in my childhood but I was able to pull myself out of it four years ago. Over the last two years, I have always had an easy time sleeping. My friends and I would joke about it, but as time went on it became less comedic as it once was. In the summer/fall of 2019 I started to feel an inconsistent pain in the middle of my chest. It would come and go randomly, not triggered or caused by anything I was aware of, and it didnt really cause me any issues. In January of 2020 this pain started to spread from the middle of my chest to the top and sides of my left breast, next to my armpit on my right side, and it would send pains down my left arm and up my neck. I had a sort of what Im calling an attack, as it hasnt happened often, one night in January as well. I was laying in bed at night, playing a game after finishing all my work for the week, and suddenly it pulsed and throbbed and I got a stabbing pain from every affected place in my chest. I was unable to move, and then after 30 minutes it went away. My mother blamed it on anxiety and I went to bed. With the chest pain has also come an extreme amount of exhaustion. I sleep 8-10 hours a night, and by the time I get home from school in the day I am exhausted. I sleep for another 2-3 hours and Im still exhausted after that. In February something similar to my attack happened again, and this time I went to the emergency room and I was there until 4 in the morning. They did blood work, I got an EKG, we did a thyroid test, and everything came back fine. The doctor says there is nothing they can do for me and send me home. I am a healthy teenager. Recently I have had to drop classes in a vocal competition I was in because I havent had enough energy to practice my songs. I have needed to cancel social events, my intense chest pain comes out of nowhere and doesnt leave for days. Im missing school, falling behind, falling asleep in class, I cannot study or function properly anymore and its because Im always so tired. Last night I had my third attack as Im calling it, for lack of better words, but it happened whilst I was standing and mid-conversation I fell down. I went home and went to bed, and I have been in bed ever since. My chest hurts to touch, hurts when I sneeze or blow my nose, lay on my side, and I havent been able to get out of my bed. My doctors say the earliest they can see me is May 27th but things just keep getting worse. I feel like Im giving up my life because of some chest pain or because Im tired. Is there anything I can do to help alleviate the pain or something I can ask the doctors to check or give me? I have needed to cancel plans I've been excited or looking forward to because Ive been too tired to go forward with them. I was invited to perform in Florida for a week in June, but all I can think about now is how my body is going to get through it. Thank you for listening! I hope they can figure out whats wrong with me soon. Liked by lioness Follow Report"

Now the chest pain mainly feels like pressure in my chest snd i get occsssional sharp pains on the lower portion of my ribs and sometimes on each side of my sternum. What could this be? Heres what all Ive had done. CT scan of heart and heart echo  found i have a slightly dialated aerota at the base that they will monitor yearly. I also have a bicuspid aerota valve with moderate regurgitation. Cardiologist does not think my heart is causing the pains.

I've done an ultrasound, CT scan(with contrast), MRI, endoscopy, colonoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, cystic fibrosis testing, gastric emptying test, etc. Some of those tests done at Mayo Clinic itself in 2010 in Minnesota. All of those tests were normal. The only thing that's ever been shown in my testing, has been a slightly elevated lipase and amylase. It led doctors into thinking I have pancreatitis, but they've looked at my pancreas extensively(especially during the endoscopic ultrasound at Mayo) and the pancreas looks completely normal. I recently went to the ER and did another blood test + CT scan with contrast. The pancreas was again normal(as was everything else), but my lipase was slightly elevated at 150(normal levels being 90 for that hospital). I went to a GI doctor today and they told me it could be an abdominal migraine, or a potential vascular problem involving the abdomen.

I've had abdominal pain problems since 2010. Thankfully I managed to get better after 2 years of constant pain and every test done possible. My problems have returned for the past 2 months, albeit, my pain isn't constant and does go away unlike before. My pain is usually a 4/5 out of 10 and can last for a few hours until it subsides. It is usually around the belly button area(mainly above, but sometimes below). I have done almost every test possible. I've done an ultrasound, CT scan(with contrast), MRI, endoscopy, colonoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, cystic fibrosis testing, gastric emptying test, etc. Some of those tests done at Mayo Clinic itself in 2010 in Minnesota. All of those tests were normal. The only thing that's ever been shown in my testing, has been a slightly elevated lipase and amylase. It led doctors into thinking I have pancreatitis, but they've looked at my pancreas extensively(especially during the endoscopic ultrasound at Mayo) and the pancreas looks completely normal. I recently went to the ER and did another blood test + CT scan with contrast. The pancreas was again normal(as was everything else), but my lipase was slightly elevated at 150(normal levels being 90 for that hospital). I went to a GI doctor today and they told me it could be an abdominal migraine, or a potential vascular problem involving the abdomen. They did schedule a HIDA scan(to check the function of the gallbladder), as that is ironically the only test(or one of the only), I have not done. They want to see the results of the HIDA scan before progressing further and they told me to try out some more bentyl for pain(something I took before and didn't notice relief from it). Most pain medications do not help. Even back in 2010 when my pain was constant and more severe, I tried almost everything possible in terms of medications, but nothing helped. The only relief I get from the pain is from natural remedies. Tea and 1 small teaspoon of apple cider vinegar mixed with some lemon and baking soda(this helps me the most). I don't have acid reflux like I did in 2010. It's mainly the pain now. It can be described as a squeezing pain just above my belly button mainly(sometimes lower).

Her day now starts with her waking up with nausea and when she has a cup of tea and toast in the morning she gets sick within fifteen minutes thereafter. Her sickness is accompanied by violent belching, and at times she regurgitates liquid vile. The only drug she has for nausea is Zofran which does nothing for her.

I mentioned it with my gastroenterologist before a routine colonoscopy; she pretty much dismissed it but immediately put me on Prilosec in the morning and Zantac.It really doesnt help very much. before bed. I had and EGD and she diagnosed and irritated esophagus and stomach and a small hiatal hernia.I have now given up coffee, wine, chocolate, beef, tomatoes and eating after dinner (everyday the list grows.) We have propped our bed at an angle. I am afraid to eat. She insists that the hernia is not causing this, but it must be. Im in my 50s, perfect weight and have never even had heartburn.

She has been from doctor to doctor and no once can seem to pinpoint what is wrong with her. She weights 89 lbs, cant gain weight, has chronic pain in her abdominal area and a small mass that can be felt. She has had 4 MRIs which found nothing. She lives in Arizona and was in the Scottsdale Mayo ER, they thought it was an ovary or endometriosis and they did an ultrasound, blood work and pelvic exam. Found nothing, sent her home but told her to come back if things got worse. They never get better. I wish they would have looked further to see what the problem really is if it isnt female issues. She is so slim you can feel there is something going on, a mass. She also gets chronic inflammation in her rib cage on one side, on and off. No one can explain that either. Her blood work shows she produces very little progesterone. No one really has done anything to address that. Her diet is very limited because she gets ill very easily. She gets night sweats that soak her sheets just about daily. She runs low grade fevers frequently. She has had many tests done over the years, and while things may come back slightly off, no one has a diagnosis or explanation for why she is chronically sick. The chronic pain is affecting her mental state as well. She can barely function enough to keep a part time job. Her income level is low so she could never pay out of pocket to get diagnosed by Mayo. Her government insurance policy that she pays for doesnt want to approve many tests or specialists. Even when they do, they are mediocre and all they want to do is give her pain meds and anti nausea. She does not take the pain meds and the anti nausea just provides a bit of relief. She needs a diagnosis, not meds that cover up symptoms. What is causing all of this? I wish she could afford to go to Mayo to at least get a diagnosis. She is deteriorating and no one helps her. We do not know what to do. I am her mother and I live in Wisconsin and do what I can to help her keep afloat. At 89 lbs she is frail and dragging herself through her days not living life. I am scared for her.

It was occasional complaint then and wasn't affecting her eating then. Started in October, the complaint grew stronger and she wasn't able to eat her school snacks, but still finished all her food. In December, it got worse to the point she wasn't able to eat much at dinner and complaining she feels really full. Dinner was a big struggle, she still managed to finish all her breakfast and lunch. Up to January, daughter couldn't take any food at all, she says she feels really full all the time. She is also experiencing constipation, she also experiences headache when she feels really full. We have done all kinds of tests, x-ray, CT scan, endoscopy, ultrasound, upper GI test, blood tests, all have come back normal. Now they diagnosed her as eating disorder. I understand that she has some anxiety/fear over eating due to her fullness in the tummy, but it's not due to anything else. Is this a form of eating disorder? She was admitted to the hospital 3 weeks ago, tube feeding was started on her as she was malnourished and had lost lots of weight over the months. She is experiencing severe symptoms towards the tube feed. We were told the symptoms should get better over time as she adjusts to the feed, but after a week, she was still feeling awful. She experiences burning in her throat, pain in her chest, stomach, fullness and sick feeling in her stomach, nausea but not able to throw up, she also burped lots with acid reflux coming up. She felt really distressful with the tube. When offered the food, she is not interested at all. She said she feels really full. She has started on the solids 5 days ago with the eating disorder program, she can only eat minimal amounts, she threw up almost on all meals. She was offered anti nausea meds after, have not thrown up but felt lots of discomfort. I can see that she hunches down with lots of discomfort. I wanted to help my daughter but don't know how. Should I get a second opinion on her abdominal fullness? She said the full feeling is not the same as a full feeling when you eat lots of food. When she has a bowel movement, she does feel a little better. I am really lost at this point and desperately wanted to help my daughter. Any advise you can offer is much appreciated. Follow Report"

I'm a 21 year old South Asian female and I have been having GI issues for about five yearsmainly along the lines of constipation. I do have bowel movements every day but it takes a long time & I am rarely fully cleared out. These GI issues are always accompanied by other health issues (gas, pressure in head, etc). Recently, some scary new conditions have manifested: In the past few weeks, there have been times where my heart starts beating wildly and very fast. Sometimes, when I'm tired and constipated, my entire body feels like its vibrating internally; the shakes aren't visible but it feels like all my muscles are quivering. At this point, I feel a constant shaking/quivering within my body, especially in my heart cavity. I have had TWO EKG's and both came back normal. All lab tests for diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol, etc came back within normal limits. I am very concerned about this internal shaking. My dad says he found something about how GI disorders can impact muscoskeletal system and since the heart is a muscle, it's contracting and being affected.

I have been going through the ongoing left chest lower ribcage/chest pain which moves around and goes to the back(sometimes) for the last 10 months. I went to ER 3 times, they did chest X-ray, EKG(probably 4 times) and found nothing suspicious. They relieved me asking to find a primary care doctor for proper diagnosis. So, I booked an appointment with primary care and he did a LIPID PANEL test (the results looked good) and asked me to put ICY HOT (pain relieving) cream on the chest areas that hurt. I used it for a while and found out that it gives temporary relief but the the pain doesn't go away. Also, if the pain is like 7 or 8 out of 10 it doesn't really help. Then, he did a bunch of tests like MAGNESIUM, HIV-1/2 AG/AB INITIAL SCREENING, HEMOGLOBIN A1C, COMPREHENSIVE METABOLIC PANEL, CBC, HELICOBACTER PYLORI ANTIGEN and the results looked good for each of those tests. He also asked me to take FAMOTIDINE but it didn't really work. He is sure that it is non cardiac given my symptons and sent to Gastroenterology dept. So, the doctor from Gastroenterolog dept asked to take Omeprazole (40 mg) for 2 or 3 weeks. I thought initially the pain was a little less but to my surprise I was was experiencing the same pain I used to have. Then he asked me to take Iberogest(purchased from Amazon) 20 drops with water 3 times a day but I couldn't take it for more than 3 days because I felt heaviness, pressure on my chest/stomach and more pain. He then changed it to FD-gard (over the counter medicine) but again didn't help much. In the mean time, I did an endoscopy So, during Endoscopy they found a small lesion in my gastric antrum and they have sent it out for biopsy and the result was benign. They also recommended to do an Ultrasound Endoscopy to get better pictures of the lesion. I did that too and they said it is too small now (like 1.5 cm) and they won't cut it until it shows growth. They advised me to repeat the procedure in next 6 months. They also said that this MIGHT NOT be the reason for your chest pain. So, now the doctor thinks that the nerves around the esophagus and the stomach might cause the pain and I'm taking despiramine (10 mg) daily for the last 5 days He said he will increase the dose every 3 weeks and it takes time to kick in. Now, I'm on 50 mg Desipramine and FD-gard but nothing seems to help either. The doctor ordered CT scan for my chest, abdomen and pelvis now. He also did a few tests like CRP, SEDIMENTATION RATE AUTOMATED, ANA SCREEN and LIPASE. All the tests were normal except LIPASE (The standard range is 13  64 U/L) but for me it was 79 U/L. The doctor said that the pancreas marker is very mildly elevated and it's a little hard to say if this is truly the pancreas issue or not. Also, the results of CAT scan was negative. Yesterday, I went through another round of EUS and the doctor has taken a sample of the lesion found in gastric antrum to identify if it is a GIST or pancreatic rest. (sent out for biopsy) He thinks it is a pancreatic rest. Also, they have taken tissue from esophagus to find out if I have severe acid reflux. Given my lipase level is high and there is a chance that the lesion might be a pancreatic rest the doctor thinks the pain might be coming from the wall of the stomach. Can a pancreatic rest in the antrum cause chest pain? Follow Report"

A beautiful girl on the inside, as well as the outside. She had food sensitivities as a baby. She would become blotchy when eating dairy. As a young teen, she would sometimes get significant stomach-cramping. She now experiences bloating, gas, belching, and a disagreement with dairy. She eats super-healthy, works out like a maniac and takes care of herself. She was a div 1 college athlete. She struggles with keeping her weight down (was always very thin as a young girl.and all immediate family members are thin). She cant sleep and is often exhausted. In her high school years, she had terrible sinus issues, which wrecked havoc on her life and athletics. She was always tired. Finally had sinus-surgery, which helped somewhat. Experiences diarrhea at times. Not sure about constipation. She has a major sweating problem. She has such a plethora of issues. They are wrecking havoc on her life. She has seen several physicians, incl a gastroenterologist and a nutritionist. She has been on elimination diets. We still have no answers and this is really getting her down. I am so worried for her and her future. I am seeking a physician who can help us to unravel these many issues and help her to have a happier life.

It was not a surprise to us. She has only a part time job because for the last year and a half she has had a severe Crohns flare. This past summer she had surgery to remove part of her intestine. We thought that would be the answer, but the flare is still active, so she has held onto the little job she has because it is somethingbut certainly not enough to support herself on. He doesnt have a care in the world. It didnt faze him that they will now have no money coming and no health benefits. This was the last straw for her. She is leaving him, but that does not help us figure out where to go from here. Have any of you out there been this down and out and been able to get treatment?

I found a ball about the size of a golf ball near my lower abdomen. It actually popped the other day (I felt it pop when I touched it from the outside). But it is not gone. I told the doctor about it today. When I first got excruciating pain after I overate (8 months ago), I was screaming and thought I might die, I was alone, but did not call 911. I couldnt even walk to the phone. Finally I puked and had uncontrollable diarrhea, and eventually went to sleep. The next day I felt somewhat better but have been eating better and differently since then. Not eating to the point of horrible excess, much more careful.I saw my primary care physician then because I thought I could have had sepsis. She said she didnt think so, but really didnt do anything. Since then I have been having pains and saw her today and she finally ordered an ultrasound for the lower region, becauseI told her I felt a lump there and it hurt. She said it wasnt exactly in the region of the ovaries but near there. She said it could be a digestive problem with my lower bowel.Heres the question  I am usually constipated. I noticed when I was taking laxatives with senna in it I was in worse pain. So I stopped taking senna. And tonight I bought glycerine suppositories. I dont know what is there  bothering me so much, but hopefully theyll find out. Meantime I am wondering if taking a suppository could hurt me. I hope not.

I just had a POEM surgery done in November (2017) with Dr. Robert Bechara in Kingston, Ontario. I wanted share my experience because, like many people here, before my surgery I scoured the web for hours trying to get an idea of what I should expect. I ended up being very anxious about the surgery, afraid that it wouldnt work or even make things worse. I now know I fell victim to confirmation bias, since people are much more likely to post a bad experience rather than a good one, and I want to dilute that a bit.Like many, I was first diagnosed with GERD and took Proton Pump Inhibitors, which obviously didnt work. After a barium swallow, endoscopy, and mamotomy (ugh), I was correctly diagnosed with Type I achalasia and was lucky enough to be scheduled for POEM only three months later. Dr. Bechara and his staff were incredibly friendly, communicative, and accommodating to the fact that I lived out of province. Dr. Bechara studied in Japan, where the procedure was developed, and had a success rate of 100% from 100 patients that hed done the operation on. Contrasting to how nervous I was, he seemed to almost be bored. In fact, the day I had my operation, he had another person getting it too. So, hes a total expert. Do ask your doctor how many operations theyd done and if they had any complications, if nothing else itll put your mind at ease.Three days before the operation I was on a fully liquid diet, which isnt bad but really drains your energy. All I wanted to do was lay in bed and watch TV, so dont plan any marathons. The morning of the surgery I was put on IV and right before the surgery I was knocked out and put on anaesthetic. All I remember is the count down, and the next thing I knew I was coming to in the post-op room. At first the anaesthetic was still working so I felt sleepy but great. As it wore off though, I started feeling a pain in my chest. Getting up was out of the question for at least a few hours, but they gave me a fantastic pink numbing liquid (Lidodan 2%) which worked wonders. I was pretty much bedridden for the next three days, and had almost no energy for anything. So take that week off work is my advice.This pain remained for about three weeks, and, Ill be honest, it really sucked. At first it was a constant dull pain that inhibited my breadth of movement and would only be subdued by the pink stuff. After about a week the pain became acute, which was worse. I would feel almost totally fine, and then this sharp stab would suddenly come on and I had to lie down wherever I was; always have your pink stuff (or Tylenol) on hand. I thought these was the spasms some people wrote about in blogs and was afraid it wouldnt go ever away. I definitely had thoughts that this wasnt worth it, and I shouldve just lived with the swallowing issues rather than inhibiting spasms. BUT, the pink liquid was awesome and it would calm the pain in about 30 minutes, and it did go away after three weeks. It became less and less frequent, and now totally gone. The pain is not that surprising really, they put a 17cm incision inside your body  its gonna hurt. After a week after the surgery I was able to work just fine.Right now, two months post-surgery, I feel so incredibly grateful that I had the operation done. I can eat all my favourite food not only without throwing up, but with consuming only a small amount of water (often not even necessary). Ive started feeling thirsty again, can eat until Im full, and have finally started regaining the weight Id lost. If you have a chance to do this operation, do it.

Contrasting to how nervous I was, he seemed to almost be bored. In fact, the day I had my operation, he had another person getting it too. So, hes a total expert. Do ask your doctor how many operations theyd done and if they had any complications, if nothing else itll put your mind at ease.Three days before the operation I was on a fully liquid diet, which isnt bad but really drains your energy. All I wanted to do was lay in bed and watch TV, so dont plan any marathons. The morning of the surgery I was put on IV and right before the surgery I was knocked out and put on anaesthetic. All I remember is the count down, and the next thing I knew I was coming to in the post-op room. At first the anaesthetic was still working so I felt sleepy but great. As it wore off though, I started feeling a pain in my chest. Getting up was out of the question for at least a few hours, but they gave me a fantastic pink numbing liquid (Lidodan 2%) which worked wonders. I was pretty much bedridden for the next three days, and had almost no energy for anything. So take that week off work is my advice.This pain remained for about three weeks, and, Ill be honest, it really sucked. At first it was a constant dull pain that inhibited my breadth of movement and would only be subdued by the pink stuff. After about a week the pain became acute, which was worse. I would feel almost totally fine, and then this sharp stab would suddenly come on and I had to lie down wherever I was; always have your pink stuff (or Tylenol) on hand. I thought these was the spasms some people wrote about in blogs and was afraid it wouldnt go ever away. I definitely had thoughts that this wasnt worth it, and I shouldve just lived with the swallowing issues rather than inhibiting spasms. BUT, the pink liquid was awesome and it would calm the pain in about 30 minutes, and it did go away after three weeks. It became less and less frequent, and now totally gone. The pain is not that surprising really, they put a 17cm incision inside your body  its gonna hurt. After a week after the surgery I was able to work just fine.Right now, two months post-surgery, I feel so incredibly grateful that I had the operation done. I can eat all my favourite food not only without throwing up, but with consuming only a small amount of water (often not even necessary). Ive started feeling thirsty again, can eat until Im full, and have finally started regaining the weight Id lost. If you have a chance to do this operation, do it. And I would highly recommend Dr. Bechara if you have the opportunity. Good luck, and dont give up hope! Liked by Teresa, Volunteer Mentor, Zaroga, oceanone, pjstatham ... see all Follow Report"

I just had a POEM surgery done in November (2017) with Dr. Robert Bechara in Kingston, Ontario. I wanted share my experience because, like many people here, before my surgery I scoured the web for hours trying to get an idea of what I should expect. I ended up being very anxious about the surgery, afraid that it wouldnt work or even make things worse. I now know I fell victim to confirmation bias, since people are much more likely to post a bad experience rather than a good one, and I want to dilute that a bit.Like many, I was first diagnosed with GERD and took Proton Pump Inhibitors, which obviously didnt work. After a barium swallow, endoscopy, and mamotomy (ugh), I was correctly diagnosed with Type I achalasia and was lucky enough to be scheduled for POEM only three months later. Dr. Bechara and his staff were incredibly friendly, communicative, and accommodating to the fact that I lived out of province.

They found 2 lymphatic formations in her small intestines which they removed, but were not sure if that was the cause of her pain and digestive problems. The sharp pains she was experiencing did go away, but nothing else. No one had an answer as to how or why she had these growths. Birth defect was the best guess there, but why didn't it bother her until she was a teen? As time went on after this surgery she had constant problems with digestion, bloating, constipation/diarrhea, inflammation, vomiting and night sweats. Since her teen years she has had 4 CAT scans, 1 MRI, ultrasounds, loads of blood work and more specialist and ER visits than I can count. She can't keep weight on and weighs 89 lbs right now, can barely hold a part time job due to pain, nausea and exhaustion and it is affecting her mental state. She has been to many, many specialists over they years and they seem to run the same few basic tests. They know something is off, but no one goes the extra mile to figure out where this is all coming from. You can feel a hard ""mass"" for lack of a better word, in her abdomen. Nothing shows up on the scans so no one bothers to check further. One guess is scar tissue, but from what and why and do you just leave it? They found that she is producing very small amounts of progesterone, so her hormones are way off as well. No idea if the two issues are somehow related.and different specialists don't seem to talk to each other. She also gets inflammation on one side of her where her rib cage is so inflamed it distinctly sticks out further than the other side and is tender to the touch. No one has an answer as to why that happens from time to time either. Every time she has gone in for tests or the ER, they don't find anything specific, however they all think something is going on and tell her to go to a specialist. So she gets prescribed anti nausea and pain meds. She refuses to rely on pain meds so doesn't fill them, and the anti nausea only does so much. Pain meds also cause her GI upset. She doesn't want meds to cover the symptoms, she wants to know what is causing all of this. Her insurance limits her ability to get quality care and a decent diagnosis. I really wish she could be examined at Mayo, because I feel this is the only place that would go the extra mile to actually diagnose what is causing all these problems. She is on a very limited budget so her options are very slim. She is 26 and is deteriorating. She thinks that she is just doomed to spend the rest of her life this way and that she will never find answers or help. Even if she has a health issue that will need constant care, it is hard to take care of a problem when you don't really know what it is. Pain meds and anti nausea are not health care.
