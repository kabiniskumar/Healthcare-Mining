I have more pain now. I have been looking at the pain center where they have the 2 day or 3 weekbprogram. I do not know yet if that is what my referring doctor wants me to participate in or if its just to have a whole team fresh eyes to look at me. I am worried about the pain i am in. I understand it is not ideal to take pain meds for a long peruod of time but the option we are looking at next is a spinal cord stimulator. I guess what i am wondering is, at the Mayo will i be required to go off all pain meds and then see if a SCS will help? If anyine has any thoughts or has a SCS, i would like to know how or if it helps with the pain?? Thank you Liked by Deena Follow Report"

Including UC, surgeries related, hospitalizations! Since 2005 alone I have had 11 abdominal surgeries been near death more or less about 5x. The problem is that I know specific pain in my body is a precursor to major problems b4 tests confirm that anything at all is happening. For example: my last endeavor was ultimately an absess that killed 9 inches of intestine and all of my organs were sick. Blood work, ultrasound, TWO Ct scans (one of which was not 24hrs b4 exploratory surg), showed nothing. I had been vomiting violently for a week prior. This was in 2010 So here I am again facing similar situation, pain unexplainable, test show nothing, all I can think is when will my body give in to what is going on. The abscess seriously almost killed me, the closest I have been. I dont want to wait until it is too late, can Mayo help me? How can they help me? How can I get in? Please any one help!!

I dont think that pregnancy is likely but I also have not had a period in over a year due to my birth control, so I wouldnt know if Ive had a missed period.

It was coming and going on a daily basis, and seemed to feel better when I would eat food, but then come back. Some background Im a 26 year old female, no underlying health issues, and while I do eat fast food or junk food, I mostly have a healthy diet. About a week after that pain started, it shifted into a pain that felt like it was moreso in my lungs, and I started to feel a dull pain sometimes when breathing in deeply. Again comes and goes, but for the most part its a consistent annoying pain throughout the day (felt moreso with deep breaths). Since it turned into more of a lung pain (I use quotation marks because Im not sure if its my lungs or just feels like my lungs Ive had no trouble breathing) it hasnt seemed to improve when eating food as much as it did before. As of right now, it bothers me dully throughout the day, but Im still getting the pain when breathing deeply, some days worse than others. Again, no trouble breathing or any other symptoms, and Im sleeping well. What bothers me most is that its gone on this long (4 weeks now) which seems unusual, and with whats going on now, I dont want to go see a doctor unless absolutely necessary. A lot of what Ive seen online tends to point to it having to do with acid reflux (which I do get sometimes based on what I eat) but again, could that cause a constant chest issue for 4+ weeks now? It seemed to come on suddenly without any major diet change, which is what steers me away from that a bit. Thank you in advance for any and all input! And I do plan to see a doctor once the COVID-19 pandemic starts to slow down (hopefully), if it keeps persisting. Liked by Merry, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

On the very onset of this month's periods,I wasn't very careful as always.I walked and get up from chair etc at haste. Also 2-3years back,I was having an issue wherein I was not having periods for about two months.Doctor diagnosed that there was a small cyst as I was not into good exercise and Water (even now I am not into it). Treatment was done successfully that time.After that for 2 years I don't remember having any issue regarding periods.

I know most people have flatter stomachs even those who dont eat as well as me. I have done research and have come to some conclusions that could fit.

I have a question about what is currently happening to me. So for the past five years or so I have been period free thinking that maybe I hit an early menopause because when my periods stopped I also had symptoms mostly associated with menopause. I even went to my doctor and we think my periods stopped due to an insulin producing condition I have. My body makes too much insulin. However, out of nowhere my period started. At first it was light and brown and that went on for a week. Then it stopped for about 4 days. Then the real period started. Its only been three days and Ive already gone through so many tampons and pads because the bleeding is very excessive. Not to mention the terrible cramps that go with it. Is this because I havent had a period in years? Or could something be seriously wrong? I know its best to go see my doctor. But it started Friday night and I live in the founding city of Veterans day. Which means theyll be closed tomorrow. At this point Im not sure what to do. Ive been sitting in my toilet most of the time just so I can avoid too much of a mess. Im just wondering if this is a emergency room situation or if its normal.

My questions are, the antibiotics are for what exactly as from my research they dont really positively effect yeast infections and also on applying the ketoconazole I notice that after washing off any discharge and drying it off, when I apply the anti fungal, that minutes later it will start having a clear discharge which turns into a mucus white transparent discharge hours later, is that ok/normal as I know keeping the area dry is important? -Im uncircumcised and the area is my foreskin/side on penis glans.

Hopefully they will also provide me with a referral to get in to see my OBGYN. Back in I want to say sometime between the end of April early May I started putting on a ton of weight. I gained an easy 20 pounds in less than a month, then I literally gained 6 pounds in less than 5 days. I know something is wrong. Ive always been really slim and slender, no more than about 117 lbs. I do have one child, but shes school aged and I know Im not pregnant. A little background, I am on the implanon which I know causes no estrogen coming into my body. Im working at getting an appointment to have it removed as its been in now for over 3 years. My insurance changed over when I got married and Ive been jumping through hoops to get things squared away. Something that has crossed my mind was getting parasites because for awhile my spouse and I were having sushi literally every weekend for at least 2 months. Ive now stopped eating sushi because of the concern. I also for the most part am constipated and I mean literally not going more than once or twice a week, if that. When I do go, sometimes its 2-3 times a day. I thought there were parasites in it, but Im unsure. I drank a detox tea and that helped a little bit, more I still have a lot of weight on. I look pregnant and Ive had ovarian cysts in the past.. I am concerned which is why Im trying to see someone. Cancer is a big one in my family, so Im stressed. Can anyone offer me some insight? Anyone have a similar problem or possible know what I should discuss when seeing my doctor? I want to make sure I dont leave anything out. Ask any questions, Ill be happy to answer. Dont know if I touched base on everything. Thank you for all your advice and help in advance!!! Follow Report"
