She had a spiral notebook between her leg and the arm of the chair. She reached for it often and was anxiously writing things down. At one point she asked me if I knew what she was writing down and I replied: probably  so she asked me what I thought she was writing down and I told her the most likely she was writing down things that I was saying otherwise she was writing down comments or thoughts based on things I was saying. She said  both  I nodded affirmatively and she asked me if that happened often. I replied: it depends on my audience  That seemed to surprise her some.I mentioned what my grandmother told me and how I realized that reality and truth were often used interchangeably and that a lot of our language was used unilaterally meaning that many people think or assume that others know what they mean. So if theres a thread of truth to that thought how can we know what everyone means? Its easy to be confused which means we are often lost in our own world of wondering what a persons means by what they say?If Im ON then I can read my audience but depending on many things Im just as lost as the next guy so here I am with you because someone read me and thinks you can figure me out. I really like it that youre taking notes  and we both laughed at the same time. That made me feel good and it looked like it made here feel good. Liked by johnhans Follow Report

Ive always enjoyed them as pets, and my wife has usually had a cat.My life went upside down in 2005. I was falling into a really deep depression and made multiple suicide attempts. I kept thinking Id hit bottom, but then Id go down deeper and darker. I admitted myself to a small facility for survivors of suicide attempts, and stayed for 6 weeks, until I felt like Id be safe again. I wasnt really, but life went on. I retired and began therapy, and after a couple of years I talked with my therapist about training my dog to be a service dog. I had an Aussie/Border Collie mix, who was a wonderful dog, and after working with him for over a year, he became my service animal.Barnabas went everywhere with me, and was of great service to me with depression, PTSD and suicidal thoughts. Everybody loved him. But last year at Valentines, he had a stroke or some other brain event, a week after a checkup at the vets, where I was told he had years left in him (he was only 9). That was really hard, especially since I didnt have a therapist right then, and couldnt get one until a year later. That was an 18 month stretch without a therapist, and the last six were pretty dark. I was fortunate to find my next dog at our local humane shelter, a few weeks after Barnabas died. Sadie had just been brought in that day because the people had too many dogs, and decided to return her to the shelter. She was fearful and skittish, but I felt an immediate bond with her. We left her alone for a couple of days, so she could become comfortable in our home, with us, and with my wifes little dog, Pete. After a year, shes joined to me at the hip. If I go outside, she follows, and comes in when I do. We have ten acres, so she has lots of room to run, rodents to catch, cows and horses to herd  they either ignore her or run her off  but she always comes back to me and sits down near me and watches me work in the yard. If Im kneeling, she sits right in front of me for some petting. Shes very attentive, obedient and therapeutic for me. When Im extra depressed or feeling the anxiety level rising, she lies in my lap and the pressure of the weight of her body provides calming therapy on my torso, for as long as I need her.One challenge of having a service dog is public ignorance. Everytime we go out, someone asks if they can pet her (No), or just pets her without asking. If they dont pet her, they talk to her, which is pretty much the same as petting because theyre drawing her attention away from me. Cesar teaches dont touch, dont talk, dont make eye contact.An issue Ive been dealing with is lack of understanding of the difference between service and therapy dogs. A service dog serves only its handler. A therapy dog is trained to serve others, such as in hospitals, to provide calming therapy for people. I was asked to have Sadie certified as a therapy dog, but I couldnt agree to it because of the differing purposes of the service and therapy animals. For 5 years, I was a Hospice volunteer, visiting patients for an hour a week, in their homes, in the hospital, in care homes  wherever they were. A few had house pets, so I left my dog in the car during the visit (always in safe, shaded places, with water). Every other patient loved having my dog come with me to visit them. I made an exception to the no pet rule with hospice patients because it meant so much to them. I had to resign a few months ago because they wrote a set of guidelines that specifies only certified therapy dogs could go with volunteers. I hated to give up that volunteer job. I think it helped me get out and interact with others, and it gave me a chance to give out to those who have a real need. How has a pet or animal helped you? Share your story with us. Of course, Sadies more than a pet, though she is that, too, but she provides the companionship of a pet, the devotion and unconditional love. Ill try to share pictures of Barnabas (brown and white) and Sadie (black and white). (Sorry I couldnt change the orientation of the picture of Sadie.)

Guess Ill get straight to the point 13 year old female (turning 14 soon) who has undiagnosed ADHD and shows possible depression symptoms. Parents both are diagnosed with ADHD, have shown ADHD symptoms before the age of 12, and still struggle with symptoms as of now. If I had to guess, Id say I have the Combination Presentation (Inattention & Hyperactivity/Impulsive). I show symptoms of both inattention and hyperactivity  the former being unable to properly focus often, getting distracted easily (even when its something I have to get done), and daydreaming far more than should be appropriate (waste hours of my life doing this, even when theres more important things to be done). Pace often (coupled with daydreaming), cant sit still, mind is always racing, and tend to blurt whatevers on my mind, along with a lot of extreme gestures while talking. With that ADHD note, I am uncertain where my constant daydreaming is a symptom of my ADHD, perhaps a larger issue, or both. As I mentioned before, I waste hours of my life daydreaming, even if theres things I need to get done. I blast music in my earbuds and pace. Im told I make facial expressions and sounds while daydreaming, which isnt something that people with ADHD seem to complain about  although it seems like something I would be more likely to struggle with, due to my ADHD. Ive heard of the term Maladaptive Daydreaming, but I dont daydream of worlds or make up entire storylines or plot. I dont make my own fictional characters in my head, nor do I imagine an idealized version of myself. I would say I daydream of fictional characters Ive read or watched through media going through emotional conflicts  it is not a storyline or a full plot; it is a section of a plot, the climax, with no other added details. I would like to know what other people think of this issue, and if theres anything that can be done to improve it. I think I may have developed it as an unhealthy coping mechanism, but Im unsure how to go about improving it. I have nothing against daydreaming in itself; its a wonderful thing. But now it is interfering with my schoolwork and daily life, as I find myself procrastinating both relationships and work in order to daydream. Finally, the main crux of what I want to talk about: My depression symptoms. Im not comfortable with self-diagnosing depression. It is a very real, serious condition that hurts people  even people that I currently know and love  and I would hate to invalidate the struggles of people who go through it if I dont actually suffer from it. Its why I am so hesitant in even professing the idea that I could have depression, perhaps a mild form of it, because Im scared of invalidating other peoples experiences. The fact of it is that Ive been showing depression symptoms for a while now, and Im not sure how to feel about it. Ive gone through a lot as of late, so I would be valid in being stressed or sad about recent events. To tl;dr of it: Briefly moved to another country, withdrew from an online community of friends after an argument with one of the main friends in said community (didnt feel comfortable there anymore), learned about my ADHD when my parents told me that I most likely had it but never knew before that time, got into a relationship that inevitably failed once said guy got into another relationship and told me after the fact (he was polyamorous and we never had the conversation about it until then), and am currently in a very unstable living situation, as I am unsure of where my parents and I are going to travel next or where well be staying long-term. With all that, it would be natural for me to be upset or stressed or sad. Im aware of that. And yet, when I think about whats causing me distress, its not those things  Its me. Im upset, not because of what Im going through (although I am not fine with these events, they arent the main struggle), but because of who I am as a person. I feel like a failure, useless, a burden, and that all I can do is take from other people, no matter how hard I try to do good.  That last one probably stems from my falling out with the friend I mentioned earlier. They told me I was untrustworthy, unintentionally two-faced, and a person who takes from others in her pursuit to try to help everyone. I feel like their words have become a part of my mental dialogue, now. I dont know. I think Ive been oversleeping, eating more than usual, and I feel tired, all the time. But not a physical tiredness; a mental tiredness that doesnt go away, no matter what. Its a heavy nothing that follows me everywhere, and theres moments where Ill feel better  distracting myself with friends or my daydreaming habit  but the second those things stop, it washes over me all over again. I dont know what to do about it. I feel worthless, like a waste of space. Im guilty a lot, even for things Ive got no reason to be. Ive gotten passive suicidal ideation, different from active. And I dont know, because Im terrible at self-awareness. I dont know, because with all my distractions, its possible that this has worsened over time, with the more I ignored it and the more I used my daydreaming as a coping mechanism to feel better, instead of actually addressing what was going on. And now Now, Im overdue on schoolwork, on the brink of tears because I feel so pathetic, and I just. Need advice, help, something. My friends who I have talked to about this comment that it seems like a very mild form of depression, considering that Im still able to function, but still showcase these depression symptoms. Heck, despite being told by two of my friends who suffer from depression themselves that its okay for me to call it such or that they even think its possible I have it and that that it doesnt invalidate their experiences at all, Im scared. I got a therapist appointment in June, I think, but my parents seem to be of the impression thats its for an ADHD diagnosis only. Its only an hour long, and I dont think Ill have future, consistent ones besides that one, considering how shaky my living situation is right now. Should I talk to them about me showcasing depression symptoms, as well? I dont know if well have time to really go over it, or if Ill be able to find help right away, though. I would say the depression symptoms began a year ago, got better with the relationship I had, and then fell right back into that hole of darkness again. And then I had a period where I felt better, and then crashed for no particular reason, and am now right back here again. What should I do? What should I think? What do you guys think? I need some outside advice here.I would really appreciate any input, so thanks in advance for anyone who bothers to reply to this mess, haaaa.If more context or information is needed, just let me know. (Also, Im new here, so if this is posted in the wrong area, let me know, and Ill move it.) Liked by Mamacita, Volunteer Mentor, Ginger, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

How sharing kindness can make you healthier & happier. Can simply sharing kindness on a regular basis help your health? Research says yes, in more ways than you might guess. By Mayo Clinic Staff You've heard the uplifting stories: Passersby dropping scads of cash into charity collection buckets or anonymous donors paying off hospital bills for strangers. And people helping victims during storms and natural disasters. These acts of kindness make everybody feel good. There's a science behind that phenomenon called ""loving kindness."" And research shows that learning and practicing loving kindness can profoundly affect your attitude, outlook and even your health. Better yet, you can rewire your brain to be more present and kinder to others, giving your mood a daily boost. These three simple practices will help get you started. 1. Loving-kindness meditation (LKM). LKM is a quiet, contemplative practice that focuses thought on your heart region and encourages warm, tender thoughts, possibly about a loved one. In one study, people who practiced LKM an hour a week felt greater positive emotions  love, contentment, joy  while interacting with others. Documented health benefits of practicing LKM include: Reduced pain and tension from migraines Reduced symptoms of depression Possibly slowing the aging process. Studies have found that women who practice LKM have longer telomeres, which are like little end-caps on your DNA. Shorter telomeres have been associated with faster aging. Maybe the best news is that even small doses of LKM can help. One study found that a 10-minute session of LKM increased feelings of social connection and positive feelings toward others. 2. Acts of kindness. This one's so simple: Intentionally set a goal to be kinder to others. Express sincerely felt kindness to a co-worker. Make a special effort to extend kind words to a neighbor. Hold the elevator for someone or take time to help a loved one. As you spread your kindness, you might just experience what research has confirmed: Generosity can be contagious. Why? The act of helping others actually activates the part of your brain that makes you feel pleasure. It also releases a hormone called oxytocin that helps modulate social interactions and emotion  the higher your oxytocin levels, the more generous you may be. Food for thought: Reportedly, one person in Winnipeg, Manitoba, picked up the tab for the next car in line at a coffee-and-sandwich drive-through. This inspired the next person to do to the same. The chain continued for an astonishing 226 customers! Seems like research supports the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. The kinder you act toward others, the better you will feel. 3. Focus on gratitude. Do you feel grateful for the good things in your life? If not, it's time to start. Researchers have found that feelings of thankfulness can help improve sleep, diminish fatigue, increase confidence and even lessen depression. One way to increase your feelings of gratitude is to start journaling. Keeping a gratitude journal  just writing down things you're grateful for  has been found to actually improve biological markers that indicate heart health. Don't want to carry a notebook? There are plenty of phone apps that can help you express gratitude or share happy moments. Like anything else, engaging in loving kindness gets easier with practice. Try thinking positive thoughts about people in your life. Write down the things you're grateful for this week. Set aside 10 minutes to meditate. You may just find a happier, healthier you. As all of you have shown much kindness and caring for each other, I knew you would appreciate these thoughts and that you would have great stories about kindness. So, let's take some time to share! Could you share how you practice a loving kindness meditation? Is it through your art, your words, phone calls or notes that you write to others? Will you share Acts of Kindness that you have either received or given? Gratitude: How do you focus on gratitude? Do you keep a journal, do you acknowledge gratitude when you see and hear it in action? I can't wait to hear your thoughts!

How sharing kindness can make you healthier & happier. Can simply sharing kindness on a regular basis help your health? Research says yes, in more ways than you might guess. By Mayo Clinic Staff You've heard the uplifting stories: Passersby dropping scads of cash into charity collection buckets or anonymous donors paying off hospital bills for strangers. And people helping victims during storms and natural disasters. These acts of kindness make everybody feel good. There's a science behind that phenomenon called ""loving kindness."" And research shows that learning and practicing loving kindness can profoundly affect your attitude, outlook and even your health. Better yet, you can rewire your brain to be more present and kinder to others, giving your mood a daily boost. These three simple practices will help get you started. 1. Loving-kindness meditation (LKM). LKM is a quiet, contemplative practice that focuses thought on your heart region and encourages warm, tender thoughts, possibly about a loved one. In one study, people who practiced LKM an hour a week felt greater positive emotions  love, contentment, joy  while interacting with others. Documented health benefits of practicing LKM include: Reduced pain and tension from migraines Reduced symptoms of depression Possibly slowing the aging process. Studies have found that women who practice LKM have longer telomeres, which are like little end-caps on your DNA. Shorter telomeres have been associated with faster aging. Maybe the best news is that even small doses of LKM can help. One study found that a 10-minute session of LKM increased feelings of social connection and positive feelings toward others. 2. Acts of kindness. This one's so simple: Intentionally set a goal to be kinder to others. Express sincerely felt kindness to a co-worker. Make a special effort to extend kind words to a neighbor. Hold the elevator for someone or take time to help a loved one. As you spread your kindness, you might just experience what research has confirmed: Generosity can be contagious. Why? The act of helping others actually activates the part of your brain that makes you feel pleasure. It also releases a hormone called oxytocin that helps modulate social interactions and emotion  the higher your oxytocin levels, the more generous you may be. Food for thought: Reportedly, one person in Winnipeg, Manitoba, picked up the tab for the next car in line at a coffee-and-sandwich drive-through. This inspired the next person to do to the same. The chain continued for an astonishing 226 customers! Seems like research supports the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. The kinder you act toward others, the better you will feel. 3. Focus on gratitude. Do you feel grateful for the good things in your life? If not, it's time to start. Researchers have found that feelings of thankfulness can help improve sleep, diminish fatigue, increase confidence and even lessen depression. One way to increase your feelings of gratitude is to start journaling. Keeping a gratitude journal  just writing down things you're grateful for  has been found to actually improve biological markers that indicate heart health. Don't want to carry a notebook? There are plenty of phone apps that can help you express gratitude or share happy moments. Like anything else, engaging in loving kindness gets easier with practice. Try thinking positive thoughts about people in your life. Write down the things you're grateful for this week. Set aside 10 minutes to meditate. You may just find a happier, healthier you. As all of you have shown much kindness and caring for each other, I knew you would appreciate these thoughts and that you would have great stories about kindness. So, let's take some time to share! Could you share how you practice a loving kindness meditation? Is it through your art, your words, phone calls or notes that you write to others? Will you share Acts of Kindness that you have either received or given? Gratitude: How do you focus on gratitude? Do you keep a journal, do you acknowledge gratitude when you see and hear it in action? I can't wait to hear your thoughts!

Ive been on a million different meds, tried so many different therapies. Right now, ketamine treatments or ECT are the only two options any of my docs can think of that might help because I am so treatment-resistant (evidently). Although I do my best to exercise, expose myself with anxiety, practice healthy coping tools, Ive developed a dependence on a few drugs (kratom, Adderall, and Klonopin. the former two are prescribed to me, and kratom I can legally buy OTC where I live). I feel like its the only way I can get through every day, and at night time its even worse. I have no passion, no motivation, no matter how much effort I put into trying to change things and cope with things. Its EXHAUSTING. and expensive.

Im not living for myself, Im only still here out of guilt, because if I ended my life it would hurt those who care about me and depend on me. But Im just getting too tired.

60,C0423086,Staring,"C0683369, C0085593","Clouded consciousness, Chills",https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/adhd/,Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD),"I recently stared my freshman year of high school. Talkative and excessively hyper are words that have always been closely assosciated with me. Also, lack of attention was a topic often talked about between my teachers parents, and a goal they often set for me. My parents, who I dont blame whatsoever, dismissed these as issues requiring a doctor and figured I would grow out of this, which makes sense considering these were in my elementary days. Now, atleast 4 years later, I still experience all of these issues and more, at a heightened amount. As far as attention, I feel like I have no choice and fall victum to it. I can be paying attention to the most interesting thing and boom, my imagination swoops me out of wherever and I cant pull my head out of the sky until it falls. I never felt weird in my hyperness, but my friends would often be like chill and I would be confused because I didnt realize I wasnt being chill. Anyways, to sum things up, I think I might talk to my parents and pediatrician, but I dont want it to to seem like a cry for attention or such sorts. Should I talk to my parents/doctor about it or is this a normal experience for high schoolers? If I should seek help about this, I dont really know how to. How do I?

Unfortunately, the testing results showed that, because the test didnt provide any answers for diagnosis. They said my results showed Im confused. So Im having to go through deeper evaluation using the DSM with my therapist. Has anyone else had this experience? With psychological testing only providing more confusion, instead of answers? Thanks so much. Im even more confused because Im very high functioning  my friends and family believe nothing is wrong, Im a high performer at work, but I know something is very , extremely off.

About a year ago, I had to put my little dog down .. she was a Cavalier, King Charles Spaniel, who was rescued from a puppy mill  she was 4 and had given birth to multiple liters. She never got out of the crate, and the day after I took her the mill was going to shoot her because she was no long producing what they wanted. She was a tri-color, and had the classical heart murmur. All Cavaliers have that, I guess from poor breeding practices .. goes from level 1 to level 5. She was 11 when I had to put her to sleep. Well, you all know all the moving Ive been doing  MD to VA, then another place in VA (which is quite unsafe Im finding out). I have not been happy since I left my condo in MD. Id lived in the Frederick, MD area for 30 years, and that move was a big mistake (now I know!). Well, I have 2 cats, but I so much miss that little girl. Its been a year now, and I still cant look at her picture without tearing up. So, Ive been in touch with a Cavalier rescue group that lives quite close to where I used to live in MD, and Im just praying that I can find one that I can both afford and whose murmur isnt passed 2. Im lonesome . I have a neighbor who is a friend and she has a dog. My kids are great people, and do what they can and have time for to either come over, bring me some food, or go somewhere with me, but they all have lives and families and I cannot expect them to fill in the gap. Im used to taking in a puppy mill rescue, as my Molly was afraid of grass when I got her, I had to teach her how to walk up steps, and for a long time anytime someone lifted an arm to scratch their head or anything like that, shed duck and run. Obviously, shed been abused along with everything else. I so hope I can get one .. I need a loyal friend down here, and one of them would be perfect. abby Liked by Teresa, Volunteer Mentor, Jim, Volunteer Mentor, Gail, Alumna Mentor, Parus ... see all Follow Report"

Im a little confused on how these all relate to one another and where the bipolar fits in. Is there someone who can clarify  is bipolar autoimmune? Is it a form of central sensitization? Is it both? Neither? So confused.  Thanks! Follow Report"

I had to put her down last year . she was 11. Well, that took forever to get passed, but this weekend I bought a border collie (3 months), the cutest little face. I thought I was getting her from a family who had special quarters for their breeding program .. was I ever wrong. When I turned in the driveway I should have backed right out .. behind the house it was a hoarders paradise .giant mess doesnt even cover iteverything from old tires, big metal rims all over, refrigerators, washing machines .. you get the picture. I wont go into the whole thing, but I did wind up getting a little black and white female .. BIG mistake. I told him I was taking her to my Vet. in the AM and did he have papers to show that I bought her from him . no he didnt. Stupid me. I got her home, fed her and took her out, and sat in my rocking chair holding her, scratching her belly, and just loving on her..so cute. Well, as I was doing this I noticed a necklace of ticks all the way around her neck, attached. And fleas galore! The ticks were all over her body also. I called my Vet. in the AM and they got me right in. The Vet. tech. said they must have taken 100 ticks off of her, and the fleas were just hopping all over the place. Both the Vets there examined her, shed had no shots yet, and they said that while she seemed to be OK then, there very likely would be things crop up within the year. They called him for some questioning, which he answered vaguely . they were very angry with him and I was angry with myself for being so stupid. They gave her the shots she needed, a pill for the fleas and ticks, and dipped her quickly in some watery solution for the jumping fleas. I didnt know what to do . I was so upset. I didnt want to take her back to that guy because Id be putting her right back in the same situation, I thought of the SPCA because down here they really check potential buyers out thoroughly. Then the Vet said, wait, I have an idea. And off she scurried, dog in her arms, all the while I was sniveling .. its just been too much this week. She said that one of their Techs. had been looking for another border collie (they have 2) as their family has a farm and the dogs just love to run, chase vermon, etc .. they need lots of exercise. She came out holding the dog, and here it was a early 20 year old Mennonite girl whose family raise beef and corn. I knew her well from going there for so long. OMG, I couldnt believe it. I signed off and gave her the dog. I knew shed have a good home and have lots of room to run. What is it with this place? Everything I try to do down here falls flat on its face, ever since I left MD and moved to VA. Oh how I want to go home, but I cant  my condo has been sold, I cant afford to rent anything up there, and my 2 girls would be devastated if I moved . they love having me here. I wish I had never left MD  Id been there 30 years and its still home to me. abby Liked by Teresa, Volunteer Mentor, Lisa Lucier, Parus Follow Report"

She was admitted after 4 calls to local law enforcement that were a result of her own hallucinations. After stabilizing medications, and a transfer to a more advanced psych unit the second week, she was stable but hostile. She submitted a 72 hour release form against medical advise, and quite honestly I think they were glad to be rid of her as she was disruptive in the unit. They released her with 8 prescriptions and no instructions for myself or my 86 year old dad. Because she is an adult, and she lives alone, privacy laws do not allow us access to her diagnosis, medication instructions, etc. She has now isolated herself due to the spirits as well as hallucinations that she is being watched by people outside with binoculars and is refusing to take her meds or seek medical attention. I live 30 miles from her, have a career, a husband, and truly a life that I love. Obviously, since I am her only sibling and my pop is independent, but elderly and he is a widow, it seems I am the one to take charge of the situation. But that of itself is a challenge. My dad has always rolled with what has always been a demanding sister, he has enabled her every whim for many many years. I expect that her mental illness has been progressing for some time, but has escalated to what it is now. Basically she is terrified and he is in denial due to the shame of mental illness. I can see it clearly, but am not sure where to go from here. She has a history of brain injury and stroke and has been on disability for 16 years. She is refusing MRI. She seems to be constantly reaching to the past and delusional about who is living, dead, and the whos who of the many people she has driven out of her life over the years. Even to the point that she believes an ex husband, who none of us have seen in 20 years and since remarried, is coming to reunite with her. That is just one of the many impossible delusions she has. Anyone else encounter a similar situation? Am I destined to get an attorney and have her committed? Ive not been able to find a peer sibling support group locally in central Ohio. Thats why I landed here in hopes of finding some answers. Thank you for listening and for any support you can give by sharing similar experiences and results.

Unfortunately this means I cant take many commonly prescribed meds, and Im suffering in silence with two really no-fun conditions: ADHD and PMDD (which is PMS thats so serious that it severely disrupts the quality of life: violent mood swings, debilitating anxiety, depression, etc.) Ive been to the Allergy Center at Vanderbilt University in Nashville several times only to be told what I have isnt a true allergy and that they cant help me. The symptoms usually include intense (and frightening) heart palpitations; lengthy bouts of insomnia either caused by palps or on their own; sometimes a high fever; changes in my mental state (confusion, apathy, agitation); occasionally actual hives and throat constriction. (Meanwhile the PMDD is wreaking havoc on its own with significant water retention, intense heartburn/nausea, etc) Ive had a bunch of tests  blood, thyroid, etc. only to be told nothing is wrong while my life, marriage, career, relationships are being decimated by my health problems. Im truly desperate. When you cant take ADHD medications given to five-year-olds and the only options for PMDD are the likes of Lexapro (which made me so lightheaded I couldnt sleep or walk), doctors tend to throw up their hands. It doesnt seem like any are really willing to go out of their way to explore WHY this is happening or what alternative medicines might work. Does anyone know if Mayo may be able to help? My father went there 20 years ago and was diagnosed with an immune condition called Wegeners granulomatosis, although my sense is that my problems are from my mothers side of the family  she has similar issues. One of her sisters has been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, another with diabetes. My mom herself has frequent migraines and has had breast and uterine cancer. Thanks for reading. Sometimes it helps to spell all this out, and to realize Im really not going crazy  but my body is. Follow Report"

Hated the town I was in and $$ was going down quickly, so I moved about a year ago to a low-income apartment complex. Now, please, please dont think Im feeling like Im better than these folks, because I realize that in Gods eyes were all the same. There are so many problems in just my building, and Im sure the others also, that its very upsetting. Children run random like wild animals, jumping up and down on the A/C unit, run through the hallways screaming all hours of the night and day, and the older kids try to aim directly for us when theyre on their bikes. Every Sat. PM, theres a real drug-fest in the building across from me, and the other night I was awakened by the sound of a gun. The management knows all of this, but seems to be helpless to do anything. Also, theres a police officer living in my building, but I guess when hes off, he really is off. Cant say I blame him. Often there are 4 police cars out front hauling someone away .. a drunk, drug addict, or the woman downstairs who is schizophrenic and not taking her meds. There are people here, very elderly and frail who seem to have no one checking in on them, so Ive been doing that weekly, a 36 year old woman who has the mental capacity of a 12 year old. The other night I had a knock on the door for me to take a young girl to the ER  chest pains  they should have called the ambulance, but no they didnt want to. So I stupidly took her, plus 4 other people. Theres a guy here that is in and out of jail, going from friend to friend . his family kicked him out. So, now, I pretty much stay in my bedroom, on the far end of my apt. I make my dinner and come back here. I have my door locked, a deadbolt, and a heavy metal thick rod that goes under my door knob, and as soon as I eat dinner, its lights out except for back here. Even with my meds., my anxiety is through the roof, and Ive had to take melatonin to sleep. When I try to tell my kids about it, they chuckle and say, oh, wow, thats funny. No, its not funny at all. Id rather just go to sleep and not wake up than live with this fear. Why oh why did I ever move from MD? It was a huge mistake, but its too late now. abby Liked by Parus, Lorraine Follow Report"

Way back when I was in 6th or 7th grade, all the girls were wearing saddle shoes. I desperately wanted a pair . after a lot of begging, my alcoholic parents finally relented. So, one night, the 3 of us went to a shoestore and I got those saddle shoes .. BUT the saddle part was not black or brown . instead it was RED PLAID and they had THICK RED FOAM SOLES, obviously making me stand out like a sore thumb. Well, the other day, I ordered a pair of real saddle shoes from Zappos, and they came today. I love them! So, here I am, a 73 year old woman, with purple and blue stripes in her hair, wearing saddle shoes and walking a dog who is probably very long with short legs!

Probably many of you are familiar with Dr. Amit Sood, a psychiatrist at Mayo. This is a free online program that addresses the issue of happiness. Here is what Dr. Sood says about this program. Dear friends, You and I face one common enemy  suffering. Pain, physical or emotional, when it becomes unbearable, is experienced as suffering. Pain is unavoidable, but suffering is optional. My goal is to help you find a path so you can bypass suffering in this life. One reward of traversing that journey is finding greater happiness. Happiness is a habit. Some of us are innately happy. But most others have to choose. We often, however, dont realize we have that choice. We also dont know how to exercise that choice. As a result, we push happiness away. Let that not happen to you. Join me, if you wish, to spend the next week of your life, choosing greater happiness. Each day, youll be guided to a practice that can make you happier. To enroll, youll need to register with your name and email address to connect with us for the next week. Select Happiness: A One Week Journey, below for more information.

I want even talk about everything that bipolar has done to my life in one entry. it would be easier for me to break up into sections of some kind. Right now I just want to give out a big hello and so glad I found this site. So far I think its great! I was diagnosed in 1999 with bipolar1, severe, PTSD, & panic disorder. I also suffer from multiple sclerosis, lupus, and degenerative scoliosis. I told my mom the other day that out of all my illnesses that by far my bipolar hurts me the worse. Not just mentally but physically as well. There is not one corner of my life that this sorry disease has not slithered into. And it never fails that when one disease flairs up, mania is there to aggravate it/me! and I just get sicker until I cant hide it anymore and off to the hospital I go. I have been admitted to the psych ward over 30 times since it reared its ugly head. I guess one of the first things that bipolar did was make me sexually permissive. Then eventually I ended marrying two wrong abusive guys. I didnt fight back I just curled up into the fetal position until they got tired of kicking me. I didnt fight back even though I have a 2nd degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do, they were still bigger, stronger and in their anger crazier than me. I was afraid they would end up killing me. So I havent been with a guy since 1998. Im now 50 and all that past violence leaves a deep scar that never goes away. My bipolar illness reminds me of it all the time. So thats one area of my life that bipolar has effected my life and that is social friendships, having someone hold you when your scared or in pain. I do a lot of research and from what I read as I grow older bipolar will only make my golden years nothing but pure hell. I get scared just thinking about them. So to sum things up which im sure I didnt make clear cause im stupid like that is Im scared and lonely and in pain. Life stinks, and getting old, knowing what is in store for me really stink! I just dont want to die alone not knowing who I am or who my family is. So tell me what has bipolar done to u in youre life. It dont have to be just bad. I would love to hear something good today.

I was in MD this week, helping a girlfriend who is recovering from eye surgery, and when I got home, I felt like I could collapse .. so very tired. This morning I ate breakfast, sat in my chair to watch a bit of TV, and went out like a light. I know a lot of these meds. can do that, but I try to counteract it with a fistful of vitamins. Some days I dont even feel like dressing, so I just stay in my nightclothes all day. Re. suicide, which I read someone was talking about here .. Ive felt that many times  never told a soul. I had a plan so that if things got too bad, I knew what I would do. But, since my kids dont want to hear anything about mental health, I no longer even try. Makes me feel very alone. Ive told my therapist about this, but when he asks if I have a plan, I say no. (lie) I dont really feel there is anyone I can talk to down here who wont just turn me off, or give me some flip answer like oh, youll be fine, Mom. They have no idea and dont seem to want to know. My therapist and Psychiatrist are both in MD and I go up every 2 weeks to see my therapist and my Psychiatrist about every 6 weeks. Ive invited my kids to come along, sit in on one of my sessions with my therapist so perhaps he could get through to them what I deal with daily, but none of them are willing to do that. It seems they just dont want to know. abby Follow Report"

Anyhow, I think Ive been through the whole thing about moving from MD to VA because my girls live down here and theyve been wanting me to move down for several years. Id been in MD 30 plus years and had my own condo (me and the bank). Well, I am so sorry I moved  Im obviously not a young chick (71), was divorced about 10 years ago which was traumatic, and since then I had a knee replacement and then 2 years later had to have a revision  which is having it done all over again with a new part. My dog died just about 2 months ago, and where I live is essentially a college town. The closest church like mine in MD is 1-1/2 hrs. away. Everything that was important to me, except for my family, is in MD .. my neighborhood, my friends, my church, essentially my nest.I have Bipolar II with the emphasis on the depression. I never feel up . flat is a good day. I have been struggling with some serious depression for months now and with winter coming . well, its worse. I still go up to MD every other week to see my therapist and my Psychiatrist.My kids say, get out, go do something! That sounds fine, but I dont know my way around anywhere here, I have no money to spend  Im in a debt consolidation program; they say volunteer .. sounds good too but I can barely get out of bed in the morning. Its gotten so bad that when I wake up, I make a hot cup of tea and immediately take my meds., watch the weather and a bit of news until the meds kick in. Only then do I even care about getting dressed. My kids, of course, dont want to hear it. Like their Dad (well 2 of them anyhow), just get moving is the answer. Sure, I would if I could.I hate it here . Im giving it til Spring and if nothing changes, Im going home. I essentially live on S.S. and some money my son gives me each month, so I dont even ever fill the gas tank anymore. I dont use CCs because of being in the debt consolidation program, so I pay for everything with cash or a check. Thats OK, I dont mind that, but none of this would have happened if I had stayed where I was happy.Thanks for listening.abby Follow Report"

Ive been seeing my therapist for 12 years and a Psychiatrist for about as long. I wont go into detail, but I was an only child in a very sick, alcoholic family . all of them way back the maternal side. Life was not fun . I lived in total terror because I knew my mother was going to pack my suitcase and put it on the porch when I came home from school and I should just get the h___ out. In my 7 year old mind, I knew she meant it. I spent the weekends at bars . those old beer smelling, foul languaged, joints they had years ago, and I hated it. Abuse .. physical, sexual, emotional (you rotten little SOB), mental  I lived 100% of the time in total fear, often hiding under my bed. I had no friends as I rarely took a bath or brushed my teeth. My therapist is convinced, even though he has not interviewed my mother since she died at age 60 from liver failure, that she was Bipolar I .. and now here I am Bipolar II.For me its heavily on the depressed part of the line . I rarely wake up feeling good, alive, and ready for the day.. The up part for me is not the manic state often thought of in Bipolar I, but its more a very high state of anxiety.. The meds. I take help that so its bearable to get through another day.I am glad to have found you all .. I have no friends down here, go nowhere and have no oomph to do so . and sadly, my kids totally avoid anything even edging on anything about mental health . no matter where it comes from. So here I am 3-4 hours from where I lived up til a year ago and loved, in a place I dont like, and feeling worse than ever.Another pity party, I know, and Im so sorry ..

In the early 2000s I was diagnosed with Depression and was placed on Ativan. After moving to a new location and getting a new psychiatrist, he started to wean me off of the Ativan. He didnt do it right and I went into a very bad withdrawal. I dropped that psychiatrist (had him fired) and ended up with my current female psychiatrist. Since then I have had two hospitalizations and have multiple drugs prescribed and changed to where I am no longer on any anti-depressants. I have suffered multiple serious side effects from taking and going off of these drugs. Sleeping is very difficult for me and I am taking Clonzepam 1mg along with 300mg of Trazadone for sleep. I am very restless sleeping and dont feel like I slept well when I wake up. I havent felt like myself for years now and my psychiatrist says I wont feel like I did when I was on Ativan. When I was on that for several years and had energy and the will to live life to the fullest. Now I think of dying every day (wont do that as I am afraid of dying) and just dont have the desire to do anything. I used to have pride in the way I looked and dressed and now I dont care. The drugs I was on made me gain weight so my clothes dont fit right and I havent had the desire to go shopping. My husband is now my caretaker in some respects as I have no desire to do anything. I have to force myself to get up from my chair everyday to just do the smallest of tasks. My feeling is that there isnt any medication or therapy that has helped me and I am about at the end of my rope. There isnt any true information that my Multiple Sclerosis is contributing to what is going on with me at least that is what my neurologist ang psychiatrist say. They just dont know. I have what they call Benign MS so I am not wheelchair bound. Is there any hope for me? I need help but I dont know what to do. Can anyone out there help me? Follow Report"

Since June, I have been dealing with a boyfriend who is addicted to cough medicine, and more specifically, dexomethorphan HCl. He says he takes cough syrup in excess because it produces similar effects to smoking marijuana, however, I think otherwise. Hes had a history of abusing substances, and says hes tried many different substances in his past, and hes only 18. Hes been an inpatient twice at different rehabilitation facilities, and an outpatient rehab three times a week now until January. And yet, he still uses. I feel like his mother more than this girlfriend most of the time. He doesnt like to keep a tidy room, doesnt like to do the little chores of daily life that (I think) make a person content with life. He often states that he misses smoking weed, and how he wishes he didnt have to go to treatment and give a UA each week. This is why he says he uses dexomethorphan (DXM), or cough syrup  it wont show up in a drug test, and it heightens his sensitivity to, and enjoyment of music. I think this is ridiculous. He has used DXM several times without telling me, and I found out a few weeks ago that hes actually been in contact with his ex girlfriend, whom he told me he had severed ties with as shes absolutely crazy. I have since found out about all of those little shortcomings. Ive given him chance after chance to stop lying to me, stop using, and to be honest and true to me, but he seems incapable. The worst part of having an addict boyfriend, especially this one, is that I love him. When things are good between us and his addiction is under (some) control, things are wonderful. We are happy together, we laugh, we talk, we bond. But then when things get bad and I have to find out about him having used DXM one night its bad. I feel so betrayed. Even worse is that he loves me so very much, and when I get mad at him and start talking about a break up, his tears always ruin me. He begs me not to break up with him. He says he cant do this addiction thing without me, that he needs me, that he needs my support and my love to get through this. He says hes not going to use again because it hurts me so much, but hes said that before, and then used only a few short weeks later It seems that my support, love, and compassion arent the things that he needs, or at least, not enough. I guess Im looking for support here. I know its over between us it has to be. Im a full time nursing student and I need to be focusing on the copious amounts of work and clinical activities. But Im just so sad. I feel like Im abandoning him when he needs me the most, but then I remember that I need someone that I can count on and trust, and I realize that with addicts, the cycle of behavior repeats itself over and over again, and that I cant fix him. I need support, I suppose. I feel so guilty, like Im going to ruin him. But I cant do this anymore.

Contributions!Yet, for the common person, it appears that more and more others have been trying to box us into one category and I fully disagree with these impossed categorical limitations = defining who we are!Please, no matter where you are in life do not allow others to tell you who you are nor what youre worth.I, vividly recall when I graduated with an MSW a colleague telling me to my face you were never meant to be a social worker. I could not believe what I was hearing let alone feel so demoralized especially since I already had the job title because my colleagues with the same titles only had undergraduate degrees, where doing social work but I, the ill one, with an advanced degree was never meant? ????I cannot respect people as such. They are a disappointment to human kind.However, regardless of the sting and the sad reality that employers discriminate against us I stand firm!I am worthy of everything I aspire to do and my illness does not, nor, will it ever define who I am and neither will an insensitive and biased personWe may not always feel great but we have names, careers, goals, relationships, and illnesses but this is representative of the human population.Lets not become immune to labels and always remember that no matter what the circumstances if we respect others we should expect the same.In solidarity against stigma, oppression and discrimination :+) Liked by Roxie43, malendaa, China, Iraku ... see all Follow Report"

Are you experiencing enormous amounts of added stresses that exacerbate your condition and make you feel anxious all the time? PTSD is a medical disorder that sadly has profound effects on the individuals life. I recently found out, by one of my providers that panic attacks can even occur when we are sleeping. I never knew this but it explained why I get up in the middle of the night feeling like my breathing has stopped and I need air. I sleep with a fan in my face year round for aging reasons so Im getting plenty of air. I also participated in a sleep study to ensure that I did not have Sleep Apnea but I dont. Waking up like this is very scary and at times Im afraid of falling asleep. Im glad that I mentioned it to one of my psychiatrists because not knowing what was happening was inducing even more discomfort and anxiety. When we are the victims of traumatic experiences and/ or are re-traumatized life can become so uncomfortable but please keep in mind that; If, we were strong enough to survive the traumatic experience/s we are all the more powerful in our continued efforts to heal! Our faith will be tested as well as our self worth but dont waiver my friends because we are survivors and this too will be an opportunity for us to show just how passionate we are about deserving meaningful lives.

It Almost Ended My World,"Do you know of someone who has been made to feel worthless by a boss, company,or a culture; that promotes and rewards cruelty to human beings? Do you think its o.k. to go to work, work hard and be intentionally hurt by workplace bullies who abuse their power? Just like bullying in classrooms/schools is leading to bullycides and a host of psychological issues for our youth, adults in the workplace across the world are also suffering. Workplace, discrimination and retaliation (if you report the sometimes unlawful behaviors):Robs an individual of their self worth, causes enormous amounts of stress, exacerbates pre-existing health conditions, can limit ones career growth, results in the hard work one does not being recognized and can also include defamation of character, slander, hostile and unhealthy work environments and even SUICIDE! Sometimes the behavior can be subtle but the abuser knows exactly what he or she is doing. Often the abuser is manipulative and convinces individuals who they perceive as weak to do the dirty work for them so when the behavior is finally reported they are protected. *****Please visit; http://www.change.org/petitions/workplace***** Please sign this petition and together lets put an end to a behavior that should never be accepted nor encouraged.

I couldnt focus on the game because my skin, lungs, eyes and nose were burning, my muscles felt as though they were draining off my body in long and painfully clumps, there were wavy lines traveling through my body, my head felt as though snakes were crawling inside my skull and at random spots they would bite my brain creating a stabbing pressure that abated to a dull throb. My eyes were blurring and I got sleepier as I sat in my seat. Throughout the duration of the football game I was having a conversation with the voice in my head that kept telling me that I was stupid for not being able to watch the game just like everyone else. It kept pointing out that: this person and that person was having a good time, and I was being my normal self and not wanting to enjoy myself. The voice mocked me by saying: that if there was something really wrong with me then I should be able to get up and leave just like that person was. When I didnt get up, the voice dug in deeper by pointing out that: There was nothing wrong with me, all I wanted was attention. I wanted to get up but I was experiencing conflicting motivations. My body ached so badly that I couldnt fathom the thought of moving and walking up stairs, but as I sat there I kept feeling worse. And I didnt know what to do. When I eventually got up, I walked up and out of the dome and into the concession area to notice that there was a distinct difference in the air quality. I was disoriented and the world around me was moving in directions in opposition to the normal senses (sort of like looking into fun-mirrors at a carnival). It turned out that I sat and listened to the voice for the entire football game because as soon as I got into clearer air my high school band class came out of the dome and it was time to go to our hotel. The next day I was coughing up thick yellow/green/brownish chunks and the center of my chest burned. The symptoms didnt start as soon as I sat down they began the moment my high school wind ensemble stepped on to the field and began to play the Canadian and American National Anthems for a crowd of eager sports fans. I noticed a change in my vision, I felt something form over my entire body and my head felt foggy. We started playing and my hearing became patchy and distant and my body progressed from internally vibrating to a heavy sinking feeling. I couldnt remember the notes to the anthems and at one point I forgot what anthem we were playing so I dropped my left arm and held my flute with my right hand as I slumped to the side in pain and very annoyed at the fact that I couldnt sit down. Sadly, this was most likely televised and many people saw some girl obviously pretending to play her instrument. I probably looked as though I didnt want to be there, but I was in so much pain. This was in the Spring of 2003 and I was out of school for 2 weeks and I didnt feel better until 4 weeks after I got back from a week long trip to Montreal. Over the years I have tried getting help with my situation. I have been told countless times that I just experienced a really bad flu, I had a lung infection, one doctor even told me that what I was experiencing isnt real because from known literature only specific symptoms were ever reported with tobacco exposure. The idea that I was experiencing these symptoms because of my exposure to cigarette and other tobacco products was not an option. And when I found a doctor who would listen to that idea I was told to abstain from the environment or plug my nose and everything would be okay. Those options dont help because I can smell the smoke long before I can see the smoker so I have not defense. And even when I wore a mask the scent would penetrate it and would smell sweeter and have a stronger and longer effect on my body. Over the past two years I have pinned my reactions on commercial chemicals and tobacco products. I had noticed that there were certain foods that I could and couldnt eat when I was effected and I thought that I had an idea of how to defend and protect myself. It was ( and has been difficult) to find support from people when I mention what my ailments stem from and because of that I spiraled into a deep depressive and choatic mental state. It wasnt until 3 months ago that The Environmental Clinic in my area diagnosed me with having multiple chemical sensitivity and referred me to a family physician in my area that dealt with patients with this sensitivity. Now here is the big problem: For the past 12 months I have been having trouble eating. At first it started with eating anything and experiencing intense pain all over my body and a need to sleep that could not be ignored. I went on an elimination diet monitored by myself (as I was discouraged by doctors and didnt want to visit another one) and I took out dairy and gluten and sometimes meat. I thought that I had it under control until the foods that I deemed were appropriate from my functioning created intense pain and the need to sleep. For three days I ate peanuts and cookies. I then realized that gluten and dairy were not my problem because I devoured chocolate cookies for breakfast, lunch and dinner and I was symptom free. I was also noticing that the sharp stabbing pain in my heart, that I had been experiencing since I was about 9 years old, occurred more frequently and lasted much longer. I was now experiencing shortness of breath and numbing/tingling pain in my left arm with each episode(my heart has been monitored for a week, a time, a few times, in high school and the reading showed no abnormalities, I have also been to the hospital and they did a heart reading and that showed normal functioning). Eight months ago I decided that I was going to eat the diary and gluten free diet and sleep whenever I needed to. I wasnt working so I had the luxury of sleeping 8-10 hours at night and an 1 hour here and there when I ate a meal. I finally got an appointment and the Environmental Clinic did their tests and I have a gluten intolerance, I am low in vitamins and a mineral and a few other things are wrong. Here is the bigger problem: Two months ago I realized that I couldnt eat cooked foods, so I cut out meat and quinoa and cooked vegetables from my diet. I was cool with that because I have this notion that my body doesnt produce the right amount of enzymes for proper digestion and I wanted to go on a raw diet. I started my raw diet and started noticing that I couldnt eat certain food items without experiencing tightness in my chest, increased phlegm, wheezing, pain and heat all over my skin (stronger on my chest and back). I then realized that these foods cross related to the food items that I am allergic to. I disregarded the fact that I am sensitive to dark leafy greens and peanuts and tree nuts and made kale/spinach smoothies and ate nuts everyday because I needed to put vitamins and protein in my body. I was experiencing mild symptoms and thought I could live with them. Multivitamins make me feel as though my chest is filling up and my throat feels expanded. I dont understand what that means so I dont take multivitamins. I stopped eating peanuts and tree nuts when my chest started getting tight, phlegmy and I began wheezing and I stopped drinking smoothies when I needed to sleep and my body started to hurt after I started drinking them. Here is the biggest problem: The family physician that I was referred to has not thought to refer me to a dietician and I mentioned from my first visit that all I can eat is peanuts/tree nuts and Kale smoothies. I told her that I have chest tightness and stabbing heart pains. She wondered if I had an EEG, I mentioned the monitoring in high school and I told her that I had a chest x-ray with the Environmental Health Clinic and that they would send my results to her (I havent received a call about the x-ray so I assume that everything is fine). After our first visit she told me that because of my age she doesnt believe that I have anything wrong with my heart or lungs and that my pain is from anxiety. When my blood work was transferred to her she was stunned at my results. She didnt mention anything about my IgE value being in the high 900s when the maximum level is 300 (I know because the Doctor at the Health Clinic told me and ordered a stool test because she believed I could have an intestinal parasite). Im sure there are other puzzling readings from my test but I dont know what they are. I also have a low white blood cell count. The only test this doctor wants is another CBC, but I am not physically well enough to give anymore blood. The blood I gave for her physical disrupted my ability to eat, I was fatigued and in pain for over two weeks and I craved foods that I shouldnt eat but ate because they were the only food I wanted and I paid for it each day. As of this moment the only things I can eat (and honestly I am reacting to it as well but the symptoms are mild) is sprouted buckwheat, avocado and hemp oil. I eat a tablespoon of raw honey to boost my immune system but I react to that as well but I dont know what else to do. I take 5000 IU of liquid vitamin D3 because the doctor mentioned that I might be sensitive to the fillers in vitamins and I am deficient. I purchased Rejuvenate Cell Therapy and have been placing that in my water, I dont feel good each time I take a sip of water, but I need to drink it. I am so fed up with doctors, and people thinking that they know. I wasnt sad until I got to this point in the letter because there is something wrong and I cant get proper help and I believe I am dying and its a waiting game for me right now. I dont go outside unless I need to buy food, because outside smells of car fumes, laundry detergent, shampoos, perfumes, cigarette smoke I asked one doctor if I would have to die before I got help and he said yes. This will help others with similar symptoms to mine and I hope they will get help before it gets really bad. Liked by jodooley Follow Report"

I was now experiencing shortness of breath and numbing/tingling pain in my left arm with each episode(my heart has been monitored for a week, a time, a few times, in high school and the reading showed no abnormalities, I have also been to the hospital and they did a heart reading and that showed normal functioning). Eight months ago I decided that I was going to eat the diary and gluten free diet and sleep whenever I needed to. I wasnt working so I had the luxury of sleeping 8-10 hours at night and an 1 hour here and there when I ate a meal. I finally got an appointment and the Environmental Clinic did their tests and I have a gluten intolerance, I am low in vitamins and a mineral and a few other things are wrong. Here is the bigger problem: Two months ago I realized that I couldnt eat cooked foods, so I cut out meat and quinoa and cooked vegetables from my diet. I was cool with that because I have this notion that my body doesnt produce the right amount of enzymes for proper digestion and I wanted to go on a raw diet. I started my raw diet and started noticing that I couldnt eat certain food items without experiencing tightness in my chest, increased phlegm, wheezing, pain and heat all over my skin (stronger on my chest and back). I then realized that these foods cross related to the food items that I am allergic to. I disregarded the fact that I am sensitive to dark leafy greens and peanuts and tree nuts and made kale/spinach smoothies and ate nuts everyday because I needed to put vitamins and protein in my body. I was experiencing mild symptoms and thought I could live with them. Multivitamins make me feel as though my chest is filling up and my throat feels expanded. I dont understand what that means so I dont take multivitamins. I stopped eating peanuts and tree nuts when my chest started getting tight, phlegmy and I began wheezing and I stopped drinking smoothies when I needed to sleep and my body started to hurt after I started drinking them. Here is the biggest problem: The family physician that I was referred to has not thought to refer me to a dietician and I mentioned from my first visit that all I can eat is peanuts/tree nuts and Kale smoothies. I told her that I have chest tightness and stabbing heart pains. She wondered if I had an EEG, I mentioned the monitoring in high school and I told her that I had a chest x-ray with the Environmental Health Clinic and that they would send my results to her (I havent received a call about the x-ray so I assume that everything is fine). After our first visit she told me that because of my age she doesnt believe that I have anything wrong with my heart or lungs and that my pain is from anxiety. When my blood work was transferred to her she was stunned at my results. She didnt mention anything about my IgE value being in the high 900s when the maximum level is 300 (I know because the Doctor at the Health Clinic told me and ordered a stool test because she believed I could have an intestinal parasite). Im sure there are other puzzling readings from my test but I dont know what they are. I also have a low white blood cell count. The only test this doctor wants is another CBC, but I am not physically well enough to give anymore blood. The blood I gave for her physical disrupted my ability to eat, I was fatigued and in pain for over two weeks and I craved foods that I shouldnt eat but ate because they were the only food I wanted and I paid for it each day. As of this moment the only things I can eat (and honestly I am reacting to it as well but the symptoms are mild) is sprouted buckwheat, avocado and hemp oil. I eat a tablespoon of raw honey to boost my immune system but I react to that as well but I dont know what else to do. I take 5000 IU of liquid vitamin D3 because the doctor mentioned that I might be sensitive to the fillers in vitamins and I am deficient. I purchased Rejuvenate Cell Therapy and have been placing that in my water, I dont feel good each time I take a sip of water, but I need to drink it. I am so fed up with doctors, and people thinking that they know. I wasnt sad until I got to this point in the letter because there is something wrong and I cant get proper help and I believe I am dying and its a waiting game for me right now. I dont go outside unless I need to buy food, because outside smells of car fumes, laundry detergent, shampoos, perfumes, cigarette smoke I asked one doctor if I would have to die before I got help and he said yes. This will help others with similar symptoms to mine and I hope they will get help before it gets really bad. Liked by jodooley Follow Report"

I couldnt focus on the game because my skin, lungs, eyes and nose were burning, my muscles felt as though they were draining off my body in long and painfully clumps, there were wavy lines traveling through my body, my head felt as though snakes were crawling inside my skull and at random spots they would bite my brain creating a stabbing pressure that abated to a dull throb. My eyes were blurring and I got sleepier as I sat in my seat. Throughout the duration of the football game I was having a conversation with the voice in my head that kept telling me that I was stupid for not being able to watch the game just like everyone else. It kept pointing out that: this person and that person was having a good time, and I was being my normal self and not wanting to enjoy myself. The voice mocked me by saying: that if there was something really wrong with me then I should be able to get up and leave just like that person was. When I didnt get up, the voice dug in deeper by pointing out that: There was nothing wrong with me, all I wanted was attention. I wanted to get up but I was experiencing conflicting motivations. My body ached so badly that I couldnt fathom the thought of moving and walking up stairs, but as I sat there I kept feeling worse. And I didnt know what to do. When I eventually got up, I walked up and out of the dome and into the concession area to notice that there was a distinct difference in the air quality. I was disoriented and the world around me was moving in directions in opposition to the normal senses (sort of like looking into fun-mirrors at a carnival). It turned out that I sat and listened to the voice for the entire football game because as soon as I got into clearer air my high school band class came out of the dome and it was time to go to our hotel. The next day I was coughing up thick yellow/green/brownish chunks and the center of my chest burned. The symptoms didnt start as soon as I sat down they began the moment my high school wind ensemble stepped on to the field and began to play the Canadian and American National Anthems for a crowd of eager sports fans. I noticed a change in my vision, I felt something form over my entire body and my head felt foggy. We started playing and my hearing became patchy and distant and my body progressed from internally vibrating to a heavy sinking feeling. I couldnt remember the notes to the anthems and at one point I forgot what anthem we were playing so I dropped my left arm and held my flute with my right hand as I slumped to the side in pain and very annoyed at the fact that I couldnt sit down. Sadly, this was most likely televised and many people saw some girl obviously pretending to play her instrument. I probably looked as though I didnt want to be there, but I was in so much pain. This was in the Spring of 2003 and I was out of school for 2 weeks and I didnt feel better until 4 weeks after I got back from a week long trip to Montreal. Over the years I have tried getting help with my situation. I have been told countless times that I just experienced a really bad flu, I had a lung infection, one doctor even told me that what I was experiencing isnt real because from known literature only specific symptoms were ever reported with tobacco exposure. The idea that I was experiencing these symptoms because of my exposure to cigarette and other tobacco products was not an option. And when I found a doctor who would listen to that idea I was told to abstain from the environment or plug my nose and everything would be okay. Those options dont help because I can smell the smoke long before I can see the smoker so I have not defense. And even when I wore a mask the scent would penetrate it and would smell sweeter and have a stronger and longer effect on my body. Over the past two years I have pinned my reactions on commercial chemicals and tobacco products. I had noticed that there were certain foods that I could and couldnt eat when I was effected and I thought that I had an idea of how to defend and protect myself. It was ( and has been difficult) to find support from people when I mention what my ailments stem from and because of that I spiraled into a deep depressive and choatic mental state. It wasnt until 3 months ago that The Environmental Clinic in my area diagnosed me with having multiple chemical sensitivity and referred me to a family physician in my area that dealt with patients with this sensitivity. Now here is the big problem: For the past 12 months I have been having trouble eating. At first it started with eating anything and experiencing intense pain all over my body and a need to sleep that could not be ignored. I went on an elimination diet monitored by myself (as I was discouraged by doctors and didnt want to visit another one) and I took out dairy and gluten and sometimes meat. I thought that I had it under control until the foods that I deemed were appropriate from my functioning created intense pain and the need to sleep. For three days I ate peanuts and cookies. I then realized that gluten and dairy were not my problem because I devoured chocolate cookies for breakfast, lunch and dinner and I was symptom free. I was also noticing that the sharp stabbing pain in my heart, that I had been experiencing since I was about 9 years old, occurred more frequently and lasted much longer.

I stopped eating peanuts and tree nuts when my chest started getting tight, phlegmy and I began wheezing and I stopped drinking smoothies when I needed to sleep and my body started to hurt after I started drinking them. Here is the biggest problem: The family physician that I was referred to has not thought to refer me to a dietician and I mentioned from my first visit that all I can eat is peanuts/tree nuts and Kale smoothies. I told her that I have chest tightness and stabbing heart pains. She wondered if I had an EEG, I mentioned the monitoring in high school and I told her that I had a chest x-ray with the Environmental Health Clinic and that they would send my results to her (I havent received a call about the x-ray so I assume that everything is fine). After our first visit she told me that because of my age she doesnt believe that I have anything wrong with my heart or lungs and that my pain is from anxiety. When my blood work was transferred to her she was stunned at my results. She didnt mention anything about my IgE value being in the high 900s when the maximum level is 300 (I know because the Doctor at the Health Clinic told me and ordered a stool test because she believed I could have an intestinal parasite). Im sure there are other puzzling readings from my test but I dont know what they are. I also have a low white blood cell count. The only test this doctor wants is another CBC, but I am not physically well enough to give anymore blood. The blood I gave for her physical disrupted my ability to eat, I was fatigued and in pain for over two weeks and I craved foods that I shouldnt eat but ate because they were the only food I wanted and I paid for it each day. As of this moment the only things I can eat (and honestly I am reacting to it as well but the symptoms are mild) is sprouted buckwheat, avocado and hemp oil. I eat a tablespoon of raw honey to boost my immune system but I react to that as well but I dont know what else to do. I take 5000 IU of liquid vitamin D3 because the doctor mentioned that I might be sensitive to the fillers in vitamins and I am deficient. I purchased Rejuvenate Cell Therapy and have been placing that in my water, I dont feel good each time I take a sip of water, but I need to drink it. I am so fed up with doctors, and people thinking that they know. I wasnt sad until I got to this point in the letter because there is something wrong and I cant get proper help and I believe I am dying and its a waiting game for me right now. I dont go outside unless I need to buy food, because outside smells of car fumes, laundry detergent, shampoos, perfumes, cigarette smoke I asked one doctor if I would have to die before I got help and he said yes. This will help others with similar symptoms to mine and I hope they will get help before it gets really bad. Liked by jodooley Follow Report"

Problem communicating with others and forming friendships. He is also experiencing anxiety as well as difficulty concentrating, fatigue, recent significant weight loss ( 95 pounds in 14 months.he is 6 feet tall) and difficulty being around anyone (prefers being alone in his room). He also lost consciousness prompting a fall while showering twice Some history: He was bullied emotionally his junior year in High School which then led to extremely low self esteem and withdrawal from activities he enjoyed. He went to a psychologist for a year and was diagnosed with depression and placed on medication. The medication prompted weight gain (45 lbs) within 6 months. He decided to go off the medication because he did not like how it made him feel nor did he like the weight gain; however he remained in therapy. Medical tests given: Blood work checking for anemia, kidney and liver function and thyroid all normal. Cholesterol tests normal. A brain scan checking for tumors normal. At this point he refuses to go to a psychologist and will not go on antidepressant or anxiety medication. However, he has recently started cutting himself ( 3 times that I know of the last 7 months). I do not know what to do. He will not discuss his feelings with anyone: however I think he would be open to more medical tests. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Follow Report"

Im sure in this community, Im not alone in this. I see online posts and comments complaining about shoppers purchasing more than a couple packages at a time. Large TP purchases are our normal. Im not condoning hoarding, purchasing carts-full at a time, but please, there are some of us that honestly require an abnormal amount of bog roll. When reports of TP shortages first began, I made a contingency plan, just in case. We have plenty of rags, old towels, etc., which I could cut into wash cloth size and utilize as an alternative. A good rinse after use, toss into a bucket and launder every day or so. Great plan, or so I thought. A few days into our sheltering in place, my good, OLD, reliable washing machine died. So, here I am, high risk, trying to stay home and I need a washer. Im trying to shop for one online, but finding it difficult. I REALLY want to SEE what Im buying. Laundry is an essential chore, but I have serious lung issues and am already on supplemental oxygen. Laundromats are not an option right now.

My name is Nancy and I live in Cape Coral, Florida. I have been to multiple doctors and they all have come to the conclusion that I have an insulinoma. After I read up about insulinomas I realized that I have all of the symptoms and have had them for a while. My endocrinologist admitted me to the local hospital for the 72 hour fasting glucose test and the hospital did it all wrong!! The doctors at the hospital accused me of injecting myself with insulin to cause my symptoms and the doctor ran 3 different blood tests looking for every type of artificial insulin to prove his theory. When they all came back negative he told me that insulinomas are extremely rare and there was no way I could have one. I never saw him again. He gave orders for the nurse to do all of the blood work at 36 hrs when my glucose level was at 60 instead of waiting the full 72. After the nurse took the blood work she gave me the glucagon . My first glucose check at 5 minutes was in the 30s so the nurse freaked out and gave me second dose. She checked my glucose again 5 minutes after that and it was still not coming up so she gave me a 3rd dose. At that point a felt like I was going to have a heart attack because my heart began pounding and I became nauseous. My next 5 minute glucose test was 280 so the nurse decided to leave me alone and told me to check my own glucose every 15 minutes and if it dropped below 90 I needed to drink orange juice and/or eat something. I later found out that the correct blood test werent even ordered and then the nurse giving me 3 doses of glucagon invalidated everything. The doctor refused to come see me to answer my questions and had the nurse discharge me. To make a long story short I went to see a gastroenterologist and he did an endoscopic ultrasound yesterday but he couldnt find the tumor. This is going to sound strange but after the test it was like my pancreas went nuts because I no matter what I ate I couldnt get my glucose above 68. Today was better but I still couldnt get my glucose above 84. My insurance wont approve the PET scan that my doctor ordered so now he is trying to get some much less expensive scan approved but he doubts it will help locate the tumor. I dont know where to go or who to turn to but I cant go on feeling as bad as I feel. I cant stand eating every hour or two and nothing tastes good anymore. Does anyone have any suggestions?

At that time, they found it had also spread to 2 of the 19 lymph nodes. My only symptoms then was severe watery diarrhea and occasional flushing. About 9 months ago, I started having frequent flushing and some diarrhea. The flushing has gotten very bad (multiple episodes a day) and my fatigue is severe last 3 months. All of my scans are normal. Tumor markers go up a little, but had been still within normal limits (other than occasional very minor high result for Chromogranin-A due to GERD PPI meds) until this last draw. This time, my Chromogranin-A was very high at 1410 and my Pancreastatin was high at 155. My local oncologist said could be an anomaly with the lab, but it seems too odd that 2 are so high, especially with my symptoms. My other oncologist said that often these tumor markers show up way before anything reveals itself on scans, so it is a wait and see game. Has anyone else experienced this? Its so emotionally draining. Any recommendations on how to get through this without over reacting would be much appreciated. My tumor was classified as Well-differentiated with pathologic stage of: T2 N1 M0. it surprised all of my docs that it spread even though low grad and well-differentiated, which is why I worry something is being missed.

Happy to see this group!,"I was diagnosed in May with aggressive NET, which started in the colon and had already spread to the liver with a 6 inch tumor. I started in the ER at Rush University Hospital in Chicago where I received my first infusions inpatient, but have since moved to Northwestern, which is the best in Illinois. As soon as I switched, I was given the sandotatin injection along with daily dexamethasone. Between those two my quality of life has really improved. I know many say that chemo is worthless with this cancer but both oncologists I have had insist it be given a shot with how large my tumor was, and I certainly havent done any oncology residencies myself to argue. My legs are like Jello most days and Im fairly certain its caused by the chemo (as leg weakness is an occasional side effect of carboplatum (and it gets a little worse after each set of infusions). Ive noticed ankle swelling for the first time tonight (though am not feeling any cardio/breathing issues and I have been on my feet most of the day) and Im fighting chronic diarrhea. However I actually feel really goodfar better than before I was diagnosed, unquestionably! Ive continued my MBA through all of this and will graduate in December, and still work pretty normally with the exception of my infusion week. I would certainly go to Mayo if they were closer but I cant justify it at the moment. I have a couple more rounds of chemo in the original treatment plan and if I feel Im getting nowhere at that point Ill probably consider it but I really do love my treatment team and feel they are giving me loads of attention and help. I have a lot of confidence in them. Ive learned from this experience that attitude is everything, and really do value each relationship (work, spouse, friends) so much more now. Im far more aware of the responses I give daily in reaction to petty nonsense. My perception of what matters has changed, for the better! Anyway, I just wanted to introduce myself. I dont know how long I have left on this earth but I was delighted to read about many of your experiences and it has given me what I needed most; hope! Thank you!

First to the mods, please advise if you feel this belongs in a separate forum. Im 65, 330 pounds, and Im 34 years old. I moved to Arizona in 2018 from Illinois, and within a few months, developed a cough. I was treated with antibiotics, and steroids. I feel good for another 3-4 months, and get sick again. Same symptoms, same diagnosis (acute bronchitis), same medications. In about June or July last year, I developed a slight drool on the right side of my mouth. My doctor told me it was nothing and would go away. It didnt. Maybe a month after that visit, I get sick again. This time Im given an inhaler, antibiotics (round 3), steroids (round 3), and a chest X-ray. X-ray came back normal. I was referred to an ENT for the drool, and trouble swallowing on my right side. He did an endoscopy, and said I was making it up. Approx. September, I start to develop numbness in my ring and pinky fingers on both hands. This then grows to include my forearms and upper arms. This spreads to my pectoral area. Its early October and one night I couldnt breathe. I tried my inhaler, and couldnt breathe. I went to the ER. They did a chest X-ray, and gave me a nebulizer treatment; and sent me home. Two weeks after that, the front of my neck and jaw start to go numb. I could literally feel it climbing up my body. Then my temples go numb, and my eyelids start twitching. I have yet another attack and go to the ER for a second time. I advised the doctors what was going wrong, and they diagnosed me with a probable bilateral ulnar neuropathy in the arms, and recommended I see a neurologist, then follow up with my GP. I was unable to see my GP, so I had to go see a stand in doctor. When I see him, I was so confused answering his questions, he immediately sent me back to the ER. He thought I was having a stroke. My blood pressure was in the 220/140 range. Barrage of tests were done, including CT scan of brain, blood draw, chest xray. All came back negative. Maybe 2-3 weeks after that I start to develop small pimple like rashes on my arms. I was told they will go away. They havent gone away, and have started to scar my arms, and parts of my legs. Its almost Thanksgiving now, and the numbness has spread to my entire face. I feel like Im wearing a mask, from forehead to temples, cheeks down to the jawline and chin. From the chin down the front of the neck to the pectoral area and out to my arms through to my fingers. I see my GP again, for a followup, and he chastised me for my weight, and told me to start exercising. I get home and start working out on an exercise bike. After three days of moderate biking, I wake up in the middle of the night with my calf cramping like crazy. I get up hobbling in pain and try to walk it off. I was able to, and went back to bed. Approx, 45 minutes later, my entire leg cramped up from thigh all the way down to my feet. The next day, both calves are sore, and my pinky and toe next to it start to go numb. Same as with my arms, the numbness is bilateral. Soon the outer portion of my feet and legs start to go numb up to my knees. I call my doctor, who says to take more fluids. A month goes by and Im pretty numb all over. I get sick again in the middle of December with a horrible cough, and am prescribed a nebulizer. I fly to Florida to see my parents for Christmas, and it was a disaster. I coughed and coughed the entire time there. I had 2-3 breathing treatments a day. I coughed so much I ended up getting a cough suppressant, which Im not sure helped. I get back and see my GP again. I tell him about my numbness all over and that Im starting to feel like Im dying. He laughed at me, and said that it had to have been a problem with my neck because the numbness was bilateral. He orders an MRI. Im claustrophobic and try a closed, open, and finally an open stand up MRI. I completed the cervical MRI, and was told by phone from my GP that everything looked normal. I said I felt worse. He said he would refer me to a neurologist. I call to make an appointment, and I cant be seen for 8 weeks! Its early January, and my eyes start to feel very tired and Im sleeping 12 hours a day. Everyday sounds start to shock my brain. I still have the cough. Im accomplishing nothing during the day, and start to feel faint and confused. I go to the ER in the middle of January, this time to a different ER but in the same hospital chain. The doctor there immediately suggests I see a neurologist, and I tell her my story and that I cant be seen until end of February. She orders a brain MRI, but I couldnt tolerate it. They refused to sedate me because I didnt have a ride back. I get a referral to a different neurologist from the ER for that week. I get a call from their office the next day, and because Im on AHCCCS (AZ Medicaid), I cant be seen. Although I could pay out of pocket, the receptionist said it would be pricey, and that I should call my insurance company for a neurologist. Im furious at this point, and email the hospitals patient relations department, saying the previous ER trip was worthless. Now its early February and Im still numb everywhere mentioned; and I start falling asleep during the day. I feel like theres a band around my head that covers my eyes. My eyelids are still twitching from the side. I just sit at home and wait for the upcoming neurologist appointment. I go out one day to get gas for my car, and I blacked out while driving. I almost run into another car. When I realized this I went back to the ER. The doctor there ordered a rainbow draw, and a CT of the brain. He then ordered a CT of the head and neck with contrast. I fell asleep in the room. I was woken up and told the results were normal but the doctor would like to do a brain MRI. He told me he thought I might have MS. Unfortunately, like with the previous instance, I couldnt tolerate the MRI machine and couldnt be sedated because I didnt have a ride back home. This is their policy. And because I couldnt tolerate the MRI, the doctor charged me with leaving against medical advice.

My doctor told me it was nothing and would go away. It didnt. Maybe a month after that visit, I get sick again. This time Im given an inhaler, antibiotics (round 3), steroids (round 3), and a chest X-ray. X-ray came back normal. I was referred to an ENT for the drool, and trouble swallowing on my right side. He did an endoscopy, and said I was making it up. Approx. September, I start to develop numbness in my ring and pinky fingers on both hands. This then grows to include my forearms and upper arms. This spreads to my pectoral area. Its early October and one night I couldnt breathe. I tried my inhaler, and couldnt breathe. I went to the ER. They did a chest X-ray, and gave me a nebulizer treatment; and sent me home. Two weeks after that, the front of my neck and jaw start to go numb. I could literally feel it climbing up my body. Then my temples go numb, and my eyelids start twitching. I have yet another attack and go to the ER for a second time. I advised the doctors what was going wrong, and they diagnosed me with a probable bilateral ulnar neuropathy in the arms, and recommended I see a neurologist, then follow up with my GP. I was unable to see my GP, so I had to go see a stand in doctor. When I see him, I was so confused answering his questions, he immediately sent me back to the ER. He thought I was having a stroke. My blood pressure was in the 220/140 range. Barrage of tests were done, including CT scan of brain, blood draw, chest xray. All came back negative. Maybe 2-3 weeks after that I start to develop small pimple like rashes on my arms. I was told they will go away. They havent gone away, and have started to scar my arms, and parts of my legs. Its almost Thanksgiving now, and the numbness has spread to my entire face. I feel like Im wearing a mask, from forehead to temples, cheeks down to the jawline and chin. From the chin down the front of the neck to the pectoral area and out to my arms through to my fingers. I see my GP again, for a followup, and he chastised me for my weight, and told me to start exercising. I get home and start working out on an exercise bike. After three days of moderate biking, I wake up in the middle of the night with my calf cramping like crazy. I get up hobbling in pain and try to walk it off. I was able to, and went back to bed. Approx, 45 minutes later, my entire leg cramped up from thigh all the way down to my feet. The next day, both calves are sore, and my pinky and toe next to it start to go numb. Same as with my arms, the numbness is bilateral. Soon the outer portion of my feet and legs start to go numb up to my knees. I call my doctor, who says to take more fluids. A month goes by and Im pretty numb all over. I get sick again in the middle of December with a horrible cough, and am prescribed a nebulizer. I fly to Florida to see my parents for Christmas, and it was a disaster. I coughed and coughed the entire time there. I had 2-3 breathing treatments a day. I coughed so much I ended up getting a cough suppressant, which Im not sure helped. I get back and see my GP again. I tell him about my numbness all over and that Im starting to feel like Im dying. He laughed at me, and said that it had to have been a problem with my neck because the numbness was bilateral. He orders an MRI. Im claustrophobic and try a closed, open, and finally an open stand up MRI. I completed the cervical MRI, and was told by phone from my GP that everything looked normal. I said I felt worse. He said he would refer me to a neurologist. I call to make an appointment, and I cant be seen for 8 weeks! Its early January, and my eyes start to feel very tired and Im sleeping 12 hours a day. Everyday sounds start to shock my brain. I still have the cough. Im accomplishing nothing during the day, and start to feel faint and confused. I go to the ER in the middle of January, this time to a different ER but in the same hospital chain. The doctor there immediately suggests I see a neurologist, and I tell her my story and that I cant be seen until end of February. She orders a brain MRI, but I couldnt tolerate it. They refused to sedate me because I didnt have a ride back. I get a referral to a different neurologist from the ER for that week. I get a call from their office the next day, and because Im on AHCCCS (AZ Medicaid), I cant be seen. Although I could pay out of pocket, the receptionist said it would be pricey, and that I should call my insurance company for a neurologist. Im furious at this point, and email the hospitals patient relations department, saying the previous ER trip was worthless. Now its early February and Im still numb everywhere mentioned; and I start falling asleep during the day. I feel like theres a band around my head that covers my eyes. My eyelids are still twitching from the side. I just sit at home and wait for the upcoming neurologist appointment. I go out one day to get gas for my car, and I blacked out while driving. I almost run into another car. When I realized this I went back to the ER. The doctor there ordered a rainbow draw, and a CT of the brain. He then ordered a CT of the head and neck with contrast. I fell asleep in the room. I was woken up and told the results were normal but the doctor would like to do a brain MRI. He told me he thought I might have MS. Unfortunately, like with the previous instance, I couldnt tolerate the MRI machine and couldnt be sedated because I didnt have a ride back home. This is their policy. And because I couldnt tolerate the MRI, the doctor charged me with leaving against medical advice. I see my GP tomorrow for other issues, including sharp abdominal pain, the damn cough that wont go away, and these arm rashes I still have. I finally see the neurologist next Tuesday, but his ratings are 1.8 out of 5 online, so I dont have much hope. I would love to go to Mayo, but I have AZ Medicaid, and the website says only transplant services are available. I came here because this is Mayo, and its the only place I view in high regard. I apologize profusely for the long post but I honestly feel something is seriously wrong and no one really cares to listen. I have no idea whats going on, but slowly Im feeling weaker and weaker. I appreciate any response. Thank you. Follow Report"

Because of this, you get nerve pain? Or get jolts of pain up and down your legs, back and/or side of the abdomen? Last year I was scheduled to have an arterial flush to rid my system of clots throughout, the surgeon couldnt get passed my nervous system since it had been moved due to battered arteries. In fact at one point, the doctor hit a nerve and my leg shot up and kicked him in the face (no control). Weirdest sensation ever. I get jolts of pain all over every day. Some of them can be so strong, my body jumps from its position. Some of them are so painful, nothing I can do but hold on. I guess my question/discussion is: Do you any of you suffer from displaced nerves, what do you take for nerve pain/damage and what procedures have you tried to correct the problem?

Does anyone share this symptom with me? At times I wonder if it could be another issue. They hurt so bad and create pain when walking continuously. Both legs feel heavy, tired and can't get much mileage. When I walk it's as though they are full of lead and they make me go at a turtles pace. If I stop and don't move they may settle a bit but then same old situation as I walk again. Only relief is being elevated and wrapped with heat or soaking in warm water. That buys me maybe a half hour or an hour tops. Same goes for any topicals. A tight wrap feels good almost like a weighted blanket does. Something about tightening the muscles does too.

How can it relieve pain? Lets discuss how MFR has improved our health and reduced pain and share articles about how MFR works. MFR helps so many different conditions that have compressed tissues, and entrapped blood vessels and nerves. The time to avoid MFR treatment would be if a person has cancer, because in releasing tight tissues, cancer cells could be released and able to migrate through the body. Myofascial release is a way to stretch the fascial layers that holds our body together. The fascia is connective tissue that forms a web matrix that interconnects everything in the body. It has recently been described as the Interstitium or a new organ in the body. Fascia can be too tight from injuries or surgical scar tissue, and hold the body in poor ergonomics which can lead to nerve compression. Fascia can be stretched or released and it will remodel itself by changing from a semi solid to liquid form which brings circulation to an area of compressed tissue which then expands the tissue and circulation, and it enables removal of metabolic waste products. Using their hands, the trained therapist will find the path of fascial restriction in the patients body and push against it gently in a shearing motion, and wait for the tissue to start to slide. The patient can feel the movement and become body aware. This path of fascial movement can reach the full length of the body and cross over between sides. This path changes as it unravels, and often there is a vasomotor response that can be seen on the skin temporarily as a reddish area where circulation has been restored which is shown on the photo below near the therapists hands. Treatment must be slow and gentle to prevent the body from guarding in a protective response. This is why aggressive methods to stretch fascia often fail and can cause injuries by tearing the fascia and forming scar tissue that just adds to the problem of fascial tightness. Fascia also holds tissue memory, and in releasing it, sometimes there is a release of emotions tied to an injury that was a cause of the problem. Stress and injury can cause guarding behavior and tissue tightness that become permanent over time, and MFR and working on emotional health helps a person recover from the physical and emotional effects of stress and trauma on the body. MFR is helpful to so many conditions that have an underlying physical cause. The physical therapist who developed this treatment method forty years ago is John Barnes. He has developed courses and MFR certifications for physical therapists. There is a lot of information about MFR at myofascialrelease.com as well as directory of therapists treating with MFR. A person may also contact Therapy on the Rocks in Sedona, AZ, and ask for recommendations of therapists who have been trained in the John Barnes Methods. MFR therapy is becoming better known and accepted healing therapy, although there are some doctors who are unaware of the benefits. I wanted to create this discussion to help organize this information and I thought the Neuropathy group would be a good place to start because someone in pain might look here, but we could have this discussion in many discussion groups. Animals such as dogs, cats and horses have also benefited from this therapy. Hopefully as we collect information here, this discussion can be referenced and shared in the many other discussions on Mayo Clinic Connect.

Using their hands, the trained therapist will find the path of fascial restriction in the patients body and push against it gently in a shearing motion, and wait for the tissue to start to slide. The patient can feel the movement and become body aware. This path of fascial movement can reach the full length of the body and cross over between sides. This path changes as it unravels, and often there is a vasomotor response that can be seen on the skin temporarily as a reddish area where circulation has been restored which is shown on the photo below near the therapists hands. Treatment must be slow and gentle to prevent the body from guarding in a protective response. This is why aggressive methods to stretch fascia often fail and can cause injuries by tearing the fascia and forming scar tissue that just adds to the problem of fascial tightness. Fascia also holds tissue memory, and in releasing it, sometimes there is a release of emotions tied to an injury that was a cause of the problem.

I do not suggest that you do that as your muscles can atrophy. I could still walk but I lost my fluidity of motion, nothing has brought that back.

Thank you to all the people who support this forum. I believe I have Small Fiber Neuropathy. It's been a struggle to get doctors to believe something is wrong. I have one now that believes me but believes but this seems to be all new information for her. I met with neurologists and they said I was fine. I passed all their normal tests and they seem to imply it was psychological. I'm still trying to get tested and get an official diagnosis. It's possible I'm wrong but given the symptoms I have it seems unlikely. I was a drinker for years. I brewed beer and drank daily. I also have had high cholesterol for many years. The drinking certainly affected the cholesterol. A couple of years ago I started getting very sharp stabbing pains in my toes in the evening. I can't say if it was when I was drinking or not because I know these symptoms are more common at night and that's when I drank. I started to get pins and needles shortly after mostly in my feet and occasionally in my hands. I would get a stabbing pain in my thigh and foot at the same time. A few other notes: 1. I have impaired fasting glucose in the pre-diabetic range. 2. I've had high cholesterol for many years. It's getting better with diet and exercise. 3. History of alcohol use. I've almost entirely quick alcohol. I've had a couple of drinks in that last couple of weeks but I may quit entirely. 4. I haven't found much that helps except for reducing alcohol but lately even that doesn't seem to help. 5. It's my perception that stress increases the symptoms. 6. Exercise seems to help. Even just moving around. Switching to a standing desk as well although I'm not sure. I'm mostly just sharing to see if there's anyone who can benefit or help me.

I'm a 64 year old woman who has a complex medical history. I have relapsing-remitting MS (diagnosed in 2006, well-controlled; on Copaxone). I also ruptured my L5-S6 disc in 2009, subsequently had a microdiscectomy during which the surgeon tore the dura. Since the surgery, I developed chronic pain which worsened with time. Last March I graduated from Mayo's 3-week pain management program. Since then I no longer take any opiates or benzodiazepines which has been a huge step for the better. That said, in the past few months my pain has spread and changed in nature. I now have bilateral burning sensations in my buttocks and hamstrings. This new pain seems to be burning in the outer part of my skin. It burns whenever I'm sitting or lying down. Any pressure at all on these areas causes really awful burning sensations. I am wondering if I have developed small fiber neuropathy. Questions: 1) Does my description of this new pressure-sensitive, burning pain sound like it's SFN? 2) I notice that there is some discussion about immunity and SFN. Could my having MS (an autoimmune disease) somehow be causal in the development of SFN? 3) Can anyone recommend a doctor at Mayo in Rochester who could examine me and do the proper tests to hopefully diagnose what's going on?

I have been on Low Dose Naltrexone for about 2 weeks. It may be too soon to post about this medication, but I thought I would post now, and post again, in about 2-4 weeks. Bottom line is that Low Dose Naltrexone has helped considerably with my foot neuropathy. My pain is sometime gone, and usually only reaches a level 5 or so, sometimes. Usually, it is about a 2-3, kind on a low level foot throbbing. Enough to be annoying, but not enough to want to cut my feet off. Without it, I wanted to cut my feet off. Certain problems do remain, so my feet are far from normal still. I put on shoes, and feel like my socks are bunched up, or that there are pebbles in them. It takes me a long time to find a shoe to wear. The balls of my feet still feet like they have been stuck in cement, but not all the time. My toes still feel stuck together, or too widely spread. All crazy sensations of neuropathy. So Low Dose Naltrexone has not taken all the crazies away. However, the pain is so much lower, that I am amazed. I have only used Kratom once in two weeks, which is remarkable. I have no side effects at all from the drug. It is not covered by my Medicare insurance, but is about 35 bucks a month. Not too bad. Anyway, it really is the best pain killer I have tried, other than Kratom. I don't have to taste the vile Kratom, so that is very good. I suggest that everyone give it a try. I read that it helps approximately 25% to 40% of people that try it. The endorphin rush it produces is loaded with pain fighters. Yes, give it a try. I will post again about it, as I use it more.

You literally tap on these points, and say that your pain is not necessary, and the pain goes away. I tried it just a few times so far, and it worked. This really seems to good to be true. Is there any Science behind this? Have any of you tried it? Go to youtube and type in tapping for pain. There are many videos on it. Seems crazy to me, but so far, it has helped. I guess if pain signals come from the brain, and you tell yourself to stop, while tapping, your brain does something else. Too good to be true. How long does it last? Is this crazy? Am I crazy?

The nurse went thru all my blood work, and said my B12 is way too low for someone with Neuropathy. She repeated that B12 test, and again it is low. Because it is in a low, but normal range, 2 neurologists, 2 pain specialists, and 1 primary care physician of mine, did not catch that it was low. Only this nurse did, and now I need a week of daily Vitamin B12 shots, and then weekly, for a month. If you have neuropathy, B12 level should be at least at 400. Mine is at 185. I am praying Vitamin B12 helps. I really know nothing about Vitamin B12. Just found out mine is way too low for neuropathy. These doctors need to read the actual numbers, not just the highlights of what blood work is out of range. Maybe this could have been caught 2 years ago. I don't know if Vitamin B12 will help, but I am giving it a try. We all go thru so much.

I was feeling so good because I was being successfully treated with 300 mg of Gabapentin. Good times! But it's been a rough week. My brother died on November 16th. This was not totally unexpected as he had so many health problems, but it still took us all by surprise. He's been like a bloody cat over the years  avoiding death over and over and over again despite proclamations from doctors. So here I am a couple of hundred miles from home  with my mother. Everyone thought it would be a good idea. I'm the oldest, and the child closest from a geographic perspective. But we do NOT have a good base relationship. Add to that, my step-father, a man I haven't been terribly fond of, is dying of cancer. He's in the hospital right now, but is being discharged tomorrow. He is not long for this world  a bed is set up in the living room and they have 24 hour medical care once he's home. Essentially  their home is a hospital right now. Last night my feet were burning a bit  but not enough to cause concern, just heightened awareness because I have been PAIN FREE for about 6 weeks. But tonight  my feet are on FIRE. Aside from the normal burning, other sharp pains are occurring that I don't remember feeling before in my feet and up my legs. PLUS  my hands and arms have been tingling like crazy in a manner that has never happened before So  what I am wondering is: Have others found that intense stress/distress causes a flare in symptoms?

This alone, is exhausting, because it is so not normal. Then I add the burning and throbbing, and I am an utter mess.

It is a salve. The only drawback, is that it is on the sticky side. Anyway, I find that as a salve, it is superior to anything I use. It costs about 24 dollars. Get it at anandahemp.com They call it a topical cream. They have only one topical product, so you cannot miss it. Just thought I would share.

I am a 36-year-old, wife of 7 years, currently working full time. Three months ago, I had a bunion removed from my left foot. The surgery consisted of a nerve block and general anesthesia. I had no problems until about a month ago. I had numbness (or maybe a mild loss of sensation) on the front of my left leg. No pain, no impact on my mobility. My surgeon indicated that I may have nerve damage from the nerve block. He prescribed a medical food that contains folate, B12, and curcumin. About 2 1/2 weeks ago, I started experiencing a swollen feeling in my left leg that comes and goes. Ive also experienced tingling, cold tingling, minor burning sensations, and a shooting pain in my inner left ankle. All of these symptoms are brief and do not last very long, but they happen throughout the day. This week, Ive started feeling like water is dripping on both legs. When the sensations were only in my left leg, I was okay. Now that the sensations have moved to my other leg, Im very concerned and scared. I have a neurologist appointment on Monday and Im a nervous wreck. Has anyone out there had a similar experience after regional anesthesia? I feel so alone.

I am a Latino male. age 49. I use to get a needle like jab in my feet maybe once every few months. Never thought much of it. My mothers side has many people with diabetes, which my older sister now has. I thought it might be pre-diabetic signs. In 2016, I had a great deal of stress from a job, and then starting a new job and also moving to a new state and finally my house. My manager announced a business trip to China. Quick tangent: I lived in Asia for 14 years and at the end, I developed a fear of flight. And so, this trip was the first plane ride since coming home. To say I had anxiety was an understatement. As the the trip approached, I took up restorative Yoga to relax. I felt my muscles weak and shaking. At this time, I complained about muscle aches to my doctor and he removed me from a statin I was taking for Cholesterol. I understand statins can impact muscles. He thought I had developed an intolerance to statin. Some people that came off statins have mentioned muscle problems for several years. (So I read). The trip went off without issue and I was very excited I managed. When I got back though.. I had a lot of pain in my legs. My doctor said to me that it might have been pent up anxiety/stress that was delayed. After a short time back, I noticed my feet started to tingle. At first the right foot, then both. My left toe was very stiff in the morning. I started to document this symptom. Not much longer, I started o feel more tingling in my calves. I then started to get little tiny spasms. I call them spasms, but I dont really see the muscles moving. I went to Neurologist (#1) and they examined me in the room and said I showed no signs. But they did a EMG test and the result was unremarkable. Months went by and the spasms moved to my upper body. When I took a shower, some parts of my body felt like I had walked in from a snowy day and put my skin under hot water. Sometimes I felt insects on my body but there were none. I changed my Neurologist (#2). The new neurologist said I seem to have neuropathy in my legs. She put me on Gabapentin. I started to get a lot of anxiety because Ive never really been sick outside of a torn ACL from sports. I lead a healthy life, though dont exercise anymore due to the ACL. I drink very very little and never smoked. I dont eat a lot of meat or fried food. As the months went by the sensations grew stronger. I went to Rheumatologist (#1). They said my feet pain were due to flat feet, and see a Podiatrist. So off I went to Podiatrist who sold me OTC shoe inserts. Yes, I had flat feet and wore orthopedics in my 20s, but flat feet couldnt explain the rest of my symptoms. So I went to Rheumatologist (#2) who I use to see back in my home state. After much bloodworm and office visits, she felt I had Seronegative Spondyloarthritis. She felt that would explain my non-neuropathy symptoms. She sent me to a Rheumatologist (#3) that specializes in muscle diseases. He looked over my record and said I dont have any disease related to his field of Rheumatism. He said I might have anxiety causing this, a nutritional imbalance or fibromyalgia. My Neurologist was a general one and said I should go to one that specializes in muscle diseases. So she sent me to a university hospital to see Neurologist (#3). After examination, she felt I didnt have any issues. She did some blood work and nothing showed up. And each few months I could feel my body pick up a new symptom/or current ones spreading. I related the EMG and it was unremarkable. I then has an autonomic test with skin biopsy. This test showed I had Small Fiber Neuropathy. She increased my Gabapentin dose. Due to the distance, it was difficult to go to my Rheumatologist so last week, I went to the same university to see a Rheumatologist (#4). He said I did not have Seronegative Spondyloarthritis and that Rheumatologist (#3) was completely wrong. He concurred with Rheumatologist (#2) that I did not have any inflammatory disease. He said it was 100% neurological. I should mention I picked up a chronic cough about 3 years ago. The pulmonologist had me go through various tests and hasnt found anything wrong. During the past year, I had two cases of bronchatis. I was treated with Prednisone. It cleared up my cough and heavy chest feeling butsurprise..I also noticed that all my symptoms were greatly reduced. I thought it a fluke. Then a few months mater I got bronchitis again and so back on Prednisone I went. Again, my symptoms nearly went away. It was bliss! I mention this to my Neurologist and she wasnt sure what to think. She said that my Small Fiber Neuropathy is the cause of my tingling, burning and stabbing pain, but it doesnt explain the spasms. Thus, the reason for my original question. My understanding of neuropathy is that for some people, there is no underlining cause, and for others, there is an underlining cause that has created it, such as diabetes. With my chronic cough, and responding to steroids, along with the Small Fiber Neuropathy, my wife was wondering if I might have Sarcoidosis. But the pulmonologist doesnt think I do. So that brings me to how I feel recently. Over the course of a few months, I went from 186 to 167 pounds. Only change to my diet was to avoid sugar in my coffee. Not much else change. I just did a full abdominal ultrasound and all was fine. I did an endoscopy and colonoscopy last year and they were fine. My blood pressure is great. If you look at me, youd never know. A few weeks ago I started to feel burning in my thigh muscles and calves. This is new. My legs feel weak and I really feel like the weight lose made my leg muscles smaller while my belly has the same size. I am about to make a huge life changing decision in switching jobs. The new job is a dream job but with more pressure. My current job is much less pressure but not as satisfying. I actually need to decide next week! Im at a loss on what to do.. My health isnt getting better and so I worry if a job with high stress will be the best thing. I dont know if I should believe all my symptoms are 100% neurological. Perhaps all my anxiety has manifested into physical pain? Based on my history, are there any specialist that is recommended or potential causes besides the Small Fiber Neuropathy?

She said that my Small Fiber Neuropathy is the cause of my tingling, burning and stabbing pain, but it doesnt explain the spasms. Thus, the reason for my original question. My understanding of neuropathy is that for some people, there is no underlining cause, and for others, there is an underlining cause that has created it, such as diabetes. With my chronic cough, and responding to steroids, along with the Small Fiber Neuropathy, my wife was wondering if I might have Sarcoidosis. But the pulmonologist doesnt think I do. So that brings me to how I feel recently. Over the course of a few months, I went from 186 to 167 pounds. Only change to my diet was to avoid sugar in my coffee. Not much else change. I just did a full abdominal ultrasound and all was fine. I did an endoscopy and colonoscopy last year and they were fine. My blood pressure is great. If you look at me, youd never know. A few weeks ago I started to feel burning in my thigh muscles and calves. This is new. My legs feel weak and I really feel like the weight lose made my leg muscles smaller while my belly has the same size. I am about to make a huge life changing decision in switching jobs. The new job is a dream job but with more pressure. My current job is much less pressure but not as satisfying. I actually need to decide next week! Im at a loss on what to do.. My health isnt getting better and so I worry if a job with high stress will be the best thing. I dont know if I should believe all my symptoms are 100% neurological. Perhaps all my anxiety has manifested into physical pain? Based on my history, are there any specialist that is recommended or potential causes besides the Small Fiber Neuropathy?

The question I have is, ""Does Small Fiber Neuropathy also cause muscle spasms?"" Sorry in advance for a long explanation. I didnt want to leave anything out. Here's my background. I am a Latino male. age 49. I use to get a needle like jab in my feet maybe once every few months. Never thought much of it. My mothers side has many people with diabetes, which my older sister now has. I thought it might be pre-diabetic signs. In 2016, I had a great deal of stress from a job, and then starting a new job and also moving to a new state and finally my house. My manager announced a business trip to China. Quick tangent: I lived in Asia for 14 years and at the end, I developed a fear of flight. And so, this trip was the first plane ride since coming home. To say I had anxiety was an understatement. As the the trip approached, I took up restorative Yoga to relax. I felt my muscles weak and shaking. At this time, I complained about muscle aches to my doctor and he removed me from a statin I was taking for Cholesterol. I understand statins can impact muscles. He thought I had developed an intolerance to statin. Some people that came off statins have mentioned muscle problems for several years. (So I read). The trip went off without issue and I was very excited I managed. When I got back though.. I had a lot of pain in my legs. My doctor said to me that it might have been pent up anxiety/stress that was delayed. After a short time back, I noticed my feet started to tingle. At first the right foot, then both. My left toe was very stiff in the morning. I started to document this symptom. Not much longer, I started o feel more tingling in my calves. I then started to get little tiny spasms. I call them spasms, but I dont really see the muscles moving. I went to Neurologist (#1) and they examined me in the room and said I showed no signs. But they did a EMG test and the result was unremarkable. Months went by and the spasms moved to my upper body. When I took a shower, some parts of my body felt like I had walked in from a snowy day and put my skin under hot water. Sometimes I felt insects on my body but there were none. I changed my Neurologist (#2). The new neurologist said I seem to have neuropathy in my legs. She put me on Gabapentin. I started to get a lot of anxiety because Ive never really been sick outside of a torn ACL from sports. I lead a healthy life, though dont exercise anymore due to the ACL. I drink very very little and never smoked. I dont eat a lot of meat or fried food. As the months went by the sensations grew stronger. I went to Rheumatologist (#1). They said my feet pain were due to flat feet, and see a Podiatrist. So off I went to Podiatrist who sold me OTC shoe inserts. Yes, I had flat feet and wore orthopedics in my 20s, but flat feet couldnt explain the rest of my symptoms. So I went to Rheumatologist (#2) who I use to see back in my home state. After much bloodworm and office visits, she felt I had Seronegative Spondyloarthritis. She felt that would explain my non-neuropathy symptoms. She sent me to a Rheumatologist (#3) that specializes in muscle diseases. He looked over my record and said I dont have any disease related to his field of Rheumatism. He said I might have anxiety causing this, a nutritional imbalance or fibromyalgia. My Neurologist was a general one and said I should go to one that specializes in muscle diseases. So she sent me to a university hospital to see Neurologist (#3). After examination, she felt I didnt have any issues. She did some blood work and nothing showed up. And each few months I could feel my body pick up a new symptom/or current ones spreading. I related the EMG and it was unremarkable. I then has an autonomic test with skin biopsy. This test showed I had Small Fiber Neuropathy. She increased my Gabapentin dose. Due to the distance, it was difficult to go to my Rheumatologist so last week, I went to the same university to see a Rheumatologist (#4). He said I did not have Seronegative Spondyloarthritis and that Rheumatologist (#3) was completely wrong. He concurred with Rheumatologist (#2) that I did not have any inflammatory disease. He said it was 100% neurological. I should mention I picked up a chronic cough about 3 years ago. The pulmonologist had me go through various tests and hasnt found anything wrong. During the past year, I had two cases of bronchatis. I was treated with Prednisone. It cleared up my cough and heavy chest feeling butsurprise..I also noticed that all my symptoms were greatly reduced. I thought it a fluke.

At this time, I complained about muscle aches to my doctor and he removed me from a statin I was taking for Cholesterol. I understand statins can impact muscles. He thought I had developed an intolerance to statin. Some people that came off statins have mentioned muscle problems for several years. (So I read). The trip went off without issue and I was very excited I managed. When I got back though.. I had a lot of pain in my legs. My doctor said to me that it might have been pent up anxiety/stress that was delayed. After a short time back, I noticed my feet started to tingle. At first the right foot, then both. My left toe was very stiff in the morning. I started to document this symptom. Not much longer, I started o feel more tingling in my calves. I then started to get little tiny spasms. I call them spasms, but I dont really see the muscles moving. I went to Neurologist (#1) and they examined me in the room and said I showed no signs. But they did a EMG test and the result was unremarkable. Months went by and the spasms moved to my upper body. When I took a shower, some parts of my body felt like I had walked in from a snowy day and put my skin under hot water. Sometimes I felt insects on my body but there were none. I changed my Neurologist (#2). The new neurologist said I seem to have neuropathy in my legs. She put me on Gabapentin. I started to get a lot of anxiety because Ive never really been sick outside of a torn ACL from sports. I lead a healthy life, though dont exercise anymore due to the ACL. I drink very very little and never smoked. I dont eat a lot of meat or fried food. As the months went by the sensations grew stronger. I went to Rheumatologist (#1). They said my feet pain were due to flat feet, and see a Podiatrist. So off I went to Podiatrist who sold me OTC shoe inserts. Yes, I had flat feet and wore orthopedics in my 20s, but flat feet couldnt explain the rest of my symptoms. So I went to Rheumatologist (#2) who I use to see back in my home state. After much bloodworm and office visits, she felt I had Seronegative Spondyloarthritis. She felt that would explain my non-neuropathy symptoms. She sent me to a Rheumatologist (#3) that specializes in muscle diseases. He looked over my record and said I dont have any disease related to his field of Rheumatism. He said I might have anxiety causing this, a nutritional imbalance or fibromyalgia. My Neurologist was a general one and said I should go to one that specializes in muscle diseases. So she sent me to a university hospital to see Neurologist (#3). After examination, she felt I didnt have any issues. She did some blood work and nothing showed up. And each few months I could feel my body pick up a new symptom/or current ones spreading. I related the EMG and it was unremarkable. I then has an autonomic test with skin biopsy. This test showed I had Small Fiber Neuropathy. She increased my Gabapentin dose. Due to the distance, it was difficult to go to my Rheumatologist so last week, I went to the same university to see a Rheumatologist (#4). He said I did not have Seronegative Spondyloarthritis and that Rheumatologist (#3) was completely wrong. He concurred with Rheumatologist (#2) that I did not have any inflammatory disease. He said it was 100% neurological. I should mention I picked up a chronic cough about 3 years ago. The pulmonologist had me go through various tests and hasnt found anything wrong. During the past year, I had two cases of bronchatis. I was treated with Prednisone. It cleared up my cough and heavy chest feeling butsurprise..I also noticed that all my symptoms were greatly reduced. I thought it a fluke. Then a few months mater I got bronchitis again and so back on Prednisone I went. Again, my symptoms nearly went away. It was bliss! I mention this to my Neurologist and she wasnt sure what to think. She said that my Small Fiber Neuropathy is the cause of my tingling, burning and stabbing pain, but it doesnt explain the spasms. Thus, the reason for my original question. My understanding of neuropathy is that for some people, there is no underlining cause, and for others, there is an underlining cause that has created it, such as diabetes. With my chronic cough, and responding to steroids, along with the Small Fiber Neuropathy, my wife was wondering if I might have Sarcoidosis. But the pulmonologist doesnt think I do. So that brings me to how I feel recently. Over the course of a few months, I went from 186 to 167 pounds. Only change to my diet was to avoid sugar in my coffee. Not much else change. I just did a full abdominal ultrasound and all was fine. I did an endoscopy and colonoscopy last year and they were fine. My blood pressure is great. If you look at me, youd never know. A few weeks ago I started to feel burning in my thigh muscles and calves. This is new. My legs feel weak and I really feel like the weight lose made my leg muscles smaller while my belly has the same size. I am about to make a huge life changing decision in switching jobs. The new job is a dream job but with more pressure. My current job is much less pressure but not as satisfying. I actually need to decide next week! Im at a loss on what to do.. My health isnt getting better and so I worry if a job with high stress will be the best thing. I dont know if I should believe all my symptoms are 100% neurological. Perhaps all my anxiety has manifested into physical pain? Based on my history, are there any specialist that is recommended or potential causes besides the Small Fiber Neuropathy?

In an anterior branch entrapment, symptoms can consist of exercise-related pain or groin pain.

I dont have numbness just tons of pain in both feet. I have been given stretching exercises to help with the pain and flexibility. The therapist wants me to do these exercises three to four times a day, 15 reps each and also increase my walking. My pain level has gone up significantly and I feel very frustrated because nerve pain seems to have a mind of its own. I am getting more searing pain on top of feet and more fasciculations. I feel as if Im damned if I do and damned if I dont move enough as well. I am asking the group if anyone has gone down this same road with PT. I really hate to stop it completely but sometimes I feel like I just have to listen to what the pain is telling me. Thanks for any advice. Follow Report"

I am having a heck of a time with bladder and bowel issues as well as either sleeping through the alarm or not sleeping at all. I hope someone can shed some light on this for me. Thank you.

I'm hoping by reaching out and telling my story I might connect with others who may be going through the same or similar experiences. In 2015 at age 33 I was diagnosed with idiopathic sensory axonal neuropathy. My first obvious and bothersome symptoms began in Jan 2014. I noticed numbness in one toe, the soles of my feet were burning when walking about, I had mild coordination loss in my right foot, and aching pain in my right calf. When these symptoms didn't go away after a day or two I began worrying. And when they didn't go away after a couple weeks I began panicking. The worst thoughts ran through my head. The year preceding all this, 2013, I was in the best shape of my life. Athletic. Eating well. Resting well. I was playing tennis every week. Practicing yoga regularly. Rock climbing several times a month. Going on hikes on the weekends. The only difficulties I had were a long period of stress at work and stress at home because we had a young toddler. When these symptoms suddenly started in Jan 2014 I approached my family doctor, but I felt I wasn't taken very seriously. I was referred to a psychologist to treat my ""anxiety"". Sure I had anxiety, I was scared to death and no one was helping. I made multiple visits back explaining my symptoms, but I was getting no where. After spinning my wheels for a year and a half I switched doctors in Aug 2015. This new doctor took me seriously. I got an MRI (brain and neck), it was normal. I was then referred to a neurologist where I had a nerve conduction test. I was immediately diagnosed with idiopathic sensory axonal neuropathy. The sensory nerves in my legs had amplitude scores that were well below normal. A ""normal"" score is amplitude 10 or higher, my left leg was a 6 and my right leg was 5. On one hand I was terrified when I got diagnosis. But on the other hand I wasn't surprised and I was thrilled to have confirmation that I wasn't crazy. Since my diagnosis in Aug 2015, I've read countless material, videos, and studies on neuropathy. I'm a scientist and I love researching things to death. It's very frustrating because I don't fall into the common causes (diabetes, alcohol, HIV, Lyme, etc) and I'm outside the typical age range (which seems to be 55+) so most material on neuropathy hasn't been very helpful. The only thing I haven't fully ruled out is genetic screening, but no one in my family has obvious symptoms so it may turn up nothing. Despite that it's next on my to-do list So that's my story!

When I returned to work on light duty, I was put in our back room which stay at 41degrees condition product in a sink of cold water for at least 4 hours of my shift.Im a produce manager. During this time, I sustained frostbite on my toes. More severe on my right foot. My Dr. said to avoid the cold temps. As the next two weeks went on, my upper right thigh became numb, then I started having nerve pain on the right and left sides of my right leg. Cramping in my calf, back of knee and upper thigh. I also have cold/ heat sensitivity . My Dr. thought it may be vascular even though I know it is nerve pain. All vascular testing came back normal. I had to ask to see a neurologist and was given emg and nvs which both came back normal. The neurologists recommendation was pain management. Im in a ton of pain and it effects my job and daily living. I need to find out what is causing this and if it could be small fiber neuropathy. Follow Report"

I've had some form of hand pain for more than 15 years. After many MRI scans and lots of meds I had spinal surgery (c5-c6) 5 years ago for narrowing and possible pinched nerve. Unfortunately ended up with c5 palsy which is now better but still weak. Now I get severe pins and needles maybe 4 to 5 times a day with no trigger. Lasts 1 to 5 minutes and then vanishes. I haven't seen much about arm an hand neuropathy. The neurosurgeon has no clue, neurologist has tried more meds, finally the hand surgeon believes there's nothing with my arms and hands but stems from my neck.

Back in late Winter, early Spring 2016, I developed a pins and needles feeling in my feet. I also felt like I was wearing a sock on my left foot that was not there. The pins and needle feeling would come and go. It caused me more anxiety than anything. I saw a neurologist in May 2016 and it was discovered I had a Vitamin D deficiency. I was given a script for Vit D, take a supplement every day, and that fixed the problem. We now jump ahead to January 2018. I had at at least two occasions where my left foot kinda felt numb. One time I was outside and it was VERY cold. I soaked the foot in warm water and fixed the problem. This happened again while I was INSIDE the house. Again, I put my left foot in some warm water and it was back to normal. I didn't give it much thought. I was taking a shower about six weeks ago and fell out of the tub. Now, I don't remember if I hit the side of the tub and THEN fell on the floor of I fell right on the floor. In any case, I landed on my rear end outside the tub. I did NOT hit my head. The fall was kinda hard. I had no back or leg pain right after the fall or since then. The only thing I had worth noting was a pins and needle feeling in one of my left fingers for a few minutes a day or two after the fall. We now move to three weeks after the fall. I have been having these intermittent burning sensation/electrical shocks in my feet. The pain level is about a ""1."" It has NOT affected balance, walking, or strength. However, it has done a number on me mentally. I am so freaked out by this. The anxiety has been so bad that I've lost about 20 pounds from not eating. I haven't slept well. The sensations are not constant and, thankfully so far, do not occur at night. I have done a TON of research online about diabetes and neuropathy. My PCP ran a basic metabolic panel for my yearly physical last month. Glucose came back at 99 (the extreme high end of normal). I also had an A1c done and it came back at 5.4. Vitamin D and B12 came back normal. TSH was normal. CBD Diff all came back normal except for ABS Mono. The high range of normal is .86. Mine came back at .9. The doc was not concerned. Last week, I go to see a neurologist. It's the same guy I saw back in 2016. He put me through a basic neuro test. The one thing that I should note is that there was a test where he poked my fingers with a pin. I could REALLY feel how sharp it was. However, as he went down my legs, I could feel the pin, but it felt blunt, for the most part, below the knees on both legs. I want to take a moment right now to say that my feet can feel the differences in surface texture (e.g. carpet vs. wood floor) and can sense temperature differences just fine. If I am walking outside and step on, say, a pine cone, I can feel it through my shoe. Last week, the neuro ordered these tests: ANA by IFA Screen (Negative) Folate Serum (Normal) Vit B6 (Normal) Sed Rate (Normal) Consequently, he has now ordered his 2nd tier of tests: Complete Metabolic Panel ANTI ENA ID ANTI SSA BLD ANTI SSB BLD HEP REMOTE PANEL HEAVY METALS SCREEn I have not yet taken those blood tests. I had a new development today where my right arm felt 'warm.' That is the only way I can describe it. I had this same sensation in the right for part of a day about two or three weeks ago. I also have some pain in my middle back a little below my neck. I don't think that either my PCP or Neuro believe that the fall in the tub is in any way related to what's going on. From last Saturday through Wednesday of this week I didn't have the burning pain/electrical sensations at all. I was back to my normal self with no anxiety. Then, yesterday, they come back. Again, it's a ""1"" on the pain scale, if that. It's been off and on the last few hours and now I don't know what to think. Now, the anxiety/worry is back and it's driving me crazy. Guess what I'm looking for is some feedback or, perhaps, just support, or thoughts on this whole situation. Thanks. Liked by John, Volunteer Mentor, Teresa, Volunteer Mentor, Dee Follow Report"

However, it has done a number on me mentally. I am so freaked out by this. The anxiety has been so bad that I've lost about 20 pounds from not eating. I haven't slept well. The sensations are not constant and, thankfully so far, do not occur at night. I have done a TON of research online about diabetes and neuropathy. My PCP ran a basic metabolic panel for my yearly physical last month. Glucose came back at 99 (the extreme high end of normal). I also had an A1c done and it came back at 5.4. Vitamin D and B12 came back normal. TSH was normal. CBD Diff all came back normal except for ABS Mono. The high range of normal is .86. Mine came back at .9. The doc was not concerned. Last week, I go to see a neurologist. It's the same guy I saw back in 2016. He put me through a basic neuro test. The one thing that I should note is that there was a test where he poked my fingers with a pin. I could REALLY feel how sharp it was. However, as he went down my legs, I could feel the pin, but it felt blunt, for the most part, below the knees on both legs. I want to take a moment right now to say that my feet can feel the differences in surface texture (e.g. carpet vs. wood floor) and can sense temperature differences just fine. If I am walking outside and step on, say, a pine cone, I can feel it through my shoe. Last week, the neuro ordered these tests: ANA by IFA Screen (Negative) Folate Serum (Normal) Vit B6 (Normal) Sed Rate (Normal) Consequently, he has now ordered his 2nd tier of tests: Complete Metabolic Panel ANTI ENA ID ANTI SSA BLD ANTI SSB BLD HEP REMOTE PANEL HEAVY METALS SCREEn I have not yet taken those blood tests. I had a new development today where my right arm felt 'warm.' That is the only way I can describe it. I had this same sensation in the right for part of a day about two or three weeks ago. I also have some pain in my middle back a little below my neck. I don't think that either my PCP or Neuro believe that the fall in the tub is in any way related to what's going on. From last Saturday through Wednesday of this week I didn't have the burning pain/electrical sensations at all. I was back to my normal self with no anxiety. Then, yesterday, they come back. Again, it's a ""1"" on the pain scale, if that. It's been off and on the last few hours and now I don't know what to think. Now, the anxiety/worry is back and it's driving me crazy. Guess what I'm looking for is some feedback or, perhaps, just support, or thoughts on this whole situation. Thanks. Liked by John, Volunteer Mentor, Teresa, Volunteer Mentor, Dee Follow Report"

Back in late Winter, early Spring 2016, I developed a pins and needles feeling in my feet. I also felt like I was wearing a sock on my left foot that was not there. The pins and needle feeling would come and go. It caused me more anxiety than anything. I saw a neurologist in May 2016 and it was discovered I had a Vitamin D deficiency. I was given a script for Vit D, take a supplement every day, and that fixed the problem. We now jump ahead to January 2018. I had at at least two occasions where my left foot kinda felt numb. One time I was outside and it was VERY cold. I soaked the foot in warm water and fixed the problem. This happened again while I was INSIDE the house. Again, I put my left foot in some warm water and it was back to normal. I didn't give it much thought. I was taking a shower about six weeks ago and fell out of the tub. Now, I don't remember if I hit the side of the tub and THEN fell on the floor of I fell right on the floor. In any case, I landed on my rear end outside the tub. I did NOT hit my head. The fall was kinda hard. I had no back or leg pain right after the fall or since then. The only thing I had worth noting was a pins and needle feeling in one of my left fingers for a few minutes a day or two after the fall. We now move to three weeks after the fall.

First, I should mention that this is my first post to the group. I have had neuropathic pain issues in my feet for many years made worse by surgeries that have resulted in scar tissue that has formed around the nerves. Over the years I have become diabetic (Type 2), although, it has always been considered well controlled. However, I recently had a skin biopsy performed which indicated that I did not have the clinical definition of neuropathy since the nerve cell counts were well within normal ranges. The biopsy did show small anoxal swellings in the epidermis and sub epidermis. My doctor said this condition is often a forerunner of nerve cell loss and is correlated to patients experiencing burning pain. Ultrasound scans have also found scar tissue in the areas that I experience the burning nerve pain. I am hoping to hear from anyone who has tried one of the Radio Frequency wave ablation procedures to reduce neuropathic foot pain or knows of any literature on the subject. Thanks Follow Report"

What tests should I expect/ask for? Things like that. It is for an evaluation for POTS, however if there is anything else he may find, or if you think from my symptoms I should ask. I will list the main ones. Sorry if this is long, but I feel like I only get one shot with this appointment and dont want to miss anything. Here goes: Typical MALS symptoms: worse pain after eating, bloating, nausea, chest pain, constipation, gi issues. I also have, some of which are MALS symptoms also: -difficulty breathing; hard to get deep breath in -tightening in chest -tingling in fingers and toes, sometimes legs feel numb like, just recently heels feel like pins in them -very bad hip pain/butt pain maybe area -leg pain, hard to stand -lower backpain, (do have degenerative disc disease) but also upper across top of back -neck pain, stiffness -LIGHT HEADEDNESS OFTEN moving makes it worse -ringing in ears -no endurance/no strength muscle weakness -arms feel like they go numb if held up to long (like washing hair) hurts to fold clothes -cant lay on my left side, left arm goes numb -FATIGUE!!!!!!!! no amount of sleep changes the fatigue I also am diagnosed with CFS but much worse since 1st surgery -coughing at night -dry mouth, itchy eyes. -constant thirst -inside body temperature can get really hot and overwhelming, not a hot flash, hard to explain -night sweats (not hormonal) so bad sometimes need to change clothes they are soaked -malabsorbtion issues -twice weird large round circle under my eye down to my cheek, puffy under eye -gas -constipation, if any bowel movement -small round balls -pain in chest -pain at sternum -hurts any pressure on stomach, hurts to wear a bra okay so you get the idea.

Generally speaking, a single medication will usually be inadequate to treat such a complex and intense condition, and typical analgesics such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or weak opioids are nearly always ineffective. There is going to be some kind of rational polypharmacy instead of a single bullet, Dr Williams said. The combination of medications and interventional treatments can be very effective with neuropathic pain. The only drug classes with solid evidence of effectiveness are tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors like duloxetine, which are considered first-line treatments. The antiepileptics pregabalin and gabapentin are also first-line, but best for peripheral neuropathic pain, although more recent research has produced negative results. Combining either of these antiepileptics with a tricyclic antidepressant can be more tolerable and effective than monotherapy, particularly for diabetic neuropathic pain. Second-line treatments include lidocaine 5% patches (modest effect), capsaicin 8% patches (lacks long-term safety data), and tramadol (primarily for peripheral neuropathic pain), which work in some patients, but often modestly, and with low success rates. BotulinumtoxinA as a third-line treatment has proven particularly beneficial for peripheral neuropathic pain and neuropathic pain resulting from diabetes, herpes, and trigeminal neuralgia. Opioids such as oxycodone and morphine are also considered third-line treatment for neuropathic pain, but are less effective and more prone to misuse, overdose, morbidity, death, and diversion. Patients who do not show adequate response to medications may try interventional treatments such as nerve blocks, modulation of specific neural structures, or surgical procedures for targeted drug delivery, but risks for infection or other adverse effects are possible. Neurostimulation to interfere with pain signals at different processing stages consist of cryoablation or the application of electrical, radiofrequency, or magnetic energy to pain pathways. Nerve blocks and steroid injections offer short-term relief (typically lasting a few months), and do not reduce the likelihood of later surgical intervention. Spinal cord stimulation is ideal for patients not responding to other treatments, as it was shown to be relatively safe, reversible, cost-effective, and long-lasting (with results lasting a minimum of 24 months in several studies), particularly if burst- and high-frequency stimulation is used vs monophonic square-wave pulse. Although less evidence supports neurostimulation of afferent fibers outside the spinal cord as a viable option, this intervention has also shown relief for several neuropathic pain conditions, including occipital and postherpetic neuralgia.7 Epidural motor cortex stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation comprise the 3 types of epidural or transcranial cortical neurostimulation.8 An estimated 60% to 65% of patients experience at least a 40% reduction in pain intensity from epidural motor cortex stimulation, which requires surgery to place the electrodes. Meanwhile, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation are noninvasive and use magnetic coils or electrodes placed on the scalp to ease central, peripheral, and facial neuropathic pain for a minimum of 2 weeks. However, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is contraindicated for those with aneurysm clips, deep brain electrodes, cardiac pacemakers, cochlear implants, or a history of epilepsy. A more controversial approach is that of deep brain stimulation: whereas this intervention was found to be effective for some patients, it is associated with serious risks, including seizure during the procedure, lead fractures, and wound infections.8 Intrathecal therapy to deliver morphine or ziconotide to specific nerves using an implanted, refillable pump is considered a last resort option.9 Dizziness, nausea, confusion, memory impairment, uncontrolled eye movements, and an increase in serum creatine kinase are the most common adverse events, but more serious morbidities and death are also associated with this treatment. Of all psychological interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy is the only one supported by evidence; however, effect size is modest and varies across patients.10 People with chronic pain are not passive; they actively attempt to change the causes of pain and change their own behaviour in response to pain, wrote review author, Luana Colloca, MD, PhD, an associate professor of anesthesiology at the University of Maryland School of Nursing, and colleagues. However, for many patients, such change without therapeutic help is unachievable, and repeated misdirected attempts to solve the problem of pain drive them further into a cycle of pain, depression and disability. Further, it is not currently possible to reliably determine patients who will benefit most from psychological treatments or those most at risk for pain that is exceptionally difficult to manage. Cognitive behavioral therapy would need to be part of an interdisciplinary approach, Dr Williams said, just as would biofeedback, acupuncture, mindfulness meditation, or other nonpharmacological approaches if any of those offer a patient some additional relief. Looking Ahead: Phenotyping and Personalized Medicine Although emerging, the practice of identifying specific phenotypes to better determine course of treatment is promising for a future of personalized medicine. For example, evidence suggests that patients displaying mechanical allodynia, but with intact nociceptive function, will be more likely to respond to systemic and topical sodium channel blockers, botulinum toxin A, and clonidine gel. It would not be surprising if phenotyping has a great part to play in demonstrating the efficacy of psychological interventions as it does for medications, the authors wrote. Phenotype identification could also rely on genetic identifiers or certain combinations of symptoms or subjective descriptions of pain. For example, the voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.7, is established as an important pharmacological target, and identification of genetic mutations affecting this protein may inform treatment decisions.11 Dr Williams told Clinical Pain Advisor that the field is headed in the direction of using genetics, phenotype identification, and personalized medicine, but it is still in the early stages. Its an approach that makes sense and that were all endeavoring to get to, and sometimes we can do that, but were still defining what those characteristics are, Dr Williams said. The neuropathic pain categories that present the biggest challenges for genetics-based stratification are acquired ones, such as neuropathic pain resulting from diabetes, stroke, cancer, trauma, shingles, or anything else thats polygenic or specific to an acquired disease. But eventually overcoming these challenges to offer personalized approaches to pain management will pay off in multiple ways. Its good medicine, it tends to be less costly, and people tend to have higher satisfaction, as opposed to starting treatment in a stepwise fashion, Dr Williams added. Trial-and-error has dominated our approach for quite some time, but were starting to be able to move out of that and have a more specific approach thats stratified and hopefully gives us a higher hit rate in terms of success sooner than that trial-and-error and stepwise approach.

A more controversial approach is that of deep brain stimulation: whereas this intervention was found to be effective for some patients, it is associated with serious risks, including seizure during the procedure, lead fractures, and wound infections.8 Intrathecal therapy to deliver morphine or ziconotide to specific nerves using an implanted, refillable pump is considered a last resort option.9 Dizziness, nausea, confusion, memory impairment, uncontrolled eye movements, and an increase in serum creatine kinase are the most common adverse events, but more serious morbidities and death are also associated with this treatment. Of all psychological interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy is the only one supported by evidence; however, effect size is modest and varies across patients.10 People with chronic pain are not passive; they actively attempt to change the causes of pain and change their own behaviour in response to pain, wrote review author, Luana Colloca, MD, PhD, an associate professor of anesthesiology at the University of Maryland School of Nursing, and colleagues. However, for many patients, such change without therapeutic help is unachievable, and repeated misdirected attempts to solve the problem of pain drive them further into a cycle of pain, depression and disability. Further, it is not currently possible to reliably determine patients who will benefit most from psychological treatments or those most at risk for pain that is exceptionally difficult to manage. Cognitive behavioral therapy would need to be part of an interdisciplinary approach, Dr Williams said, just as would biofeedback, acupuncture, mindfulness meditation, or other nonpharmacological approaches if any of those offer a patient some additional relief. Looking Ahead: Phenotyping and Personalized Medicine Although emerging, the practice of identifying specific phenotypes to better determine course of treatment is promising for a future of personalized medicine. For example, evidence suggests that patients displaying mechanical allodynia, but with intact nociceptive function, will be more likely to respond to systemic and topical sodium channel blockers, botulinum toxin A, and clonidine gel. It would not be surprising if phenotyping has a great part to play in demonstrating the efficacy of psychological interventions as it does for medications, the authors wrote. Phenotype identification could also rely on genetic identifiers or certain combinations of symptoms or subjective descriptions of pain. For example, the voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.7, is established as an important pharmacological target, and identification of genetic mutations affecting this protein may inform treatment decisions.11 Dr Williams told Clinical Pain Advisor that the field is headed in the direction of using genetics, phenotype identification, and personalized medicine, but it is still in the early stages. Its an approach that makes sense and that were all endeavoring to get to, and sometimes we can do that, but were still defining what those characteristics are, Dr Williams said. The neuropathic pain categories that present the biggest challenges for genetics-based stratification are acquired ones, such as neuropathic pain resulting from diabetes, stroke, cancer, trauma, shingles, or anything else thats polygenic or specific to an acquired disease. But eventually overcoming these challenges to offer personalized approaches to pain management will pay off in multiple ways. Its good medicine, it tends to be less costly, and people tend to have higher satisfaction, as opposed to starting treatment in a stepwise fashion, Dr Williams added. Trial-and-error has dominated our approach for quite some time, but were starting to be able to move out of that and have a more specific approach thats stratified and hopefully gives us a higher hit rate in terms of success sooner than that trial-and-error and stepwise approach.

Generally speaking, a single medication will usually be inadequate to treat such a complex and intense condition, and typical analgesics such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or weak opioids are nearly always ineffective. There is going to be some kind of rational polypharmacy instead of a single bullet, Dr Williams said. The combination of medications and interventional treatments can be very effective with neuropathic pain. The only drug classes with solid evidence of effectiveness are tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors like duloxetine, which are considered first-line treatments. The antiepileptics pregabalin and gabapentin are also first-line, but best for peripheral neuropathic pain, although more recent research has produced negative results. Combining either of these antiepileptics with a tricyclic antidepressant can be more tolerable and effective than monotherapy, particularly for diabetic neuropathic pain. Second-line treatments include lidocaine 5% patches (modest effect), capsaicin 8% patches (lacks long-term safety data), and tramadol (primarily for peripheral neuropathic pain), which work in some patients, but often modestly, and with low success rates. BotulinumtoxinA as a third-line treatment has proven particularly beneficial for peripheral neuropathic pain and neuropathic pain resulting from diabetes, herpes, and trigeminal neuralgia. Opioids such as oxycodone and morphine are also considered third-line treatment for neuropathic pain, but are less effective and more prone to misuse, overdose, morbidity, death, and diversion. Patients who do not show adequate response to medications may try interventional treatments such as nerve blocks, modulation of specific neural structures, or surgical procedures for targeted drug delivery, but risks for infection or other adverse effects are possible. Neurostimulation to interfere with pain signals at different processing stages consist of cryoablation or the application of electrical, radiofrequency, or magnetic energy to pain pathways. Nerve blocks and steroid injections offer short-term relief (typically lasting a few months), and do not reduce the likelihood of later surgical intervention. Spinal cord stimulation is ideal for patients not responding to other treatments, as it was shown to be relatively safe, reversible, cost-effective, and long-lasting (with results lasting a minimum of 24 months in several studies), particularly if burst- and high-frequency stimulation is used vs monophonic square-wave pulse. Although less evidence supports neurostimulation of afferent fibers outside the spinal cord as a viable option, this intervention has also shown relief for several neuropathic pain conditions, including occipital and postherpetic neuralgia.7 Epidural motor cortex stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation comprise the 3 types of epidural or transcranial cortical neurostimulation.8 An estimated 60% to 65% of patients experience at least a 40% reduction in pain intensity from epidural motor cortex stimulation, which requires surgery to place the electrodes. Meanwhile, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation are noninvasive and use magnetic coils or electrodes placed on the scalp to ease central, peripheral, and facial neuropathic pain for a minimum of 2 weeks. However, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is contraindicated for those with aneurysm clips, deep brain electrodes, cardiac pacemakers, cochlear implants, or a history of epilepsy.

Nerve blocks and steroid injections offer short-term relief (typically lasting a few months), and do not reduce the likelihood of later surgical intervention. Spinal cord stimulation is ideal for patients not responding to other treatments, as it was shown to be relatively safe, reversible, cost-effective, and long-lasting (with results lasting a minimum of 24 months in several studies), particularly if burst- and high-frequency stimulation is used vs monophonic square-wave pulse. Although less evidence supports neurostimulation of afferent fibers outside the spinal cord as a viable option, this intervention has also shown relief for several neuropathic pain conditions, including occipital and postherpetic neuralgia.7 Epidural motor cortex stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation comprise the 3 types of epidural or transcranial cortical neurostimulation.8 An estimated 60% to 65% of patients experience at least a 40% reduction in pain intensity from epidural motor cortex stimulation, which requires surgery to place the electrodes. Meanwhile, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation are noninvasive and use magnetic coils or electrodes placed on the scalp to ease central, peripheral, and facial neuropathic pain for a minimum of 2 weeks. However, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is contraindicated for those with aneurysm clips, deep brain electrodes, cardiac pacemakers, cochlear implants, or a history of epilepsy. A more controversial approach is that of deep brain stimulation: whereas this intervention was found to be effective for some patients, it is associated with serious risks, including seizure during the procedure, lead fractures, and wound infections.8 Intrathecal therapy to deliver morphine or ziconotide to specific nerves using an implanted, refillable pump is considered a last resort option.9 Dizziness, nausea, confusion, memory impairment, uncontrolled eye movements, and an increase in serum creatine kinase are the most common adverse events, but more serious morbidities and death are also associated with this treatment. Of all psychological interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy is the only one supported by evidence; however, effect size is modest and varies across patients.10 People with chronic pain are not passive; they actively attempt to change the causes of pain and change their own behaviour in response to pain, wrote review author, Luana Colloca, MD, PhD, an associate professor of anesthesiology at the University of Maryland School of Nursing, and colleagues. However, for many patients, such change without therapeutic help is unachievable, and repeated misdirected attempts to solve the problem of pain drive them further into a cycle of pain, depression and disability. Further, it is not currently possible to reliably determine patients who will benefit most from psychological treatments or those most at risk for pain that is exceptionally difficult to manage. Cognitive behavioral therapy would need to be part of an interdisciplinary approach, Dr Williams said, just as would biofeedback, acupuncture, mindfulness meditation, or other nonpharmacological approaches if any of those offer a patient some additional relief. Looking Ahead: Phenotyping and Personalized Medicine Although emerging, the practice of identifying specific phenotypes to better determine course of treatment is promising for a future of personalized medicine. For example, evidence suggests that patients displaying mechanical allodynia, but with intact nociceptive function, will be more likely to respond to systemic and topical sodium channel blockers, botulinum toxin A, and clonidine gel. It would not be surprising if phenotyping has a great part to play in demonstrating the efficacy of psychological interventions as it does for medications, the authors wrote. Phenotype identification could also rely on genetic identifiers or certain combinations of symptoms or subjective descriptions of pain. For example, the voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.7, is established as an important pharmacological target, and identification of genetic mutations affecting this protein may inform treatment decisions.11 Dr Williams told Clinical Pain Advisor that the field is headed in the direction of using genetics, phenotype identification, and personalized medicine, but it is still in the early stages. Its an approach that makes sense and that were all endeavoring to get to, and sometimes we can do that, but were still defining what those characteristics are, Dr Williams said. The neuropathic pain categories that present the biggest challenges for genetics-based stratification are acquired ones, such as neuropathic pain resulting from diabetes, stroke, cancer, trauma, shingles, or anything else thats polygenic or specific to an acquired disease. But eventually overcoming these challenges to offer personalized approaches to pain management will pay off in multiple ways. Its good medicine, it tends to be less costly, and people tend to have higher satisfaction, as opposed to starting treatment in a stepwise fashion, Dr Williams added. Trial-and-error has dominated our approach for quite some time, but were starting to be able to move out of that and have a more specific approach thats stratified and hopefully gives us a higher hit rate in terms of success sooner than that trial-and-error and stepwise approach.

Generally speaking, a single medication will usually be inadequate to treat such a complex and intense condition, and typical analgesics such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or weak opioids are nearly always ineffective. There is going to be some kind of rational polypharmacy instead of a single bullet, Dr Williams said. The combination of medications and interventional treatments can be very effective with neuropathic pain. The only drug classes with solid evidence of effectiveness are tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors like duloxetine, which are considered first-line treatments. The antiepileptics pregabalin and gabapentin are also first-line, but best for peripheral neuropathic pain, although more recent research has produced negative results. Combining either of these antiepileptics with a tricyclic antidepressant can be more tolerable and effective than monotherapy, particularly for diabetic neuropathic pain. Second-line treatments include lidocaine 5% patches (modest effect), capsaicin 8% patches (lacks long-term safety data), and tramadol (primarily for peripheral neuropathic pain), which work in some patients, but often modestly, and with low success rates. BotulinumtoxinA as a third-line treatment has proven particularly beneficial for peripheral neuropathic pain and neuropathic pain resulting from diabetes, herpes, and trigeminal neuralgia. Opioids such as oxycodone and morphine are also considered third-line treatment for neuropathic pain, but are less effective and more prone to misuse, overdose, morbidity, death, and diversion.

The antiepileptics pregabalin and gabapentin are also first-line, but best for peripheral neuropathic pain, although more recent research has produced negative results. Combining either of these antiepileptics with a tricyclic antidepressant can be more tolerable and effective than monotherapy, particularly for diabetic neuropathic pain. Second-line treatments include lidocaine 5% patches (modest effect), capsaicin 8% patches (lacks long-term safety data), and tramadol (primarily for peripheral neuropathic pain), which work in some patients, but often modestly, and with low success rates. BotulinumtoxinA as a third-line treatment has proven particularly beneficial for peripheral neuropathic pain and neuropathic pain resulting from diabetes, herpes, and trigeminal neuralgia. Opioids such as oxycodone and morphine are also considered third-line treatment for neuropathic pain, but are less effective and more prone to misuse, overdose, morbidity, death, and diversion. Patients who do not show adequate response to medications may try interventional treatments such as nerve blocks, modulation of specific neural structures, or surgical procedures for targeted drug delivery, but risks for infection or other adverse effects are possible. Neurostimulation to interfere with pain signals at different processing stages consist of cryoablation or the application of electrical, radiofrequency, or magnetic energy to pain pathways. Nerve blocks and steroid injections offer short-term relief (typically lasting a few months), and do not reduce the likelihood of later surgical intervention. Spinal cord stimulation is ideal for patients not responding to other treatments, as it was shown to be relatively safe, reversible, cost-effective, and long-lasting (with results lasting a minimum of 24 months in several studies), particularly if burst- and high-frequency stimulation is used vs monophonic square-wave pulse. Although less evidence supports neurostimulation of afferent fibers outside the spinal cord as a viable option, this intervention has also shown relief for several neuropathic pain conditions, including occipital and postherpetic neuralgia.7 Epidural motor cortex stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation comprise the 3 types of epidural or transcranial cortical neurostimulation.8 An estimated 60% to 65% of patients experience at least a 40% reduction in pain intensity from epidural motor cortex stimulation, which requires surgery to place the electrodes. Meanwhile, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation are noninvasive and use magnetic coils or electrodes placed on the scalp to ease central, peripheral, and facial neuropathic pain for a minimum of 2 weeks. However, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is contraindicated for those with aneurysm clips, deep brain electrodes, cardiac pacemakers, cochlear implants, or a history of epilepsy. A more controversial approach is that of deep brain stimulation: whereas this intervention was found to be effective for some patients, it is associated with serious risks, including seizure during the procedure, lead fractures, and wound infections.8 Intrathecal therapy to deliver morphine or ziconotide to specific nerves using an implanted, refillable pump is considered a last resort option.9 Dizziness, nausea, confusion, memory impairment, uncontrolled eye movements, and an increase in serum creatine kinase are the most common adverse events, but more serious morbidities and death are also associated with this treatment. Of all psychological interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy is the only one supported by evidence; however, effect size is modest and varies across patients.10 People with chronic pain are not passive; they actively attempt to change the causes of pain and change their own behaviour in response to pain, wrote review author, Luana Colloca, MD, PhD, an associate professor of anesthesiology at the University of Maryland School of Nursing, and colleagues. However, for many patients, such change without therapeutic help is unachievable, and repeated misdirected attempts to solve the problem of pain drive them further into a cycle of pain, depression and disability. Further, it is not currently possible to reliably determine patients who will benefit most from psychological treatments or those most at risk for pain that is exceptionally difficult to manage. Cognitive behavioral therapy would need to be part of an interdisciplinary approach, Dr Williams said, just as would biofeedback, acupuncture, mindfulness meditation, or other nonpharmacological approaches if any of those offer a patient some additional relief. Looking Ahead: Phenotyping and Personalized Medicine Although emerging, the practice of identifying specific phenotypes to better determine course of treatment is promising for a future of personalized medicine. For example, evidence suggests that patients displaying mechanical allodynia, but with intact nociceptive function, will be more likely to respond to systemic and topical sodium channel blockers, botulinum toxin A, and clonidine gel. It would not be surprising if phenotyping has a great part to play in demonstrating the efficacy of psychological interventions as it does for medications, the authors wrote. Phenotype identification could also rely on genetic identifiers or certain combinations of symptoms or subjective descriptions of pain. For example, the voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.7, is established as an important pharmacological target, and identification of genetic mutations affecting this protein may inform treatment decisions.11 Dr Williams told Clinical Pain Advisor that the field is headed in the direction of using genetics, phenotype identification, and personalized medicine, but it is still in the early stages. Its an approach that makes sense and that were all endeavoring to get to, and sometimes we can do that, but were still defining what those characteristics are, Dr Williams said. The neuropathic pain categories that present the biggest challenges for genetics-based stratification are acquired ones, such as neuropathic pain resulting from diabetes, stroke, cancer, trauma, shingles, or anything else thats polygenic or specific to an acquired disease. But eventually overcoming these challenges to offer personalized approaches to pain management will pay off in multiple ways. Its good medicine, it tends to be less costly, and people tend to have higher satisfaction, as opposed to starting treatment in a stepwise fashion, Dr Williams added. Trial-and-error has dominated our approach for quite some time, but were starting to be able to move out of that and have a more specific approach thats stratified and hopefully gives us a higher hit rate in terms of success sooner than that trial-and-error and stepwise approach.

Generally speaking, a single medication will usually be inadequate to treat such a complex and intense condition, and typical analgesics such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or weak opioids are nearly always ineffective. There is going to be some kind of rational polypharmacy instead of a single bullet, Dr Williams said. The combination of medications and interventional treatments can be very effective with neuropathic pain. The only drug classes with solid evidence of effectiveness are tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors like duloxetine, which are considered first-line treatments. The antiepileptics pregabalin and gabapentin are also first-line, but best for peripheral neuropathic pain, although more recent research has produced negative results. Combining either of these antiepileptics with a tricyclic antidepressant can be more tolerable and effective than monotherapy, particularly for diabetic neuropathic pain. Second-line treatments include lidocaine 5% patches (modest effect), capsaicin 8% patches (lacks long-term safety data), and tramadol (primarily for peripheral neuropathic pain), which work in some patients, but often modestly, and with low success rates. BotulinumtoxinA as a third-line treatment has proven particularly beneficial for peripheral neuropathic pain and neuropathic pain resulting from diabetes, herpes, and trigeminal neuralgia. Opioids such as oxycodone and morphine are also considered third-line treatment for neuropathic pain, but are less effective and more prone to misuse, overdose, morbidity, death, and diversion. Patients who do not show adequate response to medications may try interventional treatments such as nerve blocks, modulation of specific neural structures, or surgical procedures for targeted drug delivery, but risks for infection or other adverse effects are possible. Neurostimulation to interfere with pain signals at different processing stages consist of cryoablation or the application of electrical, radiofrequency, or magnetic energy to pain pathways. Nerve blocks and steroid injections offer short-term relief (typically lasting a few months), and do not reduce the likelihood of later surgical intervention. Spinal cord stimulation is ideal for patients not responding to other treatments, as it was shown to be relatively safe, reversible, cost-effective, and long-lasting (with results lasting a minimum of 24 months in several studies), particularly if burst- and high-frequency stimulation is used vs monophonic square-wave pulse. Although less evidence supports neurostimulation of afferent fibers outside the spinal cord as a viable option, this intervention has also shown relief for several neuropathic pain conditions, including occipital and postherpetic neuralgia.7 Epidural motor cortex stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation comprise the 3 types of epidural or transcranial cortical neurostimulation.8 An estimated 60% to 65% of patients experience at least a 40% reduction in pain intensity from epidural motor cortex stimulation, which requires surgery to place the electrodes. Meanwhile, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation are noninvasive and use magnetic coils or electrodes placed on the scalp to ease central, peripheral, and facial neuropathic pain for a minimum of 2 weeks. However, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is contraindicated for those with aneurysm clips, deep brain electrodes, cardiac pacemakers, cochlear implants, or a history of epilepsy. A more controversial approach is that of deep brain stimulation: whereas this intervention was found to be effective for some patients, it is associated with serious risks, including seizure during the procedure, lead fractures, and wound infections.8 Intrathecal therapy to deliver morphine or ziconotide to specific nerves using an implanted, refillable pump is considered a last resort option.9 Dizziness, nausea, confusion, memory impairment, uncontrolled eye movements, and an increase in serum creatine kinase are the most common adverse events, but more serious morbidities and death are also associated with this treatment. Of all psychological interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy is the only one supported by evidence; however, effect size is modest and varies across patients.10 People with chronic pain are not passive; they actively attempt to change the causes of pain and change their own behaviour in response to pain, wrote review author, Luana Colloca, MD, PhD, an associate professor of anesthesiology at the University of Maryland School of Nursing, and colleagues. However, for many patients, such change without therapeutic help is unachievable, and repeated misdirected attempts to solve the problem of pain drive them further into a cycle of pain, depression and disability. Further, it is not currently possible to reliably determine patients who will benefit most from psychological treatments or those most at risk for pain that is exceptionally difficult to manage. Cognitive behavioral therapy would need to be part of an interdisciplinary approach, Dr Williams said, just as would biofeedback, acupuncture, mindfulness meditation, or other nonpharmacological approaches if any of those offer a patient some additional relief. Looking Ahead: Phenotyping and Personalized Medicine Although emerging, the practice of identifying specific phenotypes to better determine course of treatment is promising for a future of personalized medicine. For example, evidence suggests that patients displaying mechanical allodynia, but with intact nociceptive function, will be more likely to respond to systemic and topical sodium channel blockers, botulinum toxin A, and clonidine gel. It would not be surprising if phenotyping has a great part to play in demonstrating the efficacy of psychological interventions as it does for medications, the authors wrote. Phenotype identification could also rely on genetic identifiers or certain combinations of symptoms or subjective descriptions of pain. For example, the voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.7, is established as an important pharmacological target, and identification of genetic mutations affecting this protein may inform treatment decisions.11 Dr Williams told Clinical Pain Advisor that the field is headed in the direction of using genetics, phenotype identification, and personalized medicine, but it is still in the early stages. Its an approach that makes sense and that were all endeavoring to get to, and sometimes we can do that, but were still defining what those characteristics are, Dr Williams said. The neuropathic pain categories that present the biggest challenges for genetics-based stratification are acquired ones, such as neuropathic pain resulting from diabetes, stroke, cancer, trauma, shingles, or anything else thats polygenic or specific to an acquired disease. But eventually overcoming these challenges to offer personalized approaches to pain management will pay off in multiple ways. Its good medicine, it tends to be less costly, and people tend to have higher satisfaction, as opposed to starting treatment in a stepwise fashion, Dr Williams added. Trial-and-error has dominated our approach for quite some time, but were starting to be able to move out of that and have a more specific approach thats stratified and hopefully gives us a higher hit rate in terms of success sooner than that trial-and-error and stepwise approach.

Generally speaking, a single medication will usually be inadequate to treat such a complex and intense condition, and typical analgesics such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or weak opioids are nearly always ineffective. There is going to be some kind of rational polypharmacy instead of a single bullet, Dr Williams said. The combination of medications and interventional treatments can be very effective with neuropathic pain. The only drug classes with solid evidence of effectiveness are tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors like duloxetine, which are considered first-line treatments. The antiepileptics pregabalin and gabapentin are also first-line, but best for peripheral neuropathic pain, although more recent research has produced negative results. Combining either of these antiepileptics with a tricyclic antidepressant can be more tolerable and effective than monotherapy, particularly for diabetic neuropathic pain. Second-line treatments include lidocaine 5% patches (modest effect), capsaicin 8% patches (lacks long-term safety data), and tramadol (primarily for peripheral neuropathic pain), which work in some patients, but often modestly, and with low success rates. BotulinumtoxinA as a third-line treatment has proven particularly beneficial for peripheral neuropathic pain and neuropathic pain resulting from diabetes, herpes, and trigeminal neuralgia. Opioids such as oxycodone and morphine are also considered third-line treatment for neuropathic pain, but are less effective and more prone to misuse, overdose, morbidity, death, and diversion. Patients who do not show adequate response to medications may try interventional treatments such as nerve blocks, modulation of specific neural structures, or surgical procedures for targeted drug delivery, but risks for infection or other adverse effects are possible. Neurostimulation to interfere with pain signals at different processing stages consist of cryoablation or the application of electrical, radiofrequency, or magnetic energy to pain pathways. Nerve blocks and steroid injections offer short-term relief (typically lasting a few months), and do not reduce the likelihood of later surgical intervention. Spinal cord stimulation is ideal for patients not responding to other treatments, as it was shown to be relatively safe, reversible, cost-effective, and long-lasting (with results lasting a minimum of 24 months in several studies), particularly if burst- and high-frequency stimulation is used vs monophonic square-wave pulse. Although less evidence supports neurostimulation of afferent fibers outside the spinal cord as a viable option, this intervention has also shown relief for several neuropathic pain conditions, including occipital and postherpetic neuralgia.7 Epidural motor cortex stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation comprise the 3 types of epidural or transcranial cortical neurostimulation.8 An estimated 60% to 65% of patients experience at least a 40% reduction in pain intensity from epidural motor cortex stimulation, which requires surgery to place the electrodes. Meanwhile, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation are noninvasive and use magnetic coils or electrodes placed on the scalp to ease central, peripheral, and facial neuropathic pain for a minimum of 2 weeks. However, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is contraindicated for those with aneurysm clips, deep brain electrodes, cardiac pacemakers, cochlear implants, or a history of epilepsy. A more controversial approach is that of deep brain stimulation: whereas this intervention was found to be effective for some patients, it is associated with serious risks, including seizure during the procedure, lead fractures, and wound infections.8 Intrathecal therapy to deliver morphine or ziconotide to specific nerves using an implanted, refillable pump is considered a last resort option.9 Dizziness, nausea, confusion, memory impairment, uncontrolled eye movements, and an increase in serum creatine kinase are the most common adverse events, but more serious morbidities and death are also associated with this treatment. Of all psychological interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy is the only one supported by evidence; however, effect size is modest and varies across patients.10 People with chronic pain are not passive; they actively attempt to change the causes of pain and change their own behaviour in response to pain, wrote review author, Luana Colloca, MD, PhD, an associate professor of anesthesiology at the University of Maryland School of Nursing, and colleagues. However, for many patients, such change without therapeutic help is unachievable, and repeated misdirected attempts to solve the problem of pain drive them further into a cycle of pain, depression and disability. Further, it is not currently possible to reliably determine patients who will benefit most from psychological treatments or those most at risk for pain that is exceptionally difficult to manage. Cognitive behavioral therapy would need to be part of an interdisciplinary approach, Dr Williams said, just as would biofeedback, acupuncture, mindfulness meditation, or other nonpharmacological approaches if any of those offer a patient some additional relief. Looking Ahead: Phenotyping and Personalized Medicine Although emerging, the practice of identifying specific phenotypes to better determine course of treatment is promising for a future of personalized medicine. For example, evidence suggests that patients displaying mechanical allodynia, but with intact nociceptive function, will be more likely to respond to systemic and topical sodium channel blockers, botulinum toxin A, and clonidine gel. It would not be surprising if phenotyping has a great part to play in demonstrating the efficacy of psychological interventions as it does for medications, the authors wrote. Phenotype identification could also rely on genetic identifiers or certain combinations of symptoms or subjective descriptions of pain. For example, the voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.7, is established as an important pharmacological target, and identification of genetic mutations affecting this protein may inform treatment decisions.11 Dr Williams told Clinical Pain Advisor that the field is headed in the direction of using genetics, phenotype identification, and personalized medicine, but it is still in the early stages. Its an approach that makes sense and that were all endeavoring to get to, and sometimes we can do that, but were still defining what those characteristics are, Dr Williams said. The neuropathic pain categories that present the biggest challenges for genetics-based stratification are acquired ones, such as neuropathic pain resulting from diabetes, stroke, cancer, trauma, shingles, or anything else thats polygenic or specific to an acquired disease. But eventually overcoming these challenges to offer personalized approaches to pain management will pay off in multiple ways. Its good medicine, it tends to be less costly, and people tend to have higher satisfaction, as opposed to starting treatment in a stepwise fashion, Dr Williams added. Trial-and-error has dominated our approach for quite some time, but were starting to be able to move out of that and have a more specific approach thats stratified and hopefully gives us a higher hit rate in terms of success sooner than that trial-and-error and stepwise approach.

Generally speaking, a single medication will usually be inadequate to treat such a complex and intense condition, and typical analgesics such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or weak opioids are nearly always ineffective. There is going to be some kind of rational polypharmacy instead of a single bullet, Dr Williams said. The combination of medications and interventional treatments can be very effective with neuropathic pain. The only drug classes with solid evidence of effectiveness are tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors like duloxetine, which are considered first-line treatments. The antiepileptics pregabalin and gabapentin are also first-line, but best for peripheral neuropathic pain, although more recent research has produced negative results. Combining either of these antiepileptics with a tricyclic antidepressant can be more tolerable and effective than monotherapy, particularly for diabetic neuropathic pain. Second-line treatments include lidocaine 5% patches (modest effect), capsaicin 8% patches (lacks long-term safety data), and tramadol (primarily for peripheral neuropathic pain), which work in some patients, but often modestly, and with low success rates. BotulinumtoxinA as a third-line treatment has proven particularly beneficial for peripheral neuropathic pain and neuropathic pain resulting from diabetes, herpes, and trigeminal neuralgia. Opioids such as oxycodone and morphine are also considered third-line treatment for neuropathic pain, but are less effective and more prone to misuse, overdose, morbidity, death, and diversion. Patients who do not show adequate response to medications may try interventional treatments such as nerve blocks, modulation of specific neural structures, or surgical procedures for targeted drug delivery, but risks for infection or other adverse effects are possible. Neurostimulation to interfere with pain signals at different processing stages consist of cryoablation or the application of electrical, radiofrequency, or magnetic energy to pain pathways. Nerve blocks and steroid injections offer short-term relief (typically lasting a few months), and do not reduce the likelihood of later surgical intervention. Spinal cord stimulation is ideal for patients not responding to other treatments, as it was shown to be relatively safe, reversible, cost-effective, and long-lasting (with results lasting a minimum of 24 months in several studies), particularly if burst- and high-frequency stimulation is used vs monophonic square-wave pulse. Although less evidence supports neurostimulation of afferent fibers outside the spinal cord as a viable option, this intervention has also shown relief for several neuropathic pain conditions, including occipital and postherpetic neuralgia.7 Epidural motor cortex stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation comprise the 3 types of epidural or transcranial cortical neurostimulation.8 An estimated 60% to 65% of patients experience at least a 40% reduction in pain intensity from epidural motor cortex stimulation, which requires surgery to place the electrodes. Meanwhile, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation are noninvasive and use magnetic coils or electrodes placed on the scalp to ease central, peripheral, and facial neuropathic pain for a minimum of 2 weeks. However, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is contraindicated for those with aneurysm clips, deep brain electrodes, cardiac pacemakers, cochlear implants, or a history of epilepsy. A more controversial approach is that of deep brain stimulation: whereas this intervention was found to be effective for some patients, it is associated with serious risks, including seizure during the procedure, lead fractures, and wound infections.8 Intrathecal therapy to deliver morphine or ziconotide to specific nerves using an implanted, refillable pump is considered a last resort option.9 Dizziness, nausea, confusion, memory impairment, uncontrolled eye movements, and an increase in serum creatine kinase are the most common adverse events, but more serious morbidities and death are also associated with this treatment. Of all psychological interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy is the only one supported by evidence; however, effect size is modest and varies across patients.10 People with chronic pain are not passive; they actively attempt to change the causes of pain and change their own behaviour in response to pain, wrote review author, Luana Colloca, MD, PhD, an associate professor of anesthesiology at the University of Maryland School of Nursing, and colleagues. However, for many patients, such change without therapeutic help is unachievable, and repeated misdirected attempts to solve the problem of pain drive them further into a cycle of pain, depression and disability. Further, it is not currently possible to reliably determine patients who will benefit most from psychological treatments or those most at risk for pain that is exceptionally difficult to manage. Cognitive behavioral therapy would need to be part of an interdisciplinary approach, Dr Williams said, just as would biofeedback, acupuncture, mindfulness meditation, or other nonpharmacological approaches if any of those offer a patient some additional relief. Looking Ahead: Phenotyping and Personalized Medicine Although emerging, the practice of identifying specific phenotypes to better determine course of treatment is promising for a future of personalized medicine. For example, evidence suggests that patients displaying mechanical allodynia, but with intact nociceptive function, will be more likely to respond to systemic and topical sodium channel blockers, botulinum toxin A, and clonidine gel. It would not be surprising if phenotyping has a great part to play in demonstrating the efficacy of psychological interventions as it does for medications, the authors wrote. Phenotype identification could also rely on genetic identifiers or certain combinations of symptoms or subjective descriptions of pain. For example, the voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.7, is established as an important pharmacological target, and identification of genetic mutations affecting this protein may inform treatment decisions.11 Dr Williams told Clinical Pain Advisor that the field is headed in the direction of using genetics, phenotype identification, and personalized medicine, but it is still in the early stages. Its an approach that makes sense and that were all endeavoring to get to, and sometimes we can do that, but were still defining what those characteristics are, Dr Williams said. The neuropathic pain categories that present the biggest challenges for genetics-based stratification are acquired ones, such as neuropathic pain resulting from diabetes, stroke, cancer, trauma, shingles, or anything else thats polygenic or specific to an acquired disease. But eventually overcoming these challenges to offer personalized approaches to pain management will pay off in multiple ways. Its good medicine, it tends to be less costly, and people tend to have higher satisfaction, as opposed to starting treatment in a stepwise fashion, Dr Williams added. Trial-and-error has dominated our approach for quite some time, but were starting to be able to move out of that and have a more specific approach thats stratified and hopefully gives us a higher hit rate in terms of success sooner than that trial-and-error and stepwise approach.

The tumor markers were 6670. A 2 inch tumor was found in the head of my pancreas, and nearly two dozen tumors were found in my liver. There is a suspicious spot in my lung, but we dont know if it is cancer, fungal, or bacterial. I started a chemo regimen of Folfirinox every two week in August of 2017. It was super rough at first. I vomited several times a day, stopped eating, and lost a tremendous amount of weight. I was also on 60mg of morphine and several Norco breakthrough pills to combat the pain from the cancer. At one point I was taking 36 pills a day to combat the side effects of chemo and painkillers. However, slowly but surely I weaned off the pain meds and the symptoms subsided. In October my scans showed a small decrease in tumor size, and my markers dropped down to the 3000s. I traveled to Boston to see my daughter, and we visited Salem, Mass dressed as witches. Before that trip I slept a lot, had little energy, and felt hopeless. However, when we decided to go I started preparing for the trip. I spent a little time every day walking on a treadmill. I started at the lowest setting for about a minute and worked my way up to 45 minutes at a 2 setting. Salem was amazing. I walked the whole time, toured museums, and spent quality time with my family. In December my scans showed a significant reduction in tumor size and my markers were in the 1300s. I was no longer taking any pain pills, and I started working part-time again. My last two sets of scans have shown , as the doc put it, the tumors in my liver have resolved themselves, the tumor in my pancreas is a fuzzy haze, and the spot in my lung cavitated. My tumor markers were and have remained in the mid-100s. At that point I was told I was technically entering remission. Since the tumors in my liver have resolved, I am now eligible for radiation. I begin radiosurgery next week. We suspect there are cancer cells living in the pancreas, and we hope by attaching the original source we can reduce the cancer cells and extend my life a little longer. I understand that this is not a cure. I also understand that I will most likely be on chemo the rest of my life, but I sure appreciate the extra time Ive been gifted. I do not live near the Mayo, but all of my oncologists have been Mayo trained. However, I have been fortunate enough to to visit the Mayo and meet the fantastic oncology team that collaborates with the local docs on my case. It is my hope that the radiation will work wonders and the chemo will continue to keep me in the maintenance phase. Stay strong cancer warriors!

I have been feeling OK as of late. Physically I almost feel like me before the cancer. Emotionally I realize that things are now changed forever. In October ,which is here, I will meet my new oncologist. He will order scans and blood work so the cycle of surveillance begins for me. I was told that for the next 2 years I would have scans and blood work. Hopefully my cancer will not return but it just may. There is no way to tell how things will go. I was told that due to my tumor size I am at higher risk for recurrence. I will hope for the best. Many of you have already traveled the cancer trail some are just beginning the journey. Where ever you are with your cancer there is always hope. There may be pain and discomfort but we must fight to beat the beast that is cancer. I want to think of scans as positive in hopes of quelling my anxiety scanxiety. I have scan anxiety right now. A sense of dread intertwined with fear of the unknown. I dont like the drive to the cancer center it tends to fill me with much stress. I dont like checking in for appointments, the same questions asked, the same answers given. I am a cancer patient at a cancer center and that doesnt sit well with me. I have an ID card with my name on it reminding me I am a member of a new club I never thought I would be be a part of! Faces are becoming familiar at the cancer center. At this point of my journey, I feel no comfort in the newfamiliar. It feels very foreign and not part of me. Its been 4 months that is not very long since the cancer  officially invaded my life. Yet in many ways it feels like an eternity. So much has happened in those 4 months. I am grateful that my panic stage is over. I do feel less anxious in general. I am grateful for this site and for everyone who has given me insightful advise and direction. I find it most helpful! I feel supported which is very much appreciated. We all need to feel support! There are so many of us out there! There is strength in numbers!

I was told it was a very slow progressing hormone receptor negative cancer that Id had for years. After lumpectomy, chemo, and radiation I had no evidence of cancer for almost 10 years. But was diagnosed again in January 2011 with stage 2 breast cancer in the other breast. This time a hormone receptor positive type. After surgery and remaining on Arimidex for 5 years, In Sept 2016, I was told the cancer had metastasized to my thoracic spine and two ribs. Im told this is connnected to my BRCA1 gene mutation and is the most agggressive breast cancer there is and all that could be offered is palliative care and hope for 3 more years avg. So more chemo which was much harder on me this time, and some radiation. I developed a lung toxicity in my left lung and ended up in the hospital, in and out out of ICU three times, for almost 3 weeks. I couldnt go home so Ive been in assisted living on oxygen full time since July. The left lung was too damaged to get it back to normal but I did surprise all the doctors by actually pulling out of the respiratory failure and making it more than a couple months. So were in the new year now, 2018, and Im still here in the assisted living. Doing pretty well except for the endless debilitating fatigue. Im on hospice and they do an excellent job with pain control and nausea so far. I count my blessings every day for the extra years I was given to see the youngest of my four kids graduate, get married and has 3 little ones now. Im sure Ive seen all my 18 grandchildren. Well, maybe theres another possible one in the future, my son and his wife are still discussing having one morelol And Ive seen 5 great grandchildren, Im sure there will be many more. Ive also been blessed with all of their love and support. Im just wondering if anyone else has stopped all treatments like I have. I did have one more radiation treatment in November and was sick from it for about 6 weeks. Ive decided its not worth being so sick when I could be having fun visits with children and grandchildren. The cancer is just taking its course now and it seems I can feel it slowly taking over. New bone pains, new aches, sleeping longer and longer, more growths or tumors I can feel under the skin. I just dont know what to expect, its kind of scary. Im not afraid of death, I just hope and pray the pain stays under control and I can go peacefully in my sleep. We dont always get what we want but I hope I do this time.Anyone else in my shoes? Liked by Scott, Volunteer Mentor, stoneypath, metalneck Follow Report"

It has been a dull pain that has moved around, on and off, in my mid/upper abdomen over the last few weeks (5-6 weeks or so) I have felt the pain in the kidney areas too and originally the first episode was on my right side. Before this, I had experienced excessive burping on and off for months that would be bad on one day and be gone for a few and come back. Now I am at the point where the abdominal pain is more prominent in the upper center/left part and still is on and off, but I have also developed a dull back pain directly behind that. On top of the burping, I also have been passing more gas from the other end as well. I went to my GP and she thought it was my IBS that I have been diagnosed with years ago, but the symptoms I used toe experience were different than what I am experiencing now. She put the stethoscope to my gut and said she heard a lot of gas. She said normally you hear one or two sounds every minute, but she was hearing one or two every second. I mentioned that I was worried about other things like pancreatitis or pancreatic C so she ran some bloodwork testing all the normal stuff, and a few others like lipase and amylase (pancreatic enzymes) as well as a urinalysis. All was normal. The only abnormality was a glucose level of 112 which they used fasting as the reference time even though I had a full lunch the hour before so I assume that was a mistake and those levels were normal. Another thing I have noticed now is that every time I eat a meal, I get the burping more frequently. On the bright side, I have not experienced any weight loss, jaundice, nausea, appetite changes. In terms of digestive health, I have been passing smaller, thinner, infrequent bowel movements, but no color changes. A little more background that may help, I was diagnosed a few months ago with GERD that was giving me a nasty cough every morning. I was given Prilosec to take before bed, and I take it occasionally after a big meal. Another thing is that I have always had horrible anxiety and at one point I had convinced myself that I had a brain tumor but after over a year of being miserable and experiencing many weird neurological symptoms, I had some sort of epiphany and realized it was all my anxiety playing tricks on my mind and body. I was also in the hospital once for a very bad and painful case of constipation. I will be visiting my GP again for a follow up in 4 days. She advised me three days ago to try and eat more fiber, lay off the dairy (I am lactose intolerant, still eat dairy for years, but in moderation with no problems), and to use Miralax to loosen any possible blockages. I have been using it for three days, but have not passed a normal BM to my own normal standards. What other things should I ask her? And I know I am very young (21) but I cant shake the thought that there is something more sinister going on inside me. Anyone have any similar stories or encouraging thoughts? Thanks! Follow Report"

Mostly, I deal with it through distraction, grand babies, and volunteer work. But I feel alone in this conflict. My current health changes are increase in arthritis symptoms, which may or may not have to do with the loss of my spleen or just body stress. Additionally, I had to have an abdominal mesh inserted due to an infection, the pain is not going away. I started insulin yesterday, I am a baker by trade. Really? And my digestion, I dont even want to go there. Oh, constant infections and illness. Everyone says, Better then the alternative, right? (Meaning death) Why go there? Then they (professional and friends alike) do not investigate my health concerns. I feel that the you survived argument is not related to my current health concerns, nor is my gratitude diminished by my physical complaints. My concerns are?* How long is my pancreatic head going to last? (I have constant swelling and radical sugar fluctuations)* How does one cope with diabetes? This is a lifetime commitment.* How long will this pain in my stomach last, and how can I tell what pain is dangerous and what is post surgical?* What are the risks of complications as a diabetic, hereditary immune disorders, and loss of spleen?* I have Hashimotos disease, how will that effect these other new conditions. I feel these are minor concerns. Seeing that I survived pancreatic cancer. Is anyone else experiencing, generally, post cancer anxieties and health conditions?

He hasnt gotten a second opinion yet. We are in a small town that isnt too advanced. The tumor was 3 cm on the head by the bile duct. They put a stent in and the plan was to take chemo to shrink the tumor and then surgically remove it. After 3 months of chemotherapy, (and I watched him suffer terribly) they did a scan and apparently this chemo treatment did nothing for him. In fact they are saying it got worse and they are not quite sure what the spots are on his spleen etc. he is down to about 135 lbs. so now they are telling us it is inoperable because the tumor is basically connected to the vein that blood travels through. His doctor said he would give us a referral to anywhere we wanted except the cancer centers of America. Why I do not know. So we chose Sloan in nyc. After 4 days of waiting for that appointment I finally a called the doctor. After going through several channels he is now saying nyc will not see you. He supposedly sent them his records and they are saying they wont touch him. After hearing this I was bound and determined I was going somewhere else if i had to pick him up and drag him there. I think he was extremely discouraged. He collapsed on the way out of the office that day. I was devastated. I immediately called the mayo clinic for an appointment. It didnt take long for his dr to get them what they needed. I had made my point clear by then I think. They received everything on a Thursday and that following Monday (10/24/16) he got the call from the mayo. We got an appointment for 12/5/16. I immediately booked the flight (traveling from upstate ny) and the hotel.This past Thursday he was suppose to receive a different kind of chemotherapy. He got all the way there to find out they didnt even have he medicine. Unreal huh? He went the next morning and got it (Friday) and while he was there his dr came in and said we will do a scan before you go to the mayo because if the chemo hasnt helped there is no sense in traveling to the mayo clinic. Why does he not want us to get a second opinion??? I am not allowing that to happen because the mayo said continue chemo until you get here and we will do a scan here. I am not allowing these small town doctors to screw around any longer. Please please if anyone has been through this give me some advice. I am so devastated. He was self employed and has not been able to work to support his family. He can barely walk.I am his younger sister 47 years old and come health issues myself, fortunately not cancer. But I am bound and determined to get him the best possible care. We only have our mom left who is 85 years old and so sad to see her son go through this.Please if anyone out there can tell me anything at all I would be so appreciative.

Wed like to share his journey with you  in real time, so to speak, as this ongoing process continues. Surgery #1  Awake surgery with an electrode implanted into the left side of Walts brain; Surgery #2  One week later, a repeat of #1, but on the right side of his brain, and #3, two weeks later (due to the Thanksgiving holiday week), the pacemaker-like device will be implanted under his collarbone, under general anesthesia. First  some background  Walt is 65 years old, and was diagnosed with Parkinsons Disease at Mayo in 2012, 6 years ago (gasp! I thought it was only 4 years or soTime flies when youre having fun!) His symptoms have progressed slowly (I think), but they have indeed progressed. The symptom that led to Walts diagnosis was a slight tremor in his left hand and then left foot.When he was diagnosed (6 months after the initial neurology appointment) his tremor had increased, and other symptoms were noted. His left arm no longer swung naturally when he walked; he had lost most or all sense of smell years earlier; his left hand no longer gripped things with the same force as his right. Additionally, I should mention that we initially were totally stunned and befuddled by the diagnosis. We were overwhelmed with anxiety and dread, envisioning the worst kinds of rapid progression of this incurable disease. Walt has always been a fit, active, strong man  who never shied away from hard work.He has worked his whole life in the automotive body repair industry, focusing on fiberglass repair over the last 30 years.(Yes  we have often thought that his constant exposure to fumes from solvents and other chemicals, despite taking proper safety precautions, may have played a part in his developing PD.) Whether he was helping someone move, clearing and landscaping our property, moving rocks, or chopping wood  Walt never stopped working until the job  whatever it was  was done. With PD, came increasing levels of fatigue and pain, which not only affected him physically, but added significantly to his despondency and ultimately, his increasing depression. His facial expressions decreased  a symptom we unaware of, until our son said to me that he didnt think his Dad was very interested in what they talked about. I realized then, that other peoples interactions with Walt were likely affected, as well. He complained of difficulty focusing and concentrating, and of needing multiple substantial naps each day. He uses CPAP to help him get a good nights rest  not sure it helps. He wakes in the morning, feeling fatigued. Little by little, we were able to once again appreciate the good things in life. We could see that in the greater scheme of things, Walt was still able to function independently. He could walk, work, play, drive, and enjoy gatherings of family and friends. As we watched our son and daughter thrive and succeed in the lives and families they are building and with the arrival of grandchildren, we felt joy again and were able to happily anticipate the future  a part of life we were missing for a couple of sad, lonely, dark years. **Note that I repeatedly use the pronoun we. Walt and I have been married 38 years this month (our anniversary is the same day the 3rd part of the DBS is scheduled), and although I do not have PD, my guy does. We are in this together, and I have found that when he is down, so am I. When he is so tired that he despairs, so do I. Life is changed  but by no means destroyed. I say this on a good day, when I can feel that life is good. Yesterday, I felt differently, and that was not the emotion at the front of my brain. Like everyone else, well or ill, we are better on some days and not so great on others.** About 3 years ago, Walts neurologist mentioned DBS to Walt, who immediately responded, No  Im not ready for that! We had, very early on, attended a presentation about DBS at a local PD Support Group meeting. It seemed at that time, to Walt, to be a bit of overkill. Drill into his brain? Not likely. About a year ago, Dr. Mehta mentioned it again. Over time, we had come to like, respect, and trust Dr. Mehta completely, and this time Walt was not so quick to dismiss the idea. We listened carefully as Dr. Mehta explained that not everyone would be a candidate for DBS, and that a considerable amount of testing would have to be done to find a patient eligible for this procedure. He said that there is a window for DBS to be helpful and for a patient to be eligible, and that there could be backup/delay in scheduling some of the tests  so it might be a good thing to get some of the tests scheduled. The DBS could be beneficial only as long as his meds helped him. Among other things, if that window closed, DBS would not be an option. We came to understand that DBS is not, of course, a cure for PD, but as Walts symptoms had progressed and worsened, they made daily activities more difficult and he was more easily fatigued. His tremor  on his left side  had become more pronounced and he felt weaker than ever on his left side. Luckily, Walt is right-handed, but it was easy to feel that his tremor and weakness was impacting his right-side function too. It also seemed that his increased dosage of Carbidopa-Levodopa was contributing to increasing dyskenesia and stomach upset, so the potential to decrease his medications was more and more attractive. Last Spring we agreed that testing should be scheduled  which would allow Walt to keep his options open, and to make whichever decision he chose. The first testing scheduled, before all the others, was to be a Neuro-Psych exam. This was of concern to us due to the fact that Walt had, on several occasions over the past 3 years, had periods of confusion and disorientation. One time, he was even hospitalized at Mayo while they tried to figure out what was going on. Happily, we had been advised that Walt was not experiencing dementia, and that his confusion seemed unrelated to PD. No one on his medical team was able to pinpoint the cause of these brief periods of confusion. Walt and I thought that maybe he had not consistently taken his medications  specifically Zoloft, an SSRI  and that it was the cause I believe that if Walt had not passed the Neuro-Psych evaluation, no further testing for DBS would be scheduled. I have only just now read in some of the DBS literature that after taking Sinemet for a while, and/or after dosage increases, it may cause periods of confusion. After the Neuro-Psych testing results came in, during the summer Walt was scheduled for various tests and appointments: Speech evaluation and assessment; Swallow evaluation and testing; MRI qEEG (Brain-mapping/EEG) ECG, DBS Profile appointment with the Nurse on Dr. Mehtas DBS Team. This extensive exam was recorded, and included various activities before, and then after Walt took his meds, as well as assessment of Walt as a candidate for DBS. This would be followed by her report at the next DBS conference, and decision by the DBS Team; and, finally, Meeting and consult with the nurse and neurosurgeon, Dr. Lyons.Through the entire process, our questions were welcomed and answered, and we made the decision to ask that Walt be scheduled for bilateral DBS. Before I go on (and on), I have to say this: Walt is not afraid of pain. Over the last 10 years he has had extensive dental work, 2 knee replacements, 2 carpal tunnel surgeries, a quadruple bypass, a pacemaker implanted, a concussion and broken collarbone after a fall from a roof-level ladder, and a hand vs table saw accident resulting in surgery. His recuperation and recovery have always appeared effortless and quick. He has never liked or needed narcotic pain meds after the first few post-surgery hours. If he required physical therapy, he was always a rock star about it, and in some cases he used his affected limb as soon as he was able  so he never even needed to go to PT. His attitude has always been, It is what it is. We knew  KNEW  that DBS at Mayo was going to be awake surgery. But somehow, we were in denial, or not totally aware of how traumatic and/or painful Walt might find it to be conscious and aware while the surgeon drilled through his skull and inserted an electrode into his brain. The patient needs to be conscious in order to respond to the doctors by moving what they ask him to move, the way they ask him to move it. while the surgery is in process. This ensures that the lead is placed properly to help with the PD symptoms. Dr. Lyons met with us while Walt was in Recovery, and told us that Walt had tolerated the surgery quite well; that Dr. Mehta was very pleased by the way Walt responded during surgery; and that they are confident the DBS will help Walt . Our daughter (a nurse at Mayo) and I were shocked when we first saw him in Recovery. He was conscious  he had not been under general anesthesia  but seemed very dazed and confused. And freaked out. He told us that when the procedure started, he actually dozed off, possibly, in part, due to whatever they gave him as light sedation or local anesthesia for the installation of the head apparatus, a frame, which was secured to his skull by 4 pins. He woke, apparently, as they finished positioning and pinning the frame to his head. He asked if they were finished, and they said they were. Walt says he was delighted to know that it had not been a terrible ordeal, and that he had essentially slept through the whole thing. He was taken for an MRI, and returned to the operating room, where he realized, to his dismay, that they were not done with him  and the worst was yet to come. Walt found it difficult to say much about having a burr hole drilled into the top of his skull. He said it seemed like it lasted forever, that it was painful, and that the sound of the drill was horrifying. Through the hole, an electrode was inserted into his brain, as Dr. Mehta asked Walt to make certain movements and follow some directions, which allowed him to ensure the electrode placement was correct. The incision on the left top of Walts head had been closed with staples and was covered with a bandage. In Recovery, Walt was distraught, complained of head pain, and he was clearly scared  all unusual reactions for him. In the hours after the surgery, once Walt was in his room, he complained continually about the pain, which was distinctly unusual for him. Depending on who we spoke with  any of the nurses or doctors who came into his room  pain was typical or severe discomfort was unusual. We could see that there was some swelling around the incision, and as the hours went by, the swelling expanded to his forehead. I didnt really understand what this all felt like, but Walt said his head felt like a bag of potato chips, about to explode. With his usual stoic manner, he refused offers of meds to help with the pain for several hours. He waited until his pain was really bad  and as a result, it took longer than it should have, to get it under control. By the next day, Walts constant refrain was How am I going to do this again in one week? We truly feared that he would refuse to return for the next part of the procedure  when the electrode would be implanted in the right side of his head. He was discharged the day after his surgery, with a prescription for pain meds. For three days after getting home, Walt was really tired, slept a lot, took pain meds at least once each day, and was alternatively anxious and depressed, and resistant to the idea of returning as scheduled for #2. Happily, by Day 4, Walt turned the corner, found that Tylenol helped with the residual headache he had, and he no longer needed pain meds. His moods returned to normal, he still took lots of naps, and he intends to return to Mayo for Surgery #2 in 2 days (although he doesnt want to talk about it much). I think that although we knew what the surgery entailed, we were allowed to minimize the expected discomfort in our minds. Maybe the amount of pain Walt experienced was, indeed, atypical, but I cant help but feel that he was blind-sided by the impact of the awake part of the process, and we wish someone had made sure he understood. At this point, we trust the doctors expectations that DBS will benefit Walt. Feel free to ask us any questions you might have, and we will keep you updated as this journey continues..

In the hours after the surgery, once Walt was in his room, he complained continually about the pain, which was distinctly unusual for him.

We could see that there was some swelling around the incision, and as the hours went by, the swelling expanded to his forehead. I didnt really understand what this all felt like, but Walt said his head felt like a bag of potato chips, about to explode. With his usual stoic manner, he refused offers of meds to help with the pain for several hours. He waited until his pain was really bad  and as a result, it took longer than it should have, to get it under control. By the next day, Walts constant refrain was How am I going to do this again in one week? We truly feared that he would refuse to return for the next part of the procedure  when the electrode would be implanted in the right side of his head. He was discharged the day after his surgery, with a prescription for pain meds. For three days after getting home, Walt was really tired, slept a lot, took pain meds at least once each day, and was alternatively anxious and depressed, and resistant to the idea of returning as scheduled for #2.

His moods returned to normal, he still took lots of naps, and he intends to return to Mayo for Surgery #2 in 2 days (although he doesnt want to talk about it much). I think that although we knew what the surgery entailed, we were allowed to minimize the expected discomfort in our minds. Maybe the amount of pain Walt experienced was, indeed, atypical, but I cant help but feel that he was blind-sided by the impact of the awake part of the process, and we wish someone had made sure he understood.

Wed like to share his journey with you  in real time, so to speak, as this ongoing process continues. Surgery #1  Awake surgery with an electrode implanted into the left side of Walts brain; Surgery #2  One week later, a repeat of #1, but on the right side of his brain, and #3, two weeks later (due to the Thanksgiving holiday week), the pacemaker-like device will be implanted under his collarbone, under general anesthesia. First  some background  Walt is 65 years old, and was diagnosed with Parkinsons Disease at Mayo in 2012, 6 years ago (gasp! I thought it was only 4 years or soTime flies when youre having fun!) His symptoms have progressed slowly (I think), but they have indeed progressed. The symptom that led to Walts diagnosis was a slight tremor in his left hand and then left foot.When he was diagnosed (6 months after the initial neurology appointment) his tremor had increased, and other symptoms were noted. His left arm no longer swung naturally when he walked; he had lost most or all sense of smell years earlier; his left hand no longer gripped things with the same force as his right. Additionally, I should mention that we initially were totally stunned and befuddled by the diagnosis. We were overwhelmed with anxiety and dread, envisioning the worst kinds of rapid progression of this incurable disease. Walt has always been a fit, active, strong man  who never shied away from hard work.He has worked his whole life in the automotive body repair industry, focusing on fiberglass repair over the last 30 years.(Yes  we have often thought that his constant exposure to fumes from solvents and other chemicals, despite taking proper safety precautions, may have played a part in his developing PD.) Whether he was helping someone move, clearing and landscaping our property, moving rocks, or chopping wood  Walt never stopped working until the job  whatever it was  was done. With PD, came increasing levels of fatigue and pain, which not only affected him physically, but added significantly to his despondency and ultimately, his increasing depression. His facial expressions decreased  a symptom we unaware of, until our son said to me that he didnt think his Dad was very interested in what they talked about. I realized then, that other peoples interactions with Walt were likely affected, as well. He complained of difficulty focusing and concentrating, and of needing multiple substantial naps each day. He uses CPAP to help him get a good nights rest  not sure it helps. He wakes in the morning, feeling fatigued. Little by little, we were able to once again appreciate the good things in life. We could see that in the greater scheme of things, Walt was still able to function independently. He could walk, work, play, drive, and enjoy gatherings of family and friends. As we watched our son and daughter thrive and succeed in the lives and families they are building and with the arrival of grandchildren, we felt joy again and were able to happily anticipate the future  a part of life we were missing for a couple of sad, lonely, dark years. **Note that I repeatedly use the pronoun we. Walt and I have been married 38 years this month (our anniversary is the same day the 3rd part of the DBS is scheduled), and although I do not have PD, my guy does. We are in this together, and I have found that when he is down, so am I. When he is so tired that he despairs, so do I. Life is changed  but by no means destroyed. I say this on a good day, when I can feel that life is good. Yesterday, I felt differently, and that was not the emotion at the front of my brain. Like everyone else, well or ill, we are better on some days and not so great on others.** About 3 years ago, Walts neurologist mentioned DBS to Walt, who immediately responded, No  Im not ready for that! We had, very early on, attended a presentation about DBS at a local PD Support Group meeting. It seemed at that time, to Walt, to be a bit of overkill. Drill into his brain? Not likely. About a year ago, Dr. Mehta mentioned it again. Over time, we had come to like, respect, and trust Dr. Mehta completely, and this time Walt was not so quick to dismiss the idea. We listened carefully as Dr. Mehta explained that not everyone would be a candidate for DBS, and that a considerable amount of testing would have to be done to find a patient eligible for this procedure. He said that there is a window for DBS to be helpful and for a patient to be eligible, and that there could be backup/delay in scheduling some of the tests  so it might be a good thing to get some of the tests scheduled. The DBS could be beneficial only as long as his meds helped him. Among other things, if that window closed, DBS would not be an option. We came to understand that DBS is not, of course, a cure for PD, but as Walts symptoms had progressed and worsened, they made daily activities more difficult and he was more easily fatigued. His tremor  on his left side  had become more pronounced and he felt weaker than ever on his left side. Luckily, Walt is right-handed, but it was easy to feel that his tremor and weakness was impacting his right-side function too. It also seemed that his increased dosage of Carbidopa-Levodopa was contributing to increasing dyskenesia and stomach upset, so the potential to decrease his medications was more and more attractive. Last Spring we agreed that testing should be scheduled  which would allow Walt to keep his options open, and to make whichever decision he chose. The first testing scheduled, before all the others, was to be a Neuro-Psych exam. This was of concern to us due to the fact that Walt had, on several occasions over the past 3 years, had periods of confusion and disorientation. One time, he was even hospitalized at Mayo while they tried to figure out what was going on. Happily, we had been advised that Walt was not experiencing dementia, and that his confusion seemed unrelated to PD. No one on his medical team was able to pinpoint the cause of these brief periods of confusion. Walt and I thought that maybe he had not consistently taken his medications  specifically Zoloft, an SSRI  and that it was the cause I believe that if Walt had not passed the Neuro-Psych evaluation, no further testing for DBS would be scheduled. I have only just now read in some of the DBS literature that after taking Sinemet for a while, and/or after dosage increases, it may cause periods of confusion. After the Neuro-Psych testing results came in, during the summer Walt was scheduled for various tests and appointments: Speech evaluation and assessment; Swallow evaluation and testing; MRI qEEG (Brain-mapping/EEG) ECG, DBS Profile appointment with the Nurse on Dr. Mehtas DBS Team. This extensive exam was recorded, and included various activities before, and then after Walt took his meds, as well as assessment of Walt as a candidate for DBS. This would be followed by her report at the next DBS conference, and decision by the DBS Team; and, finally, Meeting and consult with the nurse and neurosurgeon, Dr. Lyons.Through the entire process, our questions were welcomed and answered, and we made the decision to ask that Walt be scheduled for bilateral DBS. Before I go on (and on), I have to say this: Walt is not afraid of pain. Over the last 10 years he has had extensive dental work, 2 knee replacements, 2 carpal tunnel surgeries, a quadruple bypass, a pacemaker implanted, a concussion and broken collarbone after a fall from a roof-level ladder, and a hand vs table saw accident resulting in surgery. His recuperation and recovery have always appeared effortless and quick. He has never liked or needed narcotic pain meds after the first few post-surgery hours. If he required physical therapy, he was always a rock star about it, and in some cases he used his affected limb as soon as he was able  so he never even needed to go to PT. His attitude has always been, It is what it is. We knew  KNEW  that DBS at Mayo was going to be awake surgery. But somehow, we were in denial, or not totally aware of how traumatic and/or painful Walt might find it to be conscious and aware while the surgeon drilled through his skull and inserted an electrode into his brain. The patient needs to be conscious in order to respond to the doctors by moving what they ask him to move, the way they ask him to move it. while the surgery is in process. This ensures that the lead is placed properly to help with the PD symptoms. Dr. Lyons met with us while Walt was in Recovery, and told us that Walt had tolerated the surgery quite well; that Dr. Mehta was very pleased by the way Walt responded during surgery; and that they are confident the DBS will help Walt . Our daughter (a nurse at Mayo) and I were shocked when we first saw him in Recovery. He was conscious  he had not been under general anesthesia  but seemed very dazed and confused. And freaked out. He told us that when the procedure started, he actually dozed off, possibly, in part, due to whatever they gave him as light sedation or local anesthesia for the installation of the head apparatus, a frame, which was secured to his skull by 4 pins. He woke, apparently, as they finished positioning and pinning the frame to his head. He asked if they were finished, and they said they were. Walt says he was delighted to know that it had not been a terrible ordeal, and that he had essentially slept through the whole thing. He was taken for an MRI, and returned to the operating room, where he realized, to his dismay, that they were not done with him  and the worst was yet to come. Walt found it difficult to say much about having a burr hole drilled into the top of his skull. He said it seemed like it lasted forever, that it was painful, and that the sound of the drill was horrifying. Through the hole, an electrode was inserted into his brain, as Dr. Mehta asked Walt to make certain movements and follow some directions, which allowed him to ensure the electrode placement was correct. The incision on the left top of Walts head had been closed with staples and was covered with a bandage. In Recovery, Walt was distraught, complained of head pain, and he was clearly scared  all unusual reactions for him. In the hours after the surgery, once Walt was in his room, he complained continually about the pain, which was distinctly unusual for him. Depending on who we spoke with  any of the nurses or doctors who came into his room  pain was typical or severe discomfort was unusual. We could see that there was some swelling around the incision, and as the hours went by, the swelling expanded to his forehead. I didnt really understand what this all felt like, but Walt said his head felt like a bag of potato chips, about to explode. With his usual stoic manner, he refused offers of meds to help with the pain for several hours. He waited until his pain was really bad  and as a result, it took longer than it should have, to get it under control.

Been awhile since Ive been involved. My Parkinsons has been doing pretty well for 2/3 of a year now with the exception of REALLY, REALLY bad constipation!!! I have been drinking a lot of water(60 oz a day), walking 5 days a week(3-4 miles each day), and trying to eat high fiber foods. Nothing seems to work much. I have taken Magnesium Citrate on a couple of occasions and tried an enema on a number of occasions too. These work for a short time, but then it is the same old, same old thing. Ive tried Ducolax and a number of other stimulant laxatives. Same result. Not much. Last week I took the Magnesium Citrate again and this time when I drank it I had a horrible burning feeling in my upper GI tract. Had to go to ER. Did CT scan and could find nothing. Saw a GI doctor at the Mayo a few months ago and he had me do some tests and determined that I most likely have Bowl Evacuation Disorder. He ordered evaluation to see if I am a candidate for therapy. I havent scheduled that yet. I plan on calling his office tomorrow and request to see him again. I just feel so awful. Constipated most of the time, nausea, bloated, especially in am, and cramping. I wake up every morning feeling very bloated with considerable cramping. This is NOT normal!!! So that is my sob story. Am I going crazy? I am sincerely starting to think so.

My husband, Walt, complained to his Mayo cardiologist about shortness of breath upon exertion. He had cardiac workups and pulmonary testing, and because he has a slow heart rate (his whole life), they thought a pacemaker to make sure his heart rate increased with exertion, would help. He had a pacemaker implanted at Mayo in August 2018. Honestly  it hasnt made any difference in his shortness of breath. None at all, and as far as we know, the only thing the pacemaker has done is ensure that his heart rate does not drop below 60 bpm. Walt has Parkinsons Disease, and was scheduled for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery at Mayo, to take place a few weeks after his pacemaker. MRIs are essential for DBS  and because of this, I spent a long time insisting on confirmation that the pacemaker Mayo was putting in him would be MRI compatible. It is. His DBS surgery was successful, and his Parkinsons symptoms were greatly reduced. Unfortunately  long story short  Walts DBS system, (consisting of electrodes placed in his brain, wires from the electrodes snaking their way across his skull and down his neck, and a battery pack/controller device under his collar bone like a pacemaker), all had to be removed by the Mayo neurosurgeon in March 2019, when a wire coming from his brain broke through the skin on his head, and was exposed. We have subsequently scheduled another DBS surgery at Barrows, Brain and Spine Center. Everything is in place for the surgery  except for one thing. Mayo cardiology gave him cardiac clearance, but will NOT give him a standard signed form clearing his pacemaker for MRI. The form must be completed and signed by Walts cardiologist of record, and sent to Barrows. Since the pacemaker is monitored remotely and transmissions are evaluated by doctors in the Mayo system; and since there have been no issues with the pacemaker, which is MRI compatible, the cardiologist at MAyo should be able to clear the pacemaker for MRI. They refuse to do so  Mayo says it will not accept liability for the acceptability of an MRI outside of the Mayo system. Barrows Patient Care Coordinator tells me that if Mayo will not sign off on it, we need to find another cardiologist to do an evaluation of the pacemaker  either remotely or by wanding him in the office, thus becoming Walts cardiologist of record. If we need to do that, there is no way Walt will be able to meet the timelines for his surgery, scheduled 10/2. WTH????? I guess Mayo wants to keep Walts business in-house? I feel like his pacemaker is being held hostage. I am furious  this is me venting. Has anyone else ever had to deal with this?

Sometimes it starts with a numb feeling in my elbow and sometimes the numbness spreads onto the top of my forearm. It can be like a burning sensation too. Sometimes it is in my upper arm (shoulder and underarm) and goes up into my shoulder and neck. It is more of a sharp pain then. It lessens and worsens. Comes and goes.

My beautiful mother is about 3 years into her Parkinsons diagnosis. She had been doing quite well, with symptoms being not much more than a nuisance. In the last few months things have gotten significantly worse and Im searching for direction as we havent found answers with her doctors. I do have a request into Mayo for an appointment and am waiting to hear back  but in the meantime, am hopeful someone in this group might have some feedback. She is dealing with severe shortness of breath. She describes it as a very heavy feeling. Shell get extremely weak and almost like her legs are going to give out on her. When she lays down, it seems to get a little better, but it takes quite a bit of time before it does. Its been happening more and more frequently. I dont know if something is physically preventing her from getting air or if she is having anxiety/panic attacks  or both, with the former causing the latter and magnifying it. Also  she has lost her appetite and has gotten very thin. She eats like a bird and we cant seem to get her to eat more. I dont want to force her as there is obviously something preventing her from wanting to take in food. She says she feels very full  but is just getting to be skin and bones. She has dealt with constipation, so perhaps that is part of the problem? Im really at a loss and am just so worried about her. Feeling so helpless and am just praying that we get into Mayo. In the meantime, does anyone have experience with these symptoms? (Her other symptoms have been shuffled walking, but she is still very mobile and able to do everything, some memory/confusion issues  but not severe, hallucinations from the medication  but not severe, very tired, very mild tremor  not severe at all. Thank you in advance  greatly appreciate any feedback you have to offer. Also very happy to have found this group as Im feeling so alone in this. Love my mom and would move heaven and earth to keep her feeling good. Britt Liked by mojo1965, Lisa Lucier Follow Report"

I have been exposed to many chemicals & elements , welding rod , solder , copper , lead , pvc glue & cleaner ( benzeen ) raw sewage etc. About 6 yrs. ago I started haveing issues with the fine motor skills in my right hand . Thinking I had carple tunnel I went to my doctor who sent me for a EMG , it came back  perfect  . Next he sent me to a neurologist , who sent me for a MRI , it came back perfect . Ruleing out M.S , stroke , brain tumor . He told me he didnt think it was Parkinsons but he would like me to go the M.I.N.D institute ( a movement disorder specialist ). The Dr. at MIND had me preform some hand eye excercises then he twisted and pulled on my arms and had me walk up and down the hallway . He then told me that he thought I might have Parkinsons ( His best guess ). Then he gave me Requip , told me to try it , said if the symptoms go away its Parkinsons. Well talk about a sucker punch ! I didnt see it comeing , I took it pretty hard. I went home and read the side effects of the Requip , it scared the hell out of me. The side effects seemed worse than the symptoms.

Prednisone was increased to10m daily. In Jan prednisone was lowered to 9m but has not been lowered since even though doctor says my labs all look perfect.At this point Im losing faith in my doctor and not sure how to proceed with treatment. Because I have no family or support system in this country I have no one to discuss this with so Im hoping someone out there can give me some insight.Ive recently been diagnosed with Sjorgens syndrome and was told treatment was the same as PR and GCA. so nothing further need be done.Im now dealing with facial pain, fatigue, chronic constipation, swelling in my legs and hands and insomnia.My recent lab tests show high bilirubin scores, high total neutrophils, plus low eosinophils absolute, low monocytes, and low monocytes absolute.I dont know what all that means but when I question my rheumatologist about it she does nothing to alleviate my fears and just says your labs all look perfect and maybe you should see a therapist.Im very afraid of what is happening to me and would really appreciate advice from anyone out there with knowledge and information about my health problems.Thank youAnya Liked by Dee Follow Report"

The cause was first thought to be Charcot-Marie-Tooth, type 2A (CMT2A), an hereditary neuropathy. Now (nearly 20 yrs later), they are not too sure. He has no neuropathic pain, but a severe loss of sensory perception. In spite of that, he has learned to walk and drive by feeling via the muscles in the thigh and his knees. In any event, I believe this Neuropathy is an aggravating factor because, as I mentioned, John has a loss of sensory perception and he is unable to pinpoint the issues on the parts affected by the Neuropathy. So, when PMR started to interfere with his ability to walk and drive, he says he feels weak and unsteady. Before starting on 20mg of Prednisone, last week, there were days when he was totally unable to walk; however, he doesnt know what is not working  The muscles in the lower/upper legs? Knees? Feet? It certainly isnt easy! His Sed rate is 36 and C-reactive Protein is 55.3. If these values dont go down, the Rheumatologist said she will need to increase the Prednisone.

Alan said it was OK so I thought it might be a good idea to start a new discussion. Alans question  I started out on Prednisone last August on 20s and I am now 4s. Just had blood work done and from a month ago SED rate is now 4 and it was 3 and CRP is now .5 and it was .3. Both in normal range. Do you normally see these reading go up when Prednisone rate goes down. How will I know if I can continue to decrease prednisone? will there be significant discomfort and or Higher test number possibly above the normal range as taper down. Can different labs give different results. My response  Hi Alan, You ask a really good question. Im have no medical training or background but can share my experience with you. Would you mind if I answer your question in the discussion? I think its a good question and others may be struggling with the same question. I think the SED rate is just an indicator of inflammation which is what the prednisone treats. The kicker is that each of us and our tolerances are different. When my PMR came out of remission back in June/July of 2016 and I went to the doctor, he ordered a SED rate test and mine came back at 16 (normal for men being 0 to 22) and confirmed the PMR was back. I started back on 20 mg prednisone and tapered off at a rate of up to 5 mg a week once I was feeling better and most of the pain was gone. When I got to 10 mg I changed to tapering by 2.5 mg a week until I felt OK at 5 mg. From 5 mg to off I switched to 1 mg tablets and went down 1 or 2 mg a week. I can tell you there was a lot of setbacks and going back to the previous dose for a few days and then going back down. I was able to stop taking prednisone on the last day of February 2018. I still have some stiffness in my hands and shoulders mostly in the mornings which I try to control with some stretching exercise and 30 minutes or so on my recumbent exercise bike. I had a SED rate test Jan 1, 2018 and it was at 1. That was about 2 months before I stopped taking prednisone. Alan  I am glad to have you share my question and your answer. A couple more questions . 1. at point did you know it was time to go back on or a higher amount of Prednisone? 2. How was the doctor to know that the PMR was back as I assume there is no test for PMR, I was also told that I had PMR and the Prednisone eliminated all of the pain but I always wondered how the doc knew PMR was my issue . 3. since it takes so long to see the Doc at what point in time did you think it was back? 4. Is the 20 mg and the tapering process you went thru a standard process. I have been on the Mayos tapering protocol and now on 4 mg and started having some morning stiffness in both shoulders. Stretching, hot shower or a spa when available totally frees it up. Do you take any over the counter pain med such as Tylenol. I have a torn rotator cuff in one arm and thought to stiffness in that arm was the explanation. I am suppose to go to 3s in two weeks and I know wonder if I should stay on 4 longer or what. It seems as though there is no standard answer. I see the Doc at the end of May and I will see what they say. Thank you Alan for questions that I know most of us with PMR have asked or thought about. I will give you my experience to the last 4 questions in the first post below. Im hoping other members will share their experience in relation to your last 4 questions and offer suggestions for what worked for them. John Follow Report"

Alan said it was OK so I thought it might be a good idea to start a new discussion. Alans question  I started out on Prednisone last August on 20s and I am now 4s. Just had blood work done and from a month ago SED rate is now 4 and it was 3 and CRP is now .5 and it was .3. Both in normal range. Do you normally see these reading go up when Prednisone rate goes down. How will I know if I can continue to decrease prednisone? will there be significant discomfort and or Higher test number possibly above the normal range as taper down. Can different labs give different results. My response  Hi Alan, You ask a really good question. Im have no medical training or background but can share my experience with you. Would you mind if I answer your question in the discussion? I think its a good question and others may be struggling with the same question. I think the SED rate is just an indicator of inflammation which is what the prednisone treats. The kicker is that each of us and our tolerances are different. When my PMR came out of remission back in June/July of 2016 and I went to the doctor, he ordered a SED rate test and mine came back at 16 (normal for men being 0 to 22) and confirmed the PMR was back. I started back on 20 mg prednisone and tapered off at a rate of up to 5 mg a week once I was feeling better and most of the pain was gone. When I got to 10 mg I changed to tapering by 2.5 mg a week until I felt OK at 5 mg. From 5 mg to off I switched to 1 mg tablets and went down 1 or 2 mg a week. I can tell you there was a lot of setbacks and going back to the previous dose for a few days and then going back down. I was able to stop taking prednisone on the last day of February 2018. I still have some stiffness in my hands and shoulders mostly in the mornings which I try to control with some stretching exercise and 30 minutes or so on my recumbent exercise bike. I had a SED rate test Jan 1, 2018 and it was at 1. That was about 2 months before I stopped taking prednisone. Alan  I am glad to have you share my question and your answer.

Because of my occupation, I was required to have physicals every 6 months and EKGs every year after the age of 40. For 40 years I was active, jogged 15-20 miles per week, watched my diet, BP was mostly normal, cholesterol normal, weight normal.basically in very good shape. August 2012 I had a stent placed in my LAD and at that time they discovered I had had a heart attack sometime in the prior 10 months (the time since my last physical and EKG). I was shocked. BTW, I was jogging the day before they implanted the stent with NO symptoms. A story for the cardiac board. Fast forward to the fall of 2014when waking in the morning, I was experiencing full body aches and pains. I told my wife it felt like somebody beat me with a baseball bat. The symptoms did get somewhat better during the day; however, I found it getting more difficult working out AND recovering from a workout. I could never recover.the aches, pains, fatigue and stiffness never went away. I thought it was cardiac related. Explained the symptoms to my cardiologist, he said it could be because of a weakened heart plus medications. I was taking Lisinopril and Bystolic. He thought changing the beta blocker would provide some relief.it didnt. After heart echos, MUGA tests and a cardiac MRI, it was determined my heart condition wasnt the cause of my aches, stiffness and pains. BTW, I did consult with my PCP throughout this whole process. All my blood work came back normal. No signs of troubleperiod. He didnt have an answer other than watch your diet and get more exercise! I told him in the most polite manor I could Doc, Ive been doing that for 40 years!!. He said maybe I should see a rheumatologist. October 2015 I saw a rheumatologist and although all my blood test came normal, based on my symptoms he diagnosed me with PMR. BTW, by this time I was in pretty bad shape. Couldnt do any type of exercise, even hated waking up at night or in the morning because the pain was so bad. He place me on 15mg of Prednisone and said I should start feeling better in 4-5 days. I filled the script and took the first dose in the car! Upon waking the next morning, I laid there in total disbeliefthere was NO pain. I actually had to pinch myself, thought I was dreaming. I couldnt believe how good I felt. Hadnt felt that good in a long time. Finally I had an answer. Since the initial dose, my rheumatologist has tried to wean me off the Prednisone with little success. I did get down to 2.5mgs last month, but unfortunately had a relapse ironically while visiting the Rochester Mayo Clinic for a cardiac and PMR evaluation. Although Ive never had any side effects, I did not like taking the Prednisone.dont ask me why, could be the fact that it does shut down the adrenal glands! The Mayo rheumatologist did put my mind at ease by explaining hes had patients on much higher doses for over 6 years and never NOT had adrenal glands recover. He recommended I increase my Prednisone to 10mg per day. I did and it did help somewhat, but I did not recover 100%. Three days ago, my rheumatologist increased it to 15mg and today I am finally feeling better. Ill stay on this dose for 3-4 weeks and slowly begin the weaning off process all over again. Sorry for the long post, but hope this will help others who may be struggling with this disease and treatment plan.

Biopsy advised one agressive cancer and 2 not as agressive. Had a prostatectomy. Woke up from surgery with severe burning pain in and around my rear. This continued in my 3/4 days in hospital. Worst hospital stay ever. As soon as I left hospital for home, I had difficulty sitting due to the burning pain in my buttocks and down the back of my thighs.My cancer was advanced prostate cancer due to it being outside the prostate. Following radiotherapy, my PSA levels have been stable for 12 months at .04. The nerve pain down my thighs have not diminished and has radiated down under my feet. When I sit I have burning pain down the back of my thighs and burning pain under my feet when I walk. I am currently on 450mg of Lyrica a day but does not appear to be helping. As the nerve pain is bilateral (ie in both legs and feet) my doctor believes my sciatic nerve was damaged in surgery in my lower back.Urologist advised that it has never happened before. Just lucky I guess. I was wondering if any man out there has had a similar problem following prostate surgery and what treatment has worked/not worked for them as I am desperate to get this fixed.

I was told it was a very slow progressing hormone receptor negative cancer that Id had for years. After lumpectomy, chemo, and radiation I had no evidence of cancer for almost 10 years. But was diagnosed again in January 2011 with stage 2 breast cancer in the other breast. This time a hormone receptor positive type. After surgery and remaining on Arimidex for 5 years, In Sept 2016, I was told the cancer had metastasized to my thoracic spine and two ribs. Im told this is connnected to my BRCA1 gene mutation and is the most agggressive breast cancer there is and all that could be offered is palliative care and hope for 3 more years avg. So more chemo which was much harder on me this time, and some radiation. I developed a lung toxicity in my left lung and ended up in the hospital, in and out out of ICU three times, for almost 3 weeks. I couldnt go home so Ive been in assisted living on oxygen full time since July. The left lung was too damaged to get it back to normal but I did surprise all the doctors by actually pulling out of the respiratory failure and making it more than a couple months. So were in the new year now, 2018, and Im still here in the assisted living. Doing pretty well except for the endless debilitating fatigue. Im on hospice and they do an excellent job with pain control and nausea so far. I count my blessings every day for the extra years I was given to see the youngest of my four kids graduate, get married and has 3 little ones now. Im sure Ive seen all my 18 grandchildren. Well, maybe theres another possible one in the future, my son and his wife are still discussing having one morelol And Ive seen 5 great grandchildren, Im sure there will be many more. Ive also been blessed with all of their love and support. Im just wondering if anyone else has stopped all treatments like I have. I did have one more radiation treatment in November and was sick from it for about 6 weeks. Ive decided its not worth being so sick when I could be having fun visits with children and grandchildren. The cancer is just taking its course now and it seems I can feel it slowly taking over. New bone pains, new aches, sleeping longer and longer, more growths or tumors I can feel under the skin. I just dont know what to expect, its kind of scary. Im not afraid of death, I just hope and pray the pain stays under control and I can go peacefully in my sleep. We dont always get what we want but I hope I do this time.Anyone else in my shoes? Liked by Scott, Volunteer Mentor, stoneypath, metalneck Follow Report"

I've been to numerous doctors, and none of them can give me an answer for what it is. They all kind of tell me something different. At this point I've given up, but now I feel like I can ask here and maybe get an answer. So, here it goes. 3 years ago, I noticed this blemish on the top of my foot. See pictured. At the time, it was about the size of a quarter. I didn't think anything of it. Over the months it started to get larger, maybe to about the size of a business card. It never hurt, so I chalked it up to the shoes that I wore. A year later, I noticed the a similar blemish starting to develop on the inside of my right leg, near my shin. Same thing on the left leg, on the inside. And this time I noticed that the lower sections of my legs were swollen and they started to itch some. I could touch my skin with my finger, and leave a white indentation. It would disappear, but that's what scared me to finally going to a doctor. I went to a dermatologist, and she told me it looks like contact dermatitis. She put me on a small dose of triamcinolone acetonide, and told me to wear compression socks to help with the swelling. The compression socks have definitely helped with the swelling, but the triamcinolone acetonide didn't treat the blemishes. Over the months, I dealt with the issue and I noticed the spots started to get darker in color. And one time I actually banged my leg into something at work where I had the blemish and the amount of pain I felt was almost excruciating. The next day I noticed an area on the blemish was now black and scabbed. Like that little bump at work broke the skin. Next I went to an urgent care doctor, he told me the same thing, contact dermatitis, gave me more triamcinolone acetonide, and sent me on my way. I tried the triamcinolone for 2 months. Diligently applying it twice a day to no effect. He told me that it could end up thinning my skin, so after those two months I stopped applying it. At this point in time, I finally got a PCP, and he took a fresh look at my legs and he referred me to a vascular specialist, he thought the capillaries in my legs could have collapsed causing the blood to rise to the skin giving me this effect. Anyways, I went to the vascular specialist in the hospital and they did an ultrasound on both my legs. They didn't see anything that was out of the ordinary, and sent me on my merry way with still no answers. To this day, my PCP looks at my legs and feet and doesn't know what the problem or the solution is. So now I'm here. Can anyone look at this pictures and maybe give me a solution to what this is? What can I do to treat it? I want to be able to wear shorts and sandals again in the summer. Edit (grammar) and another addition: I would also like to add that my PCP also gave me a blood screening and everything game out normal. Blood pressure is good, cholesterol is a little high, no diabetes or anything. Thank you. Follow Report"

It never hurt, so I chalked it up to the shoes that I wore. A year later, I noticed the a similar blemish starting to develop on the inside of my right leg, near my shin. Same thing on the left leg, on the inside. And this time I noticed that the lower sections of my legs were swollen and they started to itch some. I could touch my skin with my finger, and leave a white indentation. It would disappear, but that's what scared me to finally going to a doctor. I went to a dermatologist, and she told me it looks like contact dermatitis. She put me on a small dose of triamcinolone acetonide, and told me to wear compression socks to help with the swelling. The compression socks have definitely helped with the swelling, but the triamcinolone acetonide didn't treat the blemishes. Over the months, I dealt with the issue and I noticed the spots started to get darker in color. And one time I actually banged my leg into something at work where I had the blemish and the amount of pain I felt was almost excruciating. The next day I noticed an area on the blemish was now black and scabbed. Like that little bump at work broke the skin. Next I went to an urgent care doctor, he told me the same thing, contact dermatitis, gave me more triamcinolone acetonide, and sent me on my way. I tried the triamcinolone for 2 months. Diligently applying it twice a day to no effect. He told me that it could end up thinning my skin, so after those two months I stopped applying it. At this point in time, I finally got a PCP, and he took a fresh look at my legs and he referred me to a vascular specialist, he thought the capillaries in my legs could have collapsed causing the blood to rise to the skin giving me this effect. Anyways, I went to the vascular specialist in the hospital and they did an ultrasound on both my legs. They didn't see anything that was out of the ordinary, and sent me on my merry way with still no answers. To this day, my PCP looks at my legs and feet and doesn't know what the problem or the solution is. So now I'm here. Can anyone look at this pictures and maybe give me a solution to what this is? What can I do to treat it? I want to be able to wear shorts and sandals again in the summer.

When I was 27 I noticed I was losing my hair. I started taking propecia. 1 week into taking it I started to feel unwell and thought maybe I had caught a bug. Body aches and malaise. I rested for several days and was starting to feel better. But I had angiodema and was very pale. I saw that facial swelling was a possible reaction to finasteride so I stopped taking.m it.My skin color returned Sort of. I was much whiter than I was prior to finasteride. The edema came and and went for over 10 months. When it would go away I also notived my face was much more gaunt and it appeared I had some facial fat atrophy. I looked much older and tired. It had really demoralized me and was taking up most of my thoughts. I decided to rechallenge the medication as it was supposedly very safe and tolerable and no one could help my link my symptoma and medication so I thought maybe I had caught a virus that caused the symptoms. I took finasteride for 6 days. I noticed issues with my sexual health and it seemed my face got thinner. I immediatelt stopped taking it, within days of getting off of medication I began to notice several issues: I could see greenish blue veins on my fore arms that had never been visible before. It spread to my feet and legs and eventually my hands. My skin especially in direct sunlight was transparwnt and many of my large veins clealry visible and skin grayish and dull. In addition to this I experienced more facial fat atrophy, erectile dysfuntion. Testicular atrophy, sexual ahodenia. It's been 4 months since and my symptoms have not really improved. I've poured over medical literature and can't understand why this happened and if there is anything I can do to heal my skin. It's been really demoralizing. Hoping to find some healing mostly for my skin. I am going to a naturopath to address my sexual health issues. Follow Report"

I moved here in March 2018 from Northeast Texas (Longview/Tyler) with a scalp condition that keeps morphing into something else, each time getting worse. It began in May 2016, and here it is 2019 and I still have ""it,"" but I've learned a whole lot I never really wanted to know. I have no idea what exactly is wrong with me, but because of what I found in July 2018 on my pillow I'm thinking Morgellons because I found the same looking thing someone else had posted and they were talking about Morgellons. I have attached two photos, one close up and the other is the original so you can have an idea of the actual size. I also have these white sparkly/shiny critters on every inch of my body, especially my hair/scalp, and face/neck. They can only be seen if I take a picture using my camera with the FLASH ON. Otherwise, no one would know there is anything wrong with me. This was discovered by accident when in May 2016 I got my long hair all cut off. Right after that (about a month) my head started itching in the upper center back. I couldn't see anything in a mirror so I picked up my phone and took a picture. I still couldn't see very well so I turned the flash on. THAT WAS IT!! (I saw more than I wanted to see.) At first I thought I had bed bugs and did everything I could to get rid of them, including lice treatment. Then I started seeing these shiny, sparkly-looking things. I accidentally caught some of them on camera flying around my head. I kept trying everything I could to rid myself of ""them,"" but nothing has worked so far. However, it is now June 2019 and ""the condition"" only changes (morphs). It never goes away. I have seen 9 dermatologists, 2 derm PAs, 2 internists, and 2 GPs, a total of 16 (maybe more), counting the one I'm with now since ""it"" began. My hair fell out in that spot, I had lesions where the hair was missing, and when a new lesion would begin it was always itchy, then that hair would fall out, too. My hair grew back, but not quite as thick. The fever and rash went away, but the achiness and lethargy/fatigue has stayed with me all these years. About a year or two after that fever, and after going to many, many doctors between Shreveport, Dallas, Tyler, and Houston, one of them said I have Fibromyalgia & Chronic Fatigue. I simply took his word for it. I was so very tired of seeing doctors, doing lab work, driving and working a full time, stressful job. I needed a break! Then in 1999 I lost my left kidney to an oncocytoma (tumor the size of a softball), benign. Lost my gallbladder in 2004, had carpal tunnel surgery on both wrists at the same time in 2005. I don't think there's much left. I had already had a thyroidectomy in my 20s (Graves Disease), and a hysterectomy in 1986. Then, the BIGGEST loss of my lifemy only child in 2013. I honestly did not think I was going to make it. I had told every single one of ALL those doctors the story of the high fever and rash and how my GP thought it was Lymes, but lab was negative, and not ONE of them (nor me) simply thought of running another Lyme test until last year 2018. On Sept 18, 2018, my 72nd birthday the results were in and I was at my doctor's office with my sister to get the results. That test came back with all sorts of red flags, 30 years later! Now I am 72 and the second antibiotic I'm on is not doing anything. After one month on Doxycycline (had to stop because my liver didnt like it) and two months on Clindamycin I haven't noticed anything positive, but that doesn't mean nothing is happening, RIGHT?!!. For some reason she didn't put me on anything else right away after the Doxy. Maybe I had to give my liver time to heal. She never said why, and I forget to ask these questions. I think I am going to simply start feeling POSITIVE about things no matter which way they go!! UPDATE: I finally found a doctor who 'seems' to want to help me. She ran a Lyme test on my blood and was very excited she could help me which was very encouraging as you can imagine. I have had Lyme Disease and a co-infection called Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (since 1988-1990ish, 30 years ago). I remember it like it was yesterday. I had a high fever, achiness all over like a flu sickness, and a rash. It was not a flu. And the first thing he said to me was, ""It looks like Lymes Disease to me!"" Unfortunately, the lab report came back negative and neither one of us thought to do another test. Yet, for some reason, I keep replaying one of my favorite songs in my head, Eric Clapton's, ""NO MORE TEARS IN HEAVEN."" (It makes me smile because I know I WILL see my son again and be able to talk to him.) Ever heard of of the song? Check it out. Just Google it and listen. USEFUL WEBSITES: (https://thecehf.org).

960,C0263163,Cellulitis of ankle,C0013604,Edema,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/lymphedemacellulitis/,Lymphedema/Cellulitis,"I'm new to this disease, the calf on my right leg has been swollen for about 3 months but my doctor wasn't concerned until I broke out with cellulitis on my ankle which she then treated with an antibiotic. I also have Idiopathic peripheral neuropathy for the past 20 years in my feet and legs. She said the swelling was probably due to the neuropathy but it wasn't. I'm trying to find out any information on it through support from others. I belong to a support group on neuropathy where I have been helped by others with neuropathy, so much more than any doctor. I am grateful for the computer because without it I would probably be on all kinds of prescriptions which the doctors hand out so freely or maybe dead by now.
