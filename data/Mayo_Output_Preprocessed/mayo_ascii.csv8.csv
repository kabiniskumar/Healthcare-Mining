Although my GAF was around 30 all others measures were well within appropriate limits. I asked my nephrologist why this had happened as ive Always been healthy and all previous blood work over the years had been good. (Im 71 years old). He said he had no idea why and at that moment I decided to try and get a second opinion at the Mayo Clinic. The appointment I was given was for 3 months in the future and is now 2 weeks away. Im asking for some words of encouragement from anyone who has been down this road. I have no idea if ill Have a future and if so, no idea at all what it might look like. Now that my appointment is only 14 days away, my anxiety level is definitely on the rise. Thank you for anything you can do. Liked by Rosemary, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

It has become an international health crisis as we take round after round of antibiotics which our systems progressively become resistant to. We UTI sufferers come to learn in our research to cope with and even hopefully find a cure for our UTIs, that all these antibiotics alter and compromise the gut biome. As much as 80% of our immune system is in the gut which becomes weakened by all the rounds of antibiotics. Some antibiotics can even cause syndromes that make the cure as bad as or worse than the UTI itself. In the elderly, a UTI can cause confusion. If UTIs are left untreated, the infection can spread to the kidneys which is very serious. And if it spreads from the kidneys into the blood, there is only a 50% survival rate. What initially seemed to be a simple and inconvenient but easily treated bladder infection, can develop into years of general ill health due to a compromised immune system and with constant worry hanging over our heads that the UTI will spread to the kidneysand beyond..I am one of these UTI sufferers. Two month short of a 3 year battle with UTIs and 38 UTIs plus 37 rounds of antibiotics later, I have a protocol in place that is working for me and has kept me UTI free for several months with a breakthrough at the 3 month point. All is well to date, one more month later.To be concise I will list what I have learned works. Estrogen therapy in mainly locally absorbed vaginal tablet or cream form or using the Ering stopped UTIs for me for 3 full months at the beginning of this saga when the UTIs were happening pretty much back to back. I had a cystoscopy which introduced bacteria and started the UTI cycle all over againAfter another year and a half of constant UTIs, I read about PACS (A-type proanthocyanidins) which are made from the skin, pulp and seeds of American cranberries (not just the juice or d-mannose which for me did not work). Studies of PACs show promise in preventionnot cure. I ordered Utiva on line but there are other similar PACs products out there. The recommended dose is once a day but I read in research papers that PACs are effective at preventing bacteria from adhering to the bladder lining for 8 hours only and that a higher dose is required.For me the PACs worked after finishing a round of antibiotics, at staving off future UTIs. I did have a breakthrough UTI and took antibiotics. Then a second back to back UTI with pain on urination, cloudy urine, malaiseall the usual UTI symptoms I have always had. It was a weekend so I had to wait 2 days to go for the culture. I took it upon myself to take the PACs (Utiva) every 8 hours, 3 times a day to get myself through the weekend and the UTI symptoms went awaywhich never happens completely. On the Monday morning I went for the urinalysis and culture and the results came back NEGATIVE! Conclusion: the PACs actually cured my UTI!Since then I have added tea tree oil diluted in coconut oil as a vaginal salve for itching/vaginal infections and this has helped.Besides the usual recommendations, I try my best to keep my diet low in high carb foods and get exercise daily. I drink plenty of water. I take high quality probiotics daily. I keep my vaginal area very clean after BMs and shower morning and night. I take a few supplements including vitamin D, C and Omega 3. I try not to sit too long because that just creates a warm, dark, moist environment for bacteria to grow.And so far, so good. PACs are really working for me, keeping me UTI free.And I want to share this with others. If you do take PACs, keep in mind that they are for prevention so you must start from a position of no infectionso right away during or after antibiotic treatment. It is up to you if you want to take PACs more than once a dayafter all it is fruit. As I said, for me, taking it 3x per day has cured my UTI and I was 3 months in and am now 1 more month in with no infection. By no means is this an endorsement of PACs treatment instead of antibiotics. To be sure you no longer have a UTI, your doctor must order a urine test. He may be surprised as my urogynecologist was, to learn how effective PACs are. He was actually the one to suggest I try Utiva in the first place but had been pushing for me to go on a 6 month course of half dose antibiotics which I was opposed to.Im sorry this post is so long, but I wanted to be very clear about how PACs have worked for me. And I just want to help others who are suffering like I have. Contact me if you like with any questions. Liked by JK, Volunteer Mentor, nene22 Follow Report"

I have been feeling OK as of late. Physically I almost feel like me before the cancer. Emotionally I realize that things are now changed forever. In October ,which is here, I will meet my new oncologist. He will order scans and blood work so the cycle of surveillance begins for me. I was told that for the next 2 years I would have scans and blood work. Hopefully my cancer will not return but it just may. There is no way to tell how things will go. I was told that due to my tumor size I am at higher risk for recurrence. I will hope for the best. Many of you have already traveled the cancer trail some are just beginning the journey. Where ever you are with your cancer there is always hope. There may be pain and discomfort but we must fight to beat the beast that is cancer. I want to think of scans as positive in hopes of quelling my anxiety scanxiety. I have scan anxiety right now. A sense of dread intertwined with fear of the unknown. I dont like the drive to the cancer center it tends to fill me with much stress. I dont like checking in for appointments, the same questions asked, the same answers given. I am a cancer patient at a cancer center and that doesnt sit well with me. I have an ID card with my name on it reminding me I am a member of a new club I never thought I would be be a part of! Faces are becoming familiar at the cancer center. At this point of my journey, I feel no comfort in the newfamiliar. It feels very foreign and not part of me. Its been 4 months that is not very long since the cancer  officially invaded my life. Yet in many ways it feels like an eternity. So much has happened in those 4 months. I am grateful that my panic stage is over. I do feel less anxious in general. I am grateful for this site and for everyone who has given me insightful advise and direction. I find it most helpful! I feel supported which is very much appreciated. We all need to feel support! There are so many of us out there! There is strength in numbers!

When he was 18, I took him to ER due to lower back pain, turns out it was infection in both kidneys. ER dr. was curious how this could be at such a young age. He has/does have blood in urine, had a surgery to confirn no tumors. That checked out fine but still has blood in urine and back pain comes and goes, not real frequent though. Then about two years ago, he got foot pain in right foot, more trips to ER and dr.s for multiple x-rays, this pain comes around about every 6 months or so. He would get inflamatory meds and pain meds, pain goes away but what is it? Went to a specialist and he advised its Charco Marie Tooth Syndrome. He had a nerve test done to confirm, that was good, no damage at all. He had a genetics test done, this had three undetermined genes, so no real answer here if he has the syndrome. The specialist advised a major foot surgery, re directing tendons, reconstructing bones, we weren't convinced it was CMTS so we put surgery off for now.

I did not like the MRI. It was confining and noisy. I was able to listen to Vivaldis Four Seasons but it was interrupted by the machine asking me to breathe in and hold my breath etc. My back almost went into a spasm. I was both cold and hot. My extremities were cold while the sheet they put over me made me hot and a bit sweaty my hands, arms and feet felt cold. The tech explained things well enough. I will be dreading the next MRI. When I came home I took off the tape, coban, and I started bleeding a little from the needle site in my arm. I applied pressure and it stopped but that annoyed me. Thank Gid I dont take blood thinners I feel sorry for people that do I could see how you could bleed quite a bit! It made be annoyed that I had to go through the MRI because of the renal tumor I had and I will have more MRI s in my future. Thats just great! I know I need them. I am just depressed and annoyed that I do need them! I am also angry that I got this cancer in the first place! As if life isnt hard enough!

I feel really confused. I'm HIV+ and have been asymptomatic for a really long time viral load undetectable. I started noticing muscle spasms in my chest on left side a couple months ago and didn't think much of it. It seemed to increase making me somewhat anxious. Something told me to get a BP monitor. Now, I've always been told from regular labs that my kidney function was somewhat elevated but it was never said to me that I should do anything about it or pay attention to it. So my elevated kidney function has been in the background with not much focus. I felt scared to check I've always had normal to low BP. I took it and was shocked to see it was 150/100 which, for me was crazy high. I started having headaches, stiff neck, and these muscle spasms. I waited took my BP again and it was higher. I went to the ER they admitted me and did NMR stress test telling me my heart is fine no chance of heart attack. They did casually mention CKD 3 which rung a bell. I asked the physician on the way out if I needed to be concerned check my diet etc. He said no not really. But something didn't sit right. I got out of the hospital and immediately started a whole new diet. I've been eating over the last week a strict diet of (limited as I know they're high-er in sodium) bagels, low sodium tuna, bell pepper, tomato, almond milk, cream of wheat, blueberries, strawberries, Cucumber, onion, broccoli, cauliflower, egg whites massively reduced, sodium protein potassium and phosphorus. No more pigging out. My BP and symptoms subsided which pleased me. I wanted to wait before I made an appt with reg doctor to get referral to kidney doc to adjust eating. I also realize now I was taking 500 naproxyn once or twice a day for a couple months for sciatica. I had no idea about naproxyn and CKD. I do now. Now, I have this muscle spasm around my heart and in my neck it's as if my heart beat is in my neck. I cut the naproxyn and am off all vitamins except a multi which does not have potassium.

I feel really confused. I'm HIV+ and have been asymptomatic for a really long time viral load undetectable. I started noticing muscle spasms in my chest on left side a couple months ago and didn't think much of it. It seemed to increase making me somewhat anxious. Something told me to get a BP monitor. Now, I've always been told from regular labs that my kidney function was somewhat elevated but it was never said to me that I should do anything about it or pay attention to it. So my elevated kidney function has been in the background with not much focus. I felt scared to check I've always had normal to low BP. I took it and was shocked to see it was 150/100 which, for me was crazy high. I started having headaches, stiff neck, and these muscle spasms. I waited took my BP again and it was higher. I went to the ER they admitted me and did NMR stress test telling me my heart is fine no chance of heart attack. They did casually mention CKD 3 which rung a bell. I asked the physician on the way out if I needed to be concerned check my diet etc. He said no not really. But something didn't sit right. I got out of the hospital and immediately started a whole new diet. I've been eating over the last week a strict diet of (limited as I know they're high-er in sodium) bagels, low sodium tuna, bell pepper, tomato, almond milk, cream of wheat, blueberries, strawberries, Cucumber, onion, broccoli, cauliflower, egg whites massively reduced, sodium protein potassium and phosphorus. No more pigging out. My BP and symptoms subsided which pleased me. I wanted to wait before I made an appt with reg doctor to get referral to kidney doc to adjust eating. I also realize now I was taking 500 naproxyn once or twice a day for a couple months for sciatica. I had no idea about naproxyn and CKD. I do now.

Ive always had a very lean/muscular build growing up, but ive recently started gaining a little bit of weight. The results of my blood work were never a concern to me until a few weeks ago when I started to look into it. My first creatinine level was 1.2, and 5 months later I had more blood work done and my creatinine was 1.32, The second creatinine level was most likely affected by dehydration, NSAID use the day of the draw, and the fact I had been started on lisinipril/hctz prior to that. So im guessing my baseline is about 1.2. My egfr was 77. My question is, is this indicative of kidney problems? None of the nurse practitioners mentioned my creatinine level to me. I assume the high levels are from lean muscle and a high intake of protein? I eat like a horse, but im not like super muscular.. Just kind of lean. I worked out a TON in highschool, but not so much since I graduated 2 years ago. Im really worried about this, because I plan to start back at the gym soon, and I dont want that to affect my creatinine? I guess im more worried about when I get older and start working out more, because my creatinine will only go up from here, and this will just cause my gfr to fall as I get older.

Sound familiar? These are reactions to grief. Grief is a very personal experience  everyone grieves differently  even in the same family because the relationship of a father is different than that of a wife or a granddaughter. Unfortunately, often we grieve alone. Sometimes we dont want to bother others with our grief, and sometimes friends and family tell us that we should be over it by now. After all the person we lost was ill for a long time or was very old and it was their time or they are in a better place now. Sound familiar? Grieving is often described as the work of grief. It does feel like hard work doesnt it? Grief can be difficult because of the many factors related to the loss. If the loss followed a prolonged, serious illness you undoubtedly did some anticipatory grief work prior to the actual death of the loved one. If the loss, however, was sudden, i.e., accident related, suicide, a result of crime, etc. the sense of grief is coupled with shock. The relationship that you had with the loved one also affects your grief experience, i.e. was your relationship close or had it been strained? Do you feel guilt that you were not closer or do you feel guilty because you dont feel you did enough to help while your loved one was ill? Sometimes anger plays a part in the grief process. Did your loved one get poor medical treatment or a wrong and/or late diagnosis? Did your loved one not follow your doctors orders with regard to their health (diet, smoking, attention to meds or exercise)? All of these factors contribute to your experience of grief. Also, some losses are not so evident to others. These would include a miscarriage or a stillborn. Sometimes these losses are not considered as relevant to others as the loss of a person who has lived a longer life. In the case of a miscarriage, others might not even be aware of your loss. You may think of that person on anniversary dates (their birthday, date of their death) or you might think of them constantly. Unfortunately, sometime people say things that can multiply grief. Have you ever heard someone say, you should be over this by now? or I had a similar experience and Im OK. Well, most likely their similar experience was not the same as yours. Thinking you should be over it might compound your grief with feelings of guilt or frustration. Whether a recent loss, or a loss you experienced a long time ago, lets talk about it. Whatever your experience, Id like to hear your stories and together find a way to relocate that loved one so that we can experience peace in our lifetime. Together let us support each other in our grief journey. Teresa Liked by Kdawn, John, Volunteer Mentor, Jackie, Alumna Mentor, Gail, Alumna Mentor ... see all Follow Report"

She ended up working with the University of Washington  possible heart/lung transplant. She fought very hard and tried to continue an independent life. ( Im states away). She was also diabetic. She was trying real hard to better herself.Last Christmas, I did not hear from her. ( Her and I are our only blood family). Finally got a hold of her. She said she slept 4 days  thru Christmas. Ok, she did sleep a lot due to being weak from the lung issue. I am use to her sleeping a lot. We had a good talk, she sounded good and said she was going to get up and get some food. Days past. The pause on her phone to get to the answering machine got longer. I had a gut feeling. BUT I was really trying to give her support for being independent. Time passed and no response from FB, phone or messages. Gut feeling. BUT, IF I called in a wellness check and she was just sleeping, she would have killed me if her door had been broken down and she was asleep in the chair. Maybe she was feeling good and went to the casino and was tired after that and was resting? Well, Jan 9th, I called in a wellness check. They found her dead in bed.Have no idea how long she was there. No autopsy but I put things together and figured, since she was sleeping so much, she wasnt eating or taking insulin.. she went into a diabetic coma. So, I had to fly out to Seattle and take care of things. I held it together during the day, but the nights I went thru 2 bottles of Jack and took 2 mg of Klonopoin at night.. the nights were mine. Fast forward to May 24th. Her funeral at the national cemetery  clear across the state. Lots of turn out from people all over the country. I held it together well. the next day when we left for home, the interstate goes right by the cemetery. I looked up at it and just wanted to scream. I have been low before, had my share of hospital stays from mental breaks and lows. But NOTHING like this. Something was over me. I couldnt figure out how my heart was still beating and I felt so bad. It was like something came and took my soul. I was pretty messed up when my sister died.. but NOTHING like this.. very unfamiliar with it. They say there is no pain like the pain of a mother losing her child  I have SEEN this pain with a good friend when she lost her daughter  seen her body laying on the bed when Id check in on her.. but there was a bad  thing surrounding her. She was not there. I think this is what I was feeling.My step dad was in the back seat. ( I had a friend drive out with me so I wasnt driving). I could NOT let him see me break so as not to upset him. I Bawled silently all the way home.. across the state. Getting out of the car at gas stations and rest stop and letting it out a bit  but not so much as for someone to call the police.Got home, I asked IF I could stop at the liquor store,, NO! fine,(now, I didnt want to kill myself.. just needed NOT to feel this thing. I am trying to be sober.. so ok.. I bawled HARD for almost 2 hours. Until my body just couldnt do it any longer. SO, my next coping mech. is cutting. I had an over hour fight with a razor I won.. I actually got up and put it away. So, what to do???? I had my meds on the shelf. I have NEVER abused my meds. But,, I needed that thing to go away. so (somehow I came up with a stupid calculation of mg. that wouldnt kill me.) and I took 6-7 mg of Klonopin with a handful of meletonin just to kick it in. I did this for 4 days. Day 5 ,(wed) somehow I took myself to the ER. I dont remember ANYTHING ( well, 2 small things) of those 5 days. I even traveled an hour and a half to the town where my phsyc team is and had an emergency chat with one of them.I found out today about that day, she tried to get me to go to the hospital.. I didnt. I went and got 2 tattoos ( needed to feel some physical pain). I fell asleep for both.One of those days of the week, I even went to my phsyc Dr and explained the ER trip. ??? I drove 2 times out of town, I have NO remembrance of this.Im just like WOW.. I went to the ER in some state and never saw a Dr ( this was ONE of the things I remember as I was waiting to see who my dr was going to be  didnt want it to be a certain one- and I remember trying to focus on the name tag of the girl who gave me the IV.. she was not a Dr.I scared myself. I dont know how I feel about that whole episode. I actually didnt think about it till last week,, realized I blacked out several days.just WOW.. looking back.. how could the ER and the therapy clinic let me go.. I must have been very high functioning ??? Just had to share..and when I do see my primary again, I am going to ask her to read me the ER note from that day..

I had no idea Mayo Clinic had a Loss & Grief group. 6 years ago I moved to AZ to be closer to my aging parents. I left an abusive marriage after 16 years and was finally able to be near my family again. Only thing was, within 2 years, my mom was my caregiver- I was diagnosed with breast cancer and was undergoing treatment. My mom was my Hero, she survived ovarian cancer 36 years prior, and I couldnt get through it without her. Then, in 2018, my mom started to not feel well. Doctor after doctor, they all said she had anxiety, indigestion, asthma, food allergies, hiatal hernia. No doctors ever sent her in for any kind of testing. They all said, due to her older age, there was no need to start testing. Elderly people are treated so poorly in Arizona! By March 2018, we were in the ER quite a few times. My mom was getting very weak, she could no longer hold food down, and she was starting to fall at home. The paramedics were called several times to help her up off the floor when she fell and couldnt stand back up on her own. By April 2018, she went in for emergency surgery for a ruptured intestine. Then during surgery, they found a huge tumor that was blocking her stomach and intestines. The surgeon said it was beyond his s one of practice as he was a General Surgeon for the ER Department but he was educated enough to know he needed to place a permanent feeding tube in her and refer her to oncology. He told us it was not encouraging for a good prognosis, but suggested if she had the will to live, they maybe could if she could gain strength back have chemo to shrink the tumor and surgically remove the tumor and then remove the feeding tube so she can continue treatment to possibly stabilize the cancer. All my dad heard was she will have chemo, remove the feeding tube, she will be cured. He already hit the dental stage that my mom was not doing well. And I was all alone in this fight to help him through this. My sister lives in Maryland and only involved herself when it benefited her. My youngest son lived nearby and he and I were up against an incredible fight to not only help my mom through what she was going to face when she woke up from anesthesia, but now with my dads reality of losing his wife of 56 years. It took several days for the biopsy to return to us. The oncologist asked us to meet with him. Guilt #1. I was sick and had an appointment with my PCP to get a clearance to return to work so I couldnt be at this appointment with my mom at our mutual cancer clinic, but I agreed to attend by conference call. I could hear my mom crying for me and begging for me to be there with her. My dad again still in denial, decided he hated this oncologist because the oncologist gave my mom 2-3 months to live and stated she would not survive through chemo. My dad only heard, she will be cured after having chemo, surgery, and she will eat again. He expected of me to line up several 2nd opinions with my mom, who was fully bed ridden now and 100% on a feeding tube with stage 4 adenocarcinoma with an originating diagnosis of stage 4 pancreatic cancer. My mom chose to go home and have palliative care work with her, I did what I could driving over in the morning, at lunch, and after work to help with medications and feeding as well as taking her to the bathroom and changing. My dad became very angry with me saying I saw him as an idiot when I asked him if he would be able to help with the feeding tube while I was at work as I was not going to be able to leave in an emergency to get to them. He started yelling at me every chance he got. He kept asking me when the 2nd opinions were happening. I was using all extra time calling cancer clinics and learning that if she wasnt outpatient and walking, she probably was not going to be accepted. I asked each one of the ones who agreed to schedule with her to call her directly because she would know her own schedule. The day she told me U of A said they dont accept her insurance was the day I knew she was accepting her own fate and she did not want to move forward. I knew they took her insurance, they told me, but I let it go. My mom went into hospice and stayed home. My dad continued to yell at her when she said she needed help going to the bathroom. She would call me, I would go to their house in the middle of the night to help and of course get yelled at too by my dad for the interference. He had these ideas my mom was going back to her childhood and pretending to be a little 6 year old girl needing to go to the bathroom, but doing it for attention. My mom would have an accident, start crying, fall on the floor, call me and it would start all over again.until 7/1, she fell out of her bed bleeding internally in the middle of the night. She was rushed to the ER, then to a hospice hospital where they kept her heart beating until family could get there to say their goodbyes. She passed away at 2:10pm, 7/1/18. Hospice said my dad had to move in with me, he was unable to make good decisions on his own. He was not happy with this. He and I already had the strained relationship left over from my moms illness and death. I was driving him back and forth all hours of the night to their house, the bank, the stores they frequented, restaurants they always went to, etc one night I got home from work late. He said, lets go out for dinner. I told him, No, I have to feed the dogs, Im tired and there are things in the refrigerator. I go to the refrigerator and tell him whats in there, he ignored me, and said lets go out somewhere Ill pay. I told him, can you just be grateful for what others do for you? His response was, I dont have to. I just have to be kind. Thats basically the last thing he ever said to me. He went into another room, called my son to come pick him up and take him back to his home. He decided to live in his home while it was up for sale. He never responded to any of my phone calls. I finally got a call from the hospice social worker that my dad was found in a pool of blood on the floor of the family room. He was rushed to the ER. I left work and met him there. Im the Assessment he called me his sister (who he hated) and yelled at me, cussed at me, threatening me in the ER and the hospital. I have a therapist I see at my cancer clinic who recommended I not communicate with him during this emotional time as I was preparing for a very hard Neurosurgical surgery. I had multiple complications and almost didnt survive. My sister took it upon herself to cut me off of all planning for all preparations for my dad and my dad then started telling stories to all he knew that were not true about how horrible I had been to him. After I was allowed to leave my home and return to work (8 weeks), my dad entered hospice at a nursing facility. I went to see him several times and cried over our relationship. He was sweet to me in front of other people or family, but abusive to me when we were alone together. He passed away on 10/4/18 3 months after my mom passed away and I was called 30 minutes after he passed, after the hospice nurse called my sister who lives back east, even though I lived 20 minutes away, and when I picked up his stuff, I found out that hospice nurse knew he was having difficulties the night before because he aspirated but never called me. My sister and I were both equally POAs but she chose and my dad chose to exclude for reasons I still dont understand. I had to hire a lawyer to solve trust fund issues as my sister stole everything and even told the mortuary to not include me in the funeral preparations or the upcoming memorial for the unveiling of the memorial plate and I own the plot property. Due to my cancer diagnosis and a spinal cord injury and Ongoing spinal cord disease, I dont have the fight in me, but I dont understand why all this was done to me.

I had no idea Mayo Clinic had a Loss & Grief group. 6 years ago I moved to AZ to be closer to my aging parents. I left an abusive marriage after 16 years and was finally able to be near my family again. Only thing was, within 2 years, my mom was my caregiver- I was diagnosed with breast cancer and was undergoing treatment. My mom was my Hero, she survived ovarian cancer 36 years prior, and I couldnt get through it without her. Then, in 2018, my mom started to not feel well. Doctor after doctor, they all said she had anxiety, indigestion, asthma, food allergies, hiatal hernia. No doctors ever sent her in for any kind of testing. They all said, due to her older age, there was no need to start testing. Elderly people are treated so poorly in Arizona! By March 2018, we were in the ER quite a few times. My mom was getting very weak, she could no longer hold food down, and she was starting to fall at home. The paramedics were called several times to help her up off the floor when she fell and couldnt stand back up on her own. By April 2018, she went in for emergency surgery for a ruptured intestine. Then during surgery, they found a huge tumor that was blocking her stomach and intestines. The surgeon said it was beyond his s one of practice as he was a General Surgeon for the ER Department but he was educated enough to know he needed to place a permanent feeding tube in her and refer her to oncology. He told us it was not encouraging for a good prognosis, but suggested if she had the will to live, they maybe could if she could gain strength back have chemo to shrink the tumor and surgically remove the tumor and then remove the feeding tube so she can continue treatment to possibly stabilize the cancer. All my dad heard was she will have chemo, remove the feeding tube, she will be cured. He already hit the dental stage that my mom was not doing well. And I was all alone in this fight to help him through this. My sister lives in Maryland and only involved herself when it benefited her. My youngest son lived nearby and he and I were up against an incredible fight to not only help my mom through what she was going to face when she woke up from anesthesia, but now with my dads reality of losing his wife of 56 years. It took several days for the biopsy to return to us. The oncologist asked us to meet with him. Guilt #1. I was sick and had an appointment with my PCP to get a clearance to return to work so I couldnt be at this appointment with my mom at our mutual cancer clinic, but I agreed to attend by conference call. I could hear my mom crying for me and begging for me to be there with her. My dad again still in denial, decided he hated this oncologist because the oncologist gave my mom 2-3 months to live and stated she would not survive through chemo. My dad only heard, she will be cured after having chemo, surgery, and she will eat again. He expected of me to line up several 2nd opinions with my mom, who was fully bed ridden now and 100% on a feeding tube with stage 4 adenocarcinoma with an originating diagnosis of stage 4 pancreatic cancer. My mom chose to go home and have palliative care work with her, I did what I could driving over in the morning, at lunch, and after work to help with medications and feeding as well as taking her to the bathroom and changing. My dad became very angry with me saying I saw him as an idiot when I asked him if he would be able to help with the feeding tube while I was at work as I was not going to be able to leave in an emergency to get to them. He started yelling at me every chance he got. He kept asking me when the 2nd opinions were happening. I was using all extra time calling cancer clinics and learning that if she wasnt outpatient and walking, she probably was not going to be accepted. I asked each one of the ones who agreed to schedule with her to call her directly because she would know her own schedule. The day she told me U of A said they dont accept her insurance was the day I knew she was accepting her own fate and she did not want to move forward. I knew they took her insurance, they told me, but I let it go. My mom went into hospice and stayed home. My dad continued to yell at her when she said she needed help going to the bathroom. She would call me, I would go to their house in the middle of the night to help and of course get yelled at too by my dad for the interference. He had these ideas my mom was going back to her childhood and pretending to be a little 6 year old girl needing to go to the bathroom, but doing it for attention. My mom would have an accident, start crying, fall on the floor, call me and it would start all over again.until 7/1, she fell out of her bed bleeding internally in the middle of the night. She was rushed to the ER, then to a hospice hospital where they kept her heart beating until family could get there to say their goodbyes. She passed away at 2:10pm, 7/1/18. Hospice said my dad had to move in with me, he was unable to make good decisions on his own. He was not happy with this. He and I already had the strained relationship left over from my moms illness and death. I was driving him back and forth all hours of the night to their house, the bank, the stores they frequented, restaurants they always went to, etc one night I got home from work late. He said, lets go out for dinner. I told him, No, I have to feed the dogs, Im tired and there are things in the refrigerator. I go to the refrigerator and tell him whats in there, he ignored me, and said lets go out somewhere Ill pay. I told him, can you just be grateful for what others do for you? His response was, I dont have to. I just have to be kind. Thats basically the last thing he ever said to me. He went into another room, called my son to come pick him up and take him back to his home. He decided to live in his home while it was up for sale. He never responded to any of my phone calls. I finally got a call from the hospice social worker that my dad was found in a pool of blood on the floor of the family room. He was rushed to the ER. I left work and met him there. Im the Assessment he called me his sister (who he hated) and yelled at me, cussed at me, threatening me in the ER and the hospital. I have a therapist I see at my cancer clinic who recommended I not communicate with him during this emotional time as I was preparing for a very hard Neurosurgical surgery. I had multiple complications and almost didnt survive. My sister took it upon herself to cut me off of all planning for all preparations for my dad and my dad then started telling stories to all he knew that were not true about how horrible I had been to him.

After 3 brain surgeries and 6 weeks of brain and spine radiation, He spent 4 months, fighting like the warrior he is, battling what was a rare Glioblastoma and Embryonal Tumor (CNS) hybrid Tumor .. The tumor in his brain ended up a mix of Embryonal, which meant tumors spread throughout brain and in spinal cord via cerebral spinal fluid. April 10th, after all treatments to fight this monster cancer were exhausted, the tumors came back and my precious son passed in hospice on April 17. It has been unbearable, as those on this site know all too well. I know we all grieve for our losses, parents arent supposed to write the obituary and plan a service for their child, nor their siblings. Is there anyone that has experienced this type of brain tumor that leaves the brain, travels throughout the CNS and paralyzes a soldier of 9 years to not leave a hospital bed until Hospice. I am desperately looking for other people who experienced this type of cancer as it is rare and leaves me and my family completely at a loss as to cause. We are told it is due to cells splitting abnormally and more molecular and very rare and extremely bad luck . Our docs and medical team have been wonderful but so much unknown about this hybrid of tumor. Sincerely, Holly Dereks mom Liked by Scott, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

She just turned 72. After 4 months in a Hospital she was finally placed in a Long-Term Care Facility (for memory impaired), a lock-up where she has been for just over 3 months. She does not remember me, calls me Mommy or Barb her sister. Occasionally she remembers my name. She shuffles when she walks. She has poor eyesight now. She needs help with bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, basically everything. She cannot form a complete sentence but does come out with words once in a while that I know and understand, mostly though she tries to talk but the words just dont come out as intelligible words. So shes here yet shes not here. She has no joy, no laughter, no memories to share with me or anyone, and Im not sure if she can feel anything, emotionally or physically. My visits are arduous because we cannot have a conversation. I cant tell her things, share anything with her. She is constantly agitated, anxious , and I fear she is lonely, bored and scared. And there is nothing I can do to assuage her feelings if in fact that is the case. I come home feeling depressed, lonely too. I dont know what future (time here) she has. Nor do I know how to plan my own future. I am 73, reasonably healthy. I have guilt feelings all the time. I feel sorry for her, and me. I watch her in the home and she just behaves as if no one cares, I guess because to her no one does. Or she is just living in her own little world. To me her life is empty and meaningless. I am at a loss. I feel as if my life is on constant hold, frozen in this daily warp of dementia. Liked by Scott, Volunteer Mentor, John, Volunteer Mentor, cmael, margockim ... see all Follow Report"

I hope today, a new weekend, and a new month, brings some goodness to each caregiver everywhere! I send you my best regards and wishes today and everyday. I have been struggling lately with my grief and the loss of my wife. While I am keeping busy, visiting with family and friends, getting out, and trying to establish what my new normal will be in life, I continue to struggle with not only our familys loss, but also one nagging thought. I am wondering if anyone else has confronted this issue. It is this: Everything I read on grief and loss gave me two distinct impressions. One was that there were stages of grief and loss, like steps. Most even called them the stages of grief. Second was that the end of life would be like some movie, book, etc. You know, friends gathered around, smiling, calm, peaceful, angels strumming harps, etc. Well, in my case, and I admit I may be different than most, which is why I bring this up, neither of those two things were true. First neither my wife, children, nor I proceeded through those stages of grief. My wife hit on one and stayed there for years. My children (grown) and grandchildren are not processing grief in those supposed steps either. And for me they were basically unrecognizable. Loss continues for the three of us to be overwhelming at times and the triggers are usually small events, but powerful in their ability to effect new equilibrium. On the issue of loss, I am having a great deal of difficulty getting past the horror of my wifes last two months of life. Her physical pain was controlled, but that was all. My sleep pattern is still a wreck (I was on a 2-hour med regimen for her for her last three months), I am plagued with nightmares about her last months, and how she looked to me and would beg frequently for me to fix it when I could not. I had always been the one to take on her battles and help as best I could until those last days, when it was beyond anyones control. It did not help that we were constantly barraged with (I am sure well-meaning) folks who would tell us over and over either it will end peacefully or that I would welcome her passing. No, it didnt end well and no I dont welcome her passing as I know she would have given anything for even one more minute with us. Grief and loss seem to be more personalized and difficult than anyone actually writes about. Reality might bite, but it beats mythology for caregivers. At least I think so. I would have preferred to be better prepared for reality than the wishful thinking and one-size-fits-all pontificating offered as what to expect. Thanks for listening and Im interested to know if this is just our experiences or perhaps a bit more common than not.

I was all set to enjoy our more mild winters in southern RI and get outside more when I started to have one bothersome thing happen after another. I had signed up for an exercise program that I wanted to get back into. However, my rotator cuff was acting up and my trainer wouldnt let me begin the program until I got clearance from my doctor. Very shortly after that, I experienced a horrible case of vertigo that snowballed into a bout of migraines. Every morning I was having mini-panic attacks and migraines. After 22+ years of lung cancer, I surely didnt need these added stress factors. I started to search for anything that would help me stay in the present and help me relax. My next CT scan isnt for another 4 months so I wanted to enjoy those months before I get panicky again. lol Then it seemed that I had one doctors appointment after another. I was inundated with illnesses and doctors and tests and blech. Im an early riser and hit the computer first thing to check on my eagles (I watch the most famous pair of eagles in the world, https://www.raptorresource.org/birdcams/decorah-eagles/ I then check my email, Facebook and check in with Connect.This is what I found this AM.

How do I get it?,"I know that I have been confused as to what palliative care means until my oncologist recently used it in reference to me me! I said, Whoa, hold your horses am I dying or near the end, I have plans? All of my life I have known it to be in reference to dying patients, keeping them comfortable and pain free. Boy was I wrong!The goal of palliative care is to help people with serious illnesses feel better. It prevents or treats symptoms and side effects of disease and treatment. Palliative care also treats emotional, social, practical, and spiritual problems that illnesses can bring up. When the person feels better in these areas, they have an improved quality of life.Palliative care can be given at the same time as treatments meant to cure or treat the disease. Palliative care may be given when the illness is diagnosed, throughout treatment, during follow-up, and at the end of life.https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000536.htmI am blessed to have such an excellent oncologist. Dr. Jennifer Temel is an expert in palliative care and uses it with her patients along with other doctors caring for that patient. Palliative care needs to begin at diagnosis and follow you through your illness- from hang nail to manicure. (http://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/jennifer-s-temel-md/) So with out further blathering please read what she has to say because she says it perfectly.https://www.ascopost.com/archive/meetings/2015-palliative-care-in-oncology-symposium/jennifer-s-temel-mds-expert-perspective-palliative-care-in-2015/(By the way, its true- the camera does add 10 lbs on!)My palliative care has been excellent since the very beginning. After surgery I have had every pain and discomfort tended to, medicines or suggestions given to me, explanations made as clear as they could on the day that I asked. I think of palliative care as having a new mommy. This is the video that Dr. Temel refers to at the end of her talk. https://www.ascopost.com/archive/meetings/2015-palliative-care-in-oncology-symposium/vicki-jackson-md-mph-on-effective-care-integration-and-the-comanagement-model/ What have your Palliative care experiences been like?

We live far apart, so when I got to him he was very ill and close to death. After he got his brain scan the doctor put him on a Dexamethasone 6mg a day. He had made a huge turn around. Seems alert, eating well and no more falls. He wants me to go back home and Im very concerned that his prognosis could change overnight . He has refused all other treatments because he is terminal, so its just the steroids. Does anyone know about how long these steroids will continue keeping his brain swelling down. He wont let me bring in help and he wont come home with me. I was hoping someone had a general idea on steroid use and there effectiveness. Can they suddenly stop helping?

I am writing to the Connect from Thailand. I have been reading excellent supporting messages in this group for a few weeks and very impressed by members here. Here are my story: My father was diagnosed with NSCLC adenocarcinoma 5 years ago. We had undergone cryosurgery followed by EGFR target drugs, i.e., Tarceva and Iressa, for 5 years. His EGFR mutation test was positive. Now, at the age of 82 yrs old, the cancer has relapsed with new solid tumor at the same location (2.5 cm x 1.5 cm). Hoping to use Tagrisso to treat the mutated cancer, he had done biopsy again but unfortunately, the test for T790M was negative. (We have positive for EGFR T854A (21.98%) and L858R (21.73%)) The test for PD-L1 shows only 2% for both tumor and immune cell but the Mismatch Repair (MMR) test indicates proficient MMR and MSS (I was told that this makes the PD-L1 drug less effective). Our doctor in Thailand suggested using PD-L1 drug such as Keytruda and Opdivo in combination with Iressa but we are still in the decision making stage. (From my research, it seems like the response rate of PD-L1 is not high and there are also unpredictive autoimmune side effects which could also persist even if we stop the drug. ) In searching for more information, I also run into an article ""Trial Results Highlight Changing Lung Cancer Treatment Landscape"". It was mentioned in the last part of the article that ""use of EGFR targeted drug in combination of PD-L1 GREATLY increased the risk of serious side effects in the lung."" Here is the link : https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2018/durvalumab-brigatinib-lung-cancer-trials At the moment, he shows no sign of sickness and still on Iressa until now. In the meantime, my father also controls his diet (anti-angiogenesis foods) and tries using Cannabis oil, as well. (Just started over a week ago.) I just want to have views or experiences from members in the group or perhaps doctor on the side effect/ efficacy of PD-L1 drug in combination with EGFR target drug. Perhaps, they can help us make decision easier. Thank you very much in advance. Appreciate your comments. Liked by Merry, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

He has COPD and they have found a tumor in his lung. The tumor is cancer but they can't determine what kind? They said it showed signs of an upper GI cancer but all tests so far show no other cancer (PET, MRI of brain) waiting on the endcoscopy results from last week but that also looks clear according to the GI doctor. I have read about a lung cancer that mimics upper GI cancer in pathology called Pulmonary Enteric Adenocarcinoma. The doctors are considering it but we still don't know.. My poor husband has endured pretty much every test there is at this point. EKG's, EEG's, Heart Stress Tests and Monitoring, PET, CT and MRI scans, a lung biopsy, esophagus biopsy and upper GI biopsy and subcarnial lymph node biopsy. Additionally over this past year he has been diagnosed with Parkinsons (which they say he does not have now) and has had other symptoms which no tests show any disease (Kidney's Liver, etc). I have also read up on something called paraneoplastic symdrome which might account for his fainting spells? His lack of stable blood pressure? (his blood pressure can go from 200 to 74 in a matter of minutes (the upper blood pressure number..systolic). This site has been so helpful to me on my breast cancer journey and also throughout his 'misdiagnosis' of Parkinsons over the past year. Hoping someone might have some insight or thoughts? We will meet with his new oncologist on Wednesday and I have a second opinion oncologist on board is needed. We are in Colorado with Kaiser and have been treated well but I am looking at a second medical source (the University of Colorado Health Center) as they have more resources and experts as well as clinical trials.but FIRST, we need a diagnosis and it's been over 6 weeks and we are no closer.

Beginning in summer of 2012, I began having shortness of breath (SOB) with no other symptoms. I felt a constant need to yawn, and every few breaths wouldn't satisfy the SOB. I would take a deep breath, and felt like it would get ""stuck"" before satisfying the air hunger feeling. About every 3-5 deep breaths would satisfy it, only for it to return a minute later. I got an endoscopy and other tests done, which revealed that I had some esophageal erosion due toacid refluxand a slight hiatal hernia and was diagnosed withGERD. I had always have badheartburn, so I was prescribed with Prilosec, which I have been taking daily since them. I've tried stopping it a few times but the reflux always comes back a lot worse. Lung tests and x-rays were normal. Heart tests normal. Blood test revealed a slight anemia but otherwise pretty normal. I did some research reading forums where someone suggested taking vitamin B-12. Strangely, I took it and the SOB disappeared almost instantly. However, it only lasted a few days for it to return just as bad. I then started taking an iron supplement, which again made the SOB disappear quickly- same thing; symptom returned days later. After further research, I came across a breathing exercise method called the Buteyko method. Essentially you do a lot of breath holding to build up CO2 and reduce breathing as the theory is that I had chronic hyperventilation causing too much CO2 to exit my body. After applying the method and reducing my breathing, the SOB disappeared after only 2 days and I felt completely normal. I continued the method a few more days then no longer felt the need to pursue the exercises. I was normal for a whole year when the SOB once again returned with some chest tightness. I applied the method again and the symptom went away, this time with a little more effort; after about 3 weeks. I included physical exercise which also helped with my breathing. After that, I was normal for about 2 years. I mistakenly stopped or at least slowed down exercise and the SOB returned once again. I applied the method and began running for exercise but the SOB kept getting worse. It got so bad, I had multiplepanic attacksand the feeling of completely empty lungs with the inability to satisfy it with deep breaths. I had to stop exercise altogether, apply the Buteyko method and do breathing exercises very carefully with very light and slow exercise. This helped, but it took many weeks for the SOB to improve. Then, it was almost normal when over a year ago as I was running, I couldn't get a deep breath to satisfy exercise-induced SOB. I have had SOB continuously since then (a year and a half). I once again started doing breathing exercises and slowly building up physical exercise, but I can't do any prolonged cardio activity because the SOB gets to a point where deep breathing will not satisfy it. While the breathing exercises have helped, they have had very little effect compared to previous efforts. It seems that every time the symptom returned, greater effort yields few results. I suspect there is something, some underlying cause that is causing the SOB that has alluded me this entire time. So for the past few months to a year, the SOB is worse on some days, better on others, but never gone. There's no rhyme or reason or pattern for it. It's just there, sometimes affecting my sleep. I sometimes can't get a deep breath to satisfy it every now and then, but for the most part, a big gulp of air will satisfy it. But it returns seconds to minutes later. It's as though every breath doesn't deliver what it's supposed to, the SOB builds up, and then I have to take a big gulp of air to get rid of the feeling, pattern repeats. My breathing pattern is normal, however. I don't feel like anything physical is happening, but sometimes it feels like my airways and nostrils are slightly inflamed due toallergies, but when I don't feel inflammation the SOB is still there. Recent lung function tests show normal- I don't have asthma, or any other problems with my lungs. Heart tests are normal though I did have about a two week bout of heart palpitations which came and went. Haven't had any for a while- it just mysteriously started happening then stopped. Blood tests are normal, though tests always show a slight elevation of biliruben which my doc thinks is Gilbert's disease. I don't have sleep apnea (normal test), bloody oxygenation is normal, heart rate normal. I recently saw local naturopath (since mainstream docs aren't able to help) who immediately suspected a liver problem when I described my SOB, possibly liver inflammation. He used an electrodermal testing machine to test his theory which did seem to show a problem with my liver and gallbladder. He gave me digestive enzymes and a gallbladder formula to help clear a bile duct clog, thus reducing liver inflammation. He also determined with the machine that I have an egg sensitivity so I've been avoiding eggs. Been taking this and avoiding eggs for a couple of months, but there has been no noticeable improvement. Everything else is normal. Emotionally I'm normal- no anxiety,depression, etc. The SOB seems to be the only symptom of something, but always comes back worse, until a year and half ago when it came back and has remained since. I feel like I shouldn't have to do breath holding exercises every day just to maintain my breathing well enough to do every day things. Does anyone have any idea of a possible underlying cause?

After that, I was normal for about 2 years. I mistakenly stopped or at least slowed down exercise and the SOB returned once again. I applied the method and began running for exercise but the SOB kept getting worse. It got so bad, I had multiplepanic attacksand the feeling of completely empty lungs with the inability to satisfy it with deep breaths. I had to stop exercise altogether, apply the Buteyko method and do breathing exercises very carefully with very light and slow exercise. This helped, but it took many weeks for the SOB to improve. Then, it was almost normal when over a year ago as I was running, I couldn't get a deep breath to satisfy exercise-induced SOB. I have had SOB continuously since then (a year and a half). I once again started doing breathing exercises and slowly building up physical exercise, but I can't do any prolonged cardio activity because the SOB gets to a point where deep breathing will not satisfy it. While the breathing exercises have helped, they have had very little effect compared to previous efforts. It seems that every time the symptom returned, greater effort yields few results. I suspect there is something, some underlying cause that is causing the SOB that has alluded me this entire time. So for the past few months to a year, the SOB is worse on some days, better on others, but never gone. There's no rhyme or reason or pattern for it. It's just there, sometimes affecting my sleep. I sometimes can't get a deep breath to satisfy it every now and then, but for the most part, a big gulp of air will satisfy it. But it returns seconds to minutes later. It's as though every breath doesn't deliver what it's supposed to, the SOB builds up, and then I have to take a big gulp of air to get rid of the feeling, pattern repeats. My breathing pattern is normal, however. I don't feel like anything physical is happening, but sometimes it feels like my airways and nostrils are slightly inflamed due toallergies, but when I don't feel inflammation the SOB is still there. Recent lung function tests show normal- I don't have asthma, or any other problems with my lungs. Heart tests are normal though I did have about a two week bout of heart palpitations which came and went. Haven't had any for a while- it just mysteriously started happening then stopped. Blood tests are normal, though tests always show a slight elevation of biliruben which my doc thinks is Gilbert's disease. I don't have sleep apnea (normal test), bloody oxygenation is normal, heart rate normal. I recently saw local naturopath (since mainstream docs aren't able to help) who immediately suspected a liver problem when I described my SOB, possibly liver inflammation. He used an electrodermal testing machine to test his theory which did seem to show a problem with my liver and gallbladder. He gave me digestive enzymes and a gallbladder formula to help clear a bile duct clog, thus reducing liver inflammation. He also determined with the machine that I have an egg sensitivity so I've been avoiding eggs. Been taking this and avoiding eggs for a couple of months, but there has been no noticeable improvement. Everything else is normal. Emotionally I'm normal- no anxiety,depression, etc. The SOB seems to be the only symptom of something, but always comes back worse, until a year and half ago when it came back and has remained since. I feel like I shouldn't have to do breath holding exercises every day just to maintain my breathing well enough to do every day things. Does anyone have any idea of a possible underlying cause?

I would take a deep breath, and felt like it would get ""stuck"" before satisfying the air hunger feeling. About every 3-5 deep breaths would satisfy it, only for it to return a minute later. I got an endoscopy and other tests done, which revealed that I had some esophageal erosion due toacid refluxand a slight hiatal hernia and was diagnosed withGERD. I had always have badheartburn, so I was prescribed with Prilosec, which I have been taking daily since them. I've tried stopping it a few times but the reflux always comes back a lot worse. Lung tests and x-rays were normal. Heart tests normal. Blood test revealed a slight anemia but otherwise pretty normal. I did some research reading forums where someone suggested taking vitamin B-12.

After further research, I came across a breathing exercise method called the Buteyko method.

I am suffering from bad health anxiety these days just like many others. I'm wondering if it's possible to have pneumonia (let's say mild) with a normal oxygen saturation of 98%? It all started with a fever 6 weeks ago. The fever itself only lasted 2 days but since then I've had a wet cough (not that bad), fatigue, anxiety, feel like I'm short of breath doing light exercises. I've been sleeping very poorly with many sleepless nights at the start. Now I can manage around 6 hours of interrupted sleep per night with the help of Valerian and Melatonin. The poor sleep certainly isn't helping my recovery. It's only now that the wet cough seems to be going away. The past 3-4 weeks or so I struggle to sleep more than 2-3 hours at a time. Quite often I would wake up breathing quite heavily or faster than usual. I'm was concerned that I might have a mild form of pneumonia. Doctor advised me to buy a pulse oximeter which I did today. I tested myself and my SpO2 level is average 98%, reading between 97-99%. So basically my current symptoms are fatigue, lack of sleep, minor throat irritation with little mucus, and breathing issues. The breathing issues is partly psychological but I'm concerned that there is something wrong with my lungs. Thanks for any input. Stay safe! Liked by Merry, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

Im worried about covid 19 because I still feel like my lungs havent recovered, and I cough every night. Im taking Zarelto and will see a pulmonologist for a follow up appointment at the end of this month to look over the echocardiogram and pulmonary functions test results. However, since hes a critical care pulmonologist at the largest hospital in Honolulu, Im wondering if by the end of this month things are going to be so bad here with covid 19 that he will only be working in the hospital and wont see people with less serious conditions.

Last night while I was ending my day on-line a feeling of craving came over. It was as if a dark force was pushing through different layers of air to capture me. I knew exactly what it was- a slight nicotine craving! I quit 22+ years ago- cold turkey- kind of. I was to have a lobectomy of my right lower lung because of cancer. I stopped one night and put a patch on. A week later it was removed before my operation and never went back on. What was so hard about quitting was not only the craving but the angst and anger that came with it. Why was I angry? Why wasn't I excited, like looking forward to her first party? This quitting smoking was a positive thing! I wouldn't stink anymore, my nails and teeth would lighten up. my Blood pressure would drop and I would have more money in my pocket. Because there are cyclic physical and emotional stages that you go through when you quit. Your body has been use to nicotine. ""Nicotine prompts the brain to release more dopamine, a chemical that is found to give humans a pleasant and relaxed mood. This is the most gratifying, yet short-lived, effect of cigarette smoking. Since the brain becomes nicotine tolerant after some time, smokers need more of the substance into their system to achieve the same pleasure. When nicotine levels go down, the brain sends signals that will make you crave for that nicotine fhttps://vapingdaily.com/quitting-effeix again. You try very hard to distract yourself by different methods, such as eating, exercising, and more. Additionally, when stress levels rise, the body craves for more nicotine since it is used to the quick fix that the substance gives. Everyone has a certain level of emotional quotient that gauges his or her ability to react towards different occurrences, manage anger and stress, communicate, and resolve issues. According to studies, the ability of a person to manage his or her anger and emotions during stressful events is also linked to smoking habits.""* https://vapingdaily.com/quitting-effects/anger-management-when-quitting/ There are many triggers that also set off cravings. Coffee, for some reason, didn't trigger any for me, not did seeing anyone smoke or inhaling any secondary smoke which I tried to avoid. My cravings, as you know, came and went, but they do go. You do get a break. One thing that I would encourage you to do is to exercise like your life depends on it. And it does. I have no idea how long that you have smoked but I smoked heavily for 35 years. With out smoking kicking in endorphins I really needed to replace them. Exercise does that. Because I had a long recovery due to my surgery I couldn't exercise enough to make a difference. I hope that you can! Do you think that you can try again, knowing all of these things, with more success? Follow Report"

The Mayo Clinic is my go to website for clear and reliable medical info. My 90 yr old Mom has pneumonia. I'm concerned because I don't believe that her doctor is taking this situation with the seriousness and attention that it deserves. Here is the situation. My Mom has always deferred to doctors' diagnosis and analysis of medical conditions. I was pretty much shocked when she came back from her visit and she told me that her doctor took a chest xray and said that he could tell everything that he needed to know from that. If you look up pneumonia on this website, you'll realize that was pretty much an ill-informed statement. To date he has prescribed her an antibiotic, an inhaler that unfortunately I wasn't able to find out what it was, a week or so of Prednisone, and now Anora Ellipta powder inhaler. I have searched high and low on the Internet, and have found nothing that states that Anora Ellipta is a treatment for pneumonia. It does however have a rather long and frightening list of side effects and possible complications. And lastly, I persuaded my Mom to tell him that he needs to take a sputum test. He refused and told her she didn't need it. He also has not done any bloodwork to date. Bottom line is that I'm very worried that she's not receiving the proper diagnosis, care and treatment and what the consequences of that might be. She did appear to respond to the Prednisone for a short period, but has since regressed. Thanks very much for any information, advice or ideas regarding this situation. John Q.

Like my headache any flu like symptoms can be a reaction and are just minor inconveniences. Also another misnomer is that the flu shot will not prevent the flu. It does in most cases but it really does minimize the symptoms if you ever get it. Have you ever had the flu? I have and anything that minimizes the symptoms is welcomed in my book.Yesterday, coincidentally was also the day that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released their long awaited report about drug resistant illnesses and what they found is astounding. With the Earth's temperatures warming so fast and high there are all sorts of organic changes that are happening. One of them is the antibiotic-resistant infections. With this report it is ever more important to be vigilant and defensive against exposing ourselves to any situation that might harm us. For example if the flu, or any other ""bug"" is going around your community forgo the holiday party, stay in and safe. Lung diseases and cancers have compromised our bodies. This means that our natural defenses have been broken through, making it easier for other undesirables to join the club. It's like invitations are sent out! Germs have become ""super-bugs"" that resist present day medicines. ""Bugs"" are smart creatures. Unlike us ""bugs"" have learned to evolve so that killing them is often impossible, so far. If only our bodies could do the same.This is the report that was released:https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/11/13/deadly-superbugs-pose-greater-threat-than-previously-estimated/ I hope that you all have gotten your flu shot. If you haven't what are the reasons? What methods have you used to avoid becoming ill during the holidays?

I was put on oxygen for sleeping when the diaphragm weakness/paralysis causes the most problems. High dose steroids during the attacks seems to be the standard treatment, but not much is known about how to prevent worsening. Ive seen case studies where rituximab was used too, but there are too few cases out there to be able to define a real treatment protocol. Anyone out there with any knowledge of this rare area?

So to start it off back in April (6 months ago) what i think and many doctors think happened is as follows. I was coming in to work at the time was Allstate Insurance, and theirs a HUGE sliding glass door that is extremely hard to open almost like its stuck and it slightly came off the track its probably 200 pounds and you really have to put a lot in to opening it. So 2 days after this i really started to feel this discomfort. My chest felt like there was a huge amount of pressure and like couldnt breathe feeling. So obviously i freaked out and over the last few months i have switched up anxiety medicines and have gotten my anxiety way better under control. But i still have this chest discomfort. it almost feels like a squeezing and tight pressure in the middle of my chest and it just doesnt make sense that this could still be from a pulled muscle. It doesnt hurt me like there is no pain when i breathe. it just feels like tight squeezing and very bad shortness of breath. I have had a stress echo test and regular echo test done of my heart and also i had a lung pulmonary function test done and both came back great. I also saw and allergist for allergies and asthma and was told i have neither. Also if i do any kind of physical activity it definitely aggravates it.This is a non stop discomfort that is always there!! At this point i am just lost and feel like there is something missing and this will never go away. Please help me!!!!!! Liked by Chris Trout, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

My story is very lengthy, but symptoms and tests finally gave a diagnosis to my SOB. I was recently diagnosed in November 2018 with pulmonary hypertension that hit me like a ton of bricks last summer following an exacerbation of COPD, only the second one I've had in 9 years! In July 2018, after the COPD exacerbation when SOB never went away and worsened by the week and I began having palpitations almost daily at rest, I called my pulmonary doctor who ordered PFTs (which I'd just had done 10 months prior, as I'm a regular patient seen for COPD and treated for sleep apnea since 2006), but the tests did not show any signs of worsening(?) I also saw my cardiovascular doctor who ordered a 48-hour Holter monitor, but don't you know during that time the palpitations did not occur, until the monitor was discontinued and they returned and continue date! My SOB continued and I was literally unable to go out at all in the summer heat or do anything, including walking in or out of my home without feeling completely breathless, it got worse by the day. Finally October came and time for my 3-month pulmonary visit. The usual walk down the short hall and back with a pulse oxemitry device on my finger began loudly buzzing every step of the way, bringing my doctor and the respiratory therapist out of from their patient visits to see who it was. My oxygen levels dropped to 81-82 each step. My pulmonologist wouldn't let me go home without him making arrangements for admission to the hospital to find out what was going on with me. He'd made a call to my cardio doctor as well, as I'm sure he must have had a suspicion of what it could be. My mistake was insisting on going to the sister hospital closer to my home that the pulmonologist did not physically work in. As a result, a 2-night stay and multiple tests (xrays, CT scans, tons of bloodwork) did not reveal ANY reason for SOB! Pulmonary doctor there said it was a cardio problem, the cardio said it was a pulmonary problem. I was not placed on oxygen there because at test I did not show signs of needing it. Respiratory performed only ONE monitored walk with me around the unit hours before discharge and my O2 levels hovered barely above 90 and so I did not require home oxygen. Three days later I went back to my pulmonologist office, where he gently voiced his anger with me not going to the ""home"" hospital so that he would have intervened in my care personally there and consulted with my cardiologist to have a catheterization done. With my permission, he called my cardio doctor and asked that I might be seen immediately for consult and consideration for a right-to-left catheterization be done. In addition, he ordered immediate home oxygen concentrator be delivered to me at home and I use it to date. I have a portable unit I must use whenever I go out. It's one of those nice concentrators carried in a shoulder bag (about 5#). I do not require oxygen while sitting, only walking or exerting myself, although I also use it always in eve watching TV and I connect the oxygen tubing to my CPAP machine while sleeping. I use 2 liters of oxygen. Long story shorter (a little bit) the right-to-left catheterization performed on me did in fact confirm pulmonary hypertension. I was devastated and I'm still loaded with both anger and sadness that my once very productive life had been completely altered, but at least I had a diagnosis. I am a former smoker, quitting only 5.5 years ago, but both my pulmonary and cardiac doctors have assured me my PH is NOT smoking or from COPD, but from a ""stiffening and narrowing"" of the pulmonary artery slowing blood/oxygen flow to the heart, as evidenced only by cardiac catheterization that I have twice had done since November. This long story about my SOB and it's diagnosis I shared because I had fooled the PFT tests and the hospital diagnostic tests that had been performed and they showed NO reason for my SOB. I'm only wondering if perhaps your physicians (pulmonary doctor) should consider catheterization to rule out possibility of pulmonary hypertension. It was a hidden diagnosis for me, but I can't walk down my hall at home or up my basement steps without total SOB. I've gone thru 18 visits with pulmonary rehab to learn about dealing with it and worked on equipment (with oxygen) and I'm going to begin going to the pulm/cardiac gym at the hospital to continue working on endurance. This is a really hard, new lifestyle for me. I am 63 and 100 pounds overweight and also insulin resistant/metabolic syndrome so weight loss is extremely difficult for me; however, I must try to improve my lifestyle somehow. I don't know options other than my current oxygen and Lasix treatment for now, unless (per my cardio doctor) I come to the Mayo or University of MI Pulmonary Hypertension specialty clinics (the later of which my pulm doctor has discussed my case with for treatment purposes and that treatment is pursued at this time) I have Factor V and history of DVT in 2011. I am a lifetime Coumadin user. Is be scared for surgery, a death outcome. I'm really scared of my future now. I am mom to 20-year old twins who are my heart and soul. I really don't know next steps.

My HVAC company recommended the Reme HALO whole-house in-duct air purifier by RGF, but I was concerned to learn its an ionized hydro-peroxide output that includes some level of ozone being emitted into the air from what I read in their literature/site and from talking to the manufacturer. They say its safe but Ive read people with lung problems shouldnt breathe in any ozone (I have Bronchiectasis). I also couldnt get a straight answer as to whether the UV light is part of the Reme HALO or a separate UV bulb that shines on the AC coil (called the BLU QR UV stick light) or whether both have a UV component. Ive read that UV in whole-house air purifiers (and whole-house water systems) is safe for humans  Im more concerned about whole-house air purifiers that emit ozone. Im also looking at whole-house UV purifiers without ozone (e.g., APCO-X, Purity, Field Controls Trio). All of these products are hard to decipher. I live in a townhouse with a small space for the HVAC system. I have 2 small Winex air purifier floor units (from Costco) that I use but Ive learned that isnt enough to remove harmful mycobacteria and mold spewing into the air from the HVAC air ducts and the AC coil where moisture builds up.

How do I get it?,"I know that I have been confused as to what palliative care means until my oncologist recently used it in reference to me me! I said, Whoa, hold your horses am I dying or near the end, I have plans? All of my life I have known it to be in reference to dying patients, keeping them comfortable and pain free. Boy was I wrong!The goal of palliative care is to help people with serious illnesses feel better. It prevents or treats symptoms and side effects of disease and treatment. Palliative care also treats emotional, social, practical, and spiritual problems that illnesses can bring up. When the person feels better in these areas, they have an improved quality of life.Palliative care can be given at the same time as treatments meant to cure or treat the disease. Palliative care may be given when the illness is diagnosed, throughout treatment, during follow-up, and at the end of life.https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000536.htmI am blessed to have such an excellent oncologist. Dr. Jennifer Temel is an expert in palliative care and uses it with her patients along with other doctors caring for that patient. Palliative care needs to begin at diagnosis and follow you through your illness- from hang nail to manicure. (http://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/jennifer-s-temel-md/) So with out further blathering please read what she has to say because she says it perfectly.https://www.ascopost.com/archive/meetings/2015-palliative-care-in-oncology-symposium/jennifer-s-temel-mds-expert-perspective-palliative-care-in-2015/(By the way, its true- the camera does add 10 lbs on!)My palliative care has been excellent since the very beginning. After surgery I have had every pain and discomfort tended to, medicines or suggestions given to me, explanations made as clear as they could on the day that I asked. I think of palliative care as having a new mommy. This is the video that Dr. Temel refers to at the end of her talk. https://www.ascopost.com/archive/meetings/2015-palliative-care-in-oncology-symposium/vicki-jackson-md-mph-on-effective-care-integration-and-the-comanagement-model/ What have your Palliative care experiences been like?

Or it had nothing to do with the flight and I shouldnt have been lifting heavy things during a coughing attack. Ugh I really want to get on a plane. Does anyone else fly with bad lungs??

The backflow of stomach acid and digestive enzymes (pepsin) canwreak havoc on your esophagus(the food passage that goes from your throat to your stomach), as well as your ears, nose, throat, vocal cords, sinuses, mouth, and lungs. Pepsin, in the presence of acid, digests protein and damages tissue. Outside the protected stomach, pepsin, bathed in acid, digests you! And when pepsin attacks your sensitive airway and esophageal tissues, you can suffer all kinds of problems. The most common silent reflux symptoms are hoarseness, chronic cough, throat-clearing, post-nasal drip, sinusitis, sore or burning throat, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, snoring, sleep apnea, bad breath, tooth decay, asthma, and COPD. Unfortunately, your doctor is probably unaware that these symptoms may be caused by silent reflux and that it could be controlled with the proper diagnosis and treatment. Did you know that asthma is one of the most common misdiagnoses, because silent reflux mimics asthma? Heres a big tipoff: When you have trouble breathing, do you have more difficulty getting air IN or OUT? People with reflux have trouble getting air IN during inspiration (not out during expiration). People with asthma have difficulty getting air OUT of the lungs. In truth, many people with asthma may not actually have it, and, consequently, asthma medication doesnt really help much if at all. The fact is that once the correct diagnosis is made, effective anti-reflux treatment can permanently cure this asthma-like breathing problem. How Do I Know If I Have Silent Reflux? One of the characteristics of silent reflux is that most people who have it have several different symptoms all at the same time, but often heartburn isnt one of them. To find out if you may have silent reflux, take this simple quiz. Just circle the number for each symptom and add up the numbers. The quiz is actually known as theReflux Symptom Index(RSI), and it is a great first test to see if you have reflux. If your RSI is 15 or more (and you have a zero or one for heartburn), you may have silent reflux; you should see a specialist trained in detecting reflux by examination of both the throat and esophagus. Doctors who only scope the esophagus are missing the boat.Get your printable version of the Reflux Symptom Index. Why Is Reflux Sometimes Silent? What makes silent reflux different than heartburn is that the silent reflux sufferer may be unaware of having it, and his or her doctor may not suspect the diagnosis. A lot of reflux is needed to damage the esophagus, but very little reflux can severely damage the more sensitive throat, sinuses and lungs. Many people with silent reflux have never even once experienced classic heartburn. How the term silent reflux came to be is instructive. In 1987, Walter Bo, a medical school colleague, was my patient. As a result of nighttime reflux, he had terrible morning hoarseness. This was because he had a habit of eating dinner very late and then falling asleep on the sofa. Hence, he would reflux into his throat all night. I tried explaining the problem, but Walter repeatedly denied having reflux. As it turned out, Walter affirmed that he thought that heartburn and reflux were the same. When I was able to explain that one could have reflux without heartburn  as in this example, when it occurred during sleep  Walter rolled his eyes and said, I see. I have the silent kind of reflux. I declared, Yes, Walter, thats it! You have silent reflux! Why Doesnt My Doctor Know About This? Unfortunately, people with silent reflux symptoms, even if they ask their doctor, are usually incorrectly told they do not have reflux. The medical specialties are broken down by parts of the body, and doctors are experts in, and only test for, those parts of the body in which they specialize. The problem is that reflux does not care where your doctor trained and how it might affect the different medical specialties  the esophagus treated by gastroenterologists, the throat and sinuses treated by ear, nose and throat specialists (otolaryngologists), and the trachea and lungs treated by lung specialists (pulmonologists). The Solution: Integrated Aerodigestive Medicine Only a trained reflux specialist who knows what to look for in all affected areas and who has the right diagnostic tests is equipped to make an accurate diagnosis. Otherwise, a doctor may guess wrong and treat you for an illness that you dont have. Some of the symptoms of silent reflux can sometimes be caused by other diseases, which doctors try to treat unsuccessfully, leaving you miserable, frustrated, and having wasted money on useless tests and drugs. Instead of focusing on the patients diet and lifestyle  the root cause of almost all reflux disease  doctors often employ pills, usually the wrong pills, that rarely correct the problem. In truth, reflux medications are grossly misused and over-used today. Liked by Merry, Volunteer Mentor, alamogal635 Follow Report"

A lot of reflux is needed to damage the esophagus, but very little reflux can severely damage the more sensitive throat, sinuses and lungs. Many people with silent reflux have never even once experienced classic heartburn. How the term silent reflux came to be is instructive. In 1987, Walter Bo, a medical school colleague, was my patient. As a result of nighttime reflux, he had terrible morning hoarseness. This was because he had a habit of eating dinner very late and then falling asleep on the sofa. Hence, he would reflux into his throat all night. I tried explaining the problem, but Walter repeatedly denied having reflux. As it turned out, Walter affirmed that he thought that heartburn and reflux were the same. When I was able to explain that one could have reflux without heartburn  as in this example, when it occurred during sleep  Walter rolled his eyes and said, I see. I have the silent kind of reflux. I declared, Yes, Walter, thats it! You have silent reflux! Why Doesnt My Doctor Know About This? Unfortunately, people with silent reflux symptoms, even if they ask their doctor, are usually incorrectly told they do not have reflux. The medical specialties are broken down by parts of the body, and doctors are experts in, and only test for, those parts of the body in which they specialize. The problem is that reflux does not care where your doctor trained and how it might affect the different medical specialties  the esophagus treated by gastroenterologists, the throat and sinuses treated by ear, nose and throat specialists (otolaryngologists), and the trachea and lungs treated by lung specialists (pulmonologists). The Solution: Integrated Aerodigestive Medicine Only a trained reflux specialist who knows what to look for in all affected areas and who has the right diagnostic tests is equipped to make an accurate diagnosis. Otherwise, a doctor may guess wrong and treat you for an illness that you dont have. Some of the symptoms of silent reflux can sometimes be caused by other diseases, which doctors try to treat unsuccessfully, leaving you miserable, frustrated, and having wasted money on useless tests and drugs. Instead of focusing on the patients diet and lifestyle  the root cause of almost all reflux disease  doctors often employ pills, usually the wrong pills, that rarely correct the problem. In truth, reflux medications are grossly misused and over-used today. Liked by Merry, Volunteer Mentor, alamogal635 Follow Report"

The backflow of stomach acid and digestive enzymes (pepsin) canwreak havoc on your esophagus(the food passage that goes from your throat to your stomach), as well as your ears, nose, throat, vocal cords, sinuses, mouth, and lungs. Pepsin, in the presence of acid, digests protein and damages tissue. Outside the protected stomach, pepsin, bathed in acid, digests you! And when pepsin attacks your sensitive airway and esophageal tissues, you can suffer all kinds of problems. The most common silent reflux symptoms are hoarseness, chronic cough, throat-clearing, post-nasal drip, sinusitis, sore or burning throat, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, snoring, sleep apnea, bad breath, tooth decay, asthma, and COPD. Unfortunately, your doctor is probably unaware that these symptoms may be caused by silent reflux and that it could be controlled with the proper diagnosis and treatment. Did you know that asthma is one of the most common misdiagnoses, because silent reflux mimics asthma? Heres a big tipoff: When you have trouble breathing, do you have more difficulty getting air IN or OUT? People with reflux have trouble getting air IN during inspiration (not out during expiration). People with asthma have difficulty getting air OUT of the lungs. In truth, many people with asthma may not actually have it, and, consequently, asthma medication doesnt really help much if at all. The fact is that once the correct diagnosis is made, effective anti-reflux treatment can permanently cure this asthma-like breathing problem. How Do I Know If I Have Silent Reflux? One of the characteristics of silent reflux is that most people who have it have several different symptoms all at the same time, but often heartburn isnt one of them. To find out if you may have silent reflux, take this simple quiz. Just circle the number for each symptom and add up the numbers. The quiz is actually known as theReflux Symptom Index(RSI), and it is a great first test to see if you have reflux. If your RSI is 15 or more (and you have a zero or one for heartburn), you may have silent reflux; you should see a specialist trained in detecting reflux by examination of both the throat and esophagus.

Coughing, which I do a lot and very deeply to clear mucus, feels like someone is stabbing me in the head with knives and makes the headache/migraine even worse. Is this or could this be too much CO2 in my blood and a lack of oxygen in my blood? if so, can this be helped. I am a 56 year smoker trying to quit.

About 10 years ago I started wheezing while playing tennis and having trouble breathing with extreme exertion and dr started me on bronchial dilator and steroid inhaler, which helped. . My chest X-rays have shown hyperinflation for about 20 years I am 62. Former smoker but stopped around age 27. Smoked about 10 years. Three years ago I saw my pulmonologist and my 02 was at 87 walking around his office. Went through pulmonary function tests, stress test with echocardiogram , overnight pulse oximentary test and all showed normal. So nothing new was added but still used inhalers daily. I continued playing tennis but with breathing difficulties. Last November I decided to stop tennis because breathing was getting too difficult. Rescue inhalers never seemed to help. Xrays have continued to show hyperinflation. Fast forward to January '19 and saw new pulmonologist due breathing problems with exercise. Again, in her office my 02 was at 87. After being put on 02, it came back up to 98. She prescribed home 02 and a number of tests, high resolution ct scan, overnight pulse ox, echocardiogram and pulmonary function tests. So far, all have come back normal including the ct scan which showed no air trapping or small airway disease, everything normal except coronary and aortic calcifications. Basically normal which surprised me since I've been told for years I have mild copd. Will wait to see what overnight pulse ox shows. My 02 is still dropping to the high 80s upon exertion but not always and it goes back up pretty fast when I sit down, within 5-10 minutes. Currently I'm not using the oxygen until I find out what's going on. So I am wondering why the xrays and ct scan show different info and now wondering if I gave copd at all. And clueless about why 02 is dropping and why I heave upon more than usual exertion. Maybe it's exercise induced asthma but again, the rescue inhalers don't help me when I can't breath well.

Please!,"My mom: healthiest woman in the world. She is TRULY the epitome of health and always has been my entire life. Walks 4 miles/day, 4 days/wk. Eats all natural, raw, organic foods, drinks her Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar every day, herbs, vitamins, supplements. She smoked very briefly 45 years ago. Bottom line: MY MOM has ALWAYS done EVERYTHING RIGHT. Ten weeks ago, she very suddenly got what appeared to be 'bronchitis'. With zero improvement with antibiotics, it escalated to 'pneumonia', bronchiectasis, 'Valley Fever', MAC, etc. Throughout, she visited her primary doctor but had to go to hospital multiple times after-hours with the inability to breathe. She was given antibiotics and anti-fungals, then finally steroids and oxygen, which she has been 100% reliant upon for 6 weeks. She has never had a fever. Oxygen 24/7 for a few weeks. She did get down to 14-16 hours a day. When attempted to taper off the prednisone a couple weeks ago, she quickly resorted back 100%. Four CT scans, a bronch scope biopsy, and multiple testing thus far show bronchiectasis, MAC (initial 'cousins' at this point), severely scarred lungs and infection throughout all 5 lobes with ZERO progress in 10 weeks. When 'diagnosed' with MAC by her Infectious Disease doctor and living in Dallas, TX, I found UT Health in Tyler, who specialize in bronchiectasis and MAC. They scheduled her for next week due to the severity. Unfortunately, because it is not more progressed, that has been put on hold until the 'Final Results' are received in 4 weeks. She saw her pulmonologist yesterday. Her lung capacity is 50%. She is able to walk for 1 minute before her SaO2 drops below 85. They do not know what this is, but they know they don't have time to wait for the final results. Therefore, they are finding a surgeon to perform the VATS procedure next week. I have been speaking with a wonderful woman on the MAC/Bronchiectasis forum the past couple of days.

This was consistent with my coworkers as well. I also took Flonase for a couple weeks. I then suspected some sort of mold exposure since we work in a fairly old office space. Blood tests for mold exposure came back at low levels, but nothing that should cause any symptoms. The office was tested for mold and those levels were again low, but not harmful. I then had blood samples taken to test for other allergies/red flags, chest x-ray, and EKG, all which came back normal. I was prescribed an inhaler to see if that would open my airways. The inhaler did not help. I tried changing my diet to see if it was my acid reflux acting up (which I've had most of my life and take Omeprazole to control).

Im 36yo Asian female diagnosed with NSIP 2 years ago related to my autoimmune disorder, which my doctors still unable to find out which type of disorder as they think it hasnt fully blown out yet. Its a condition under Interstitial Lung Disease / Pulmonary Fibrosis. I was on 40mg prednisone for about 10 months in 2016 and stopped for about 9 months in 2017 when my condition was stabilized. Then I had an episode of pneumonia during winter in Dec 2017 that got me hospitalized twice, and has made my condition worse with mild pulmonary hypertension. I became more breathless even short walks to the bathroom and during showers. Im now back in my own home country where the weather is warm but since the pneumonia, I have started back on 40mg prednisone in Feb and last month, I was also given 500mg Cellcept daily (2 tabs a day) as a steroid sparing agent so I could reduce my prednisone sooner. Ive been advised by my docs not to travel for work, so I can now only work from home. So Im now on these two main medication along with my other vitamins. And Im also on 24/7 oxygen now too. But it doesnt really help when Im moving because of my limited lung capacity that I cant inhale very deep. What makes me breathless is when I cough really hard from my itchiness of my throat and whenever I needed to expel my mucus. And when I get breathless, my nails turn purple. Both my lower limbs occasionally get numb too and turn pale, which my doc tells me that its because I dont have enough oxygen in my body that can cause that to happen. What scares me now are showers and toilet breaks. There are always risks of getting choked up and out of breaths if I couldnt hold my coughs. Ive been reading from researches and posts from others that mild exercise and breathing exercise helps. As much as I want to do so, I dont like the feeling of coughing and seeing my SpO gets to as low as 80% while doing just slow walks of treadmill and deep inhalation makes me cough. My question is  is there anyone out there with similar diagnosis (NSIP with autoimmune) and how do you guys cope with your daily activities? Especially in showers, exercises, any kind of life hacks of people like us? Im also trying to get onto the transplants waiting list and will be meeting my new lung team soon in a few weeks time to get the transplant conversation started.

In the grocery store and most places, my nose would run non-stop, just like out in the cold in the wintertime. That was in 04. An allergist told me I didnt have allergies, but I had VMR  vasomotor rhinitis  A.K.A. non-allergic rhinitis. Told me to take Flonase, and that was that. It didnt seem to help much, so I stopped taking it. It was only in 15, when I was really struggling with breathlessness that I dug out the old records to see in addition to VMR, theyd noted suspect asthma. Now its been three years and ten specialists later. Allergists say no allergies. Its asthma. Pulmonary says  after giving me Symbicort which was the first thing to help after Flovent and Singulair failed  it must be anxiety; or deconditioning or VCD (vocal cord dysfunction). Ive been the gammit: cardiologists, gastenterologists, speech pathologists, neurologists (for a stroke/PE from not moving), hematologist (mothers blood disorder with the same symptoms), ENTs, etc., etc.; you get the idea. Finally, while here at Mayo for a bone issue, I decided I had to get a pulmonary evaluation. I do have asthma. But chronic rhinitis/sinusitis has had uncontorlled sinus draining filling my lungs. Its no wonder my cardiologist had said, once, I had wet lungs. I might have picked that up, when I saw that the antihistamines that E/R gave me, once, helped those times I oculdnt even stand in place ironing, doing dishes or doing my hair, let alone try to move. Then, this past April, my local pulmonologist heard me (?), and gave me Spiriva, while a second opinion allergist gave me Atrovent. Both are the same drying agent, ipratroprium. One for my lungs, one for my head. I could, finally stay out of the chair, vs. siting in it all day, but still couldnt walk outdoors and/or live my life. The new concept of sinus rinses  NeilMed Nasal Wash Squeeze Bottle  became a new part of my daily life. But I needed Mayo to say it wasnt enough to only catch what was behind my eyes or out my nose. I had to pay attention, too, to what was going down my throat  post nasal drip Now, Im encouraged. Itll mean twice daily saline washes  vs. only sprays  morning and night, whether I think I need them or not, followed by Flonase which, previously, did reduce very, very swollen turbinates which threatened surgery. Turbinates are the three sets of filters in your nose and sinuses that warm, cleanse and moisten the air you breath before it goes into your lungs. After the Flonase, twice daily, too, itll be sprays of Atrovent for drying, too, twice daily, hoping to stop the post nasal drip down the back of my throat. Im hopeful  finally. Has anyone else had problems, such as this?

We went to the ENT several weeks ago. He said that the oxygen dries out the nasal septum which is the center part of the skin separating the nostrils. He also said that the plastic prongs were rubbing against the septum irritating it and making it raw. Since he knows I really get involved in researching medical issues, he called me over to look up her nose to see the actual raw spots. They looked much like a skinned knee from falling onto concrete. It was very raw. Remedy was to snip about half the length of the prongs off the oxygen cannula, which the ENT did to show me how much in case I had to do the same to new cannulas. For the nose bleeds, he said to purchase a bottle of Afrin nasal spray. DO NOT SPRAY in nose but to place some Afrin onto a cotton ball then place in nostril for 10 to 15 mins. He said, the medication in Afrin causes the tiny blood vessels to constrict thus stopping the bleeding. He also said, that if the blood pressure is 160 or the bottom number was 90 then the blood pressure would cause the blood to be pushed around the cotton ball. If that happens and the bleeding continues, then go to the ER. How many others have heard of doing these things? Has anyone tried or had success at stopping nose bleeds? So far, the Afrin placed on a cotton ball and placed in her nostril for 10 ton 15 mins has worked. Sometimes we have done it twice but had success. Follow Report"

She still needs some surgeries for fractures in her ears and she lost all her top front teeth. All other broken femur and arm and skull fracture and facial fractures have healed. She is a miracle. However her lung recovery is something we cant quit figure out. Pulmonologist says her last X-ray looks 100% normal. A pulmonary stress test does show pulmonary issues. She was in great physical shape and trained 6 days a week for her sport which was basketball year round since 5th grade. Her physical condition is one of the reason she survived. Its is now six months after the accIdent and she can lift weights and train but nothing with conditioning or she has no oxygen reserves. Finding research on teenagers recovery with ARDS is almost non existent. She was improving at a steady rate and was able to do more and more. Started to basketball train again but has hit a wall and plateau for abt 2 months with no visible gains. Still can easily get out of breath. Though to someone who wouldnt know her you couldnt tell. Is leveling off normal? And should we see improvement again? Since she is young will she heal over time? No significant cough, no bringing up phlegm, just shortness of breath when she tries to do too much. She weight trains for an hour 2x per week. Her oxygen level always stays in 90s. When we push to hard and try some conditioning it sometimes will drop high 80s but recoveries within seconds after she stops. Within seconds (like 15) she is fully recovered w heart rate and oxygen back in mid to high 90s. Is that a positive sign? Or could she have long term irreversible damage. Accident was 6 months ago. In rehab she would get out off breath sitting up in bed and trying to stand to go to bathroom. She wasnt able to walk down hallway very far without wheelchair behind her. Now she can hit layups and shot 3s and take stairs easily. So we have seen great improvements should we expect more. Pulmonologist didnt want to do scan yet because she has been exposed to so much radiation as long as she was improving he felt we were heading in right direction. Sending us to Childrens Hospital in Rochester Ny (Strong) for help. Since it is a miracle she survived such injuries (car was going 40mph) she was walking our dog and she recovered at a rate that astonished the medical community it is hard to find research or baseline information on recovery.

My oxygen levels went from the 86-88 range to 89-91. My doctor supported the course of action I implemented and suggested taking 20 mg/day which may have helped a bit more. I have moved to another city and have yet to find a new doctor. Even when I do, I am leery about finding one who was as willing as the fifth doctor was to pay attention to my request. Does anyone have any ideas, theories, or experiences that can help me? I want my energetic, wonderful life back! Follow Report"

I am so glad to have found this group with so many knowledgable and caring members who know about bronchiectasis. My name is John and I am Ts hubby (hence the username). T was diagnosed in 2014 with bronchiectasis. A bit more about T, she is a 51 year old never smoker. She also has a DX of long qt syndrome which is a heart rhythm condition that can cause chaotic and rapid heartbeat and other serious complications. Otherwise she is healthy. She exercises (walks 3+ mile regularly, is not overweight, does not drink, eats well, etc.). She is a elementary school teacher and is in contact with lots of sick kids. She does have significant allergies and she tends to have extra sensitivity to extreme temperature changes. The first blasts of winter tend to knock her out for a couple days annually. When T was first diagnosed with bronchiectasis we actually breathed a sigh of relief thinking that she actually had lung cancer. Our local hospital did a CT scan that showed nodules and then a PET scan lit up in a way that can be consistent with cancer. After switching to more knowledgable medical team at a leading university hospital with a top lung center, we found out that it was actually bronchiectasis. Have others here had similar false positive experiences? Anyway, fast forward to today and she is having more trouble. She was diagnosed w/ pneumonia around Thanksgiving, was put on a 10 day course of antibiotics. During this time she was also having pain in her back on one side and she has been losing weight (~30 pounds over ~3 months). She has had two incidents (about 3 weeks apart) of coughing up blood. The 10 day antibiotic course seemed to work even though she was miserable while on it due to stomach side affects. Nevertheless, she seemed back to normal. Then she went on a day long field trip with our daughter that required walking outdoors in very cold temps (December in the north east) for between 5-10 miles. It was after this that she began to feel bad again. All the same symptoms came back. She has had a another chest X-ray that looked like the one leading to the pneumonia DX as well as a CT scan that showed masses consistent with differential diagnoses of pnuemonitus and lung cancer. The doctor who ordered the CT is not her specialist (pulmonologist) and the radiologist who wrote the CT report does not know of her bronchiectasis diagnoses. We have an appt this week with her pulmonologist (we have to drive couple hours to a different city to see him which is why the distinction between local doctors and her specialist who knows her full history). Despite the previous false positive and the similarities seen in CT scans, we are still nervous that well hear that this is not just bronchiectasis (not to discount the seriousness of bronchiectasis one bit). The thought of lung cancer is never far from our minds. My question has to do with a couple other troubling things that have happened recently. She had a mental lapse recently in calculating a tip at a restaurant that resulted in a very nice Christmas present to the server. Such a nice gift that this was definitely NOT intentional so she is worried about cognitive function. Did I mention that were both VERY stressed? Maybe that is a factor. The other incident had to do with urinary incontinence. This only happened once but it was very troubling to her, needless to say. It was as if her brain was unable to communicate to her body in a way that normally allows one to hold it. Even though we know she has bronchiectasis, we are quite worried about: the blood coughing incidents, the weight loss, the back pain, the masses in the CT scan, something called cavitation also noted in the CT, the mental lapse and the incontinence. We see the specialist this week and will share all these concerns but I was hopeful that by sharing our story here that someone may have had similar experiences / insights into what we are seeing.

Fast-forward to December, culture still positive, but cough gone, sputum clear, CT scan clear, and experiencing side effects from daily meds My infectious disease doc, in consultation with NJH, decided to STOP the antibiotics, a conclusion supported by my new pulmonologist. So now, we ""wait and see"" if any symptoms come back. I will continue ti use my inhaler & asthma meds, neb with saline & use the Aerobika. And reevaluate in the Spring.

I have been lurking here for a while and have learned a lot. I was diagnosed with slow growing MAC several months ago.. I am being treated by a University of Chicago pulmologist who specializes in bronchiectasis and ntm . She's terrific and if anyone is looking for a specialist in the Chicago area, I would gladly recommend her. She started me on the 3 antibiotics and told me to bring in a sputum sample every month. I had to stop Rifampin due to severe abdominal pain. Apparently, patients have been doing just as well on Azithromycin and Ethambutol and trials are underway to determine whether Rifampin is needed. While it is too late to enroll me in the trial, my doctor is confident that I will do just as well without the Rifampin as with it. (She is currently running 4 different studies, has a resident and a Fellow assigned to her and, most important, I trust her.) My 2x a day airway clearance consists of a percussion vest, an aerobika and 3% saline (I can't tolerate 7%). MAC has shown up in all 5 of the samples I have brought in so far. Sadly, the June sample also showed moderate pseudomonas along with at least two other bacteria. In the last two weeks, I had a pft (pulmonary function test) with 6 minute walk, a ct scan and a bronchoscopy with biopsies of a suspicious area in my right upper lobe. I am in the start up phase of Arikayce which hopefully will take care of the MAC, the pseudomonas and all the other nasty stuff (fingers crossed). I have spoken to a rep of the specialty pharmacy and verified insurance. My assigned coordinator sent me a welcome package and called yesterday. Once the medication has arrived (which should be soon), a nurse will come out to set me up and I will do the first dose in her presence. I am very nervous with respect to the possible side effects. I remember reading in a discussion or two here a mention of Arikayce but I can't find it. I would love to hear from anyone who is taking this drug. Did you suffer any of the side effects?

Luterman, M.D. Suite 806 Barnett Tower 3600 Gaston Ave. Dallas, TX 75246 Re: Saline Inhalation Nebulizer Dear Dr. Luterman: Since beginning to use the Percussion Vest Airway Clearance device a little over two years ago Ive been using 3 mL vials of .09% saline solution. Ive never had reason to question the routine; indeed didnt even know there were other concentration and quantity options. More recently, Ive learned that other bronchiecstasis/MAC patients variously use concentrations of 3% and 7% and 5 mL volumes. Those patients seem to do so predicated on the notion that since 0.9% is the salinity of the human body that an inhalation concentration greater than 0.9% is necessary to clear mucous. I also know that many, perhaps all, of these persons suffer more severe pathology than I do. However knowing that hasnt dampened my curiosity about the more aggressive regimen(s). So Id like to impose on you to consider for a moment if there is any merit in increased saline concentration and/or volume in my clinical situation. Ill try to make it as easy as possible; if your advice to stay-the-course as it stands now dont bother to call. If the phone doesnt ring Ill take that as stay put.

And I still FELT lousy  no energy, still losing weight, intermittent cough and chest tightness. My pulmonologist wanted to ""stay the course"" and ""be patient""  easy for him to say  he wasn't living life on the sidelines. So he reluctantly offered to refer me to the infectious disease doc in our large clinical system. That guy changed one med, upped everything to daily, and was monitoring my bloodwork, eyes and hearing closely. But, when it came to questions about bronchiestasis and asthma, he said ""I'm not the guy  you need to see your pulmonologist."" Back to Dr A, who seemed impatient with my questions that day. At the end of the appointment he said, ""Well now that you have Dr B, I don't need to see you any more."" Wow! Ow! For the next several months, I asked my questions here, or of my primary practitioner. I got good answers, but felt like I was adrift. Last week I saw my primary in the same practice, who has been with me for over 20 years, she asked what was going on and I explained. She wasastonished? And adamant that living with asthma, bronch & mac required oversight by a pulmonologist, so she and the ID doc found me a new one. Like many things in life, this little adventure may turn out to be a blessing in disguise. I saw Dr C yesterday. She was much easier to talk to, listened, explained and was very accepting of my saline nebs as the ongoing treatment, with my Xopenex as backup for flares. Dr A had dismissed the saline as both unnecessary and probably ineffective, didn't want to hear or read about it. She also listened to my concerns about Breo (robs me of my voice!) and willing to step down to a milder med and ""see how it goes."" Have you ever been ""fired"" by your doctor? What did you do?

My HVAC company recommended the Reme HALO whole-house in-duct air purifier by RGF, but I was concerned to learn its an ionized hydro-peroxide output that includes some level of ozone being emitted into the air from what I read in their literature/site and from talking to the manufacturer. They say its safe but Ive read people with lung problems shouldnt breathe in any ozone (I have Bronchiectasis). I also couldnt get a straight answer as to whether the UV light is part of the Reme HALO or a separate UV bulb that shines on the AC coil (called the BLU QR UV stick light) or whether both have a UV component. Ive read that UV in whole-house air purifiers (and whole-house water systems) is safe for humans  Im more concerned about whole-house air purifiers that emit ozone. Im also looking at whole-house UV purifiers without ozone (e.g., APCO-X, Purity, Field Controls Trio). All of these products are hard to decipher. I live in a townhouse with a small space for the HVAC system. I have 2 small Winex air purifier floor units (from Costco) that I use but Ive learned that isnt enough to remove harmful mycobacteria and mold spewing into the air from the HVAC air ducts and the AC coil where moisture builds up.

Had been doing great. Minimal coughing, getting energy back, eating better etc. Got portal message from doctor today. Pseudomonas found with 3 colonies and 2 are resistant to Levaquin. Doc posed two options. 1) Place PICC line and start IV antibiotics for 14 days as well as 28 days of nebulized antibiotic. or 2) do only nebulized antibiotic if want to suppress rather than eradicate.

I have been taking the Apo-Lactoferrin bought through Life Extension once a day and the N-A-C 600mg Sustain by Jarrow for about 7 months now. I keep getting better and better. My lungs seem stronger though I haven't had them tested and my heavy almost constant chronic cough that I had for a couple of years is pretty much gone. I have a brief few coughs right after extensive exercise that brings up and clears a bit of thick mucus most days that I exercise but it's only for a moment about 10 minutes after an hours worth of exercise. My pulmonary doc appt isn't till October, so I don't have any diagnostic proof without tests to see if I'm rid of the heavy concentration of MAC and Aspergillus that I was diagnosed with after a Bronchcospy in January. I have not yet taken any antibiotics or medicine for treating the MAC as I wanted to see what I could do on my own. I also use some light saline nasal spray in the mornings. I could be just lucky, but it seems those supplements are doing what some research said they might do and are helping break up the biofilms of the mycobacteria and helping my immune system keep them at bay (or maybe even rid me of them!). I also take Jarrow Curcumin once a day for good measure to help prevent any possible inflammation for the last 4 months and have been taking 500mg of D3 sublingually but I've taken the D3 for a couple of years, so I think it's been the N-A-C and the app-lactoferrin that's working for me! Anyone else tried N-A-C in a consistent dosing over a number of months? I think the long-term consistent dosing with the N-A-C supplement is important not just to get at and break up the hard to reach MAC that hides in its biofilms, but to prevent any new NTM from getting a deep hold in the lungs. Again, I don't know whether it's the N-A-C alone or with apo-lactoferrin, there's just much more research on N-A-C since it's been used for other useful things in medicine, like preventing liver toxicity.

Like many of you, after a multiple years long process of chasing symptoms, which included heart caths, many different kinds of scans, and many different kinds of doctors, I was finally diagnosed by a pulmonologist with Bronchiectasis, Multiple Lung Nodules, and MAC/MAI in April 2019. After reading through most of the posts here, I can see that I was following the same sort of trajectory that many of you did. For a long while, my pulmonologist insisted that the symptoms I was experiencing were out of proportion to my ""mild"" bronchiectasis and nodules. After a year or so, she finally did cultures, and my cultures grew within 18 days (rather than the 6-8weeks she warned me it might take). Part of her delay in doing the cultures was my age (53), which she originally thought on the young side for something like a MAC/MAI diagnosis. Anyway, here we are. I started the Big 3 (azithromycin, ethambutol, rifampin) May 1st, 2019. Prior to starting, I had my eyes and skin checked no other checks. I was nervous about it because I had already been through many rounds of various antibiotics due to the ongoing cough, ""bronchitis"", ""possible pneumonia"", ""respiratory infection"" and other illnesses I'd been having, and without fail, my stomach rebelled. I was pretty pleased that the first month was uneventful. Midway through June, I have started having some ongoing stomach issues, and my pulmonologist has requested that I visit my GI doc to make sure things are ok in that area before we make any changes. In the meantime, tinnitus I was already experiencing seems to have doubled (if that's possible), so she has also requested that I see an ENT. I've seen an ENT before about the tinnitus which began years ago, and was told there's nothing that can be done about it. So am I now stuck with even LOUDER and more persistent tinnitus?! Yikes. The pulmonologist also told me that the main vision concern was color vision changes. But I'm pretty sure I am having acuity changes. I mentioned this to the pulmonologist at my check up, and she suggested that I get my vision Rx re-checked in case something is out of whack there (I did have a Rx change at the vision check prior to starting meds). I'm going to get my vision rechecked in case it IS the RX, but the vision question is, have any of you also had acuity issues on these meds? Or is it really just a color change if there is a change? I haven't had any problem with color. so far. Naturally, I am also experiencing some psychological challenges since diagnosis. The thought of dealing with multiple parts of cruddy health for the next 30-40 years is overwhelming. I try to take it a day at a time, but when you just don't have the energy to do anything at all, it hardly seems worth it. My situation is a little complicated by the fact that I am a kidney donor (2008), and with only one kidney, there are additional hoops to jump through pharmaceutically (things I can't take. most notably NSAIDS. I'd give my remaining kidney for an NSAID some days!) I have missed a ridiculous amount of time with my grandchildren because I'm just too tired, or sick some days, to keep up with them. I always imagined myself as the Active Grandmother when that time came since I was a super active mom (it's frustrating that it's not working out that way). AND all of this treatment, and doctor visiting is very expensive. I'm still trying to go to work every day; some days it's very difficult. but I definitely NEED to keep working. My question for those of you who have been on the Big 3 for multiple years is, does it ever get easier? Do the drugs finally just seem like no big deal? I am noticing that I THINK my cough is a little better for the first time in years (there seems to be less coughing), but when it hits, it hits just as hard. I'm certainly not giving up after only a couple of months, but I guess I need a little more ""hand holding"" than I thought I did.

Following guidance from the group I looked closely at my last cultures and they show MAC:presumptive M chelonae. Is anyone familiar w/ their organism labeled presumptive? Its close to the M fortuitum ive been seeing a respected pulmonologist but have a second opinion w infectious disease tomorrow. Looking forward to the info but Leary  hes supposed to be the state expert & poo pood my initial Diagnosis. It doesnt affect everyone but i was so tired I had trouble gettting up in the am, needed naps all the time. Ive improved on big 3 but feel Ive plateaued and am worried the abtibx combo is a little off re: getting the umbrella tx instead of for specific MAC organism. Am I making sense?

I just got an e-mail back from Dr. Falkinham concerning our questions about serratia marcescens, which is one of the bacterias that Katherine was battling at the end. This specie is pink in color and is not to be confused with the methylobacterium that we sometimes see in our shower stalls and rings in the toilet. The serratia marcsecens comes from fecal matter and water contaminated with fecal waste. This particular bacteria is often caught in hospitals (ICU mostly) and nursing homes  for obvious reasons. Or could be picked up caring for someone who is incontinant or bed-ridden. So, that really nasty bug is most likely NOT in our homes. The pink slime in your bathrooms is likely methylobacterium which could technically cause you harm, but not likely. Just squirt it with clorox water in a spray bottle if you have it. I hope this allays some of the fears. Liked by Colleen Young, Connect Director, heathert, Jennifer Follow Report"

He did not feel he had to check as I am not coughing much and not getting anything up.

She was released from hospital the next day but came down with pneumonia on January 8. Two days later, her chest, abdomen, neck and face swelled up. She had developed pneumothorax. Basically a collapsed lung/leak and her body was filling with air. A very rare complication. Pushing on her body, it sounded and felt like rice krispies. The weirdest thing! She was kept in the hospital until the 'leak' had repaired itself. Immediately upon being released, she began nebulizing colloidal silver. Fast forward 2 weeks later, she was completely off oxygen and prednisone. 1 week later, she was out walking a mile daily.

Mom attributes her healing to these three things: colloidal silver, Bragg's apple cider vinegar, and prayer. Dr. Philley agreed with the prayer and told her whatever she was doing was working and to keep doing it.

I just got the results of my broncoscopy a week ago. First I was told I had Staph Aureus in my lungs & was put on Levaquin X 10 days. OK, Now she tells me I had MAI & I think the other one is MAC. Anyway, My pulmonologist said we are waiting for the sensitivity test to see if the bacteria in my sputum are sensitive to the antibiotics.or not.since now some strains are resistant. My name is Sue from Oregon and I am 61 years old with Sjogren's Syndrome, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Bronchiectasis, and now THIS. My RA & bronchiectasis are extensive with a lot of coughing and I am on a biologic immunosuppressive drug, infusion, for the RA. I read several posts at this site, looked up the side effects of the 3 meds my pulmonologist said she will put me on, scheduled an eye and hearing exam. This is scarey!!!!

ONE EXPLANATION I FOUND ON MAC/MAI TO HELP YOU,"MAC/MAI .. just ONE article I have come across that I felt might help Newcomers in understanding their diagnosis of MAC/MAI .. a LOT of information to digest but I hope you find it helpful! Hugs! Katherine (I have left out information on Aids .. for most of our arriving Newcomers that has not been an issue.) https://patient.info/doctor/mycobacterium-avium-complex Synonyms: Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, MAI There are two discrete species in the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC): Mycobacterium avium (M. avium). Mycobacterium intracellulare (M. intracellulare). They are both opportunistic pathogens that affect the immunocompromised. They can affect immunocompetent people, especially those with pre-existing lung disease. MAC is ubiquitous. However, only a minority of people exposed to MAC will acquire infection. It usually only affects the lungs in the immunocompetent. Pathophysiology M. intracellulare causes 40% of MAC infections in the immunocompetent. Transmission is via the respiratory (inhalation) and the gastrointestinal (ingestion) routes. There are many environmental sources of MAC including:[5] Piped hot water systems (household and hospital). Aerosolised water (eg, hot tubs). House dust. Soil. Birds and farm animals. Tobacco, cigarette filters and paper. In those with pre-existing lung disease, MAC usually just leads to pulmonary infection. The infection may (rarely) appear in elderly ladies with no pre-existing lung disease who chronically suppress the cough reflex and therefore allow respiratory secretions to stagnate. This is known as Lady Windermere syndrome.[6] MAC can also present as a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. This can occur in those exposed to water vapour containing MAC (commonly in poorly maintained indoor hot tubs or swimming pools).[7] Risk factors immunosuppression. Bronchiectasis. Cystic fibrosis. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Pulmonary malignancy. Presentation Pulmonary MAC infection Insidious onset. Features include: Cough. Excessive sputum production. Dyspnoea (difficult or labored breathing). Haemoptysis (coughing of blood). Fever and night sweats. Fatigue. Weight loss. Nonspecific focal chest signs: crackles, wheeze, bronchial breathing, dullness to percussion. Clubbing (in cases with underlying bronchiectasis). Disseminated MAC infection ..] Features include: Fever (may present as pyrexia of unknown origin). Sweating. Malaise. Dyspnoea (difficult or labored breathing). Diarrhoea. Significant weight loss with marked wasting. Generalised lymphadenopathy (disease of the lymph nodes) Pallor. Tender hepatosplenomegaly (disorder where both the liver and spleen swell beyond their normal size) Cutaneous involvement. Pulmonary disease 	Sputum AFB staining: this is positive in most with MAC. 	Sputum culture: takes 1-2 weeks to detect the organism but doesnt differentiate between infection or just colonisation. A number of positive cultures are usually required for diagnosis and there are set criteria.

When we get run down or sick, that gives it the opportunity to rear its ugly head again and grow colonies that make us very sick. The second known cause is that we most likely caught this somewhere in our daily routine, whether it be in the home, job, outdoors, or at the gym. Most likely, we caught this in our own homes. Most of the mycobacteriums that typically infect those with bronchiecstasis and cystic fibrosis form a bio-film. Bio-film is the sticky stuff the bacteria surrounds itself with to shield it from our immune system, antibiotics, and other mycobacteriums. It also uses it to attach itself to plumbing pipes and tubes, sides of swimming pools and hot tubs, inside of water filters, inside of water tanks of your refrigerator (ice-maker & water in the door), tanks inside medical equipment for surgeries, and dental rinsing tools. Some people get re-infected by environmental means as well. For example a person who works in a nursery/garden center may catch it from the potting soils and misting water. Because they work around that day after day; they build up a bacterial load where the body can no longer defend against it. This is only one example of many on how it can be contracted again from outside sources. Liked by Jennifer, pfists, Carolyn Follow Report"

I know this group is wise enough to know not to give your whole life over to MAC. So, what is everybody doing that does NOT include illness? (if you are having illness, that is ok to talk about also.) As for me, I went to happy hour on Hilton Head Island with my hubby and our teacup poodle named Scarlett. We enjoyed a mini pizza and colossol shrimp and an adult beverage. Afterwards, we ran our little pupster across a big lawn on the Broad Bay River. There was a cooling breeze blowing and it was quite nice. The humidity finally broke and the air was breathable. Tomorrow, we will attend a birthday party for a new friend. Whats up gang?

I had a CT scan in May (annual lung cancer screening because I was a 50+ year smoker) which showed a suspicious nodule in the upper right lobe. A PET scan was done in June and it indicated cancer, however, apparently MAC and MAI can mimic cancer in a PET scan. I was supposed to have a lobectomy in July, but the surgeon decided that he could get the spot out with just a wedge resection. I have a nice 9 scar across my back and right side now. The pathology report reached us in early September, indicating mycobacterium avium intracellulare complex, or MAI. A followup CT scan in October showed what my doctor called a tiny spot that was in the same lobe, only lower. If I would have gotten the lobectomy that was planned, I may not be here now. Swell, huh? Anyway, I just had another followup CT scan yesterday because the doctor wanted to see if that tiny spot changed at all, or if more spots developed. I was disappointed to not start an antibiotic regimen immediately, but I went along with the doctors plan. So. Awaiting results of the last CT to see where to go from here. I have read some of the information on side effects of antibiotics here on these forums, and I am a bit concerned, but I believe that attitude is everything and Ill be just fine in the end. Besides, I am taking 85 billion live cultures of 32 probiotic strains every day. I think that will help. Follow Report"

This all started in May 2017 when I was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia. They found a spot on my lung, and I had to have a lung biopsy done on first of July. My pulmonologist put me on the Big 3(Clarithromycin, Ethambutol, Rifampin). I could not tolerate any of those medications so they had me stop all medications and referred me to an Infectious Disease doctor. I was also put on Zithromax 500mg daily but could not tolerate that either. I have not noticed a change in my symptoms, and I am having more severe pains. I am 27 years old, and every doctor that I see says that I am to young to have MAC, but then they all review my records. For the last year I have tried multiple medications for treatment, and at this time, my providers have told me to stop taking the medications due to severe side effects landing me back into the hospital. I see my primary, pulmonary, infectious disease, as well as an allergist. My allergist ordered a repeat CT, which marks 1 year from this all really starting. At the time they told me that it was dormant and I didn't have to worry about it growing, but I would continue with fatigue, cough, etc.. I had the CT done 2 wks ago and now they are telling me that it has grown and I need to seek a treatment right away. So now they are referring me to Tyler, Texas.. They have an 8 wk wait time, and I am considering moving to Montana so I can have support. This has been a struggle to handle on my own, and has caught me off guard. Does anyone know of a hospital in Montana, or surrounding state that would be a good place to establish?

It caused a large cavity in my middle lobe. In 2015, I was back in the hospital three times with pneumonia and a fourth time due to a rib that fractured and displaced while coughing.

I am new in the group. Unfortunately, I am not new in these conditions which most, if not all of us here are dealing with. I was diagnosed in 2012 with M. Avium and Bronchiectasis. I wast treated for 18 months with success. I continue to see my doctor for monitoring until the infection came back in late 2016, this time the culture showed Intracellulare. Since the growth was minimal, my doctor decided to put me in watchful monitoring. Please take note all this time, my symptom is shortness of breath. In early 2017, we moved to another city which was closer to UF Health Gainesville. So, I transferred to another doctors. My new pulmo had me go through all the tests. The ct scan and PFT of 2017 compared to 2016 were not so bad, BUT if its compared to the 2015, there was relatively noticeable change. My doctor now opens the idea of going back to treatment. This is where I am now: struggling whether to go back or not. I want to be treated because my breathing is really getting harderto put it in perspective, tasks that i can complete 6 months ago with relative ease, I am having difficulty completing them now. Yes, I can still exercise, but it has become really so hard. On the other hand, I am hesitant to be on treatment again because i already have side effects from the previous treatment: reduced hearing, eye problems and my stomach is messed up that I do not think it can tolerate the antibiotics. I have done quite a number of remedies to fix my stomach but its always distressed. I am hoping there might be someone in the group who is/are in similar situations, i want to know some insights.

The infection went from one considered as opportunistic (effects mostly those who are very compromised, like the HIV infected) to one that has now invaded the general population. Yet, by all research and medical standards, treatment with first 2, and now 3 (and in some cases 4) extremely powerful antibiotics is grueling (side-effects similar to those experienced with chemotherapy) thus difficult (for some impossible) to sustain as it must be taken 3X/day for at least 1 year, thus its effectiveness as a cure in many patients is spotty; for an increasing number it can only manage the infection, causing them to be on strong antibiotics for the rest of their lives.

I had a vist to the Mayo this past Tues. I was first diagnosed with MAC in 2005. I refused the three drug standard treatment. Several weeks on antibiotics knocked it out. It came back in 2013, was treated with one antibiotic for 10 days a month on a monthly basis. It cleared up. Then in 2016, had pseudomonas infection. It was treated with bi-monthly tobramysin & cipro. It too cleared up.I asked my Dr why in the four yrs I have been going to the Mayo; that he never put me on the BIG THREE antibiotics. His reply, and I quote with his permission: The BIG THREE treatment is old school and it is OVER-TREATING most patients. He said he gets new patients in seeking second opinions and that he takes no less than three people a week OFF of the BIG THREE. I asked what he prescribes instead. He said it varies depending on colony size, specie, patient history, etc. He stated that most drs prescribe the BIG THREE because it was the norm years ago, and they honestly do not know much about the disease. He only uses the BIG THREE when a patient does not respond to single antibiotic treatments, or is SEVERE and CHRONIC. I would guess Katherine may fall into that catagory. He also said that he sometimes doesnt recommend treatment at all because 90% of the time, the MAC clears up on its own. That may be why someone recently posted she was confused as to why her dr did not want to treat it yet and wait and see. I found this info VERY interesting.

Aerobika. I highly recommend it. I love mine. I have two. They vibrate well to loosen the stuff and they are so much easier than an Acapella to clean. (I use a bit of dish soap. Suds it up .. agitate .. hold the parts and shake them very thoroughly through the sudsy water. 2. Let the parts soak for 10 to 15 minutes. Then several times fill the measuring cup with very warm rinse water .. again agitate the parts thoroughly to make sure they are thoroughly clean of the antibacterial dish soap. ) I have had mine for at least 2 years. Aerobika-Medical Supply ordered 2/25/17 $90.00 *Acapella device did not help me. . SEVERAL MEMBERS stated this AEROBIKA-MY PERSONAL ROUTINE-INHALERS/LUNG CLEARANCE HYGIENE/AEROBIKA Below is my particular routine in using my Aerobika Use my 2 inhalers PRIOR to brushing my teeth Use a huff cough at least 3 times .. like you were cleaning your glasses and fog them with your breath .. only MORE forcefully. Then use the Aerobika device per the instructions. Do the huff cough along with the Aerobika until you feel you have gotten up as much sputum as you possibly can. Personally I judge when to quit by the quantity and color of the sputum. I have found using the Aerobika you are able to  pull mucous out of those lower lung airways in a way you cannot without the device. Personally I do this twice a day. Inhale 7% Sodium Solution using my Pari Compressor and nebulizer After my Saline Inhalation I again use my Aerobika. Then use the Aerobika device per the instructions. A huff cough at least 3 times .. like you were cleaning your glasses and fog them with your breath .. only MORE forcefully. Do the huff cough along with the Aerobika until you feel you have gotten up as much sputum as you possibly can. Using peroxide to dampen my toothbrush and toothpaste to brush (purchased a squirt dispenser for the peroxide) Rinse my toothbrush .. then using peroxide for toothbrush storage for sterilizing I think this routine will help oral thrush by keeping my Sonicare toothbrush sanitized daily. http://www.good-gums.com/sanitizing-your-toothbrush.cfm AEROBIKA AND NEBULIZER -CLEANING *6/17 From Member @lindam272, Linda, Aerobika sites the Electronic Steam Sterilizer (baby bottle sterilizer) as the recommended method. It says, The four disassembled parts may be disinfected using an electronic steam sterilizer for baby bottles, following the manufacturers instructions for use (e.g. AVENT Electronic Sterilizer). The disinfection cycle should last approximately 15 minutes. Allow the parts to cool and air dry thoroughly before reassembly. Im only microwaving for 6 mins but maybe need to up that. It seems like the other components for the nebulizer should be okay. They are all plastic. One of the alternative methods described is the microwave steam bags but says to use distilled water. For HIGH LEVEL DISINFECTION: If clinically necessary for the patients disease state, the device may be cleaned after each use and disinfected once each treatment day. STERILE distilled water must be used for rinsing. To sterilize distilled water, boil it for 5 minutes. @katemn NOTE: because I purchased a large supply of nebs I use the same cleaning method as below for the Aerobika and nebulizers per my File Cabinet. I can ONLY speak for myself .. I follow the cleaning method on the Aerobika website: https://www.monaghanmed.com/patients-education .. the same one that came with the Aerobika. I use very warm water .. I use a 4 cup plastic measuring cup to wash the various parts .. I like the cup handle as I agitate the parts I am cleaning! Norpro 4-Cup Plastic Measuring Cup I USE THE: The First Years Power of Steam Electric Steam Sterilizer (I remove ONE shelf & make the bottom shelf TALLER to accommodate the tall nebulizer with two other more narrow shelves) I use a bit of antibacterial dish soap. Suds it up .. agitate .. hold the parts and shake them very thoroughly through the sudsy water. Let the parts soak for 10 to 15 minutes. Then several times fill the measuring cup with very warm rinse water .. again agitate the parts thoroughly to make sure they are thoroughly clean of the antibacterial dish soap. I then toss them into the large round center baby sterilizer with the drainage holes at the bottom for storage (that I have removed from the unit) until I am ready to sterilize them all at one time. (This may sound dumb but I store all this equipment in my unused bathtub since I only use my shower!) When I sterilize.. I make SURE I place the AEROBICA on THE TOP SHELF!! After I do sterilize them .. I let the sterilizer cool down. Re assemble and I am good to go! I use distilled water .. I feel it is a good cautionary detail to keep the unit in good condition. If you are unsure you could confirm by calling 800) 833-9653 .. or better yet .. ask your Pulmonologist or respiratory therapist. I called Monaghan Medical (800) 833-9653 Aerobika Customer Service directly and told them my cleaning method .. their only concern was that I rinse well the antibacterial dish soap after soaking. BUT they are NOT experts on MAC or Bronchiectasis. They finally admitted their ONLY cleaning research was based on boiling SO cannot comment on any cleaning method other than boiling .. baby bottle sterilizing? LIABILITY!! (See 6/17 post from Member @lindam272, the new instructions from Aerobika NOW approve baby bottle sterilizing!)

Then use the Aerobika device per the instructions. Do the huff cough along with the Aerobika until you feel you have gotten up as much sputum as you possibly can.

It says, The four disassembled parts may be disinfected using an electronic steam sterilizer for baby bottles, following the manufacturers instructions for use (e.g. AVENT Electronic Sterilizer). The disinfection cycle should last approximately 15 minutes. Allow the parts to cool and air dry thoroughly before reassembly. Im only microwaving for 6 mins but maybe need to up that. It seems like the other components for the nebulizer should be okay. They are all plastic. One of the alternative methods described is the microwave steam bags but says to use distilled water. For HIGH LEVEL DISINFECTION: If clinically necessary for the patients disease state, the device may be cleaned after each use and disinfected once each treatment day. STERILE distilled water must be used for rinsing. To sterilize distilled water, boil it for 5 minutes. @katemn NOTE: because I purchased a large supply of nebs I use the same cleaning method as below for the Aerobika and nebulizers per my File Cabinet. I can ONLY speak for myself .. I follow the cleaning method on the Aerobika website: https://www.monaghanmed.com/patients-education .. the same one that came with the Aerobika. I use very warm water .. I use a 4 cup plastic measuring cup to wash the various parts .. I like the cup handle as I agitate the parts I am cleaning! Norpro 4-Cup Plastic Measuring Cup I USE THE: The First Years Power of Steam Electric Steam Sterilizer (I remove ONE shelf & make the bottom shelf TALLER to accommodate the tall nebulizer with two other more narrow shelves) I use a bit of antibacterial dish soap. Suds it up .. agitate .. hold the parts and shake them very thoroughly through the sudsy water. Let the parts soak for 10 to 15 minutes. Then several times fill the measuring cup with very warm rinse water .. again agitate the parts thoroughly to make sure they are thoroughly clean of the antibacterial dish soap. I then toss them into the large round center baby sterilizer with the drainage holes at the bottom for storage (that I have removed from the unit) until I am ready to sterilize them all at one time. (This may sound dumb but I store all this equipment in my unused bathtub since I only use my shower!) When I sterilize.. I make SURE I place the AEROBICA on THE TOP SHELF!! After I do sterilize them .. I let the sterilizer cool down. Re assemble and I am good to go! I use distilled water .. I feel it is a good cautionary detail to keep the unit in good condition. If you are unsure you could confirm by calling 800) 833-9653 .. or better yet .. ask your Pulmonologist or respiratory therapist. I called Monaghan Medical (800) 833-9653 Aerobika Customer Service directly and told them my cleaning method .. their only concern was that I rinse well the antibacterial dish soap after soaking.

Then use the Aerobika device per the instructions. Do the huff cough along with the Aerobika until you feel you have gotten up as much sputum as you possibly can.

It says, The four disassembled parts may be disinfected using an electronic steam sterilizer for baby bottles, following the manufacturers instructions for use (e.g. AVENT Electronic Sterilizer). The disinfection cycle should last approximately 15 minutes. Allow the parts to cool and air dry thoroughly before reassembly. Im only microwaving for 6 mins but maybe need to up that. It seems like the other components for the nebulizer should be okay. They are all plastic. One of the alternative methods described is the microwave steam bags but says to use distilled water. For HIGH LEVEL DISINFECTION: If clinically necessary for the patients disease state, the device may be cleaned after each use and disinfected once each treatment day. STERILE distilled water must be used for rinsing. To sterilize distilled water, boil it for 5 minutes. @katemn NOTE: because I purchased a large supply of nebs I use the same cleaning method as below for the Aerobika and nebulizers per my File Cabinet. I can ONLY speak for myself .. I follow the cleaning method on the Aerobika website: https://www.monaghanmed.com/patients-education .. the same one that came with the Aerobika.

Then several times fill the measuring cup with very warm rinse water .. again agitate the parts thoroughly to make sure they are thoroughly clean of the antibacterial dish soap. I then toss them into the large round center baby sterilizer with the drainage holes at the bottom for storage (that I have removed from the unit) until I am ready to sterilize them all at one time.

Aerobika. I highly recommend it. I love mine. I have two. They vibrate well to loosen the stuff and they are so much easier than an Acapella to clean. (I use a bit of dish soap. Suds it up .. agitate .. hold the parts and shake them very thoroughly through the sudsy water. 2. Let the parts soak for 10 to 15 minutes. Then several times fill the measuring cup with very warm rinse water .. again agitate the parts thoroughly to make sure they are thoroughly clean of the antibacterial dish soap. ) I have had mine for at least 2 years. Aerobika-Medical Supply ordered 2/25/17 $90.00 *Acapella device did not help me. . SEVERAL MEMBERS stated this AEROBIKA-MY PERSONAL ROUTINE-INHALERS/LUNG CLEARANCE HYGIENE/AEROBIKA Below is my particular routine in using my Aerobika Use my 2 inhalers PRIOR to brushing my teeth Use a huff cough at least 3 times .. like you were cleaning your glasses and fog them with your breath .. only MORE forcefully. Then use the Aerobika device per the instructions. Do the huff cough along with the Aerobika until you feel you have gotten up as much sputum as you possibly can. Personally I judge when to quit by the quantity and color of the sputum. I have found using the Aerobika you are able to  pull mucous out of those lower lung airways in a way you cannot without the device. Personally I do this twice a day. Inhale 7% Sodium Solution using my Pari Compressor and nebulizer After my Saline Inhalation I again use my Aerobika. Then use the Aerobika device per the instructions. A huff cough at least 3 times .. like you were cleaning your glasses and fog them with your breath .. only MORE forcefully. Do the huff cough along with the Aerobika until you feel you have gotten up as much sputum as you possibly can. Using peroxide to dampen my toothbrush and toothpaste to brush (purchased a squirt dispenser for the peroxide) Rinse my toothbrush .. then using peroxide for toothbrush storage for sterilizing I think this routine will help oral thrush by keeping my Sonicare toothbrush sanitized daily. http://www.good-gums.com/sanitizing-your-toothbrush.cfm AEROBIKA AND NEBULIZER -CLEANING *6/17 From Member @lindam272, Linda, Aerobika sites the Electronic Steam Sterilizer (baby bottle sterilizer) as the recommended method. It says, The four disassembled parts may be disinfected using an electronic steam sterilizer for baby bottles, following the manufacturers instructions for use (e.g. AVENT Electronic Sterilizer). The disinfection cycle should last approximately 15 minutes. Allow the parts to cool and air dry thoroughly before reassembly. Im only microwaving for 6 mins but maybe need to up that. It seems like the other components for the nebulizer should be okay. They are all plastic. One of the alternative methods described is the microwave steam bags but says to use distilled water. For HIGH LEVEL DISINFECTION: If clinically necessary for the patients disease state, the device may be cleaned after each use and disinfected once each treatment day. STERILE distilled water must be used for rinsing. To sterilize distilled water, boil it for 5 minutes. @katemn NOTE: because I purchased a large supply of nebs I use the same cleaning method as below for the Aerobika and nebulizers per my File Cabinet. I can ONLY speak for myself .. I follow the cleaning method on the Aerobika website: https://www.monaghanmed.com/patients-education .. the same one that came with the Aerobika. I use very warm water .. I use a 4 cup plastic measuring cup to wash the various parts .. I like the cup handle as I agitate the parts I am cleaning! Norpro 4-Cup Plastic Measuring Cup I USE THE: The First Years Power of Steam Electric Steam Sterilizer (I remove ONE shelf & make the bottom shelf TALLER to accommodate the tall nebulizer with two other more narrow shelves) I use a bit of antibacterial dish soap. Suds it up .. agitate .. hold the parts and shake them very thoroughly through the sudsy water. Let the parts soak for 10 to 15 minutes. Then several times fill the measuring cup with very warm rinse water .. again agitate the parts thoroughly to make sure they are thoroughly clean of the antibacterial dish soap. I then toss them into the large round center baby sterilizer with the drainage holes at the bottom for storage (that I have removed from the unit) until I am ready to sterilize them all at one time. (This may sound dumb but I store all this equipment in my unused bathtub since I only use my shower!) When I sterilize.. I make SURE I place the AEROBICA on THE TOP SHELF!! After I do sterilize them .. I let the sterilizer cool down. Re assemble and I am good to go! I use distilled water .. I feel it is a good cautionary detail to keep the unit in good condition. If you are unsure you could confirm by calling 800) 833-9653 .. or better yet .. ask your Pulmonologist or respiratory therapist. I called Monaghan Medical (800) 833-9653 Aerobika Customer Service directly and told them my cleaning method .. their only concern was that I rinse well the antibacterial dish soap after soaking.

The first time she had the usual 3 antibiotics treatment for 18 months and she tolerated the drugs very well. After 2 years the MAC is back. She has been on the same antibiotics for about 3 weeks now. She woke up about 12 days ago with a severe stiff neck and pain. We tried the ussaul hot/cold and no help. Went to an Urgent Care and the dr there said no reaction to drugs, just a stiff neck. She saw her Infrectious Disease specialist a few days later and he concurred. Now she has beentaking muscle relaxers and pain meds in addition to the MAC treatment. Her neck is progressively worse. She is in constant pain and soreness.Nothing seems to help. She has also tried a professinal massage. Today she is at a chiropractor. Anyone else hade or ever heard of this severe neck pain and stiffness as a side effect of the MAC antibiotics?

At this time everything is stable and they have decided to not treat. My function tests have not changed much and the xray showed no major changes. This is good news but I still get nervous knowing that I have these nodules in my lungs and that I am a former smoker. I still have not got clarification on whether I have Bronchiectasis. I sent an email out today to get some more clarification. I did not get a chance to see Dr Aksamit  he is so hard to get into now  becoming popular, which disappointed me since I have seen him in the past. Hopefully his assistant that I saw will at least confer with him. My trust level with Dr Aksamit is so much higher, he truly takes the time to discuss everything and give you the answers, and compassionate to boot. Are any others on this site not being treated and how did they decide it? Liked by Katherine, Alumni Mentor Follow Report"

Also, I am having some issues with the meds. My CT showed the cavity had gotten really thin walled and the doc said it almost looks like brochecstasis is whats left. She said I will always have something there, sort of scar lung tissue, dead for any function of any kind. She confers w Aksimet. She said the other part of my lungs looked much better, and mucous free. Ive had 3 negative cultures since August, so in 6 months I could be done w the meds. 1 Year treatment after clear culture is there protocol. She is discussing moving me to 3 days per week in March  August. I am very happy about this news, I had such a small are of infection, it was always a bit strange. But to get the drugs to that area, you have to put them thru your whole body. Inhaled drugs would be ideal, or something more targeted. They could do it, with the will and the money Promised Katherine Id report on travel. My doc said she conferred with te MAC team, and they are agreed that at this time, travel would not be a problem. I had been told in Oct no travel w cavities due to cabin pressure. The big problem is cysts, we dont have cysts. So, Im traveling and probably dropping off for a few month to do so. If Im fortunate enough to have this behind me, I plan to still work the site to encouage,and advise where I can, with my own personal experience. The drugs work. They can be hell to take, they can be adjusted and changed to make it easier. We should use them where we can, is my thought, and all advocate for something a whole lot better than dinosaur Tuberculosis drugs to fight a modern day illness!

Was in a world of excrutiatng prostate pain a few weeks ago, and urinary flow and frequency problems. Family doctor put me on Cipro for 2 weeks, but nothing changed. Then a urologist on rectal exam diagnosed enlarged and inflamed prostate, despite no infection detected in urine or blood tests. Put me on another 4 weeks of strong antibiotic and Flomax. Flomax helps, but drawing more water out of my body caused me severe constipation. I tried stool softeners but finally had to use a combo stool softener/17 mg two nights to have a bowel movement. Urologist nurse said doctor said it was OK to take a laxative every night on Flomax, but this sounds counter to EVERYTHING you read about relying on stimulant laxatives. Pharmacist suggested Murilax but that draws even MORE water out of the body. Does anyone have a solution to the Flomax constipation issue?

Does the medical staff tell you that over 100 baby boys die in hospitals in this country every year! Do they tell you that the risks outweigh the benefits (and it will not stop masturbation)? Finally some insurance companies won't cover this elective cosmetic surgery. and the cost range in the $1000 range. Women use the reason that they have the right to terminate a developing human life, called abortion, or women's reproductive rights, When the umbilical cord is cut it is HIS BODY NOT HERS and there is no justifiable medical reason for this. and causes problems later in life. This surgery is highly painful for the infant male they can't give enough lidocaine because of the size of the infant, and if the have a bleeding disorder a baby only has to lose 2/3 of an ounce of blood to go into traumatic shock. In some hospitals these infant foreskins are sold for up to $1000 to harvest skin cells called fiborblast used in anti aging creams.

(going through the mental game of having it done along with the post procedure complication and anything else that could happen) Secondly, has anyone here had a stricture before. Did it change the way you felt the urge to pee in your urethra from the base of the member to the head or move anywhere along the urethra? or was it just very hard to pass urine and you noticed no difference in the way it felt when you have to pee.with a stricture is it always a very weak stream or can you still pass a good stream sometimes. I now feel my bladder feeling up and the weight/pressure of my bladder when it fills, but i no longer feel the urethral pressure that i once felt at the base of my member.when i start a stream i feel a twinge or relaxation at towards the tip and then i urinate. it is rather difficult to begin urination. in a very dark place right now with all my symptoms so any advice would be greatly appreciated. thank you for your time for reading this.

I have been feeling very weak and fatigued and am even out of work now for 1 month because I cant sleep properly and do not have any energy. My thinking is cloudy, no energy, and depressed. I can sleep all day if I get the chance. I need to get better. Im 43 and its time to live a normal life. I felt like this when I was 22 yrs old but didnt have insurance and fought through all this until they put me on Paxil and discovered a few years later I had atrial fibrilation. The fatigue and depression has returned so I got a bood test and my testosterone is 97. Had another test to make sure and it came back the same. I went to an endocrinologist yesterday and he is running more blood tests but says he thinks I just have low testosterone and nothing is causing it. Said the testicles are just not producing like they should. I have a lot of the symptones of hypothyroidism such as feeling very hungry and etc. With all the research Ive done I wonder if he should be doing more testing on my thyroid etc. I was also thinking that maybe my atrial fibrilation is caused by this and possibly and even my depression? Ive felt very depressed recently due to this low testosterone. Im hoping the androgel will help me with all these symptoms. Ive been taking androgel for 3 weeks now and feel a little better but still can sleep all the time. Im wondering if there are some things the doctors should be looking at. I have to return to work in 9 days and want to be able to return healthy. Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Follow Report"

LOL it was weird.i could still cum but the feeling was hard to reach and the cramping feeling got fierce. it got worse to the point where i was getting a cramping feeling with erections in the base of my penis as well. at this time i was a pretty sick boy and wasnt in the mood to be masturbating so i was not aware when my ability to orgasm left me. suddenly when things got better i noticed my penis head pointed up now intead of straight and my penis head seams to remain completely soft. now my neurologist sent me to a sex doctor who immediately blamed it all on the NMO, saying that the nerve signal messing was keeping me from orgasming. i believed her and the wife and i approached the problem in a scientific way and started exercises designed to reawaken my orgasm. i feel and have found that with work we can overcome almost anything. now my wife and i noticed something in our daily play to try and reinvigorate me. i have lost at least 2 1/2 from my penis and the head no longer gets hard at all! the rest of my staff gets ginsu knife hard but my head is all small and floopy. now i am gonna postulate my ideas on what has happened. if i am wrong in my suppositions please correct me and if what i am saying makes sense PLEASE let me know. i think the cramping was due to some damage happening to the plumbing that supplies erectile blood to the head of my penis. i am having problems orgasming because the head of my erection no longer engorges thusly not allowing all the nerves in the head of the penis to come online so that i can have an orgasm. it only makes sense that these nerves would be turned off while the penis is unerect, otherwise men would have a hard time getting anything done with our soft penises rubbing themselves to orgasm every 15mins or so on our own thighs and pants. so obviously some mechanism keeps the nerves offline till the tissue becomes engorged. and my tissue seems to not be getting engorged anymore! my biggest problem besides the orgasm is keeping the erection for any period of time as most of my penises feelings are now more in the lower staff and base when erect so my penis has a hard time keeping the level of stimulation up enough in intercourse to allow me to stay erect for long periods. what i think happened is a feeder tube that brings blood to the head of my penis has become plugged somehow, whether from scar tissue or an injury or just a body screw-up that sometimes happens. i think that if i can get to someone who knows what they are doing that this can be checked.perhaps by ultrasound. and hopefully the problem can be fixed. i mean all it should take at the most is a lil surgical repair-work on my plumbing so that blood will fill the head of my penis again. what kind of specialist deals with this kind of stuff? can it be done? i mean they reattached bobbits penis and he went on to use it in porno.this surgical technique should be well understood shouldnt it? what do i ask my doc about it? my family doc is awesome and very caring but he is also aware of how specialists sometimes take the easy answer for whatever reason and dont really dig into a prob. they keep telling me to just relax and deal with a nonsexual life. BUT that aint gonna happen as long as i can keep myself trying to heal myself(with my loving wifes help). so please help me. i am so frustrated both with specialists that wont listen and with the fact im becoming so over-ridingly horny that im about to die and it is making me very depressed.

LOL it was weird.i could still cum but the feeling was hard to reach and the cramping feeling got fierce. it got worse to the point where i was getting a cramping feeling with erections in the base of my penis as well. at this time i was a pretty sick boy and wasnt in the mood to be masturbating so i was not aware when my ability to orgasm left me. suddenly when things got better i noticed my penis head pointed up now intead of straight and my penis head seams to remain completely soft. now my neurologist sent me to a sex doctor who immediately blamed it all on the NMO, saying that the nerve signal messing was keeping me from orgasming. i believed her and the wife and i approached the problem in a scientific way and started exercises designed to reawaken my orgasm. i feel and have found that with work we can overcome almost anything. now my wife and i noticed something in our daily play to try and reinvigorate me. i have lost at least 2 1/2 from my penis and the head no longer gets hard at all! the rest of my staff gets ginsu knife hard but my head is all small and floopy. now i am gonna postulate my ideas on what has happened. if i am wrong in my suppositions please correct me and if what i am saying makes sense PLEASE let me know. i think the cramping was due to some damage happening to the plumbing that supplies erectile blood to the head of my penis. i am having problems orgasming because the head of my erection no longer engorges thusly not allowing all the nerves in the head of the penis to come online so that i can have an orgasm. it only makes sense that these nerves would be turned off while the penis is unerect, otherwise men would have a hard time getting anything done with our soft penises rubbing themselves to orgasm every 15mins or so on our own thighs and pants. so obviously some mechanism keeps the nerves offline till the tissue becomes engorged. and my tissue seems to not be getting engorged anymore! my biggest problem besides the orgasm is keeping the erection for any period of time as most of my penises feelings are now more in the lower staff and base when erect so my penis has a hard time keeping the level of stimulation up enough in intercourse to allow me to stay erect for long periods. what i think happened is a feeder tube that brings blood to the head of my penis has become plugged somehow, whether from scar tissue or an injury or just a body screw-up that sometimes happens. i think that if i can get to someone who knows what they are doing that this can be checked.perhaps by ultrasound. and hopefully the problem can be fixed. i mean all it should take at the most is a lil surgical repair-work on my plumbing so that blood will fill the head of my penis again. what kind of specialist deals with this kind of stuff? can it be done? i mean they reattached bobbits penis and he went on to use it in porno.this surgical technique should be well understood shouldnt it? what do i ask my doc about it? my family doc is awesome and very caring but he is also aware of how specialists sometimes take the easy answer for whatever reason and dont really dig into a prob. they keep telling me to just relax and deal with a nonsexual life. BUT that aint gonna happen as long as i can keep myself trying to heal myself(with my loving wifes help). so please help me. i am so frustrated both with specialists that wont listen and with the fact im becoming so over-ridingly horny that im about to die and it is making me very depressed.

We flew all day. The problem is, my dad scared the heck out of me because he overused an anxiety med he got for the plane travel. The thing is he already takes multiple medications that increase sleepiness and cognition when taken together. Well, maybe from noon on, he began talking funny, mumbling, in and out of sleep, poor memory, trouble with walking. I told my mother she needs to take that from him, she did. After coming out of it later tonight he realized he lost his mouth partial, so he was ranting and they were searching everywhere. I had enough, told my mom they needed to figure this out, went to bed. He was dropping his new phone and computer, etc. a lot. I had to help him out. And I know you can make that mistake but I was scared and they are treating it too lightly. Again, I feel like my feelings dont matter. I even asked my mom if he could have had a mini stroke, she just laughed. I have 2 weeks with these people, and no way out. Trapped and stunned by my parents behavior.

We couldnt figure out why I was having them, and they put me through every single epilepsy medication. None of the medications helped, and The seizures became more violent and more frequent. I was pretty much incapable of thinking at this point, and I was just worried about survival. My parents were taking care of me but it all seemed hopeless. Every day, all day I would just think about when I would have my next seizure. It almost became relieving to a certain extent because it temporarily halted the overwhelming anxiety about when the next seizure would occur. About three years ago, my dad was online trying to figure out why I was having these seizures when he stumbled across a solution. He found a doctor who created special contacts that filter out red light. We drove eight hours to meet the doctor, and I received the contacts. Since that day I have not had a single seizure. I feel normal again physically. My brain never changed though. Every day all I can think about is when I will have another seizure even though it is unlikely that I will ever have another. I also struggle when someone near me has a seizure, one time I lost my vision completely for a short period of time because someone had one when I was nearby. I havent told anyone about this and Ive been hoping that I can solve this without having to see a therapist or doctor. This is affecting my social life along with my life at school and my relationship with my family. Im not sure what the clinical name for what Im going through is, but I figured that it is probably similar to PTSD. I dont want the rest of my life to be like this. I just want to go back to thinking as I used too: not having to worry about the next time that Ill have a seizure. Hopefully, someone can help me find a solution. Thanks in advance!
