4,C0085684,Foot Drop,C0030193,Pain,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/living-without-a-hip/,Living without a hip,"Does anyone know how it is to be without a hip. I've had 4 surgeries in the past 6 months all due to infections in the artificial hip. The hip was removed and replaced with a spacer and that got infected within weeks. They removed the spacer and put antibiotic seeds in. I've been without a hip since June. I can't walk, have sex or even stand for a minute. I'm on antibiotics permanently which I believe after so much they no longer work. I don't even know how I got the first infection cuz I had the hip replacement for over a year when I woke up screaming one day. Any advice would be appreciated. Oh I don't have much luck with this kind of surgery cuz the other hip was done 3 years before the 2nd one and that leg is useless. The surgeon cut nerves and I woke up screaming and a neurologist did nerve conduction studies and found I had RSD. Very excruciating painful disease due to the mistakes made during surgery. I have drop foot and rotation up above the knee so I can't even count on that leg for help in walking. If anyone has experience with this I'd appreciate hearing from you Liked by JK, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

He had another MRI recently on his lower back thinking maybe thats what calling causing his pain. That came back normal. He has had physical therapy, dry needling, massages and hes taking time off from running. When he starts back to running it begins to hurt he is able to do all kinds of cross training running in the water baking lifting and doesnt have any pain but is soon as he starts running on land the pain comes back.

I am not sure about what kind of facility is there. I did try treatment for fibromylgia thinking it may be that and it did not work .

My son (23yr old) has been battling wrist issues for 21/2 years. Primarily his right wrist. After conservative treatment, blood work, xrays and mri's it was determined that he had a TFCC tear and that surgery was needed. He had surgery and tried to do PT but the pain continued. From his description, the pain has shifted a bit since surgery and goes more along the forearm, starting at the wrist and going toward the elbow. Still primarily the wrist however. We have seen 3 (although I dont really count the 1st) ortho's. He has done splints, cortisone shot, PT, Acupuncture, and surgeryand still pain. Its not awful pain but it is chronic pain that is taking a toll on him mentally. Today he expressed how worried he was that he would have to stop working due to wrists. The last MRI showed some swelling/issues but nothing that the surgeon could put his finger on that would definitively say there was something he could fix that would relieve the symptoms. I am at my wits end trying to help him and I hate to see him like this. Our family is generally conservative with medical treatment (limited meds (even OTC), avoid surgery unless only option, etc) however tt this point I feel like we have tried most conventional and alternative approaches and still no relief! (although after the cort shot he did have less pain for a bit) Sorry for the long message! Here are my questions  Anyone with chronic wrist pain have success with a pain management doctor?  Anyone have chronic wrist pain who found a doc at mayo or else where that were able to give them answers that they could not find elsewhere?  Did anyone with wrist issues find relief from any home remedies/special splints/etcthat we may not be thinking of? We have researched and tried A LOT of things but maybe there is something we are missing!  Lastly, do the doctors at Mayo do online/phone consultsmeaning can you send them your MRIs, give them your history and schedule a skype call to discuss options forward? Thanks for reading/listening to our troubles! Fingers crossed that someone on Mayo Connect has been through something similar! Cheers! Follow Report"

Just wondered if anyone on the Mayo Connect hhad ever experienced anything of this nature. I am now trying cannabis to see if this helps with the pain. Thanks in advance.

His doctor prescribed Prednisone. I have seen posts here where people have been able to lower their prednisone dosage and even get off it entirely. Some people have posted about being in remission. My husband has tried several times to lower his dose but within a day's time is once again having level 10 pain. I would appreciate some posts from others that may be struggling to be able to lower their dosage. Also, posts from others that are in remission and how long between onset of illness and remission. I am beginning to think he may have some disease other than polymyalgia rheumatica. I look forward to reading your posts. Thank you. Follow Report"

I was put to the head of the line because my knee was a mess. This is my question about osteoarthritis. I have OA in my left knee as well. In fact it is slowing down the healing in my right knee because it is now hurting from being the weight bearing leg. The plan is to get the 3 injections in my left knee to help my right knee improve, but I know I am close to needing that one replaced as well.The surgeon said it was borderline. I also have osteoarthritis in my neck, spine, and shoulder and I have a herniated disc in my neck. I am 52 and I have a job that is physically demanding. Heavy lifting and on my feet all day. Because of this I am often in pain, which I tend to ignore, but am realizing I need to be listening to my body a little more. I do not think that I can do my active job anymore. I also can't sit at a desk for long periods of time. That hurts my lower back and sciatic nerve. I am at a crossroad here.At what point does it become a disability?

Went to doctor . had concussion, and lots of hurting and bruising .. all within soft tissue  nothing on surface to show. Next day from scapula to shoulder to elbow to first two digits on that hand were painful and very numb and tingling and burning. Saw 2 doctors .. didnt seem to think a thing about the numbness in my fingers . I read on Mayo last night that its probably a pinched nerve from the fall. It hurts like crazy from scapula on down to hand. Been told by others nothing could be done that it just had to heal itself. I think I need a neurologist, but dont know. My daughter has my puppy because I cant pick her up without major pain  8 pounder. I just moved down to this area from MD about 2 years ago and dont know where else to go besides the Internist, and they have the system of you get whoever is available . you have no doctor of your own. Im so upset I dont know what to do. Im 73, live alone, and I just could cry. Im scared, want a doctor who can give me definite info.

Facility. I was there for 1 week, getting therapy daily, and improving to the point where I no longer needed either a walker or cane. I was ready to head home, but my doctor in his wisdom, wanted me to stay to take advantage of the full week of P.T. Well, after I was improving, I could have stayed in my room and read, watched TV, or slept, but I decided to get out into the hall and sort of tour around. What I found was there were so many elderly folks in far worse condition than I was. Some were funny . there was a dear couple next door to me who were always going to Alaska and always trying to figure out the elevator code. But most were pretty lucid. I made friends with many of the women and it was delightful. Id push them in their wheelchairs outside into the garden, wed sit and chat, shed tell me about her life, and I would share mine. I grew to really enjoy those women. I have (I know for a 73 year old, this sounds nuts) blondish hair with a purple and blue stripe on the right side, and they loved it. They all wanted their hairdresser there to do that to them, which of course she was not prepared for. The point of this for me was, after I got a wee bit passed my own inner focus and pain, I thoroughy enjoyed being with the other folks who were in far worse shape than I. If I had not moved, I probably would still visit some of them, as they had no one else who visited. For me, it really helped my healing to get my mind off my own pain, which I figured (and hoped!) was temporary and onto the others.

My problem has taken years to develop. After having pains down side of left leg and knee pain, I was sent to PT. Got worse, started lurching (Trendelenburg gait) when walking as left leg seemed shorter and I then started using a cane. X-rays taken 21/2 years later said I had end-stage arthrosis of hip. Since I did not have any pain in hip but just down outside of hip to knee, was told to try chiropractors and neurosurgeon for possible stenosis. Did that. No real permanent progress. Was sent to PT for a year by doc who never looked at previous X-rays or ordered any. Started having pain in left knee and left lower back. This spring, PT said I might have glute medius tear on left side. I saw a different ortho doc and told that IF I had tear it would be fixed when I got my hip replaced posteriorly since I had a collapsed joint with AVN. I said but I dont have pain but he said to get it done anyway. I went to different doc who I later learned does anterolateral THR. She said that since pain relief was the MAIN benefit of THR, I would not get that benefit. However, she thought back and knee pain would get better if leg length was evened up. She could not promise if I could get off cane/improve gait because not sure how atrophied my muscles were and not sure how much ROM would improve.

My orthopedic doctor employed by a major hospital group in Florida recommended steroid injection and physical therapy as a first step. Made sense. But a pain management physical, also respected by his peers, believes the stem cell therapy is best. He works with Regenexx, as I understand it. My ortho literally rolled his eyes at the suggestion of stem cell therapy. Im cautious with major health decisions so am still in the research phase. Some of what has been written here is helpful and hopeful, but what concerns me about stem cell (derived from fat) therapy is that there are no long-term studies. The evidence is mostly anecdotal. We all know how that can lead one astray. So has anyone here found any scientific proof of the efficacy of stem cell therapy for the joints? Follow Report"

Multi-level, but individually summarized to include osteophyte complexes resulting in moderate narrowing at C5-C6 and stenosis. Met with the surgeon, put on a higher strength prednisone pack and offered a injection in the neck, which I declined as the higher Mg pack worked and I went 3 years with no issues. Fast forward three years, I am setting on the couch and sneeze. Immediate shoulder, neck and upper back pain followed by numbness running from my neck down through my shoulders and into my arm lasting about 30 seconds. I say to myself that was weird but think nothing of it. Two days later I wake up with neck pain and can barely turn my head to the left. I initially liken it to sleeping on it wrong, until days later it is still there and is now into my shoulder. Foot note- 3 years later I have moved and am a bit further away from initial doc, so I go to another Orthopedic clinic closer to my work. I leave early one day and go to their urgent care clinic (all PAs no Physician). I bring paperwork from 3 years ago and explain situation. Again, they suspect cervical, put me on taper pack, pain meds, and a follow up appointment with their spine doc. At this point my symptoms are progressively getting worse and not even c lose to comparable to 3 years ago. Much worse than three years ago. I am now experiencing significant radiculopathy down into the neck, shoulders, tricep, sides of forearms, palm of hands, and middle/ring finger. Waves of searing pain (both arms/hands but left worse). I have also been getting left ear pain and migraines every day. I also can turn just the right way, very hard to re-create, but will have a shock run down my spine like I was electrocuted. At this point I am miserable and I am sure the MRI will paint the picture. I go and have an MRI (lying down this time). Now I am traveling, several days away from my appointment and call the Radiologist office to send me the images and impression. They do and the impression this time is essentially, nothing wrong and everything is fine. At this point, I am shocked. I am in the middle of an airport terminal and wanted to break down and cry. Here is where I start to question the new spine doc office. I go to their website and no patient portal? I then find a general email address where I want to send a heads up to the doctor about all of the above and want him to be prepared to discuss the difference between MRI one and two and tell me why such a huge difference. I immediately get an outlook kick back that the email address is not valid. (completely different than the long standing orthopedic clinic previous, but more to come on that). So stranded in an airport, I am stuck until next week. I show up to the appointment, never meeting this doctor before and previously unable to get in touch with him before. He walks in completely young and smug, smile on his face, condescending attitude and says your MRI is fine (all of late 20s and just hired on at the clinic two months before come to find out but I dont let that persuade me). I try to tell him that I tried getting in touch to share the previous MRI to which he responds,  Who knows you read that, could have been anybody (a well known surgeon and Radiologist read it by the way). Well, I have the findings in hand and give it to him. He immediately opens up the new images and says oh, well on second look there is some stenosis at C4/C5, its mild to moderate. Then he says well get you in for an injection and before I knew what to say he stood up and left the room. The nurse walked in and said someone would call me to schedule the injection. I was stunned. I left and got a call two days later from the Spine Clinic who they contract to do the shots. The other doctor 3 years ago by the way does everything in house with minimal wait. This new clinic advises the earliest they can get me in is two weeks later! Doogie Houser made it seem like it would be next day. I schedule anyway. I then send a prescription refill request in to the doctor considering this was not going to be quick as they eluded to. They do have this automated approach believe it or not. I waited about 36 hours and get a call. Foot note- It has now been 5-6 weeks since my first visit. The nurse says we got your refill request and we are unfortunately in the office 50 miles away from you today as they rotate. She says we called in the Flexeril, but the doctor doesnt do narcotics, but he will write for Tramadol if you are willing to drive an hour away. At this point, my blood pressure is through the roof and I simply laughed and said no thanks. I asked her to send all of my records to my old doctor, I am now willing to travel as I am done with these people. I work high level in a Pharma company and to be told, he doesnt do narcotics as if I am making this up like some druggie is beyond me. I am furious. It has now been days, they have yet to transfer my files, but I will be on them next week as my symptoms are life and mood changing at this point. I sent the previous doctor a note in the patient portal to give him a heads up, but wont schedule until they do so in order for them to have the full picture. I am at my wits end folks!

I had my surgery on April 12, 2016. Problem with my hip started in end of June 2015. Treated for bursitis had tons of PT pain management then sent to 3 OS before they decided to do the surgery. I feel I should be doing better then I am. Went for Swedish massage and out of the blue she asked me what knee was hurting. Both were hurting a few months ago but the massages seemed to be helping. She told me to keep a check on my muscles above the knee to the hip because they didnt feel like they did before. My question could it be from the hip.

Turns out that it was a cyst, they performed a 15 minute procedure using a needle to poke holes in it and I am currently just shy of a week after. My wrist is feeling better and I am hopeful that this fixes the issue on a longer term scale. If the cyst were to reoccur, surgical removal would be the next option. If you are having very localized pain in your wrist that doesnt get better with R&R, I would certainly recommend getting it looked at by a hand specialist and to ask about ganglion cysts!

Its mostly centralized to my lower back (just above my tail bone/at the base of my spine  it feels a lot like I need to crack/pop it, but no matter how I turn or what I have people to do help, nothing will crack it), but travels often to my hips and my knees. Theres no swelling or inflammation that could suggest an infection, but its been hurting like this for around four weeks now and nothing (not heat or any over-the-counter pain reliever) seems to help.

I felt a little bit of pain in my hip, where the bone goes into the socket, and my knee. It didnt hurt as much as I expected it to (what with the rest of the joint pain), but just trying to walk on it made it buckle and I had to do a shuffling limp kind of walk just to get to a chair. The pain is mostly achey and dull, but it sometimes throbs. It doesnt move around much. On a scale of 1  10 with 10 being absolutely unbearable, it ranges from a 6  9.4 on a day-to-day basis. Often, the pain is accompanied by weakness in my legs that kind of feels like it travels from the tops of my legs down to my feet and almost feels like theyre sliding off (sorry for the poor description!). Im young (fifteen), and am fairly sedentary because of school. My mom thought it might just be growing pains, but this has been going on for around two months with no height changes and my doctors have said Im about done growing (it might be important to mention I have a congenital endocrine disorder that affects my growth, so I started growing/developing super early and super fast and will likely finish growing before most people my age). I was also diagnosed with chronic migraines a couple of years back and had a particularly nasty flare-up two weeks ago (a migraine around the same time every day for about a week and a half) but those have since decreased in frequency. Not sure what could be going on. Ive tried to see if my mom could take me to the doctor, but she doesnt seem particularly keen on that idea, so I figured I might see if anyone had any thoughts about what this might be.

I was sent to physical therapy where they had no instructions on what to do with me. they did not evaluate me before starting exercises. the exercises I did had no plan or target for improvement. the exercises started making my arms numb up to my shoulders and complaints were ignored. I finished the 8 weeks and was let go after they noted my goals were not met and there was no follow up visit from the doctor. I scheduled a follow up with the doctor and was asked why. he had read the therapy reports stating i did not improve, i got worse. I showed him with a model where the muscles were binding in my shoulders. I showed him the body position that caused the original injury but he shrugged his shoulders. I wanted him to hear the crunching that my body made and asked them to use stethescope. he said he didnt have one. i waited five seconds before raising my voice and saying maybe we should call someone, then I went to the check in counter and borrowed one for him myself. then the documentation says nothing of my pointing out on the shoulder model or the complaints from the therapy. and then the doctor says there is nothing they can do for me yet sends me off to other doctors like a medical whack a mole. I been going through this for 15 years while the problem gets progressively worse. it is ending my life and i told the dr this exactly but keep getting treating like crap. I came to mayo because i wanted scientists and what was promised in the commercial that has fireflies and says you end up with a team of doctors at mayo. instead i have a dr that doesnt want my case and is sending me around randomly while my quality of life evaporates. what is the right thing to do?

AVN is much more common than is what is widely believed and some experts believe it is actually AVN that is the primary cause of osteoarthritis. See below for general AVN disease information. Avascular Necrosis (AVN) Also known as osteonecrosis, this is a disorder where the blood supply to the bone is compromised, causing weakness and potential bone collapse. AVN usually occurs in people in the third to fifth decade of life, with an average age of 38. Common risk factors include corticosteroid use, excessive alcohol use, joint injury, and medical conditions such as cancer, lupus, blood disorders such as HIV infection, sickle cell disease, Gauchers disease, Caisson disease, gout, vasculitis, osteoarthritis, and osteoporosis. What are the Symptoms of AVN? In the early stages of avascular necrosis, patients may not have any symptoms. As the disease progresses, however, most patients experience joint painat first, only when putting weight on the affected joint, and then even when resting. Pain usually develops gradually and may be mild or severe. If avascular necrosis progresses and the bone and surrounding joint surface collapse, pain may develop or increase dramatically. Pain may be severe enough to limit the patients range of motion in the affected joint. In some cases, particularly those involving the hip, disabling osteoarthritis may develop. The period of time between the first symptoms and loss of joint function is different for each patient, ranging from several months to more than a year. Liked by julz777 Follow Report"

About 3 weeks ago as I was walking my dog, I rolled my foot on the curb  it hurt like blazes, but subsided. As the next 3 weeks went on it got worse, so I finally went to my Orthopedist. Their x-ray machine was down as they have maintenance done at night and the workers had found a problem, so they were in the process of fixing it. So he couldnt take an x-ray . he was not happy. He examined it, pressed, bent, etc. .. major OUCH! He said he felt pretty sure Id broken the outside bone on my left foot  he said its a common bone people break. He put me in a cami-walker  the tall ones, and had me go back today (1 week later). Today they took x-rays and he did not see any break. He said it must be a tendon problem  tendonitis or tendon tear. He gave me a shot of cortisone and told me if it did not feel better to get an MRI. He gave me a script for that. I came home, ate lunch, laid down and took a nap, and when I got up OMG, it hurt so bad I could not put any weight on it. It was awful. I have a dog to walk, so I wrapped it tightly which helped a little. I dont know if this is normal with these shots or not. The pain goes down that left side of my left foot (the bone on the bottom) and across the arch underneath. Id sure appreciate any input you all have. I just took a Vicodin I had left from when I had my knee replacement. I hardly used any of them with my TKR, but I sure had to with this. Id appreciate any input. Thanks so much. abby Follow Report"

My mom injured her knee over a year ago. She has been to doctors, therpists, chriroprators, and even a gym to try to stop the pain. It started with her knee hurting which she thought happened when she was walking down a bank to a lake and twisted her knee. The pain got worse and worse, after about 2 months she went to her general doctor which could find nothing wrong with her leg or knee. She then tried a chriropactor which said that the mucsle was weak, but for over a year nothing they have done has helped. Her leg is swollen most of the time, the knee pops out of joint and is very painful. She has been to at least 10 different doctors or whatever else not one of them has been able to help. She is now unable to lift her leg to climb steps or to get into her vehicle, she hasnt slept more then 2 hours at a time for almost a year, she is depressed and in extreme pain most of the day.

First to the mods, please advise if you feel this belongs in a separate forum. Im 65, 330 pounds, and Im 34 years old. I moved to Arizona in 2018 from Illinois, and within a few months, developed a cough. I was treated with antibiotics, and steroids. I feel good for another 3-4 months, and get sick again. Same symptoms, same diagnosis (acute bronchitis), same medications. In about June or July last year, I developed a slight drool on the right side of my mouth. My doctor told me it was nothing and would go away. It didnt. Maybe a month after that visit, I get sick again. This time Im given an inhaler, antibiotics (round 3), steroids (round 3), and a chest X-ray. X-ray came back normal. I was referred to an ENT for the drool, and trouble swallowing on my right side. He did an endoscopy, and said I was making it up. Approx. September, I start to develop numbness in my ring and pinky fingers on both hands. This then grows to include my forearms and upper arms. This spreads to my pectoral area. Its early October and one night I couldnt breathe. I tried my inhaler, and couldnt breathe. I went to the ER. They did a chest X-ray, and gave me a nebulizer treatment; and sent me home. Two weeks after that, the front of my neck and jaw start to go numb. I could literally feel it climbing up my body. Then my temples go numb, and my eyelids start twitching. I have yet another attack and go to the ER for a second time. I advised the doctors what was going wrong, and they diagnosed me with a probable bilateral ulnar neuropathy in the arms, and recommended I see a neurologist, then follow up with my GP. I was unable to see my GP, so I had to go see a stand in doctor. When I see him, I was so confused answering his questions, he immediately sent me back to the ER. He thought I was having a stroke. My blood pressure was in the 220/140 range. Barrage of tests were done, including CT scan of brain, blood draw, chest xray. All came back negative. Maybe 2-3 weeks after that I start to develop small pimple like rashes on my arms. I was told they will go away. They havent gone away, and have started to scar my arms, and parts of my legs. Its almost Thanksgiving now, and the numbness has spread to my entire face. I feel like Im wearing a mask, from forehead to temples, cheeks down to the jawline and chin. From the chin down the front of the neck to the pectoral area and out to my arms through to my fingers. I see my GP again, for a followup, and he chastised me for my weight, and told me to start exercising. I get home and start working out on an exercise bike. After three days of moderate biking, I wake up in the middle of the night with my calf cramping like crazy. I get up hobbling in pain and try to walk it off. I was able to, and went back to bed. Approx, 45 minutes later, my entire leg cramped up from thigh all the way down to my feet. The next day, both calves are sore, and my pinky and toe next to it start to go numb. Same as with my arms, the numbness is bilateral. Soon the outer portion of my feet and legs start to go numb up to my knees. I call my doctor, who says to take more fluids. A month goes by and Im pretty numb all over. I get sick again in the middle of December with a horrible cough, and am prescribed a nebulizer. I fly to Florida to see my parents for Christmas, and it was a disaster. I coughed and coughed the entire time there. I had 2-3 breathing treatments a day. I coughed so much I ended up getting a cough suppressant, which Im not sure helped. I get back and see my GP again. I tell him about my numbness all over and that Im starting to feel like Im dying. He laughed at me, and said that it had to have been a problem with my neck because the numbness was bilateral. He orders an MRI. Im claustrophobic and try a closed, open, and finally an open stand up MRI. I completed the cervical MRI, and was told by phone from my GP that everything looked normal. I said I felt worse. He said he would refer me to a neurologist. I call to make an appointment, and I cant be seen for 8 weeks! Its early January, and my eyes start to feel very tired and Im sleeping 12 hours a day. Everyday sounds start to shock my brain. I still have the cough. Im accomplishing nothing during the day, and start to feel faint and confused. I go to the ER in the middle of January, this time to a different ER but in the same hospital chain. The doctor there immediately suggests I see a neurologist, and I tell her my story and that I cant be seen until end of February. She orders a brain MRI, but I couldnt tolerate it. They refused to sedate me because I didnt have a ride back. I get a referral to a different neurologist from the ER for that week. I get a call from their office the next day, and because Im on AHCCCS (AZ Medicaid), I cant be seen. Although I could pay out of pocket, the receptionist said it would be pricey, and that I should call my insurance company for a neurologist. Im furious at this point, and email the hospitals patient relations department, saying the previous ER trip was worthless. Now its early February and Im still numb everywhere mentioned; and I start falling asleep during the day. I feel like theres a band around my head that covers my eyes. My eyelids are still twitching from the side. I just sit at home and wait for the upcoming neurologist appointment. I go out one day to get gas for my car, and I blacked out while driving. I almost run into another car. When I realized this I went back to the ER. The doctor there ordered a rainbow draw, and a CT of the brain. He then ordered a CT of the head and neck with contrast. I fell asleep in the room. I was woken up and told the results were normal but the doctor would like to do a brain MRI. He told me he thought I might have MS. Unfortunately, like with the previous instance, I couldnt tolerate the MRI machine and couldnt be sedated because I didnt have a ride back home. This is their policy. And because I couldnt tolerate the MRI, the doctor charged me with leaving against medical advice. I see my GP tomorrow for other issues, including sharp abdominal pain, the damn cough that wont go away, and these arm rashes I still have. I finally see the neurologist next Tuesday, but his ratings are 1.8 out of 5 online, so I dont have much hope. I would love to go to Mayo, but I have AZ Medicaid, and the website says only transplant services are available. I came here because this is Mayo, and its the only place I view in high regard. I apologize profusely for the long post but I honestly feel something is seriously wrong and no one really cares to listen. I have no idea whats going on, but slowly Im feeling weaker and weaker. I appreciate any response. Thank you. Follow Report"

I almost run into another car. When I realized this I went back to the ER. The doctor there ordered a rainbow draw, and a CT of the brain. He then ordered a CT of the head and neck with contrast. I fell asleep in the room. I was woken up and told the results were normal but the doctor would like to do a brain MRI. He told me he thought I might have MS. Unfortunately, like with the previous instance, I couldnt tolerate the MRI machine and couldnt be sedated because I didnt have a ride back home. This is their policy. And because I couldnt tolerate the MRI, the doctor charged me with leaving against medical advice. I see my GP tomorrow for other issues, including sharp abdominal pain, the damn cough that wont go away, and these arm rashes I still have. I finally see the neurologist next Tuesday, but his ratings are 1.8 out of 5 online, so I dont have much hope. I would love to go to Mayo, but I have AZ Medicaid, and the website says only transplant services are available. I came here because this is Mayo, and its the only place I view in high regard. I apologize profusely for the long post but I honestly feel something is seriously wrong and no one really cares to listen. I have no idea whats going on, but slowly Im feeling weaker and weaker. I appreciate any response. Thank you. Follow Report"

I started out with pain in my head, neck and legs, then I also started to have numbness in the saddle region, ringing and swooshing noises in my ears. I am in constant pain throughout my whole body. It is an internal pain that I can not describe. I then couldnt walk to far because it felt like my lower legs were going to tear open. As well as feeling really dizzy and uneasy on my feet. I would go grocery shopping for 30 minutes and within 5 mins of being out shopping I could hardly walk. When I finally got to the car I had to sit sideways in the car seat and then physically lift each leg into the car because I could not lift them. After a while I had full body numbness. So of course not being able to do too much I did gain extra weight. When this first began I was approx 100kg. My GP sent me to Orthopedic doctors, Neurological doctors and gynecologist. No one had an answer. They looked at me as if I was neurotic or a hypochondriac. I knew something wasnt right but the doctors kept saying there was nothing wrong. Also a year and a half ago I have had to start wearing glasses and have had to get them updared every 5-6 months. I got fed up with seeing doctors and all of them telling me I need to lose weight because Im fat. I was caught between a rock and a hard place. Then in June I went to a doctor because I was waking with severe pressure headaches. I am also allergic to anything codeine or opiate based so the only thing I can have is Panadol and Anti Inflammatory meds. The doctor sent me to an Optometrist. They took a photo of my optic nerve and found that I had Papilledema. So I was sent to an Opthalmologist. They confirmed the finding. I have then had CT scans, MRI scans and also a Lumbar Puncture. I am on Diamox. They have also found that I have Empty Sella Syndrome. On Wednesday I presented to the Emergency Department due to having a pop sensation on the left side of my head followed by a sharp pain. I had my Lumbar Puncture last Friday and was discharged that afternoon. I then ended up having to go to the Emergency Department on Sunday due to severe headache, nausea and vomiting. Put on a drip, prescribed Stemetil and sent home. I work, but have had since last Wednesday off due to the pain. I have an extremely high pain threshold due to not being able to have strong painkillers and have battled through and kept working. But I think I am now over my threshlld. My skull feels like it needs to explode open at the back, my neck is so painful and I have limited movement when turning my head. I just need to know is there something I can do to help relieve the pain and pressure. Just wondering if anyone out there has experienced the same or similar. Please any help would be great.

I want a proper and well-informed diagnosis that is meant to really make me well again. I have attached my EEG. One photo is after Hyperventilation and the other after Phonostimulation. Those are the time frames where I got the most abnormal electrical activity from my understanding. Is this epilepsy or some kind of brain inflammation? Or can it be merely the result of depression? Is something like that even possible? Liked by Leonard Follow Report"

Help,"Hello, I posted before in another group in its entirety but I think its too broad and there could be a multitude of theories and explanations. So Im going to break my story down into my most bothersome episodic symptoms. To start, everything on the surface looks like panic disorder or anxiety. However, my different episodes seem to be helping each other keep me feeling frantic more days than not so on the surface it looks like anxiety. Ive had lots of lab work testing including thyroid, Lyme, sleep apnea home test, brain MRI, spine MRI, abdominal ct scan, and way too many doctor visits with no answer, but they do agree on one thing. The symptoms are weird and seem to be more than just anxiety. There are little bits here and there but unfortunately not enough to go on. Keep in mind these episodes arent all going on at the same time but theyre not giving me any recovery time and feel like im sinking further down the hole. Its like fighting 5 bullies one at a time and losing. Just as you feel like you can get up another bully hops in. Episode 1: After waking up with head pressure, teeth chattering, shivering, lower back pain, and sweating. Oral temperature is ALWAYS between 93.8 F and 94.8 during these episodes. Also, every day is constant cold hands and feet that never happened until all of these episodes started. Episode 2: Brain fog, head pressure that feels like youre being pushed down when standing (like when youve had one too many drinks), usually later in the day when that feeling wears off, Ill have adrenaline body tingling, uncontrollable thoughts of self-harm and head chatter. (Not dwelling on things or worried about things, its just the mind doing what it does and I have no control.) Also, my eye will twitch like crazy before and during these. Episode 3: When standing for a long period of time, like cooking or washing dishes, and sweating starts to happen my heart rate increases and get extremely dizzy and feels like Im being physically pulled down. Episode 4: An overly excited feeling, almost like needing to yell or run to get adrenaline out, Heart rate is low. Episode 5. Sharp colon pain, yellow stools (frequently), stools that look sickly or unhealthy, and constipation more often than not. I had a colonoscopy recently and I was told everything looks good. Ive tried SSRIs and benzodiazepines and they dont stop these episodes from occurring. Ive tried strict diets and those dont help. If you have any thought about even one of these episodes please dont be shy to comment. Thank you so much for taking the time to read.

There was no option for me to select a canadian province) and I am a 39 yr old woman. I have been diagnosed with an arachnoid cyst of the right posterior fossa which measures 2.11.61.6 cm. The diagnosis came from an MRI after I started experiencing tingling and numbing sensations in my hands and feet. Well, later to follow was extreme fatigue, extreme burning pain in the base of my head and neck, behind my left ear, dizziness, light headedness, feeling like air is trapped inside my head, ears popping and buzzing, mood swings and i have had two episodes where I have almost fainted holding my baby. I have seen one neurologist here in Ontario who tried to tell me i was pre-menopausal or depressed, neither of which is true. It seems like the medical profession here in canada do not recognize these tyes of cysts as being symptomatic, yet i have found thousands of people all over the world with the same cysts causing the same symptoms. It is so frustrating being told that my symptoms are not likely caused by this cyst, yet there has been no other medical reason found. The symptoms have progressivly gotten worse since I had my son, who is 20 mths old now. I am no longer working becuase the headaches and fatigue have become dibilitating. I want my life back!! I sleep endlessly during the day and night and feel as though my body just doesnt have enough energy to work for me. I am losing out on precious moments with my children and no one will help me. If anyone out there has experienced teh same thing or help me in any way please contact me. i desperately need help. I understand from my enormous research that I have done that these cysts are often triggered to be symptomatic after a c-section child birth (which is when this all happened for me) because of the epidural or spinal that has tapped into my spine because the cyst is near the top of my spinal cord and cerebellum. I also understand that neurosurgeons in other parts of the world are doing great things with these cysts. thanks in advance to anyone that can help me. Liked by ttourville, kydanzer Follow Report"

In the Walmart parking lot one night in 2017, a few hours before I went home to sleep, I consumed a 1lb bag of pretzels & 1.6 quarts of CALCIUM enriched orange juice which was about 500 grams of sugar. I woke up tingly and numb. I started working in Sep 2018 and have medical benefits with my employer. I didn't check my blood pressure even once until I was almost 29 after ongoing intracranial pressure that seems like encephalopathy set in last Aug, and woke me up each night for about five days. I don't know if it's diabetic, hepatic, hypertensive, or renal. It was 170/110. I know way more about nutrition than I did then. I know calcium is bad for blood pressure and magnesium is much preferable. I know you don't need molybdenum often because your liver reuses it, and selenium, manganese, chromium, and iron are similarly lower priority. Mg, K, Cu, Zn, and I are the main minerals to worry about. Vitamins A, D, and E are lower priority than B vitamins, C, and K. Omega-3 and choline are concerns, but you'll get your aminos from pretty much whatever you eat. I can't eat salt, excess calcium, or carbs without feeling pressure in my head like a balloon inflated or a boiled egg slithered inside my brain causing it to press against the skull. I also feel my heartbeat inside my skull, pressure behind+inside my eyes, and facial tingling when this happens. I've had several episodes after trying to start an olive/avocado/algae oil keto where I felt light headed, faint, and queasy that went away when I drank a couple swallows of something sugary.

Maybe someone here has something similar or has some idea of where I could turn next. Last December I woke up with numbness and tingling on my right side (arms and legs). 2 weeks later, it was on my left side too, and sometimes my face. I had an MRI, which showed lesions in my brain, but not my C or S spine. I had a spinal tap (specifically for MS panel) and it was clear. I had 2 EMG tests, both normal. I have had tons of bloodwork done, ruled out many autoimmune diseases, viruses/ infections, toxins, etc. My bloodwork is all normal. I saw an MS specialist who ran a 2nd MRI on brain and C spine, all the same (this was 6 months after the first), nothing lit up. No lesions in spine. So they ruled out MS. They thought maybe Amyloidosis, then ruled that out. I was tested for small fiber neuropathy, which was then ruled out. The numbness, tingling etc has never gone away  at all. It sometimes also includes burning, electric jolts, cold sensations, tightness in the muscles (that is pretty constant now), constant weakness in muscles (going up stairs fatigues my legs quickly when it never used to), I have trouble lifting my left leg  my muscles wont let me. After a 1.5 mile hike up to a cave, my legs were shaking and in pain the rest of the day and I was in a lot of pain at night  legs on fire. I cant overdo it, but I also have to move my body or I hurt more, so I walk almost daily. This summer I lost my appetite, felt sick to my stomach a lot, had bowel issues, and lost 18-20 pounds in about 10 weeks without trying. Then that tapered off. A couple of months ago I started having bladder issues where I had to go frequently -sometimes 4-6 times in an hour, each time feeling urgent, and something coming out each time I went.

Because of this, you get nerve pain? Or get jolts of pain up and down your legs, back and/or side of the abdomen? Last year I was scheduled to have an arterial flush to rid my system of clots throughout, the surgeon couldnt get passed my nervous system since it had been moved due to battered arteries. In fact at one point, the doctor hit a nerve and my leg shot up and kicked him in the face (no control). Weirdest sensation ever. I get jolts of pain all over every day. Some of them can be so strong, my body jumps from its position. Some of them are so painful, nothing I can do but hold on. I guess my question/discussion is: Do you any of you suffer from displaced nerves, what do you take for nerve pain/damage and what procedures have you tried to correct the problem?

My husband has AA. I searched for physicians who specialize in AA and got an old post from 2014. Any updates? We are seeking a specialist somewhere near Maryland and are currently in a Pain Management Clinic, in a dead-end insufficient treatment protocol that will not operate beyond their narrow parameters, which are not working well. He got transferred when his PCP retired, along with 67 other Chronic Pain patients. He is the only one with Intractable Pain and it appears that no amount of educating the NP and MD is going to make a difference. Anyway, I am trying again to find answers after nearly 12 years of his doing very well and having several pain free hours a day on the regimen that various PCPs had him on. Thank you for any help or advice or links or news. I wish pain-free days and restful nights for each of you. Gentle hugs. -Jeanne Liked by downeylynn Follow Report"

I chalked it up to lack of sleep because after about a week it started getting better..about two weeks after it got better my symptoms started coming back but worse than before.

They did blood tests for ANA, RA, B12, CBC, CMP and more and everything came back normal.. they recommended I get a primary care provider.

Im not sure if anyone knows what I am talking about but I am hoping that someone does because I am beginning to feel crazy. Every day, I have an electrical sensation feeling throughout my entire body. The only way I can describe it to people is that it feels like I am being shocked by a light switch throughout my entire body. It is very painful, however only lasts from around 5-20 minutes, 1-5 times a day. Its starting to scare me because my doctor looked at me like I was crazy, and my nurses chuckled when they heard my symptoms. I am going to a neurologist but they cannot fit me in for another month. Its very painful for me and it has started to come with a red, splotchy rash from my neck down to my legs. If anyone has any idea what this could be and what I can do to surprise the pain, I would really appreciate the advice.

They have always worked for me but i think one of the side effects is hand tremors. Ive had blood tests and all ok there. the Doctor suggested coming off the CH and trying Sertraline, which I did but just felt like sleeping all the time, so back to CH. Its like Ive got too much adrenaline! It is worse in company and at work even though Im not stressed or anxious. As Im typing this my hands are shaking. It doesnt stop me doing anything but its annoying and I often have to drink holding the cup or glass with both hands and my writing is awful.

I had an auto accident on 2/1 this year and walked away with a bruise on my left arm from the airbag, 2 staples in my head, and a concussion. Other than a headache, life was good. Two weeks later, after trying to work with a headache from the concussion, it got so bad that I had trouble remembering the simplest thing about my job. I called my primary's office and agreed to go in that day. After a brief exam, he ordered a brain MRI. The first of many to come. No damage from the wreck but it was abnormal, in the cerebral peduncle area and it was totally symetrical. I was referred to neurologist. Since then I have had 5 brain MRI's, ct scans and MRI's of chest abdomen and pelvic, a full body bone scan, 2 lumbar punctures 2 aspiration biopsies and one surgical biopsy. I was relatively symptom free at this point. Although o did have symptoms but later learned they were all misdiagnosed as something else : hearing loss, crying, double vision, loss of balance, and weakness in my legs and arms. In June, I was told that I should no longer work or drive, so I am basically homebound and reliant on others for transportation. The loss of balance is so bad that i have to use a cane when i am not in my house. And the double vision has gotten to the point where it is difficult to read which is my favorite pastime. I recently went to a neuroimmunologist that gave me a diagnosis of brombencephalitis brought on by sjogren's. He only looked at my brain MRI. I am still waiting on the biopsy results. Has anyone else got a cns disorder but no diagnosis. Or if you have a diagnosis, how long did it take to get? Did it take 5 weeks to get a pathology report?

Help,"Hello, I am a Female in my 20s, 56, 115lbs. Over the past 3.5 years I have been experiencing debilitating symptoms and have been struggling to find anyone for help. I am wondering if anyone has had similar experience and issues and may be able to direct me on how I can better handle it. My first symptoms started around 4-5 years ago and it was very mild and infrequent. I would describe it has a deep burning to stabbing pain in my calves and arms. Generally it would only occur in one place at a time and could last 5 minutes to 2 days. Along with the pain whichever limb was affected also would just feel weak. The next symptom was chest pain around my left breast that feels stab like when it occurs. My next symptom began in around 3.5 years ago. I would describe it as air hunger, constantly yawning and sighing because it feels like I am not getting enough air. The first few months it was something that would come in the afternoon and be gone the next morning but it quickly turned into lasting from the moment I woke up to the moment I go to sleep. Generally it is constant on occasion it gets worse (no identifiable triggers) but it has never gone away or gotten better. Around this time I also began to become increasingly sensitive to heat. I have become almost unable to go outside and do activities such as walking or going to the beach because I will get so hot and lightheaded. I have been experiencing periodic episodes of dizziness and lightheadedness that can last a day or for weeks. Sometimes it can get to the point where I can do nothing but lay down because everything is spinning so bad. My periods have become irregular and light. Ive had a clearing of throat type cough for about two years that had noticeably gotten worse over the past two months. I once was extremely active but now I am constantly fatigued. Even standing up for five minutes makes me feel exhausted and like I need to lie down. Recently I have also been suffering from upper to mid back pain constantly and it makes me feel like I cant stand occasionally and makes my feeling of not being able to breathe properly worse. The shooting and burning pains in my arms and calves and chest have gotten much worse in the past 3 months to where they are almost an everyday thing now. In the past month I have noticed my vision keeps going in and out and getting blurry, whether I am focusing on things or not. My near sighted vision has also gotten extreme blurry.

Help,"Hello, I am a Female in my 20s, 56, 115lbs. Over the past 3.5 years I have been experiencing debilitating symptoms and have been struggling to find anyone for help. I am wondering if anyone has had similar experience and issues and may be able to direct me on how I can better handle it. My first symptoms started around 4-5 years ago and it was very mild and infrequent. I would describe it has a deep burning to stabbing pain in my calves and arms. Generally it would only occur in one place at a time and could last 5 minutes to 2 days. Along with the pain whichever limb was affected also would just feel weak. The next symptom was chest pain around my left breast that feels stab like when it occurs. My next symptom began in around 3.5 years ago. I would describe it as air hunger, constantly yawning and sighing because it feels like I am not getting enough air. The first few months it was something that would come in the afternoon and be gone the next morning but it quickly turned into lasting from the moment I woke up to the moment I go to sleep. Generally it is constant on occasion it gets worse (no identifiable triggers) but it has never gone away or gotten better. Around this time I also began to become increasingly sensitive to heat. I have become almost unable to go outside and do activities such as walking or going to the beach because I will get so hot and lightheaded. I have been experiencing periodic episodes of dizziness and lightheadedness that can last a day or for weeks. Sometimes it can get to the point where I can do nothing but lay down because everything is spinning so bad. My periods have become irregular and light. Ive had a clearing of throat type cough for about two years that had noticeably gotten worse over the past two months. I once was extremely active but now I am constantly fatigued. Even standing up for five minutes makes me feel exhausted and like I need to lie down. Recently I have also been suffering from upper to mid back pain constantly and it makes me feel like I cant stand occasionally and makes my feeling of not being able to breathe properly worse. The shooting and burning pains in my arms and calves and chest have gotten much worse in the past 3 months to where they are almost an everyday thing now. In the past month I have noticed my vision keeps going in and out and getting blurry, whether I am focusing on things or not. My near sighted vision has also gotten extreme blurry. Ive tried going to doctors a few times over the years and no one has been much of help.

My name is Michael. I have been dealing with some sort of dizziness for a long time. When Im in the shower and I can see the curtain move out of the corner of my eye it makes me feel like I am falling and need to grab onto something, I feel off balance whe I walk, I can be walking and hit an uneven spot in the ground and feel spinny, when standing and bend my knees a little I get a falling sensation, I see stationary things move on a constant basis (when I was at the doctors I can literally see the wall move close and back like its bobbing back and forth, when I stand up and pee and look down at the toilet I can literally see it twisting clockwise and counter clock wise constant and makes me feel sick and anxious), I go on a treadmill for half an hour and when I get off of it I feel really dizzy like my mind is still thinking treadmill and my body is walking in real life and my body cant make the distinction so I get motion sick, when I drive I feel ok but then I stop and feel like Im either moving still or the car next to me is moving still and sometimes I see the road stretch as if its getting longer as Im sitting still, I went to Disneyland 2 years ago on star tours the movement and the screen at the same time make my brain feel like its spinning inside my head, I had to shut my eyes and hide my face against a family member to try and regain control. When I close my eyes I can help the dizziness go away. Im sure theres something I left out but this is what I have been feeling, Im so desperate for some answers because my health care providers dont know whats going on and my grandmas doctor has told me that the major corporation hospital Im with is less that good and i have had to do my own research to whats going on. I cry everyday and Im begging for some kind of help. They seem to think its because of some concussions in 2006 and other times I have had in the past and hit the back of my head maybe whats causing it, they dont know. Im just so sick of feeling sick.

Information online paints a different story. They report cavitations could definitely cause the issues Ive been having. I just find it a strange coincidence that I do indeed have pockets in the bone where my teeth were removed and that my symptoms began not too long after my surgery. Because this is not recognized in standard dentistry, I am getting blank stares from both dentists and oral surgeons. I am debating on just asking them to cut into it to see, they are reluctant to do this. It is the only lead I have right now but I dont know who to trust.

Last June I became extremely dizzy nauseous ended up in hospital for 9 days they had told me I had vestibular neuritis put me on bed rest for two months and lots of medication. My whole life flipped upside down literally and remained everyday as if I was one of Merry Go Round. I have not driven in 9 months everything has been taken away which is very hard for me as I was a very active mom and hospice nurse, I have spent my whole life taking care of others. About 3 months ago I started having severe ear pain I was put Gabapentin which gave me severe side effects then I put was put on Lyrica Max dose. I've gone to see an ENT had an MRI seen a neurologist and no one can give me a clear diagnosis. My limbs lose circulation very easily my right side is extremely worse I wake up five times in the night with no feeling in my arm. My neurologist has started decreasing my medication and I'm having severe side effects on top of everything else. I'm not sure why I woke up one day with vestibular neuritis and now I am having the shooting pain numbness tingling in my arm fingers where I can't even feel them and there's no circulation. I go to vestibular therapy twice a week a massage therapy and nothing seems to be helping. I'm so happy to be getting off Lyrica because the brain fog and speech coordination has been tampered the last two months very hard on my children and my boyfriend.

I also have small fiber neuropathy, myofascial pain, DDD, raynauds, costa chondritis, and arthritis which are all pain producers so it may be hard for me to pick out what is what.

We have seen specialist after specialist: Went to TX To see Dr. Trevedi in thinking maybe it was HypoKPP.. she said it wasn't. It was Secondary Periodic paralysis with an underlying medical cause. Went to Endocrinologist thinking maybe conn syndrome, pheochromocytoma because during some episodes her BP spikes really high with the highest being 259/137. Conns and Pheo was ruled out. She has also had significant weight gain and severe fatigue.. cant figure that out either. Went to Caring medical and she was diagnosed with C1/c2/c3 cervical instability but not bad enough to do surgery on. Went to Cleveland clinic and they agreed it wasn't bad enough for surgery and nothing in her neck would cause this. Fast forward to today. THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER NECK. Yesterday riding in the car after shopping she turned her head and her neck popped super loud, like I had just popped my knuckles. She got an instant headache, severe neck pain and severely tired where she couldn't even open her eyes and lost movement from her neck down. This is pretty much what happens everytime.

First were frequent saliva and swallowing. Then a metal taste in mouth and swollen tongue. Last week I had numbness in on my left side of my face and now half my tongue on that side is numb and for the past few days my left arm and leg feel very heavy and hard to use. On top of all of this I have had severe fatigue just tired all of the time. So my question is does this sound like multiple sclerosis a few months before these symptoms I was having like burning itch sensation after taking showers and would feel like internal tremors through out my body and itching tongue that would come and go also I kept biting my tongue in the middle of the night a few weeks ago its like symptoms keep adding on and coming and going its very nerve racking an help would be appreciated!

I have had Rheumatoid Arthritis for 13 years, I am currently 45, turn 46 shortly. I have been on many biologics, basically since they came out, including Remicade, Enbrel, Humira, and Orencia. After having many infections in a short amount of time (approx. 2 months), I was on and off of my Humira. During this period, I woke up with extreme dizziness, 24/7, do not even have to move my head or open my eyes. This lasted for 8 1/2 months! I quit my Humira all together, as we had to look at this as a possible reason for my central vertigo. It has been proven through inner ear testing that it is central. I also had an MRI of brain done which came back normal. My RA and Osteoporosis became very bad after being off the biologics for about a year due to the horrible vertigo. It became so bad that I finally decided recently to try Orencia. My vertigo had subsided, and it was about 85% gone for about 2 1/2 months, then returned after only a month on Orencia, and is exactly as it was before, 24/7, very miserable, in which my head perceives it is in constant motion. I have a rocking sensation in my head at all times, worse when laying down, feel very drugged, very off balance. I have to believe this is due to these biologics!! Has anyone else experienced anything like this with biologics or other meds for other chronic illnesses? I would so appreciate your comments!

He informed us that, she does have POTS, however her diagnosis is more complex than just POTS. He diagnosed her with Hypervagal and Hyperadrenergic Dysautonomia. They had to decrease the Florinef because her pressure was still too high at times, that didnt work, he has now added a small dose of Atenolol 12.5mg back to her medication list, to see if it would balance her pressure out some.

I had been experiencing severe amnesia. The operation was successful in that my memory improved. The surgeon warned of the risk of ""convulsions"" in the surgical plan, and over the following year or more, I had ongoing occurrences of memory loss. Last December, my surgeon started me on epilepsy medication, as a treatment for these memory failures. From my reading, I took it that I had Transient Epileptic Amnesia. Today, I went for my latest check-up and to get my next prescription of epilepsy (Vimpat aka Lacosamide), and he told me that in fact I have Transient Global Amnesia. (TGA) So far so good, but I immediately checked the medical literature on TGA, and the first paper I read (published in QJM) says that TGA doesn't respond to anti-epilepsy drugs. https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/article/107/11/915/1512956 I thought Lacosamide is an anti-epilepsy drug. If TGA doesn't respond to it, why has the doc prescribed it? Vimpat is a non-generic drug and it's really expensive. Does anyone have a similar situation or knowledge about TGA or its treatment?

My entire visual field feels like all of the information that is going into my brain is just noticed, rather than fully seen. Like I can see everything, but it isn't going in right, and it feels extremely uncomfortable. It started when I was 13, then stayed that way for 9 years, then got worse when I was 22, then stayed that way for 10 more years, now I'm 33 and got mono just a few months ago and it got even worse the same day I got the fever from the virus. I can't figure out what could cause a chronic issue like this and just keep it this way for so long and just get worse apparently every decade. It doesn't seem to make sense. So far I have had an MRI, EEG, BAER, PET/CT scan, was tested for lyme, heavy metals, and had a spinal tap. The only thing that showed up abnormal was a little bit of high protein in the spinal tap but that was it. I have a couple bad discs in my spine also but that was all they found. It's pretty much only one symptom to, which sucks. I can't figure it out at all. Does anyone else have any ideas? No pain, dizziness or blurry vision or anything like that either, just this horrible, visual/brain abnormality  Follow Report"

He was rushed to er and after extensive tests the diagnosis was transverse myelitis. Up until that day, he was a perfectly healthy person because he did not have any other underlying medical condition and all tests came back negative, it was categorized as idiopathic. He stayed at the hospital for 12 days, was given steroid, pain meds and everything else to keep him stable. He was later discharge to a rehab where he spend a month of daily theraphy and meds. By the time he went home, he was still under the care of in home therapist with continous meds to take everyday. As we are getting close to a year anniversary, although, theres a slight improvement, he still is in wheel chair and not able to walk. Today, we just came back from his doctors appt which it gets more frustrating when it seems like there is nothing else that doctors can do..while I understand that this seems like a puzzle but I also wonder why we cant seem to get precise information as to how this condition is treated..Is TM really that uncommon?..I would appreciate it very much to hear from anyone who suffers or care for someone with TMthank you.

Prior to that no one knew what I had and I saw ENTs, neurologists, and many other Dr.s. MRI of close to two years ago shows all is normal. However, despite a respite of feeling almost normal for three months while taking a new medication (Effexor extended release at 75mg.) all of my symptoms came back full force for what I call episodes, at least once a week, and lasting up to three 3 days in bed. My symptoms for the last two years have been: popping ears, nausea, vertigo at the beginning which seems to have gone away and been replaced by dizziness and light headedness, tingling all over head, severe headaches, weakness to almost numbness in my arms, and severe fatigue. I can feel like a pressure in my head at times. I have not lost cognitive functions: that only occurred when I took Topiamate. My internist wants me to see a specialist at the Mayo Clinic, but I wonder if anyone else has experienced what my Hopkins Dr. calls very atypical VM symptoms? Liked by marystefy Follow Report"

For the past 2 years, he has been going through medical issues. Different things, one after another. He was a perfectly healthy 27 year old, and then out of no where, all this stuff hit him at once. He has seen so many doctors, that Ive lost count. Hes been on medical leave for almost 2 years now (with a short break in between where we thought he was okay, but then something ELSE popped up) As his partner, it really scares me that no one can diagnose what hes going through and we really want some resolve Ill start from the beginning, but Ill try not to make this too long. It started off with him having bowel issues. He would go to the bathroom 9-10 times a day. Sometimes he would be in the bathroom for half an hour. We thought maybe it was IBS. Maybe Crohns Disease. Eventually, they did a colonoscopy and an endoscopy and they found inflammation in his intestines. Gave him meds, and now the inflammation is gone and we dont worry about that anymore. However  during this time of his bowel issues  he also started getting chest pain, and side/flank pain. After his bowel issues resolved, his side pain is gone, but he still gets random chest pain. No one can figure out why. They did x-rays and EKGs on his heart. Its all good. I looked some stuff up and thought maybe it was pleurisy? Doctors said, very vaguely, he has inflammation in his muscles. One doctor chalked it up to asthma. Another said it was anxiety (which he doesnt have). The only thing that seems to help temporarily is going to a chiropractic neurologist who helps him stretch his chest out. That, plus applying heat to the area. However, it doesnt resolve the issue permanently, and STILL no one can tell us WHAT exactly it is and what is causing the pain. It comes and goes in waves. Fast forward to this past July  he got an ear infection. Didnt worry about it too much. However, he was complaining of INSANE ear pain. We put garlic oil and a couple homemade remedies in his ear to try to help still thinking the pain was from an ear ache. Eventually after a week or so, we took him to the doctor for the second time and they told us that the ear infection was gone. Ok  so what is causing the pain? They said perhaps its a damaged nerve. So they referred him to a neurologist. First one told him it was all in his head Needless to say, we were NOT happy hearing that. So he started seeing a different neurologist. This new neurologist says MAYBE its migraines. From what hes telling me, what hes feeling is like lightning shocks of pain in his face. They come on unexpectedly out of the blue, then it subsides. Aside from that, sometimes the left side of his face just hurts and he says it feels like his left eye is bigger or feelings like its coming out, due to the pain only on one side of his face. Hes got blood work done, xrays, a brain scan.. Nothing. We thought MAYBE it was an autoimmune disease? So he tested for a bunch. All came back negative. Cancer came back negative. While all of these tests coming back negative is a great relief because it tells us what he doesnt have  it also causes a lot of grief because NOTHING is telling us what he DOES have. And as if that isnt enough  he recently started getting random leg pain. Every day. His legs will be so sore to the point where he doesnt want to move. He CAN move, but he doesnt want to. All were hearing is a lot of guesses, but NO DIAGNOSES. Neurologist says maybe its a migraine thats so bad that its affecting his legs.. But, I just dont think this is a migraine. So to sum up: Hes suffering from random chest pains that come and go, face paint on one side of his face, and extreme leg soreness. Were at the end of our rope here. I found Mayo Clinic and I know they deal with rare conditions. Ive read articles where people who havent been able to get diagnoses for years, and then they go to Mayo Clinic and get a diagnoses within a week of being there. Were so fed up with the doctors where we live and having no answers. Is it worth the trip to come out to the Mayo Clinic?? Liked by Jamie Olson, Lisa Lucier Follow Report"

Eventually after a week or so, we took him to the doctor for the second time and they told us that the ear infection was gone. Ok  so what is causing the pain? They said perhaps its a damaged nerve. So they referred him to a neurologist. First one told him it was all in his head Needless to say, we were NOT happy hearing that. So he started seeing a different neurologist. This new neurologist says MAYBE its migraines. From what hes telling me, what hes feeling is like lightning shocks of pain in his face. They come on unexpectedly out of the blue, then it subsides. Aside from that, sometimes the left side of his face just hurts and he says it feels like his left eye is bigger or feelings like its coming out, due to the pain only on one side of his face. Hes got blood work done, xrays, a brain scan.. Nothing. We thought MAYBE it was an autoimmune disease? So he tested for a bunch. All came back negative. Cancer came back negative. While all of these tests coming back negative is a great relief because it tells us what he doesnt have  it also causes a lot of grief because NOTHING is telling us what he DOES have. And as if that isnt enough  he recently started getting random leg pain. Every day. His legs will be so sore to the point where he doesnt want to move. He CAN move, but he doesnt want to. All were hearing is a lot of guesses, but NO DIAGNOSES. Neurologist says maybe its a migraine thats so bad that its affecting his legs.. But, I just dont think this is a migraine. So to sum up: Hes suffering from random chest pains that come and go, face paint on one side of his face, and extreme leg soreness. Were at the end of our rope here. I found Mayo Clinic and I know they deal with rare conditions. Ive read articles where people who havent been able to get diagnoses for years, and then they go to Mayo Clinic and get a diagnoses within a week of being there. Were so fed up with the doctors where we live and having no answers. Is it worth the trip to come out to the Mayo Clinic?? Liked by Jamie Olson, Lisa Lucier Follow Report"

For the past 2 years, he has been going through medical issues. Different things, one after another. He was a perfectly healthy 27 year old, and then out of no where, all this stuff hit him at once. He has seen so many doctors, that Ive lost count. Hes been on medical leave for almost 2 years now (with a short break in between where we thought he was okay, but then something ELSE popped up) As his partner, it really scares me that no one can diagnose what hes going through and we really want some resolve Ill start from the beginning, but Ill try not to make this too long. It started off with him having bowel issues. He would go to the bathroom 9-10 times a day. Sometimes he would be in the bathroom for half an hour. We thought maybe it was IBS. Maybe Crohns Disease. Eventually, they did a colonoscopy and an endoscopy and they found inflammation in his intestines. Gave him meds, and now the inflammation is gone and we dont worry about that anymore. However  during this time of his bowel issues  he also started getting chest pain, and side/flank pain. After his bowel issues resolved, his side pain is gone, but he still gets random chest pain. No one can figure out why. They did x-rays and EKGs on his heart. Its all good. I looked some stuff up and thought maybe it was pleurisy? Doctors said, very vaguely, he has inflammation in his muscles. One doctor chalked it up to asthma. Another said it was anxiety (which he doesnt have). The only thing that seems to help temporarily is going to a chiropractic neurologist who helps him stretch his chest out. That, plus applying heat to the area.

I have not been here for awhile but I really need some input. . I wont go into the details or it would take forever, but I live in an apartment  1st floor. Our sidewalks are poorly maintained . between the concrete and grass is a gap, that you can easily see through, about 6. Alongside is a metal plate that I assume is part of the way they set the concrete is set  it protrudes 2. I was walking my new puppy (8 lbs.) and got the heel of my sneaker caught in the metal and flew, landed on the concrete pad holding the elec. unit, landing on my left side, head hit and bounced up and hit on other side where there was a vertical metal flange of some sort. Went to doctor . had concussion, and lots of hurting and bruising .. all within soft tissue  nothing on surface to show. Next day from scapula to shoulder to elbow to first two digits on that hand were painful and very numb and tingling and burning. Saw 2 doctors .. didnt seem to think a thing about the numbness in my fingers . I read on Mayo last night that its probably a pinched nerve from the fall. It hurts like crazy from scapula on down to hand. Been told by others nothing could be done that it just had to heal itself. I think I need a neurologist, but dont know. My daughter has my puppy because I cant pick her up without major pain  8 pounder. I just moved down to this area from MD about 2 years ago and dont know where else to go besides the Internist, and they have the system of you get whoever is available . you have no doctor of your own. Im so upset I dont know what to do. Im 73, live alone, and I just could cry. Im scared, want a doctor who can give me definite info. Im inclined to go back to MD to see the doctor I had up there. j The two doctors I saw did not pick up on the numbness in my fingers . to me that says nerve problem  advice?abby.

Over the last 7 years or so I have been tested for things like Lyme disease, HIV, heavy metals, auto-immune, etc, etc at other very reputable institutions as well. For years I simply had weakness with some atrophy in my left arm, but in the last year it has spread to the right arm/shoulders, and back and is more severe than ever. I have lost about 20 pounds of tissue  mostly muscle! Although doctors may change the label they put on my condition, they all say they have no clue what is causing it, so there is no treatment. Apparently there are no research studies either. All efforts appear to go towards ALS, which is admirable, but since I have only lower motor neuron involvement, seemingly with no upper motor neuron involvement, I am left to my own devices to deal with this situation and no help from the medical establishment.

I also have Gastroparesis, no surprise to me because that goes hand in hand with this, as well as, every single sign and symptom I have been experiencing since then. I will try to keep this brief. My history leading up to the Vagus Nerve Dysfunction was that I had Gastric Bypass surgery in 2003 and all my problems started after that. Since 2003 I have had nearly 23 both open and lap abdominal surgeries for gallbladder removal, ventral hernia repairs x 4, appendix, revision to my gastric bypass due to perforation at the anastomosis site, bowel obstructions/strictures, lysis of adhesions and the final straw was I had my gastric bypass reversed two years ago because I could not eat or drink and I had lost 65lbs. in 2 months, nearly died before my surgeon placed a g-tube then a j-tube for tube feedings. I never really tolerated the tube feedings either. My surgeon stated by the time I had my reversal done it took him 2 1/2 hours just to remove all the abdominal adhesions that I had before he could perform the surgery he was going to due. Of course, now I have a frozen abdomen, which basically means no surgeon will ever touch my abdomen again to perform surgery. Now, I feel like Ive been handed a life sentence because there isnt a cure and its all about symptom management.

Well thats a scary feeling. I was driving so slow that the people behind me was so mad but none of them passed me so l guess they might of sense something or they werent in a rush to get anywhere. So when l would stop l would start slowing down about maybe 2 cars were in front of me. So you know I had my foot on the brake a lot. Then l was going in the right direction and I got in the turn lane to go left well l was a little slow turning. Thank God no one was behind me.Then l was going to turn into the store parking lot but missed the turn so I had to go back around. I went to look for a Christmas tree and came out with nothing. They didnt have the size l wanted so back home again. Then my gas light came on, so I didnt know where the dial is that tells you if its full or empty. Thank goodness the gas station was near because the light came on and it said 37. I didnt know what that meant. So I get to the gas station and l thought okay I will just get my gas no problem. Did know were the gas tank lever was to open the tank. So here l am struggling to find it. Then Lord and behold there it was. So I put in my credit card to pay for the gas. And I thought once you put the card in you could pump the gas. Silly me you have to read the screen. I did and it said zip code. Well that seemed weird but anyway l put my zip code in. Now what? So I am waiting not going on. So I looked at the screen again so I said lets start over. So I put in my zip code and now I see where they said slide your credit card. N ok w you know you have to look and see if you put it in the right way. Thank God this one was asking to slide because I hate the chip. And thats way beyond this brain. So I thought ok I got this but I didnt know which pump to pickup. I think I said it right pump. I saw a red one as ND a yellow one. That was a crossword puzzle to figure out. So great l found the right one. I think it was the yellow one. I cant remember it was to confusing. So I pumped the gas and it stopped when it was full. Yeah!! So I got back I need the car to see if I see the needle to see if it said full. I didnt see the needle and I was wearing my glasses. So I said Lord let me get back home. I wanted to stop to get something to eat but I said no. I dont think I can handle the drive-thru. I havent done that for awhile. So I finally got home. I was so glad to see my house and three dogs. Its been along day. Is this what remembering what driving is all about? Well l have to start all over again because I have to get the car serviced. I told my adopted grandson driving for me is like getting my drivers permit. He laughed at me and said grandma it will be alright and if you need me to help you I will. Now hes 14 and going on 15 next month and hes driving ready to go get his drivers permit. So I guess we will both drive together except he remembers. So that was my big day and I had no accidents.

I just want my sister back...,"Hello all, I was hoping maybe I could find someone to possibly provide me with a possible diagnosis on what condition my sister may have and offer advice, remedy or at least treatment to whats shes been suffering for so long everyday for roughly 10 months already. Shes been seen by countless doctors and specialists like neurologist for example and even hospitalized. Shes had all the standard tests done to her like blood work, MRIs and basically anything else you can think of and we have no solutions to her ongoing problems. From all the doctors shes seen throughout this course of months, recently only one has said she spotted a rare symptom that not may people get. I dont remember what my sister said its called and she is not here with me at the moment. But basically she told me it consists of mucous that becomes trapped inside this part of the sinus cavity near an area close to the brain and stays lodged inside without being able to escape. And this the area filled with the mucous can become subject to infection and I think she explained it may have gotten to that point. But they gave her antibiotics for it and from what I noticed she seemed more upbeat in the following days. She explained if left untreated the symptoms can progress and cause other problems like seizures and even death. But even before this, she was diagnosed with having panic attacks, migraines and they even thought she was just losing her mind because it has gotten so bad and she had become so low that she has been wanting to commit suicide which breaks my heart because Ive never seen her like this and even then I have always seen her as a strong person and could never even imagine her saying something like this. Its like shes become a different person from all the hell shes suffered. They also tried to put her on psychiatric medications like very small doses of clonazepam and other medications I dont even know about (I think she mentioned at one point something like amitriptolene) but she couldnt tolerate the clonazepam at all and had to experience withdrawals from it even after only the first few times she took it. My mom said even her speech became slurred. Its been really all so horrible just to witness and cant even begin to understand what shes gone through. I only just pray for her because I do know God listens to us regardless of what we think. And honestly we dont know what to think anymore because of the multitude of healthcare professionals shes seen, that say it could be migraines and/or stress & anxiety, hormonal imbalances caused by giving birth to her first son, to the sinus/mucous infection problem. And my sister also did mention that tests showed that she did not have vertigo. Here is a list with some of the things she is currently describing feeling or what I see from her also. And from what I understand all these symptoms have been ongoing since starting with all this. Some days worse than others.  Cant do heavy movements like in running or lifting heavy weights etc. Says if she were to try she would feel worse.  Has lost weight due to changing diet to promote not upsetting her stomach area since she reported having to deal with Interstitial Cystitis and bloating symptoms that she thinks could be triggered by the migraines and dizziness she has.  Difficulty breathing and anxiety/trembling caused by overwhelmingness of her relentless migraines and dizziness  Migraines that we think may be triggering her dizziness but arent sure at the the same time  Facial numbness on her right side  Devoid of any emotion as if drained/exhausted and lifeless & hopeless. Lays in bed for a large part of the day.  Diffuculty speaking and only speaks in a quiet voice  I see her somewhat discolored (maybe yellow to whitish tinge?) or pale when she is at her worst moments but cant be sure for certain; only to think my eyes may be playing tricks on me.  Muscle spasms in her legs and face that seem to be like a quick jolt that seem to be more prevalent than anything at night when shes in bed trying to sleep. Happens when shes asleep she reports too. Could be one or more than a few she says just different on random days.  Pain and aches in neck and shoulders  Cant seem to tolerate loud noises or bright lights like on a tv or even reading.  Dizziness like someone is slowly & continuously rocking her from side to side and up and down simultaneously.  Balance problems when walking from the dizziness; has to move slowly And some treatments she utilizes for her spymptoms:  A wet cloth that was put in freezer that she sets on her forehead for the migraines and dizziness  Today she tried Ginger root tea while I was here with her and cashews which I read in many books and articles today that you shouldnt eat any type of nuts if you have migraines but one arcticle I found online reccomended it even, so Im confused if its really only one or the other even? Regardless she didnt report any adverse effects from them, so i couldnt say if they did anything  Also Ive advised her other meditative techniques to help cure migraine headaches and anxiety that were taught to me by a psychologist and had helped me, since I rarely get headaches if at all anymore when I began to practice these body/mind awareness techniques. I dont know if she does practice them even though she says she does try all the things I suggest to her. But I get the feeling she may not be willing, interested or have faith in these things and just says she does to make me happy. Hard to say or control that.  Today we tried applying a peppermint oil stick rub to her forehead. I saw it suggested online together with menthol which we didnt use but still like it said would help with inflammation and it actually did!! Shes been using it all day thank God and its been helping alleviate her pain!! But she says the dizziness is still present and wishes out of everything she could take that away the most and then the migraines would come after. The only thing she says she is on I believe is a probiotic and I forget if she said birth control or not. I will confirm this with her tommorrow when I see her as well as anything else she may be on. My mom has been taking care of my sister and her roughly one year and few month old very loveable, yet still very hyper baby boy in her and her husbands household. My moms been staying with her to provide meals, cleaning and helps care for my sisters son since my sister stays in bed for the most part of the day. My sister is even starting to think she could have MS or even Parkinsons. I hope someone out there would be so kind enough to suggest something or anything at all really. It hurts so much to see her in all this pain. Thank you to all of you who took the time to read this and I wish all of you who know some one or is someone who is suffering, all the absolute best and nothing but the best treatment you could ever want!

The big thing is I walk into walls and stuff, and I fall down very often, for seemingly no reason. I just topple over-any direction, anywhere. Im wondering if anyone else has these symptoms and if they went to a doctor about it, and what specialty it should be.

Acquire Savant Syndrome,"Hello all. My name is Jenifer Newburn. In July of last year, I suffered (another) traumatic brain injury while mountain climbing. The last week of October, I (yet again) hit my head. and approximately one week later, I had three grand mal seizures within a 30 minute period. Afterward, my cognition changed quite dramatically In addition to some cognitive decline (i.e. headaches, memory loss, and the normal post-concussive side effects), I experienced significant personality changes, as well as a creepy increase of computing power within my brain. Before the multiple injuries, I was fairly intelligent, but had basically what equated to a 9th grade education level. As my brain slowly began to rewire itself, I began to notice strange correlations between seemingly random bits of information, started quoting philosophers Ive never even heard I read previously, and even have understood physics, mathematics, and even engineering. Being the hypochondriac I had always been, I Googled traumatic brain injury + increased intelligence and found that there were only approximately 30-40 cases of acquired savant syndrome documented. I guess the reason I am posting on this board is to see if there are any Neurologists willing to possibly work with me on a pro bono basis. I say pro bono, because preceding the realization that I may have unlocked hidden potential within my brain, there were a lot of issues that lead me to an interesting, albeit frightening, path to enlightenment  whereby, I lost nearly EVERYTHING, including my sanity there for a brief moment. Slowly, I am piecing those remnants of my fractured life, just like my brain in slowly piecing itself back together, Humpty Dumpty style, fusing the hemispheres of my thoughts into what I hope will be something cohesive and beautiful. Its been a difficult journey, but it would be kind of nice to have a sounding board with a professional or few. Liked by loli, dolo Follow Report"

After 60 days in rehab and not much progress, we were told to bring him home towake up more. We really dont know what was meant by more, but it has now been 14 months and all he is receiving is a few hours each week of PT, OT and speech. In the beginning when he had PT, he was taking steps on the parallel bars with the assistance of three people. Then the vomiting started. This is the problem that I am seeking any information anyone can provide. Six months after the injury, he had a baclofen pump implanted. Approximately 3-4 months later, every time we put him in his standing frame, he would vomit. This would start anywhere after 5 minutes to 60 minutes. It varies daily. This is making his recovery very difficult. We dont know if the baclofen pump is the cause, if he is dizzy, if theres an inner ear problem, etc. He has had every test and scan possible, all show nothing.

My daughter had an examination by blood on 14.03.2016 and all types of autoimmune encephalitis (NMDA, AMPA1, AMPA2, CASPR2, LGI1, GABARB1/B2) are negative. She started to regress about a year ago. At first she had an average hipertonia, then she starded to loose her capabilities like holding and eating crisps, so we decided to go to neurologist. The doctor acknowledged, that there was something bad going on with our daughter. In hospital we have done EEG and MRI. EEG was fine, but MRI was not. In digest the myelination stopped at the age of 6 months. There are also some calcifications. We had a lot of blood examinations and CSF analysis too. It didnt exhibit anything besides high level of neopterin (134,7). They performed neural autoantibody testing. They didnt exhibit anything. My daughter doesnt have epileptic seizures. For now. Thank God. Physicians also want to take my daughters blood for DNA tests. They started to doubt if she really has autoimmune encephalitis. Or they suspect that there is something more than autoimmune encephalitis, some genetic disease. Yesterday I asked a physician why they did NMDA and other antibodies tests by serum, not by CSF and she said that this is better way. Very strange. BTW, keep in mind that all these tests (by serum) were negative. My daughter Liliana was diagnosed autoimmune encephalitis by neurotransmitter (neopterin with a value of 134,7), ANA, ANCA, MRI (myelination process stopped at the age of 6 months) and clinical picture. So is the diagnosis certain? Im not sure. Now we are back in starting point, like in november, but Liliana is 9 months older. What would it take to diagnose her? We need complex diagnosis, because definitely Liliana has some kind of neurological/genetic (with neurological symptoms) disease. Do you know approximate costs of that complex diagnosis? More less. I can translate medical summary/examinations results and post it here if someone is interested. Help, please. We dont know where to search for help. One more thing, should we think about transplanting stem cells for myelination purposes? How much does it costs? Where should we search for it? Follow Report"

In the early 2000s I was diagnosed with Depression and was placed on Ativan. After moving to a new location and getting a new psychiatrist, he started to wean me off of the Ativan. He didnt do it right and I went into a very bad withdrawal. I dropped that psychiatrist (had him fired) and ended up with my current female psychiatrist. Since then I have had two hospitalizations and have multiple drugs prescribed and changed to where I am no longer on any anti-depressants. I have suffered multiple serious side effects from taking and going off of these drugs. Sleeping is very difficult for me and I am taking Clonzepam 1mg along with 300mg of Trazadone for sleep. I am very restless sleeping and dont feel like I slept well when I wake up. I havent felt like myself for years now and my psychiatrist says I wont feel like I did when I was on Ativan. When I was on that for several years and had energy and the will to live life to the fullest. Now I think of dying every day (wont do that as I am afraid of dying) and just dont have the desire to do anything. I used to have pride in the way I looked and dressed and now I dont care. The drugs I was on made me gain weight so my clothes dont fit right and I havent had the desire to go shopping. My husband is now my caretaker in some respects as I have no desire to do anything. I have to force myself to get up from my chair everyday to just do the smallest of tasks. My feeling is that there isnt any medication or therapy that has helped me and I am about at the end of my rope. There isnt any true information that my Multiple Sclerosis is contributing to what is going on with me at least that is what my neurologist ang psychiatrist say. They just dont know. I have what they call Benign MS so I am not wheelchair bound. Is there any hope for me? I need help but I dont know what to do. Can anyone out there help me? Follow Report"

I would like to learn more about how the brain functions. In particular I want to learn more about what is going on with my brain after suffering traumatic brain injury and what if any connection there is to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I had to be med-evacuated from Vietnam to the USS Medical Ship the USS Hope due to excessive exposure to Agent Orange Herbicide and I wonder how it affects functions of the brain. So you might say I have 10 disabilities from the Vietnam war but three that might affect my brain. Last year I spent most of the year in bed. I could not think clearly, could not see well, I had lost almost all my memory, numerologists at the VA Hospital and Emery Medical Center say my severe chest pains are coming from my Traumatic Brain Injury as well as Migraine Headaches. I was in the VA Hospital in July 2015 for a week and they gave me some new medicine for my brain that seems to help. I am starting to recover some of my memory and function better. It most problem for me was as an Algebra and Science teacher I would try to work a problem on the board and could not remember how to it. I graduated from Georgia State University and made a 100 in the entire Algebra course and a 99 average on the subjects I was certified to teach. I taught Science, Algebra, Social Studies and Language Arts. I also obtained a Reading Endorsement added to my teaching certificate. I graduated 5/14/2000 and the president of the College of Education asked me to be interviewed by the Atlanta Journal Constitution and an article was written about me on the front page of the Sunday Edition of the paper. I had to overcome a complete nervous breakdown, becoming homeless and spending about 100 days in Pysho hospitals in Metro Atlanta including the VA Hospital. It is odd to be that I was basically emotionally destroyed from combat in the Vietnam war. I guess I was about as insane as you can get but when my wife took me to SSC to apply for disability one to the men said I tested the highest of anyone he had tested in 25 years. How can that be? About 10 years later I crashed again mentally and physically and was tested by the VA and they said I was functioning on a sixth grade level! These are the things I do not understand because they are totally inconsistent. About six years later Ii crashed again and this time I was almost in a coma not able to hardly think clearly at all. So I had lost my job as a District Manager in 1990 make about $90,000 a year to being crazy and going in the hospital constantly over the next 18 months. Once they put me in restraints where they but straps with buckles on your arms and legs after about 4-5 I got sick of being strapped down so I lay their thinking if Ii was Houdini I could figure out how to get out of the restraints. Well I thought about it for an hour and was able to get out. I had yelled saying I was cold until they put a blanket over me even thought it was about 70 degrees so they could not see how I go loose. Then the nurses came in speaking very disrespectfully to me and mean spirited saying if are a good boy for four hours we will let one arm or one leg loose every time you act good. So I said to the to hell with that and jumped out of the bed throwing the blanket off me. It sacred them so bad they almost killed each other trying to get out of the steel vault they had put me in. I just sit on my bed an laughed and they ran out the door and slammed the big steel door and locked it. Well needless to say they never had anyone that could figure out how to get out of the restraints so I guess I have a world record but I doubt if they put it in the World Book of Guinness. So after I had been in and out of the Summit Ridge Hospital (Part of the Gwinnett County Hospital System) about 18 months on Christmas morning they said you are out of medical benefits so you cannot stay here any more. I was rather shocked I did not realize they did that sort of thing and I was very emotionally disturbed from all the killing and mayhem going on all around me in Vietnam. They said we killed 30,000 enemy during the TET counteroffensive in I Corp. I heard they always lied and exaggerated everything but I can tell you they were a hell of a lot of dead people laying everywhere. If that dont drive you crazy I do not think you are human. Well I am still feeling very ill and frankly they said I would be dead in less than five years from getting auto immune hepatitis in Vietnam drinking nasty water and taking baths in filthy water in rivers. We did not know they had sprayed agent orange we saw them spray with a variety of aircraft but we thought if was to kill the mosquitos because they were so insistent on us taking a Malaria every day which was sickening a had really bad side effects especially the big booster pill we had to take on Monday. My Sargent would make us line up and he personally put the pill on your tongue and then thoroughly inspect your mouth to be sure you swallowed it and we had not water to drink and he had no mercy. So we all came home without getting Malaria in my platoon but we sure as hell came home with a multitude of other problem which I continue to very sick from and will probably die from so since I probably will no be needing my brain my longer so if you want it you can have it. Maybe you can learn something that help save another veterans life someday. Like I said in my first paragraph I do not know what to talk about so I just started typing and I hope I did ok to be accepted in the brain, emotional problems and of course I also have coronary heart disease from exposure to agent orange. I dont remember have many disabilities I have I think it is about ten. I recently had to go to federal court and thankfully my congressman represented me pro bono because he was an Iraq veterans and did two tours. So after 45 years they approved my appeal on my right knee that was badly injured and all my front teeth that got knocked out. Now I will just have to wait another 2-3 years if I am lucky to see what my disability rating on them are going to be and I have several more they turned down like being injured from the explosion so I cannot have children but they dont care about that I guess because there are plenty of illegal immigrants to make up for the children I should of had. It is hard to say since I have been married five times all good women except one and I must have been really bad crazy to marry her. I was very sick and she was hitting me but the police came out and arrested her and put her in jail. I sure hope I can maintain my thinking ability long enough learn something about what is going on with my brain and maybe a few other parts too. There just seem to be too many inconsistencies for an old country boy life me to figure out so I would be grateful if I could learn and understand how all the things have managed to go through the processes they have after my doctor saying my brain has badly shrunken and the frontal lobe is badly damaged and have a lot of dead brain cells. Maybe the old saying that we only use the brain capacity on a very limited basis. Now my life is winding down and I must be running on the last 25% or so of my brain cells still living. Heck I do not know that is why I am trying to join the group and learn something before the last 25% bite the dust on me. I am in terrible pain my liver is killing me so I am going to go lay down a while. John Ledford 5/06/2016 Follow Report"

It is hard to say since I have been married five times all good women except one and I must have been really bad crazy to marry her. I was very sick and she was hitting me but the police came out and arrested her and put her in jail. I sure hope I can maintain my thinking ability long enough learn something about what is going on with my brain and maybe a few other parts too. There just seem to be too many inconsistencies for an old country boy life me to figure out so I would be grateful if I could learn and understand how all the things have managed to go through the processes they have after my doctor saying my brain has badly shrunken and the frontal lobe is badly damaged and have a lot of dead brain cells. Maybe the old saying that we only use the brain capacity on a very limited basis. Now my life is winding down and I must be running on the last 25% or so of my brain cells still living. Heck I do not know that is why I am trying to join the group and learn something before the last 25% bite the dust on me.

I would like to learn more about how the brain functions. In particular I want to learn more about what is going on with my brain after suffering traumatic brain injury and what if any connection there is to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I had to be med-evacuated from Vietnam to the USS Medical Ship the USS Hope due to excessive exposure to Agent Orange Herbicide and I wonder how it affects functions of the brain. So you might say I have 10 disabilities from the Vietnam war but three that might affect my brain. Last year I spent most of the year in bed. I could not think clearly, could not see well, I had lost almost all my memory, numerologists at the VA Hospital and Emery Medical Center say my severe chest pains are coming from my Traumatic Brain Injury as well as Migraine Headaches. I was in the VA Hospital in July 2015 for a week and they gave me some new medicine for my brain that seems to help. I am starting to recover some of my memory and function better. It most problem for me was as an Algebra and Science teacher I would try to work a problem on the board and could not remember how to it. I graduated from Georgia State University and made a 100 in the entire Algebra course and a 99 average on the subjects I was certified to teach. I taught Science, Algebra, Social Studies and Language Arts. I also obtained a Reading Endorsement added to my teaching certificate. I graduated 5/14/2000 and the president of the College of Education asked me to be interviewed by the Atlanta Journal Constitution and an article was written about me on the front page of the Sunday Edition of the paper. I had to overcome a complete nervous breakdown, becoming homeless and spending about 100 days in Pysho hospitals in Metro Atlanta including the VA Hospital. It is odd to be that I was basically emotionally destroyed from combat in the Vietnam war. I guess I was about as insane as you can get but when my wife took me to SSC to apply for disability one to the men said I tested the highest of anyone he had tested in 25 years. How can that be? About 10 years later I crashed again mentally and physically and was tested by the VA and they said I was functioning on a sixth grade level! These are the things I do not understand because they are totally inconsistent. About six years later Ii crashed again and this time I was almost in a coma not able to hardly think clearly at all. So I had lost my job as a District Manager in 1990 make about $90,000 a year to being crazy and going in the hospital constantly over the next 18 months. Once they put me in restraints where they but straps with buckles on your arms and legs after about 4-5 I got sick of being strapped down so I lay their thinking if Ii was Houdini I could figure out how to get out of the restraints. Well I thought about it for an hour and was able to get out. I had yelled saying I was cold until they put a blanket over me even thought it was about 70 degrees so they could not see how I go loose. Then the nurses came in speaking very disrespectfully to me and mean spirited saying if are a good boy for four hours we will let one arm or one leg loose every time you act good. So I said to the to hell with that and jumped out of the bed throwing the blanket off me. It sacred them so bad they almost killed each other trying to get out of the steel vault they had put me in. I just sit on my bed an laughed and they ran out the door and slammed the big steel door and locked it. Well needless to say they never had anyone that could figure out how to get out of the restraints so I guess I have a world record but I doubt if they put it in the World Book of Guinness. So after I had been in and out of the Summit Ridge Hospital (Part of the Gwinnett County Hospital System) about 18 months on Christmas morning they said you are out of medical benefits so you cannot stay here any more. I was rather shocked I did not realize they did that sort of thing and I was very emotionally disturbed from all the killing and mayhem going on all around me in Vietnam. They said we killed 30,000 enemy during the TET counteroffensive in I Corp. I heard they always lied and exaggerated everything but I can tell you they were a hell of a lot of dead people laying everywhere. If that dont drive you crazy I do not think you are human. Well I am still feeling very ill and frankly they said I would be dead in less than five years from getting auto immune hepatitis in Vietnam drinking nasty water and taking baths in filthy water in rivers. We did not know they had sprayed agent orange we saw them spray with a variety of aircraft but we thought if was to kill the mosquitos because they were so insistent on us taking a Malaria every day which was sickening a had really bad side effects especially the big booster pill we had to take on Monday. My Sargent would make us line up and he personally put the pill on your tongue and then thoroughly inspect your mouth to be sure you swallowed it and we had not water to drink and he had no mercy. So we all came home without getting Malaria in my platoon but we sure as hell came home with a multitude of other problem which I continue to very sick from and will probably die from so since I probably will no be needing my brain my longer so if you want it you can have it. Maybe you can learn something that help save another veterans life someday. Like I said in my first paragraph I do not know what to talk about so I just started typing and I hope I did ok to be accepted in the brain, emotional problems and of course I also have coronary heart disease from exposure to agent orange. I dont remember have many disabilities I have I think it is about ten. I recently had to go to federal court and thankfully my congressman represented me pro bono because he was an Iraq veterans and did two tours.

I graduated from Georgia State University and made a 100 in the entire Algebra course and a 99 average on the subjects I was certified to teach. I taught Science, Algebra, Social Studies and Language Arts. I also obtained a Reading Endorsement added to my teaching certificate. I graduated 5/14/2000 and the president of the College of Education asked me to be interviewed by the Atlanta Journal Constitution and an article was written about me on the front page of the Sunday Edition of the paper. I had to overcome a complete nervous breakdown, becoming homeless and spending about 100 days in Pysho hospitals in Metro Atlanta including the VA Hospital. It is odd to be that I was basically emotionally destroyed from combat in the Vietnam war. I guess I was about as insane as you can get but when my wife took me to SSC to apply for disability one to the men said I tested the highest of anyone he had tested in 25 years. How can that be? About 10 years later I crashed again mentally and physically and was tested by the VA and they said I was functioning on a sixth grade level! These are the things I do not understand because they are totally inconsistent. About six years later Ii crashed again and this time I was almost in a coma not able to hardly think clearly at all. So I had lost my job as a District Manager in 1990 make about $90,000 a year to being crazy and going in the hospital constantly over the next 18 months. Once they put me in restraints where they but straps with buckles on your arms and legs after about 4-5 I got sick of being strapped down so I lay their thinking if Ii was Houdini I could figure out how to get out of the restraints. Well I thought about it for an hour and was able to get out. I had yelled saying I was cold until they put a blanket over me even thought it was about 70 degrees so they could not see how I go loose. Then the nurses came in speaking very disrespectfully to me and mean spirited saying if are a good boy for four hours we will let one arm or one leg loose every time you act good. So I said to the to hell with that and jumped out of the bed throwing the blanket off me. It sacred them so bad they almost killed each other trying to get out of the steel vault they had put me in. I just sit on my bed an laughed and they ran out the door and slammed the big steel door and locked it. Well needless to say they never had anyone that could figure out how to get out of the restraints so I guess I have a world record but I doubt if they put it in the World Book of Guinness. So after I had been in and out of the Summit Ridge Hospital (Part of the Gwinnett County Hospital System) about 18 months on Christmas morning they said you are out of medical benefits so you cannot stay here any more. I was rather shocked I did not realize they did that sort of thing and I was very emotionally disturbed from all the killing and mayhem going on all around me in Vietnam. They said we killed 30,000 enemy during the TET counteroffensive in I Corp. I heard they always lied and exaggerated everything but I can tell you they were a hell of a lot of dead people laying everywhere. If that dont drive you crazy I do not think you are human. Well I am still feeling very ill and frankly they said I would be dead in less than five years from getting auto immune hepatitis in Vietnam drinking nasty water and taking baths in filthy water in rivers. We did not know they had sprayed agent orange we saw them spray with a variety of aircraft but we thought if was to kill the mosquitos because they were so insistent on us taking a Malaria every day which was sickening a had really bad side effects especially the big booster pill we had to take on Monday. My Sargent would make us line up and he personally put the pill on your tongue and then thoroughly inspect your mouth to be sure you swallowed it and we had not water to drink and he had no mercy. So we all came home without getting Malaria in my platoon but we sure as hell came home with a multitude of other problem which I continue to very sick from and will probably die from so since I probably will no be needing my brain my longer so if you want it you can have it. Maybe you can learn something that help save another veterans life someday. Like I said in my first paragraph I do not know what to talk about so I just started typing and I hope I did ok to be accepted in the brain, emotional problems and of course I also have coronary heart disease from exposure to agent orange. I dont remember have many disabilities I have I think it is about ten. I recently had to go to federal court and thankfully my congressman represented me pro bono because he was an Iraq veterans and did two tours. So after 45 years they approved my appeal on my right knee that was badly injured and all my front teeth that got knocked out. Now I will just have to wait another 2-3 years if I am lucky to see what my disability rating on them are going to be and I have several more they turned down like being injured from the explosion so I cannot have children but they dont care about that I guess because there are plenty of illegal immigrants to make up for the children I should of had. It is hard to say since I have been married five times all good women except one and I must have been really bad crazy to marry her. I was very sick and she was hitting me but the police came out and arrested her and put her in jail. I sure hope I can maintain my thinking ability long enough learn something about what is going on with my brain and maybe a few other parts too. There just seem to be too many inconsistencies for an old country boy life me to figure out so I would be grateful if I could learn and understand how all the things have managed to go through the processes they have after my doctor saying my brain has badly shrunken and the frontal lobe is badly damaged and have a lot of dead brain cells. Maybe the old saying that we only use the brain capacity on a very limited basis. Now my life is winding down and I must be running on the last 25% or so of my brain cells still living. Heck I do not know that is why I am trying to join the group and learn something before the last 25% bite the dust on me. I am in terrible pain my liver is killing me so I am going to go lay down a while. John Ledford 5/06/2016 Follow Report"

Now I have learned that my beloved youngest son has been steadily declining after seizures which were treated but his other mysterious ailments such as skin rashes and other serious conditions could not be diagnosed. He finally found a doctor who was determined to diagnose my sons malady. I hear that my boy had a biopsy last week. Two of my seven living children know of my sons dire condition, but did not want confide in me about his losing ground till the other day saying that they are in fear of losing him but not allowing me to mourn with them that Brendan is in danger of death. He has I hear, finally that he has arranged his funeral He will be fifty seven days after his birth on April seventeenth. It is not about me but I am in agony knowing abruptly that he is so very ill. I will be 90 on this Sunday and a few days later my boy will be fifty years of age. I buried one son in 1996 and my beloved husband five months ago now facing that devastation of a second son dying. The news is devastating and life now has no meaning. Does anyone have a child with the same seizures and illness which has progressed to the point of death? Does anyone know why his new and competent doctor would order his biopsy? I called to just hear his voice today and his wife answered. She is a hard worker and never misses going to her job daily. She just sounded stoic and resigned but kept her feelings and his condition under wraps but fear the biopsy results were not good. I will only hear from someone lets me know that when Brendan is dying or already gone. Your input will let me understand why the first seizure is treated but the symptoms he has are so dire.

Side note, its not my gallbladder; that was removed in 2009)tingling, burning and other pain in hands, feet, face and other varied areasmy left leg drags easilyI have urinary continence issues as well as bowel instabilitymy normally damn near perfect memory has been slipping badly for the past year and have had a lot of concentration problems for the first time in my lifevision issues, primarily in my left eye, but sometimes in both.I have the dropsies and have trouble gripping a lot lately as well  there is more, but  thoughts? I am wondering how to approach my PCP doc with this theory. Would the neurologist doing MRI imagining of my entire cervical, thoracic and lumbar notice anything related to MS if he isnt specifically looking at the imaging for MS? Thoughts??? Follow Report"

After a few weeks, and it still hadnt stopped, it became more concerning to me. Especially when I started to experience other symptoms. I was becoming violently ill, often vomiting up all of my food. I was down to two,sometimes only one, meal a day. Since this started I have lost a significant amount of weight and continue to. My hands,arms,feet, and legs began going numb. I was constantly dizzy and often passing out. I have had a few episodes where my left eye would go dark, I could see out of my right but not the left. On September 4th 2013 my arms began hurting, with shooting pains in both arms. I was shaking and dizzy, so I went in to the ER. They did a CT scan and found that I had three small calcified spots, Meningiomas. I was told to visit a neurologist to check into these. I set up an appointment and long story short, they didnt appear to be harming me. The doctors dont think theyre the cause of my symptoms. I began taking a series of tests. They did blood tests and discovered that I have Rocky Mountain Spotted fever. I was given antibiotics, but the symptoms persisted so that doesnt seem to be the cause either. I have had an MRI to look for signs of Multiple Sclerosis. That came back fine with no signs of it, nor signs of anything else. I was tested for Lyme Disease and that came back negative. Ive had an EEG to see if I am having seizures, that too came back fine. My doctors seem to have run out of options and dont know what to do next.

This then evolved further with an episode of seizure-like activity- which has left him with L-side weakness, tremors in his hand, leg, and facial tics, all also left-sided. The headache continues, states the pain remains about a 6 all over, with the worst of the pain on the left side of his head. (This all came on over a 2-week period). Mild occasional memory loss continues. We have spent nearly 2 weeks in 2 different hospitals. (CT, MRI, Spinal, numerous blood tests etc) The docs have said since nothing has come back with any indications, that it has to be stress, and they want to send him to a psychologist. Ok, so I do know that stress does awful things to your body- (I am a nurse, I do see alot) but my gut says otherwise. There have been no outstanding events in my sons life, no changes in school, friends, and believe me we have quizzed any and all we could to find out- my son emphatically states that things are fine. He is frustrated as the headaches continue, making it tough to get back to school. I dont feel my son is depressed. Soanyone have any ideas or suggestions? I am pondering requesting an appt with Mayo if the symptoms dont improve- (yes, we did even agree to send him to therapy, even to rule out this avenue).

Here is Sarah Kucharskis Essay: Upon experiencing a gastric rupture on April 24, I was jolted out of the comfortable lull into which my family and myself had settled in terms of my health. Things had been quiet, perhaps too much so, and it is patently easy for one to forget the seriousness of ones medical condition when not actively in crisis. There are, however, daily reminders of my medical past. I have a tremendous bypass scar across my mid-section that traces my ribcage, an adjacent scar from my kidney removal, and four tiny scars from my laproscopic gallbladder removal. I lost the sensations of pain and temperature on my right side after a stroke in 2008, which also left me with nystagmus in my left eye. Theres the new 11-inch scar that splits my abdomen, which still itches and pulls each time I stand up. These statements are characterizations of my body, which increasingly seems to have a life of its own independent of my soul. My body does what it wants to, regardless of my intentions for it. It and I have spoken repeatedly about the matter, and while I believe its heart is in the right place (the doctors at least have never given me any reasons to doubt that), it just never can seem to getand keepits act together. Despite this rather extensive medical history and care from highly qualified doctors, I have remained undiagnosed for 31 years. The best we could get was something like fibromuscular dysplasia. Fibromuscular dysplasia is rare, and it took a trip to the Cleveland Clinic to finally learn that I have a rare version of this rare disease. It is a vascular disease that most commonly affects the renal arteries, and in its primary form a string of beads appearance characterizes the artery. The result is a reduction in blood flow that, depending on severity, can result in organ failure. There is no cure and no specific treatment only management of symptoms, which include high blood pressure, kidney failure, ringing and/or swooshing in the ears, vertigo, headache, transient ischemic attack, stroke, Horners syndrome, neck pain, and artery dissection. FMD in and of itself will not lead to death, though strokes, artery dissection, and organ failure very well can. The median age for FMD patients was last reported at 50. A median is not an average. It is a middle number, and well, its the middle number between 0 and 100. I could live to be annoyingly oldor not. Such diseases often prompt a lot of dwelling on the or not part of living. The simple fact of that matter, which is also something we tend to forget, is that any one of us has the opportunity to become or not at every moment of every day. We could slip in the shower. We could be in a car accident. We could choke on a pretzel. We are very fragile creatures overall. I have long had a pragmatic view of my condition and have tried my best to continue on with my adventures passionately and fearlessly. I have been blogging as The Afternoon Nap Society since January 2010 and recently created Facebook and Twitter accounts for TANS, which serves as repository for my ruminations from the prone position. I blog to have an outlet for the thoughts and emotions that arise from being a chronic patient. My hope is that by sharing my story I will empower other patients to be proactive about and engaged in their healthcare and to teach patients effective ways of managing relationships with their doctors and cargivers. My goal is to accomplish this by incorporating my own experiences, stories from other patients, and interviews with doctors about what characterizes a good patient into a book. I have committed to officially begin the process in January 2012, after I have finished my masters degree.

Here is Sarah Kucharskis Essay: Upon experiencing a gastric rupture on April 24, I was jolted out of the comfortable lull into which my family and myself had settled in terms of my health. Things had been quiet, perhaps too much so, and it is patently easy for one to forget the seriousness of ones medical condition when not actively in crisis. There are, however, daily reminders of my medical past. I have a tremendous bypass scar across my mid-section that traces my ribcage, an adjacent scar from my kidney removal, and four tiny scars from my laproscopic gallbladder removal. I lost the sensations of pain and temperature on my right side after a stroke in 2008, which also left me with nystagmus in my left eye. Theres the new 11-inch scar that splits my abdomen, which still itches and pulls each time I stand up. These statements are characterizations of my body, which increasingly seems to have a life of its own independent of my soul. My body does what it wants to, regardless of my intentions for it. It and I have spoken repeatedly about the matter, and while I believe its heart is in the right place (the doctors at least have never given me any reasons to doubt that), it just never can seem to getand keepits act together. Despite this rather extensive medical history and care from highly qualified doctors, I have remained undiagnosed for 31 years. The best we could get was something like fibromuscular dysplasia. Fibromuscular dysplasia is rare, and it took a trip to the Cleveland Clinic to finally learn that I have a rare version of this rare disease. It is a vascular disease that most commonly affects the renal arteries, and in its primary form a string of beads appearance characterizes the artery. The result is a reduction in blood flow that, depending on severity, can result in organ failure. There is no cure and no specific treatment only management of symptoms, which include high blood pressure, kidney failure, ringing and/or swooshing in the ears, vertigo, headache, transient ischemic attack, stroke, Horners syndrome, neck pain, and artery dissection. FMD in and of itself will not lead to death, though strokes, artery dissection, and organ failure very well can. The median age for FMD patients was last reported at 50. A median is not an average. It is a middle number, and well, its the middle number between 0 and 100. I could live to be annoyingly oldor not. Such diseases often prompt a lot of dwelling on the or not part of living.

Since her phycosis came back within 2 weeks of going off the medication they put her on Clozapine which is least likely to cause the movement disorder or worsen it. To date, her doctor has her on mega vitamin doses including Vitamin E, Gingko Biloba and Niacin as well as other vitamins, all of which have shown good results in some people in studies but not her. She eats a pretty clean diet and is vegetarian. Her neuropsychiatrist has her on Amantadine as well as Propranalol since she also has akathesia.

I am truly at my wits end and saw that Mayo treats migraines. If anyone has an experience they could share, that would be much appreciated. I take 100 mg of topiramate daily as a preventative, take maxalt when they hit. If that doesnt work, I have Demerol tablets to take. If that doesnt work, I have stadol nasal spray, these meds are used along with zofran or phenergan for nausea. I feel like I take washy too much medicine, but the headaches just keep on coming.

I will be anxious to see if anyone has any experiences to share. Thanks,  J Liked by Roxie43 Follow Report"

I just registered and this is my first post. About two years ago I started experiencing severe migraines and visual disturbances. I get zigzag patterns that obscure the center of my field of vision and they persist for about 5 minutes each. Thats how it started. Ive read that this is fairly common so I ignored it until I started to manifest other more serious symptoms. Vertigo, loss of sensation in lower extremities, limb weakness, difficulty breathing, mild muscle spasms, brain fog.

Just prior to that I also had a case of shingles, and I should mention that it was the second time within a year. I was told that it was extremely rare. I felt perpetually ill. I would sometimes feel as if the back of my throat was burning and the pain was excruciating. I did a full blood test and found nothing significant. I did a scope. I had GERD. But no H Pylori. I had a chest CT scan because of the chronic cough. Found nothing. I was also depressed, and most of the physicians I spoke to believe a lot of my symptoms were psychosomatic. I didnt go for a brain scan. My symptoms persisted for about 6 months before eventually subsiding. I wasnt on any medication, but I had started trying a variety of supplements and alternative therapies. I never found out what the real problem was. Its now been approximately two years since. For the most part I appear healthy. No changes in weight exceeding 3kg. No changes in appetite. But about three weeks ago I started having visual disturbances again. This time its a little different because the migraines are mostly absent. In addition to zigzag heatwaves, I would get these brief white flashes at the periphery of vision. These flashes are usually accompanied by a kind of dull pain that I cant quite describe. It makes me wince. Im concerned and am hoping somebody here is able to point me in the right direction.

Here is Martha Garretts Essay: Online social media has been my connection to people since being diagnosed with primary progressive multiple sclerosis and trigeminal neuralgia in 2003. Because of research and online discussion groups I was able to find out about microvascular decompression surgery for my trigeminal neuralgia and had successful surgery that stopped the pain in 2006. I have been amazed how many people are house bound or feeling alone and can reach out via the internet for knowledge and friendship. Being involved online via Twitter, Facebook and now Google+; plus blogging and posting videos has given me the ability to reach out from my sofa on the bad days and feel a purpose in my life even from home. Because of being home most of the time after working two jobs for decades I got involved with the tech community and podcasts. In 2009 I was invited to fly out to Dallas and be filmed for an episode of GeekBrief.TV (posting links at the bottom of my essay). I was also on the same trip invited to film a segment of CookingWithKat.TV. Because of the internet exposure I got from being on these video podcasts my followers on twitter increased. Which gives me more of a platform to reach out to people via social media. These connections are divine. As Im a people person who would be terribly depressed without engaging with others on a daily basis. As far as living with chronic illness goes, I would be without the knowledge I get from sharing with others who are dealing with similar circumstances. Trigeminal Neuralgia is also known as the suicide disease. My heart goes out to those who suffer with this most horrible of conditions. Again it is via connecting online that I am able to encourage people who are suffering or their caretakers. Most recently weve received the devastating news that our youngest son who is 33years old has early onset Parkinsons disease. Now Im beginning again via social media to reach out for help and understanding. Im so excited to hear about the Social Media Summit. There is no way that I could even consider attending due to my limited financial assets. Yet with the possibility of a scholarship this is within my reach. Again due to the enormous connections available because of the internet and social media. I would use my experiences of reaching out to others who suffer with chronic health conditions and/ or rare diagnosis via the internet. I would share how to best utilize social media as not only a platform for sharing but as an unlimited resource for information. There are so many things I would look forward to learning from the experts who gather together at this conference. Such as how to find the best sources of medical information online, where to find discussion boards that are moderated and give the most valuable information. I would also be thrilled to connect with others who find social media as powerful as I do. Liked by Laurel Kelly, AfternoonNapper, calilewis, davepeterson ... see all Follow Report"

My 33 year old husband presented abruptly with visual disturbances and delirium beginning on 1/3/12. The onset was rapid and dramatic, ocurrring in late afternoon. He had worked a normal day as a teacher, and picked up our 3 young kids after work. Symptoms struck on the ride home. I talked with those in contact with him throughout the day and they all reported he acted normally. Prior to these symptoms, he complained of difficulty sleeping and racing heart on 1/02/12; had strep throat dx 12/16/11; and had a root canal on 12/30/11. Beyond that, he has no remarkable med history and is otherwise healthy. Since admission to the hospital he has become more and more delirious, but has short episodes of lucidity  especially following periods of rest. He has become profoundly sleep deprived, as he only gets about 2-4 hrs a sleep a night. Delirium has been accompanied by agitation and repetative limb movements, and he has complained that he cant turn his mind off. He has become incontinent, and has difficulty eating and drinking while delirious. He has had three mild seizures, but has not experienced any more since beginning anticonvulsant medications. Tests for bacterial and viral meningitis have been negative. He has also been tested for Wilsons Disease, porphyria, heavy metal poisoning, HIV, and a host of other disorders. All have come back negative. EEG showed nothing remarkable, and CT and MRIs have been normal. The working diagnosis is encephalitis of unknown origin. The prevailing theory is that this is likely limbic encephalitis, but testing for protein markers and paraneoplastic markers in blood and CSF have not come back. He has a repeat lumbar puncture and MRI to check for changes (and I suspect to test for prion disease) tomorrow. His current treatment regime includes anticonvulsants, sedatives, IVIG, and OTCs for fever, reflux, and constipation. He did not respond well to the use of antipsychotics to help manage the delirium. IVIG has not provided any significant improvement. We are going on three weeks with little improvement in his condition, and while the doctors are working hard to determine the mechanisim of inflamation, they are beginning to grasp at straws.

I talked with those in contact with him throughout the day and they all reported he acted normally. Prior to these symptoms, he complained of difficulty sleeping and racing heart on 1/02/12; had strep throat dx 12/16/11; and had a root canal on 12/30/11. Beyond that, he has no remarkable med history and is otherwise healthy. Since admission to the hospital he has become more and more delirious, but has short episodes of lucidity  especially following periods of rest.

Here is Katherine Kraines essay: Sometimes you dont get to pick what shapes your life. My dads illness profoundly changed mine. I had just turned 13 when my father was diagnosed with ALS or Lou Gehrigs disease. My mother told me that the disease was rare and that my dad would gradually become paralyzed and die. To my adolescent mind this kind of thing happened to other people or other families, but not to my family. Shock, denial and desperate questions strike with blunt force when a family member faces serious illness. How? Why? This cant happen! But it was happening. As the oldest of two children, I felt responsible to help my mother care for my dad. Our whole family was reordered as my mother grappled with my fathers illness. He quickly lost muscle function and steadily lost the ability to speak. I spent the next four years helping my mother care for my fathers ever increasing needs to be fed, dressed, moved, rolled, toileted, and bathed as the disease unrelentingly stole his mobility and independence. It was a lonely time as a teenage caregiver. We lived in a small town and my fathers illness was well known. But my friends at school couldnt really understand what I faced and no teacher checked to see if I was doing OK. It looked like I was handling it well and I think people didnt want to interfere. Maybe they just didnt know how to help. When my mother had an emergency hospitalization, I needed to get home during school to help my father use the bathroom. I was too young to drive and had no access to a car. I felt desperate. I wanted to ask a teacher for help  but I was insecure and unsure. Who should I ask? What if they said no? In that instant I realized how important it was to have a trusted adult I could count on, someone outside my family who could help with an unexpected crisis. I also needed a community of other teens that were facing some of the same difficult and sometimes shocking realities and stresses of caring for a sick parent. My parents are my life heroes. My father faced his illness with incredible honesty and courage. My mother kept us together by providing unyielding support with moments of humor reinforced with hope. She instilled confidence and promised that we would get through this experience no matter how painful it was and that we would grow and be transformed by it. She more than fulfilled her promise. I have always loved medicine. But the care my father needed quelled my interest in nursing. Instead I write about medicine. Being a teenage caregiver made me grow up quickly. It forced me to grapple with suffering. But I also learned that life goes on and can be filled with happiness. My life is richer because of my parents courage and strength in the face of a traumatic illness. And I have learned to be carefully attuned for the pain that ekes out in the stories of others. We all have stories that have shaped us. Often we just need a safe place to share them. My social media experience includes using Facebook and YouTube. Twitter and blogging are areas I find intriguing but have no real experience with. The residency and summit would help me understand how to use social media more effectively both personally and as I write about medicine. I believe there is a real need for an online community for teenagers who are caring for a seriously ill parent or facing the death of family member. I havent found a good resource on the Internet that is designed for the unique needs of teens in these situations. The website could be a place where teenage caregivers can share their feelings and experiences or even blog. It could also be a social media portal to aid these teens in finding the positive relationships, resources and guidance to help them cope and grieve. This scholarship is an opportunity to learn from others and discover how to use social media to provide connection and information to those confronting difficult health care issues.

Here is Wendy Stations Essay: On a sunny April morning back in 1999, I sat down at my desk in our local municipal government offices for the very last time. I had been trying to shake a headache all morning. Finally, I told my co workers that I would have to go home. Thats the last thing I remember for the next four weeks. I do not recall driving home. I do not recall being miserable to my family over the next few days. And I do not recall my own husband taking me to our local hospitals emergency ward and telling them, something just isnt right about Wendy. I was diagnosed with Herpes Simplex Encephalitis (HSE), a progressive inflammation of the brain. I was whisked into treatment and my life was saved. Meanwhile my husband and our family doctor had very little success as they searched the library and the Internet to learn more about encephalitis. Once discharged after four weeks in hospital, our problems multiplied. At the age of 44, my parents would babysit me each day as my husband went to work, and our children went to school. On that first morning home, I was seeking a spoon to stir my coffee. I went searching through a pile of newspapers, asked the dog, and then checked in the freezer. As I was heading outdoors in the rain to search the backyard, my mother had to show me the drawer where the spoons were kept. This was just one piece of knowledge that I had to relearn. One of hundreds. Due to the impact of encephalitis, I am now legally disabled. I started a website in 2000 with the goal to reduce the endless searching for information for future families touched by encephalitis. I am co-founder and President of Encephalitis Global, Inc., a USA nonprofit organization. We are currently active on Facebook as well as YouTube. I do have a Twitter account, but seek to learn and understand more about using Twitter and blogging to the best benefit. Our interactive Inspire forum has over 1,200 members worldwide and exchanges more than 300 messages posted weekly, making us the most active encephalitis forum in the world. We welcome on average five new members, every week. The forum offers practical advice, links to professional medical information and words of simple unadulterated compassion. I have testified to Congress in Washington DC on the topic of the impact of mosquito-borne encephalitis. Encephalitis Global is included as a telephone contact for encephalitis information on the National Organization for Rare Disorders in the USA. I attended the first annual Encephalitis Symposium at the Johns Hopkins Encephalitis Center in March 2011 with my friend, organization co-founder and HSE survivor Ingrid Guerci of New York. More recently, I published an article titled A community lifts up a priest in need on the e-patients.net blog offered through The Society for Participatory Medicine. The social impact of encephalitis is alarming. Over the past decade, members of Encephalitis Global have joined us from so many walks of life: a fiance, heartbroken that the loved one to whom she is engaged really does not remember her or the promise that they shared; a man, furious with encephalitis and the fact that, now, his spouse is the familys sole breadwinner; school children who now face their education with increasing frustration as their peers move ahead and leave them behind; even a farmer, who can no longer return to his fields because of his impairments. One member describes Encephalitis Global as a community of understanding with which I can share my frustrations and ask my questions. Here I get real, honest responses from people who have compassion and yet have been there and done that with respect to this hideous illness. Theres nothing like connecting with someone who has survived encephalitis. Thomas Jefferson once said, Who then can so softly bind up the wound of another, as he who has felt the same wound himself? I strive daily to share information and support online.

Here is Kimberly Radomskis Essay: My Story My story begins in the year 1978. I woke up and could not get out of bed as I cannot move my legs or left arm. I am only 18 yrs old. I went to the hospital, was admitted for a week, but only to discharged by the hospital, with no diagnosis. A week goes by and Im getting worse, I have red raised nodules on the shins of my legs below my knees. They are warm to the touch and very painful. The doctors are baffled and again send me home with no diagnosis. After 2 weeks of horrific pain, Im finally carried in by my father and again admitted to hospital. The doctors tell my parents that they think there may be fluid in my ankles I will never walk again. But there was no fluid. I spent a week in the hospital only to have them discharge me with a diagnosis of Sarcoidosis or Erythema Nodosum. I spent 6 months in a wheelchair, was receiving steroid injections in my ankles and taking liquid painkillers just to be able to walk. Then, one day, it all just seemed to just vanish. Its now May in the year of 1995. I am giving birth to my second son by C-section. During this 3 day experience the only symptom that I had was severe tremors. The nurse said it was normal after a C-section. I didnt agree, as it was uncontrollable. Finally my husband and I left the Hospital and took our baby home. Two nights later I had to go back to the E.R. as I had a severe headache and my blood pressure was up. The doctors gave me a CT and a shot of Demerol, and sent me home. The next day, I literally woke up feeling like I only had a head in the bed!! I could not feel my body parts and I had no control of their movements. Today, I have learned that what I had experienced has a name and that is PROPRIOCEPTION At this point my speech started to slur. My husband drove me back to the hospital. By the time I entered the emergency room I had no vision, I was blind and paralyzed and I could not respond to any of the doctors commands. I simply did not know how to respond. After being admitted and many tests, and procedures, and having had Nitroglycerin put under my tongue every few hours, the only diagnosis that I received was that I had Post Partum Psychosis and that I needed to see a Psychiatrist. I remember a Neurologist checking my balance, and because I had a responding reflex, he said I was fine, yet I still could not see correctly. My vision finally did come back as tunnel and mirror like vision. I was discharged with 1mg of prescription Ativan 3x as it calmed the tremors. I did go to see a Psychiatrist and had a Neuropsychological evaluation. It was my Psychiatrist who said I had every symptom of Multiple Sclerosis and suggested that I see an MS specialist. So I made an appointment to see an MS specialist who finally diagnosed me with Multiple Sclerosis and he was also very upset as I brought in my past MRIs only for him to read as they all stated that I had MS on 4 different MRIs. In June of 2001, I was told I had a secondary disease diagnosis called Multiple Sclerosis. I had to go to speech and cognitive therapy for almost 3 years and I had to be detoxed from a medication that I was now addicted too. So with having Sarcoidosis and Erythema Nodosum and Optic Neuritis, and Lupus as well as Multiple Sclerosis along with other Autoimmune Related Diseases, I feel that my participation through the Social Media would be of great knowledge to the health care community, health costs, as well as educating doctors and nurses that there are a number of unnecessary tests, procedures and wrong diagnosis because the Professionals are unwilling to listen to the patient. One doctor wrote a letter to my Psychiatrist that he spent over an hour counseling me on my complaints. I would hope that I could help the Social Media to learn as my being, a patient and an example, as well as a testimonial to all of the above experiences, that no patient should ever have to go through any of the above mentioned. I now am a leader of a support group for Scleroderma and other Autoimmune Related Diseases Forum via; face book.

Here is Kimberly Radomskis Essay: My Story My story begins in the year 1978. I woke up and could not get out of bed as I cannot move my legs or left arm. I am only 18 yrs old. I went to the hospital, was admitted for a week, but only to discharged by the hospital, with no diagnosis. A week goes by and Im getting worse, I have red raised nodules on the shins of my legs below my knees. They are warm to the touch and very painful. The doctors are baffled and again send me home with no diagnosis. After 2 weeks of horrific pain, Im finally carried in by my father and again admitted to hospital. The doctors tell my parents that they think there may be fluid in my ankles I will never walk again. But there was no fluid. I spent a week in the hospital only to have them discharge me with a diagnosis of Sarcoidosis or Erythema Nodosum. I spent 6 months in a wheelchair, was receiving steroid injections in my ankles and taking liquid painkillers just to be able to walk. Then, one day, it all just seemed to just vanish. Its now May in the year of 1995. I am giving birth to my second son by C-section. During this 3 day experience the only symptom that I had was severe tremors. The nurse said it was normal after a C-section. I didnt agree, as it was uncontrollable. Finally my husband and I left the Hospital and took our baby home. Two nights later I had to go back to the E.R. as I had a severe headache and my blood pressure was up. The doctors gave me a CT and a shot of Demerol, and sent me home. The next day, I literally woke up feeling like I only had a head in the bed!! I could not feel my body parts and I had no control of their movements. Today, I have learned that what I had experienced has a name and that is PROPRIOCEPTION At this point my speech started to slur. My husband drove me back to the hospital. By the time I entered the emergency room I had no vision, I was blind and paralyzed and I could not respond to any of the doctors commands. I simply did not know how to respond. After being admitted and many tests, and procedures, and having had Nitroglycerin put under my tongue every few hours, the only diagnosis that I received was that I had Post Partum Psychosis and that I needed to see a Psychiatrist. I remember a Neurologist checking my balance, and because I had a responding reflex, he said I was fine, yet I still could not see correctly. My vision finally did come back as tunnel and mirror like vision. I was discharged with 1mg of prescription Ativan 3x as it calmed the tremors. I did go to see a Psychiatrist and had a Neuropsychological evaluation. It was my Psychiatrist who said I had every symptom of Multiple Sclerosis and suggested that I see an MS specialist. So I made an appointment to see an MS specialist who finally diagnosed me with Multiple Sclerosis and he was also very upset as I brought in my past MRIs only for him to read as they all stated that I had MS on 4 different MRIs. In June of 2001, I was told I had a secondary disease diagnosis called Multiple Sclerosis. I had to go to speech and cognitive therapy for almost 3 years and I had to be detoxed from a medication that I was now addicted too. So with having Sarcoidosis and Erythema Nodosum and Optic Neuritis, and Lupus as well as Multiple Sclerosis along with other Autoimmune Related Diseases, I feel that my participation through the Social Media would be of great knowledge to the health care community, health costs, as well as educating doctors and nurses that there are a number of unnecessary tests, procedures and wrong diagnosis because the Professionals are unwilling to listen to the patient. One doctor wrote a letter to my Psychiatrist that he spent over an hour counseling me on my complaints. I would hope that I could help the Social Media to learn as my being, a patient and an example, as well as a testimonial to all of the above experiences, that no patient should ever have to go through any of the above mentioned. I now am a leader of a support group for Scleroderma and other Autoimmune Related Diseases Forum via; face book.

A week goes by and Im getting worse, I have red raised nodules on the shins of my legs below my knees. They are warm to the touch and very painful. The doctors are baffled and again send me home with no diagnosis. After 2 weeks of horrific pain, Im finally carried in by my father and again admitted to hospital. The doctors tell my parents that they think there may be fluid in my ankles I will never walk again. But there was no fluid. I spent a week in the hospital only to have them discharge me with a diagnosis of Sarcoidosis or Erythema Nodosum. I spent 6 months in a wheelchair, was receiving steroid injections in my ankles and taking liquid painkillers just to be able to walk. Then, one day, it all just seemed to just vanish. Its now May in the year of 1995. I am giving birth to my second son by C-section. During this 3 day experience the only symptom that I had was severe tremors. The nurse said it was normal after a C-section. I didnt agree, as it was uncontrollable. Finally my husband and I left the Hospital and took our baby home. Two nights later I had to go back to the E.R. as I had a severe headache and my blood pressure was up. The doctors gave me a CT and a shot of Demerol, and sent me home. The next day, I literally woke up feeling like I only had a head in the bed!! I could not feel my body parts and I had no control of their movements. Today, I have learned that what I had experienced has a name and that is PROPRIOCEPTION At this point my speech started to slur. My husband drove me back to the hospital. By the time I entered the emergency room I had no vision, I was blind and paralyzed and I could not respond to any of the doctors commands. I simply did not know how to respond. After being admitted and many tests, and procedures, and having had Nitroglycerin put under my tongue every few hours, the only diagnosis that I received was that I had Post Partum Psychosis and that I needed to see a Psychiatrist. I remember a Neurologist checking my balance, and because I had a responding reflex, he said I was fine, yet I still could not see correctly. My vision finally did come back as tunnel and mirror like vision. I was discharged with 1mg of prescription Ativan 3x as it calmed the tremors. I did go to see a Psychiatrist and had a Neuropsychological evaluation. It was my Psychiatrist who said I had every symptom of Multiple Sclerosis and suggested that I see an MS specialist. So I made an appointment to see an MS specialist who finally diagnosed me with Multiple Sclerosis and he was also very upset as I brought in my past MRIs only for him to read as they all stated that I had MS on 4 different MRIs. In June of 2001, I was told I had a secondary disease diagnosis called Multiple Sclerosis. I had to go to speech and cognitive therapy for almost 3 years and I had to be detoxed from a medication that I was now addicted too. So with having Sarcoidosis and Erythema Nodosum and Optic Neuritis, and Lupus as well as Multiple Sclerosis along with other Autoimmune Related Diseases, I feel that my participation through the Social Media would be of great knowledge to the health care community, health costs, as well as educating doctors and nurses that there are a number of unnecessary tests, procedures and wrong diagnosis because the Professionals are unwilling to listen to the patient. One doctor wrote a letter to my Psychiatrist that he spent over an hour counseling me on my complaints. I would hope that I could help the Social Media to learn as my being, a patient and an example, as well as a testimonial to all of the above experiences, that no patient should ever have to go through any of the above mentioned. I now am a leader of a support group for Scleroderma and other Autoimmune Related Diseases Forum via; face book. I post the meetings each month on this site and research updates for people to read about. I am an advocate for AARDA.ORG and Lewy body dementia as well as a caregiver. What I really hope to learn from the Social Media is that together we can teach doctors and patients to work together as a team.

It was discovered after my gynecologist ordered blood work. During my first visit with my Neurosurgeon he said he saw something else on my MRI but would wait until my six month MRI before we would worry about it. He asked if I had ever had any other Scans of my brain and I told him that Id had a CAT Scan when they were checking to see if there were any signs of Cancer left from a tumor that had been removed from the base of my skull. I was able to show him the films on my IPad. He informed me that the spot was on the CAT Scan as well. Fast forward six months later. I go for my check up with the Endocrinologist and she asks why I didnt get my MRI done. I told her I did, but I forgot to ask them to send her the results along with my Neurosurgeon. So she called and asked them to send her the report. As shes reading the report in front of me her facial expression changes. Then she says to me has the Neurosurgeon received this yet. I said yes but my appointment isnt until the end of the month. She proceeds to tell me I have another tumor and it needs to come out. I was beside myself with worry because she didnt say where it was just that it was attached to my brain. I had decided to wait until my appointment since it was so close to Christmas. But later that day the Neurosurgeon office called saying they needed to change my appointment till the end of January. I asked her if there was any way to see him sooner because I just been told I had another tumor and I couldnt wait a month to see him Id be a wreck by then. She went in to check and just as she went in someone canceled for the next day. I get there and started getting nervous because I was in the exam room for almost an hour before he even came in. I saw his assistant and he said that the doctor was reading the MRIs and would be right with me. All sorts of things started going through my mind. He comes in the room and tells me that hes sorry it took so long but he wasnt able to load both disks at the same time in order to do a side by side comparison. That what he suspected at my last appointment was confirmed. He went on to explain to me exactly what a Meningioma was, that mine was small enough that all we needed to do was watch it for now. He also said that my medication was working because the Pituitary tumor had shrunk some since my last Scan. Fast forward three years, there has been no change in the tumor its not growing but its not shrinking either. So from a size standpoint both tumors are stable. From a lab standpoint there were some issues my growth hormones have been all over the place and they were concerned that the medication was no longer working. So I had other testing done. My growth hormones are where they should be. My question is Im having most of the symptoms that they told me to watch for. I also have a tumor on my Adrenal gland. I talked to another doctor and he said with all my other medical conditions if I was his patient he would be calling the Neurosurgeon and telling him the pituitary tumor needs to come out. Especially since I have the adrenal tumor. He believes that if the pituitary tumor is removed that some of my other issues will resolve themselves. I have also started to have issues with my heart. What Im wondering is do I seek a second opinion. I also have cysts in my liver and kidney which right now are very small. Liked by mrector Follow Report"

Im 64 and had the surgery on 7/3/18. The surgeon just knew it was cancer, but it turned out that Im in the 1% in which it was a mass of blood cells and not heritary. It was a walnut sized tumor and the surgeon, who I cant say enough good about, said he had never had a 9 hour surgery that took 2 units of blood. It was between my cerebellum and spinal column and he had to take at least 20% of my cerebellum to cauterize the blood vessels. I have full use of my left side, but my right side (I am right handed) is similar to a stroke. It is weak, but everything else is intact including the rest of my brain. It has slowly rerouted and I drive carefully locally (I live in Tampa) but I have a long way to go. I do go to the gym now and it is really good for me. So far I lost 20 of the 25 lbs I needed to, and everything is two handed which is good. I feel almost normal when I work out. My balance is better, and I walk almost straight now, but I put myself at 65-70%. Things are better, but the operative word is slowly. I used to use a walker, I couldnt go up stairs, things tasted hot and I was sorta dizzy all the time. Now its much better. The one thing that hasnt gotten much better is my ability to write with my right hand. It still tremors and I dont know whether to go left handed (this is typed with my left hand) or keep trying with my right hand. Is there anyone out there who had similar issues? Id love to talk. Its really hard to find someone in the US who has had the same thing Ive had, but I would like to meet someone whos had similar issues. Im ok and the surgeon says Ill live as long as before, but I accept my disability a lot better than my wife. Liked by mrector Follow Report"

I know that it is a very rare tumor. It is a grade 2 tumor similar to an acoustic neuroma, invading the hearing, swallowing and face nerves. My symptoms began 6 years ago at the age of 27 years old but was told by my doctors that it was just an ear hemorrhage and nothing could be done. At that time, I had an MRI that just showed a hemorrhage, I had really bad vertigo and moderate hearing loss in my right ear with chronic tinnitus. I was experiencing symptoms the next 6 years without any knowledge of it being a tumor until this June. I went to my Dr thinking I had another ear infection or suffering from what I thought was the flu again but my primary Dr told me he could see something in my ear and referred me to an ENT. I then had a CT Scan that showed a mass in my brain, after going to the ER in June with excruciating migraines, nausea, face spasms, vertigo and just a sick feeling like the flu. At this time, I had complete hearing loss with tinnitus in my right ear as well. I had a bone biopsy but the Dr had biopsied the wrong tissue, he also told me he had gotten the tumor. It was a 5 hour surgery, 6 weeks later in my follow up MRI I was advised that he had not gotten the tumor and he wanted to make it right this time. I was scheduled for a craniotomy in October but decided to get a second opinion with Mayo Clinic. Coming to Mayo Clinic was the best thing that could have happened to me. I was finally given a diagnosis and am scheduled for a craniotomy resection w/ stomach graft next month. I have full faith in my team of Doctors. With the faith in my doctors, as well as a therapist and psych, I feel that I am now ready for the surgery.

Even when ding research, it shows that meningiomas, RCC, and adenomas all can cause headaches. I even traveled to Northwestern in Chicago to be dismissed and rushed by a neurosurgeon there. I am tired, frustrated and in pain. My appointment is at Mayo in August. I am traveling by myself and I have 4 kids. I am scared I am spending all this money on travel and they will say the same, headaches are not a symptom of these tumors. Thanks for any advice.

I had and am still having lots of issues. Tens days post op they discovered I had hospital acquired menigitis. They took care of that with antibiotics. I also had DI that turned into SIADH. Im on a loose fluid restriction but my sodium bottoms out easily. I am extremely lethargic all the time. But the worse is short term memory loss and feeling like Im in a fog all day. Sometimes I cant remember things from one day to the next. I am an RN and am devastated. I was in perfect health till all this happened.

Eight month ago he was diagnosed with glioma grade II through MRI. (Back then he was nauseated and taken to ER.) He has been on anti-seizure since. It appears that the medication has the control, as he has no other symptoms other than occasional dizzy. he is able to drive and perform almost all regular activities without challenges. But doctors consider him a high risk patient, because of (1) his age and (2) glioma s size / location. A lot of homework was done, including communicating with neuro-sugions and neuro-oncologists (in Mayo and outside). Different opinions were given on the treatment plan. Mayo seems more aggressive and suggests resection, whereas another medical team in other (also quite prestigious) medical center strongly suggested biopsy followed by chemo+radiation because of the high risky level in operation. I wonder if there are any similar situations on the Connect. If yes, how was the risk taken into consideration prior to surgery? I have seen many discussions on treatment after resection, but couldnt find the risky operation itself. Are there any occasions that the patients were permanently impacted / paralyzed due to resection?The family has been debating over months long on taking resection or not Any inputs are greatly appreciated.

The second doctor says because it is relatively small and typical of a benign meningioma, that we should watch and wait, with repeated MRIs. His reasoning is at 62, the surgery is riskier than the symptoms and the likelihood of cancer. I have read some other entries in this group and apparently the watch and wait approach is common. I have to admit though it scares me a lot to leave something in there that they dont know 100% is non-cancerous, and frankly the symptoms are not fun.

Doctor said it was an ictus (cerebral stroke) , they made a lot of tests : blood, IRM, IRM with contrast, PET/TC, and some more. After 11 days they put me out and said that it wasnt an ICTUS, they were very sure it is a glioma and they suggested me to do a surgery to remove it. I have seen 5 Doctors since then, and even when my PET/TC is negative they said that a surgery is needed. Im very affraid, because diagnosis was so confused and tests dont give background for it. Even some of theme told me that they cant be 100% sure of a glioma but due of the image at the IRM they assume it. Right now, im Ok just headache and i think i can hold on.. All my functions are Ok: speak, hear, movements, view. The glioma is on my right temporal lobe and im left hand. For what I know i need another test to know if been left hand is not a problem due the glioma on the right side.Im affraid to do a surgery if Im Ok, affraid to take a wrong decissiom with the wrong doctor and I dont feel safe taking a huge decission like this with any support on my analysis..

He took a fall a week ago and hit his head, for which we promptly insisted he go to the ER to be checked out. While doing so, they discovered a 3.5 x 1.5 tumor in the occipital region of the brain, with 10-12 smaller spots on the brain. They knew he was a smoker, so decided to get a chest X-ray and sure enough, saw a region of the left lung with abnormalities. We transferred him from the small local hospital to the U of M for assessment, and were basically told to take him home to die. They set up hospice. That feels like giving up to us. So we are scheduled to visit Mayo on Monday morning, ever hopeful and trying to stay positive. We just couldnt throw in the towel on Gramps, but I am scared that Mayo will tell us the same thing, and then what will we do? Should we be hopeful, or are we just kidding ourselves. We dont want to put Gramps through biopsies, radiation, possible surgery and all of the fallout from that, if the end result is the same go home to die. But we dont want to not do something, if there is something to be done, that will give him more time with family and friends. He isnt ready to die yet he is ready to fight. We hope we have made the right choice in kicking Hospice to the curb, and scheduling that appointment at Mayo. I sure would appreciate any feedback that someone may wish to share. Gramps had his 83rd birthday yesterday. It wasnt a very Happy one, this time. Liked by Scott, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

My daughter is a Sophomore in College and was experiencing increasing severe migraines. Late June an MRI showed that she had a tumor in her right thalamus that was blocking one of her ventricles and caused a build up of cerebral fluid in her brain (hydrocephalus). 3 of her 4 ventricles were enlarged (4 times the normal size for her age). In July she had Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy to relieve the pressure. A catheter was inserted in her brain to create an alternate port for the fluid to circulate. This has helped significantly to relieve her of the migraines. Now she has a headache about once a week and they arent more than a 3 on a scale of 1-10 in severity. A follow-up MRI showed that the pressure was being reduced and her ventricles were shrinking some. Our local neurosurgeon shared that the next steps would be to biopsy the tumor although it seems benign since it is slow growing from MRI to MRI not much has changed. The next step would then be to remove the tumor. I got a 2nd opinion from a neurosurgeon at Duke and he agreed that we should biopsy the tumor first but said he would not remove it given that it is in the most inner part and center of her brain. My daughter wants to complete the semester at school so both agreed we could wait until her Winter break and we want to honor that but not at the expense of her getting worse. Last week, my daughter shared that she has been experiencing numbness. Her entire face has been going numb about 3 times a day and lasts for 30-60 sec each occurrence. She also has been experiencing where her right hand or foot goes numb. These are all new symptoms for her. Last Sat she came home and we repeated the MRI to see if the tumor moved or grew and it has not. The local neurosurgeon has asked us to continue to monitor the numbness and if it worsens or if she develops other symptoms, to call back in as we may need to accelerate the biopsy and the removal. We are concerned and wondering if we should move forward more quickly with the biopsy and if anyone has had a tumor removed from the right thalamus? We also are considering a 3rd opinion since both neurosurgeons has such different ideas about how we would ultimately handle the tumor all while not yet knowing the type of tumor via the biopsy.

I havent been on for awhile so Ill start with the good news. Had my first post cancer mammogram and it came back clear! Yay! Now for the yucky bit. Ive been on AI for almost a year now and have had minor aches and pains up till now. Lately my bones ache in the oddest places like midway from my knee to my ankle and my arm (the side I had lumpectomy on) feels like its gonna break. My neck gets sore in the back too. It feels like my head is too heavy for it. Sounds nuts I know but some days I have such fear also near the spot that the lumpectomy was done it is always sore and achy even just to touch the skin. Did anyone else suffer from AI like this? I mean Ive been on it for almost a year and its never gotten bad till now. Just concerned it may not be the AI causing these new aches and pains.

When asked for referrals to physical therapists, pain mgt. specialists and/or pain meds, the surgeon told her he didnt do referrals and told her that pain was something she would have to learn to live with. I was beyond shocked and disturbed at this. Following that visit, her arm & hand began swelling and a red horizontal swath from under arm above scar tissue and across to breast appeared. The 1st p.t. her pcp referred her to, ordered very tight compression sleeves for her arm & hand.

Who, ME? Certainly NOT ME! Well  YES, ME! DCIS  right breast. I found it because I insisted on a Diagnostic Mammogram  And it was found. It was not palpable; I had no pain; no discharge; no signs of anything  I just had a feeling, not a category found on the sheet you are going to fill out prior to an annual mammogram! But the category that doesnt exist (Feeling something is NOT right) allowed me to catch it at a very early stage. DCIS is the better type of breast cancer. If you MUST have breast cancer, well, this is the one to pick! OK .. This was meant to make you laugh!!! I had a lumpectomy in the right breast, with breast reconstruction (both breasts). Should have been pretty easy; however, it has been a very difficult road for me  Yes, everyone IS different! I had a hematoma in the left breast; another 3-hrs surgery 36 hours after the first (6-hrs) Lots of problems and pain  CT scan of the lungs  I requested the use of the latest tools and techniques during surgery and to discover my risk. I am in the higher range, as risk goes. The top margin was too close for comfort, and I had (have?) multiple cancerous sites. Count me among those who have a strong fear or radiation, and initially, I did not want to do anything but another surgery. Couldnt be done. No more tissue to take (according to the breast surgeon). I am categorized as a unique patient  I ask a lot of questions and want to plan things. GO FIGURE! Shouldnt we all have that right? I think so! BUT be ready to become the patient people address as  Oh, its you!  I choose to think of it as an endearing term! Yes! It is ME!! My medical Oncologist recommended I take one of three Aromatase Inhibitors  The pill you would take daily for 5 years, in order to kill your Estrogen and Progesterone  My cancer is 99+% receptive to both. By the way, that means I was feeding my type of cancer by taking HRT daily. Lovely news, but at least, I could do something  I stopped taking the pills immediately following the Mammogram  Just in case. And I was right to do so. But I refused the Aromatase Inhibitors; at least for now. I dont see the great advantage of taking those pills after having stopped the HRT. Also, the side effects are really pretty bad for most people! I will ask for tests to measure my hormones, later on. My Radiation Oncologist was very concerned because I was not at all prone to doing radiation therapy. I needed facts to make a decision. I didnt want to damage my lungs and heart. Well, we had a very good and lengthy meeting  He explained everything and I made the decision to have radiation. Difficult decision, in part due to the fact that my husbands first wife passed away from breast cancer. This has been VERY difficult for him! So  Today I go to get mapped and ready for the first session  Tomorrow, 12 Feb. I am truly dreading it!!! Stay healthy!

I was told it was a very slow progressing hormone receptor negative cancer that Id had for years. After lumpectomy, chemo, and radiation I had no evidence of cancer for almost 10 years. But was diagnosed again in January 2011 with stage 2 breast cancer in the other breast. This time a hormone receptor positive type. After surgery and remaining on Arimidex for 5 years, In Sept 2016, I was told the cancer had metastasized to my thoracic spine and two ribs. Im told this is connnected to my BRCA1 gene mutation and is the most agggressive breast cancer there is and all that could be offered is palliative care and hope for 3 more years avg. So more chemo which was much harder on me this time, and some radiation. I developed a lung toxicity in my left lung and ended up in the hospital, in and out out of ICU three times, for almost 3 weeks. I couldnt go home so Ive been in assisted living on oxygen full time since July. The left lung was too damaged to get it back to normal but I did surprise all the doctors by actually pulling out of the respiratory failure and making it more than a couple months. So were in the new year now, 2018, and Im still here in the assisted living. Doing pretty well except for the endless debilitating fatigue. Im on hospice and they do an excellent job with pain control and nausea so far. I count my blessings every day for the extra years I was given to see the youngest of my four kids graduate, get married and has 3 little ones now. Im sure Ive seen all my 18 grandchildren. Well, maybe theres another possible one in the future, my son and his wife are still discussing having one morelol And Ive seen 5 great grandchildren, Im sure there will be many more. Ive also been blessed with all of their love and support. Im just wondering if anyone else has stopped all treatments like I have. I did have one more radiation treatment in November and was sick from it for about 6 weeks. Ive decided its not worth being so sick when I could be having fun visits with children and grandchildren. The cancer is just taking its course now and it seems I can feel it slowly taking over. New bone pains, new aches, sleeping longer and longer, more growths or tumors I can feel under the skin. I just dont know what to expect, its kind of scary. Im not afraid of death, I just hope and pray the pain stays under control and I can go peacefully in my sleep. We dont always get what we want but I hope I do this time.Anyone else in my shoes? Liked by Scott, Volunteer Mentor, stoneypath, metalneck Follow Report"

I know ADH is not cancer and this is a breast cancer forum, but I can't find another forum that may be more relevant. I am wondering if there is anyone who is dealing with ADH or has been diagnosed with ADH that can share their experience. I was diagnosed a month ago. While I am relieved that I don't have cancer, I am confused with the radiology report that shows BI-RAD6  surgical removal is recommended. I have seen a breast oncology surgeon and I don't think she took me seriously because I don't have cancer. It almost feels like I wasted her time seeing her because I don't have cancer. If ADH is no big deal, why BI-RAD 6 (which i understand is for biopsy proven malignancy). I also read up about ADH online and understand that with ADH, my risk for breast cancer is 4x. Should I not worry about it and just do annual check? Should i see another breast surgeon? Should I see an oncologist? Do I need genetic testing to better understand my risk? I feel like an impostor for even posting this on a breast cancer forum but I am genuinely confused and concerned. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Follow Report"

Last year I had IDC in the other breast with one lymph node removed. I have asked for blood draws from other parts of the body, but I have been unsuccessful finding a place that will accommodate me. Neither my Drs office nor the two cancer centers that I have gone to provide this service. It surprises me that this is not routinely provided at cancer centers. The ones that I have gone to are respected companies, not second rate places. I would like to find a lab that can accommodate me. I see that there are a significant number of ladies that are in the same boat as me. I wonder if the cancer centers are only considering their expense and/or liability in providing this service. At one place I asked the Dr what they would do if I did not have arms and she told me I was carrying the issue too far. To me it is obvious that there is a need, not only in the breast cancer community, but in the health field as well, for this service. I feel that even though these cancer centers advertise how wonderful and up to date they are, they are not really interested in the welfare of the survivor as they advertise themselves to be. I would appreciate anyone elses thought on this issue. Follow Report"
