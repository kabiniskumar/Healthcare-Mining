Later that evening my hives got worse so i just went to the hospital to get it checked out but that was pointless and waste of money i was told the same thing and the doc had given me another steroid shot which i had told her didnt help earlier that day which is why i was there. I ended up never sleeping at night having hot/cold sweats taking alot of antihistamines that felt like forever. Did end up getting an appointment with an immulologist and skin test came out that i wasnt allergic to anything, and blood work was normal. Now iam taking 2 180mg tablets of Allegra,Montelukast SOD, Ranitidine all TWICE a day and if i skip or if im late on a dose i start getting the hives really bad. Iam going to see an Indocrinologist early next week also. I wish i could figure this out!!

It didnt bother me that much until On October 24, I started having this burning/heat sensation on the upper buttcrack part or i would say my tailbone area. That area would sweat so much and Ive observed the sweat occurs when I walk outside,run do any physical activity and also during urination. After Im done urinating, I would feel the sweat coming out of that tailbone area. Ever since october my sweat overall has become alot worse. My armpits would sweat even in the cold and that heat sensation Ive been feeling in my tailbone, i have also started feeling it in between my groin area. It would also sweat there when i walk. This between the groin area sweat started probably on Nov 24. These excessive sweating symptoms have made me so anxious and depressed. I cant even wear anything but black and white shirts and basketball shorts or people will notice the sweat has seeping in my clothes. Additionally, I think this may be related but at the beginning of the year probably late February. My testicle area on the left started feeling pain. Then one day, I peed myself while in class without even realizing it. Good thing no one else noticed and i quickly changed my pants. So I went to the doctors and said everything was fine. I think they x rayed the lower back area and found no issues. Then all hell wouldnt stop as the following months later I felt a small not growing lump on my neck which the doctor thinks is a lymph node. And now its November and during the 16th, I noticed two hard lumps on the back of my head but I think it might be because i had a bad cold but I have had it. Im visiting the doctors tomorrow to consult about my excessive sweat and if any of these may be related to it. I didnt even excessively sweat last year only this year when all of these happened. I dont know if I should see a neurologist,urologist,dermatologist or get a biopsy. What makes me so scared is what if this is lymphoma, a type of cancer, an infection or anything uncurable What if my excessive sweating on the tailbone and pretty much my body swear will never be cured. All these make me so scared. Makes me sad how all those people my age are enjoying life while I suffer these delibirating symptoms. Does anyone have any idea what this tailbone,groin and armpit sweat could possibly be? (I know its hyperhidrosis but could it be from another cause) Follow Report"

I've had it for a long time, and it flares up in episodes. I've recently had severe flare-ups, so it seems to be getting worse. I have clobetasol propionate cream which helps and takes about five days to two weeks to get it under control. The bumps look like blisters, but are solid inside  no fluid. They are pretty much only on my knuckles, on the back and sides of my fingers. My dermatologist thought it might be caused by soap, but I've tried all sorts of soaps and I'm no longer convinced soap is the culprit. I think it may be a symptom of something internal (viral?). I want to know what this stuff is, and if we can eradicate it. It is miserable, itches like poison oak. So far it has not spread to any other places but the backs of my hands, primarily the right one. My PA, based solely on the attached photographs and description (not an exam) thought it might be dishydrotic eczema, but I am getting referred back to another dermatologist (I requested a different one from the one I saw before). I want this gone. It is torturous. Added: When this subsides, the skin dries and peels off of where the blister-looking places were. Follow Report"

I assume that they are hives. The weird thing is that it only happens, well 95% of the time, the breakout starts in the evening. I know it's not from a bite or something because they are in different spots each night I have had an allergy test ..that was done a few years back and it came back negative. Not allergic to anything. I know that can change, but I just find it odd that this only happens at night. During the day, I am fine just anxious know what's to come after sundown. Another thing I noticed is that they are usually in straight lines.. not always, sometimes they are blotchy but a lot of the time they are in lines. I have taken benadryl every night for the past few nights didn't work. Tonight I got a little bit of relief but I can already feel my body getting itchy. Hydrocortisone creams do nothing. I think I just apply them for piece of mind. I called my primary's after hours answering service and spoke with my doc. I have an appt with her in the morning and she is going to do bloodwork and give me steroid shots, but I just wanted to see if anyone else has experienced anything like this before or know someone who has. They usually last for the night. When I can finally get myself to sleep at night.. in the morning i am fine. They dont leave any markings or anything. They are just red and raised and extremely itchy. Any input will help. Thanks in advance. Follow Report"

The rash coincides with the purchase of a new polyurethane mattress. However, I have since moved to another room and it persists so it could be coincidence. It started on my temples as little bumps that had an INTENSE ITCH and then they slowly progressed over a couple months down the back of my head, then neck, upper, back, then low back and around to my stomach with a few small outbreaks on my elbows. I was superscribed prednisone which was a god send. It stopped the itching completely and the bumps almost completely disappeared. Until I ran the course, and it all came back with a vengeance! The itching is awful! I can't sleep. No antihistamines work, no over the counter creams work. It's only been about three months since this all started and I can't imagine living like this for years!

He was diagnosed with dermatitis, but nothing seems to get rid of it. He also has several lung nodules. Ive done research on my own and saw a case where a man had lung nodules and once they were removed the rash went away. I also wonder if its related to the nerve block he had in his leg and the rash starting right after that.

For maybe the past month or so, I've noticed suddenly having extremely flaky dry skin on my feet (particularly the right side of my body, if that's even possible). It's honestly been on the low end of my priority list due to a plethora of other more debilitating health issues. Then several days ago, I noticed a ""patch"" of rough, red and irrirtated looking skin on each hand just slightly above the carpus. Doesn't hurt, doesn't itch, just obviously doesn't seem healthy. Fed up, with both my feet and now this odd hand thing, I went and got a pedicure and a paraffin dip for my hands. Everything looked great for about 2-3 hours! Now suddenly those ""patches"" on my hands are dry and rough again. I'm baffled, I'm fed up with weird mysterious health issues that no one can diagnose/link together, and exasperated with all the special ""health tips"" being prescribed by the various specialists that  if I could somehow manage to maintain them all  would get my body to the normal person level. Making an appointment with a new dermatologist is on my to-do list, for many reasons, but anyone have any thoughts on what this could be, and/or suggestions for potential treatment? I was diagnosed with Keratosis pilaris atrophy as a baby, and still have the Keratosis pilaris-looking bumps on my upper arms. A million other health issues at the moment. A1C is normal though. Receiving treatment for B12 and D deficiencies. Super dry mouth and eyes, currently lips as well, but ANA panel and SS-A and SS-B antibodies negative.

I want some kind of record since I am (hopefully and presumably) not the only one affect in this manner. I have had a nickel allergy all of my life. I first discovered it in my early childhood by wearing blue jeans where the back of the button would leave a rash on my lower stomach. Through the years, I have learned to stay away from nickel and other metalsexcept that I play guitar. My love for the guitar and my nickel allergy have always been foes. I would practice and play until I would begin to get a rash. Oddly, the rash would change where it occurred almost monthly. Early on, it would appear on my inner thighs. In my mid-teens it would show up on my fingers; in-betweeneczema-like. From then on, it mostly would irritate my fingers, but sometimes on my upper-right leg (like at the bottom of my right butt cheek). It has also caused boils on the bottom of my feet, although they seem to contain water and dont itch a ton. Over the years my conditions seem to slightly get better, but it has always been unpredictablesometimes after playing for a couple of days a lot, I have not been too bad, and sometimes after playing for 10 minutes, I would really get a rash badly. I have tried strings made of gold and another type made of stainless steel. The gold strings did indeed minimize the effects of the allergy, but severely degraded the playability and toneAND the cost was significantly higher making it not feasible to continue to use them on a regular basis. Stainless steel strings were heavy, didnt sound as good, and still produced symptoms, possibly in part to the materials in the actual guitar (frets, pickups, etc.) and not the strings themselves. So I was dining with my family and I ordered an Asian dish. I had really crazy spices in itsomething I had not tasted beforeand for the next three days, I had a rash that pretty much was all over my body (but concentrated in my midsection). That is the last time I remember having a nickel allergy. I usually play guitar for a couple hours a week  10 minutes here and there, take a couple days off, play for 1/2 hour, dont play for a day or two I had a makeshift schedule in my head that until now I hadnt even thought about. This allowed my to limit my exposure to nickel. That bring us to today. I bought a new guitar (Paul Reed Smith if you must know lol!) and have been playing it like crazy. I noticed the lack of rash. I noticed the explicit absence of any reaction whatsoever. Whats the deal? I dont know what to think. I am ecstatic, but at the same time a little reluctant to think its totally cured. I have played for a minimum of 45 minutes per day since I first discovered the lack of reaction. So in the last few weeks, I have probably played more than I had played in the last six months or more. Does anyone have any idea why this would happen all of the sudden? I am cautiously optimistic and am hoping and praying my allergy is finally cured. Thanks in advance for any insight. Follow Report"

If these things dont improve by tomorrow, Ill have to go to one of those walk-in medical centers .. it will probably take Prednisone. Ye gads .. these things are making me nuts! Abby Follow Report"

I am a 60 y/o white male, I [...]","Greetings to all here. I am a 60 y/o white male, I have a skin issue that was diagnosed as psoriasis about three months ago. I had red spots show up on my arms and legs. The spots were fairly smooth, not itchy and from 5mm to 10mm in size. I had four or five on each arm below the elbow and the same on each leg below the knee. Dark red at first but fading and disappearing, after about five weeks with the application of the prescribed steroid ointment. A new wrinkle, Prior to these spots showing on my arms and legs I had a itchy welt appear on my lower left forearm near the elbow. I thought it may have been a mosquito bite and I did not mention it to the physician. Now about a month ago this itchy welt makes another appearance very near the site of the first. Being acutely aware, I immediately apply the steroid to the welt. The next day the welt is gone but three red spots show up on the upper forearm. Yesterday the itchy welt makes its third showing, again I quickly apply the steroid to it. This morning I have a new red spot on the outside of my left ankle. I do not think the itchy welt is a mosquito bite. I dont know if the itchy welt is related to the red spots, but it sure seems coincidental. Have any of you all ever known of such a malady? About a three month wait to see a dermatologist around here. Would it be worthwhile to have the itchy welt tested while it is visible or have the red spots cultured? Follow Report"

Its usually burning and/or uncomfortable feeling when I am sitting down on couch or chair. the burning sensation like I said on pressure points of the elbows, legs, or butt when sitting even if only 2 mins or so and seems like I cant remain still.upon getting up and moving around it relieves the sensation. Went to neurologist 4 years ago.he confirmed that it was Restless leg syndromethere are different types of RLS but the classic symptoms are a feeling of burning, tingling, and a general sense of unable to relax when quietly sitting or even laying down and relief comes when changing position and/or getting up. Diagnosis is by symptoms.there is not a definitive diagnostic testall bloodwork etc. is normal . I now take Gabapentin, and Klonopin to calm the restless nerves..there is no cure for this ( my Neurologist says )..Its just something you have to learn to live with and take those medications for it.It is believed there is a link between low iron (which I had) and and RLS . Now I take more iron (but that does not alleivate the symptoms so far . ( even when iron level becomes normal ) . I was diagnosed with low thyroid 5 years ago and started taking the levothyroxine to put my thyroid back to normal which it IS NOW. But even though I still have the RLS..there is a possiblity that I had LOW thyroid for years before I was diagnosed with it..hence I think (my theory) the RLS evolved due to the years of LOW thyroid. This is just my thinking on this. No Dr. Told me of that..anyways I hope maybe this helps others and they can begin to pinpoint their symptoms and get a diagnoses. I would love to know others with RLS and how they have dealt with it over the years. It seems to be a tricky act to balance the medications with side effects and still manage the RLS..appreciate any feedback. Thanks Jim B. Liked by Mamacita, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

New to this great forum and hoping someone here can help me. Im a 38 year old guy, 64, 178 pounds. Ive been having incessant early morning insomnia for months, and am struggling to pinpoint the cause. I should clarify what I mean by early morning: Im a night owl, and have gone to bed at around 2:30 AM for at least the last twenty years. (There was a period of a couple years when I was working on Asian time and had to go to bed even later (4:30 to 5:00 AM), but Im back to my druthers of 2:30 AM.) My body seems to function best on about 7.5 hours of sleep, so if my circadian rhythms are in tune, I go to bed around 2:30 AM and wake up around 10 AM with a song in my heart and hope for the day, but I can function reasonably well on about 6.5-7 hours of sleep *provided that I wake up around 10*. (Waking up at my normal time seems to be more important than going to sleep at my normal time.) But since last summer, Ive been waking up around 8 AM every morning, and with a BANG  not gradual, groggy wakeups, but with a surge of energy and a pounding heart that casts me impossibly out of sleep in an instant. My initial self-diagnosis was that this was some consequence of overcardio and undernutrition. For most of my late 20s and early 30s I was pretty fit, doing HIIT cardio sessions for about 90 minutes a day, 4-5 days a week, and everything was dandy. Work and marriage kept me couchbound for my mid-30s, however, and I grew chubby, sulky, and TIRED  like the less I moved, the more worn out and depressed I got  and I couldnt live with the person I was becoming. For New Years 2019 I resolved to get back into shape, so I resumed the HIIT and radically cleaned up my diet: no sugar, no caffeine, and no flour or refined grain. (Im also a vegan of 15 years and a teetotaler whos never had alcohol more than once or twice a year at any age.) Anyway, I felt GREAT, and unfortunately started to overcook the training, letting my normal 90 minute sessions spiral outward into 180 and even 240 minute grindfests. I was obsessed with reclaiming a six pack, and underate, underhydrated, and overtrained, ignoring all the warning signs of system collapse. I stopped losing weight, even though I was eating less and working out more, and a few DexaScans revealed that I was putting on body fat in general and visceral fat in particular month after month despite a total lack of sugar intake and a mammoth calorie deficit. I also had what Id call permanent dude PMS, getting irritated by seemingly everything and taking all sorts of trivial slights deeply to heart, and I was fantasizing about food, especially junk food, every night. Sometime in the summer of 2019 I started to have the sleep disturbances, but they were intermittent at first: some mornings Id wake up at 8 and struggle, but I often could get back to sleep, and even when I couldnt, Id be fine the next night. Then, in September, my beloved cat, who Id had for a decade and was the last pet of mine from my bachelor days, was suddenly diagnosed with malignant lymphoma and given six weeks to live. From that day on, I was up at 8 AM every day, no matter what, and couldnt get back to sleep under my own power no matter what I tried. Since then nothing has changed. If I go to bed at my normal time, Im up at 8 AM with what feels like an adrenaline rush, and if I go to bed earlier I wake up earlier and *still* have the 8 AM adrenaline rush (or whatever it is) when Im out and about in my morning routine. The morning wake up is so jarring that sleep vanishes completely, and the idea of just breathing and going back to bed is laughable. The insomnia feelings dont kick in for several hours, but then inevitably hit me like a truck. I tried doxepin for several months and it did help me sleep. Id still wake up at 8 AM with the same horrible energy burst, but the doxepin would overpower it and drag me back down till my normal 10 AM wake up. Unfortunately the doxepin stopped working, but it was obviously treating the symptoms, not the cause, so it was always going to be a band aid and I kinda knew its day would come. Two other notes: * My testosterone is much lower than it used to be. In 2018 (before the overtraining) it was 493 ng/Dl, now its 290. My sex drive/libido is basically zero  the machinery still works, but I never want to turn it on. This has been the case since last summer  about when the insomnia started to creep in  and has not improved in any way. Id love to get my testosterone back, and feel like the insomnia must be related somehow, but I can live without it if need be. The insomnia is a much more pressing issue. * Ive tried a lot of the holistic supplements (Seriphos, holy basil, kava, ashwaghanda), thinking that I was suffering from high cortisol, but none of these has worked, and if anything theyve each had the OPPOSITE effect: they seem to give me heart palpitations and some physical unrest/agitation. Seriphos is particularly rough: if I take it before bed, as most naturopaths suggest, I wake up about three hours later and cant fall back asleep for love or money. Kava used to be one of my favorite relaxants, and now it makes me feel like Im one step closer to a heart attack  tight chest and shortness of breath. (Not nearly extreme enough to require a doctor, of course, but still bad.) My endocrinologist at Kaiser wont run any tests on me beyond a catchall blood panel because my testosterone is still in the normal range, no matter how crazy the loss of libido is, and my TSH level is normal so any thyroid-related insomnia is impossible, a statement which seems flatly contradicted by a lot of the medical literature Ive looked into. I need a better doctor and a place to start  can anyone help? At this point Im ready to bestow half my kingdom  which amounts to a used car, a couch, and a medium sized TV, but hey   on anyone who can save me from this. Follow Report"

PLEASE!,"OK, I admit, @johnbishop has both intrigued and freaked me out with the statistics that I am now able to see. Looking at the chart above, I see 1.79 for Flow Limitation. I had to look that term up and found that <30% is cause for concern. Flow limitation for those who don't know: ""occurs when increased esophageal pressure is not accompanied by a flow increase.  Its main characteristic is a flattening of the inspiratory flow shape which can be measured noninvasively by nasal prongs at diagnosis or by a pneumotachograph during continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration."" This explanation, the least technical one I was able to find , courtesy of a Google search blurb from Science Direct website which is of the .com variety. I was unable to add a linkthe system said no. Articles from other medical websites were very technical and used terms and figures that made my eyes glaze over and my head spin. Judging from the pie chart in the diagram above, assuming it includes my entire night of sleep, my FL was definitely in excess of 30%, but I'm not sure if I am interpreting the chart correctly. Plus, what does the 1.79 number indicate? It's not the percentage. Additional data showed that I had 12 FL events last night, and each had a number in parenthesis next to it 11 (6) and 1 (8). I tried to figure the percentage on my own and I'm lost, totally lost. I apologize, it may seem as if I am obsessing over unnecessary details, but having researched some new terms and learned that these events can cause memory loss and other bad stuff it makes sense to me that I do what I can to reduce these events. Why are we just told to focus on AHI if it is not the whole story? More details should be provided to Apnea sufferers and in layman's terms for crying out loud. Previously, I had a sleep specialist doc who always said I was just fine, and my PC doc may not be familiar with all this. Nonetheless, I will march in his office on Tuesday (I do have an appt) and present it to him as a challenge. I honestly do not expect to find a sleep scientist or interpreter of scientific data on Connect who can help, but I am asking. PLEASE HELP IF YOU ARE ABLE!!

Apparently it is used as an anti-psychotic in high doses, however in low doses it can be used as a sleep aid because of its anti-histamine properties (that are found in allergy pills for example that make you sleepy). Fast forward to this past June, and I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Congestive Heart Failure, the idiopathic cardiomyopathy kind, idiopathic meaning the doctors dont know how or why I now have this. It came on VERY suddenly. I was hospitalized for a week, all of the usual tests, and I was free of any clots or blockages. My ejection fraction was 20-25%. Trying to find a cause: A virus? I havent been sick in a long time, not even a cold. I have never smoked or used illicit drugs; I have maybe a dozen alcoholic drinks per year, and there is no history of heart failure in my family. So they went through all of my current meds to see if there was a cause. I have been on Seroquel (100mg), Clonazepam as needed, Wellbutrin, and Citalopram (20mg) for years. After the doctors did some quick research, the Cardiologist took me off the Seroquel immediately, saying heart failure was a possible side effect, however extremely small the chance might be. My psychiatrist has since told me its not the Seroquel. Its a long shot, but has anyone been told their Seroquel use led to heart failure? Thank you for any help.

Apparently it is used as an anti-psychotic in high doses, however in low doses it can be used as a sleep aid because of its anti-histamine properties (that are found in allergy pills for example that make you sleepy). Fast forward to this past June, and I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Congestive Heart Failure, the idiopathic cardiomyopathy kind, idiopathic meaning the doctors dont know how or why I now have this. It came on VERY suddenly. I was hospitalized for a week, all of the usual tests, and I was free of any clots or blockages. My ejection fraction was 20-25%. Trying to find a cause: A virus? I havent been sick in a long time, not even a cold. I have never smoked or used illicit drugs; I have maybe a dozen alcoholic drinks per year, and there is no history of heart failure in my family. So they went through all of my current meds to see if there was a cause. I have been on Seroquel (100mg), Clonazepam as needed, Wellbutrin, and Citalopram (20mg) for years. After the doctors did some quick research, the Cardiologist took me off the Seroquel immediately, saying heart failure was a possible side effect, however extremely small the chance might be. My psychiatrist has since told me its not the Seroquel. Its a long shot, but has anyone been told their Seroquel use led to heart failure? Thank you for any help.

I ended up trying the Ketamine Infusions and they worked for getting rid of my depression. Im still dealing with anxiety and some really bad memory issues. I cant remember a lot of things that happened in the past and I am having trouble with remembering new things. Sometimes I am OK with making new memories, other times I cant recall a damn thing. My doctor is telling me that its the anxiety and the insomnia that is causing the problem with my memory. Before the Ketamine treatments, it was depression and anxiety that were causing my memory problems.Im scared that its the medication I was on for so long or the ECTs I underwent at the suggestions of my old doctor. She had me over medicated so I wonder if that could be some of the problems too. I have this fear that it is early onset dementia.Im also dealing with being separated from my wife and daughter right now. My wife pretty much gave up on me due to the depression and asked me to move out two months ago. Now that it is gone, she is angry about my memory issues and wants me to come up with a plan to fix everything that has gone wrong in our marriage. I tried sitting down with her last night with a pen and paper so I could get a list of things she felt needed to be fixed and she wouldnt go over it again with me. I am pretty sure we are done at this point which is adding a lot of stress to my life. She has some issues too but doesnt believe she does so they have gone untreated. Her issues have caused a huge rift in the family over the years and made my depression worse. I have always been a fixer so I keep trying to fix the marriage. I think at this point, it might be better if I stop trying.My daughter asked me to take her to a therapist last night because of what she is going through right now and how she is feeling. I will be calling her doctor and getting that set up today. Something else for me to worry about right now and I am really scared for her. Thanks for listening.

I was taking adderall last because it worked for me but asked for an extended release so it would work all day and not just until work was over because I am wanting to be awake and alert for my kids when I get home.

I was having trouble with the mask and went back after my doctor gave me a prescription for another mask. I was given another type of mask that left me with extreme dental pain on the first nights sleep with it. That was the end of that. The questions asked while at this appointment left me questioning if I was wearing the original mask correctly. I adjusted the original mask and have been fine with it ever since. While at the appointment the man giving me the new mask gave me a lot of advice that was helpful but he told me I should not be submerging the entire tube due to the electrical end component. I wish the first woman who I originally got my equipment from had told me that. I know there are machines that you can put your equipment in for cleaning. They are rather expensive. Are they the way to go? How does everyone keep their equipment clean? How often do you clean your equipment? Getting on a CPAP has make a huge difference. My husband and I laugh almost nightly at how I look with it on but I dont care!!! He needs one too! Working on that! It may be my Christmas gift request that he get tested. TIA for any and all help!

I don't know anything about it, but am willing to try it. I am writing this because I have for over two years been suffering with pain in my breastbone, which goes up into my chest and at times down into my stomach. It is not related to my stomach or my heart. I have had all of these checked out by specialists. The sleep Dr. told me the other day that it could be the muscles that are joined to the ribcage, diaphragm and breastbone that are hurting me. He said it may improve with the new breathing machine. I was wondering if anyone else here has ever had this problem. Please let me know your thoughts on this and thank you very much. Liked by Merry, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

Ive gone off the fluoxatine, but Im having a hard time finding reliable yet understandable information about Ritalin and depression in adultsin fact, about Ritalin, in general, when its newly-prescribed for adults, as opposed to how it has affected adults who have taken it since they were children.

CPAP was recommended. The second night in the sleep lab , with CPAP, was not just uncomfortable, it felt like torture. I got no sleep that night. In the following interview with the Sleep Doctor I indicated an unwillingness to order a CPAP machine. She suggested that although surgery was no longer recommended for Sleep Apnea, I should consult a specialist regarding my nasal congestion, and then come back to her for CPAP. My reaction was to make an appointment with my primary doctor, who indicated he had found the use of nighttime Oxygen helpful for sleep apnea. Meanwhile, I had made an appointment with a dentist who specialized in an oral device for the disorder. At the first appointment I was measured for the device, which required an order from my primary doctor. After several attempts to contact my doctor, his assistant simply said he would not sign for such a device. There was no reply as to why his offer of oxygen had been delayed, now for over a month. Also I reviewed all the resources I could find and was unable to find any expert who suggested oxygen as a first line of defense for sleep apnea; there was even the suggestion it could be harmful. My sleeping remains very troublesome. Waking several times during the night, not well rested. Headaches. I continue to wake with my O2 level declining at intervals, my heart rate racing, feeling hot and clammy, despite the room temperature, gasping for breath. Realizing the need for help, I see four options:1. Go back to the sleep doctor and request a trial with BIPAP ( she had at one time suggested that but at the time it felt too much like just another version of CPAP, a reminder of my previous terrible experience). 2. Go to my primary doctor and try to sort out the confusion, and see if he will in fact order the night time oxygen. 3. As I am soon to move from this rural area to an urban area where options for medical care are far more available, seek out another Sleep Doctor for a consult, and start fresh from that point. 4. Seek an appointment at Mayo Clinic, despite the distance, expense, and inconvenience that would entail. The search for treatment has become discouraging and the toll on my life has become pervasive in my otherwise healthy life, and I appreciate any helpful comments.

The cardiologist prescribed various medications, including blood thinners to prevent stroke. A sleep study was also ordered for me. During the sleep study I was found to stop breathing 121 times per hour. Apparently this has caused my AFib as well as other medical problems. I was immediately put on a BiPap. The sleep study determined that the air pressure I need is 21. As soon as I started using the BiPap, I started having problems with leaks at that high pressure. I tightened down the straps as much as I could tolerate, even to the point of bruises and bad chafing on the back of my neck. I only got a couple decent nights on the BiPap before my appointment to speak to the sleep Dr. He reduced my pressure setting to 19 at that time. I could not tolerate the full face mask that included a forehead strap, so I was given a memory foam mask. I was mistakenly given a small mask, which also aggravated the air leak problems. When I was switched to a medium sized mask, the leaks stopped and my sleeping time extended. That's when a new disturbing problem began. Any night that my BiPap indicated that I got 7+ hours of sleep, I woke with an eyelid swollen up horribly. Often there was swelling around the eye, and even a large blister-like swelling below the eye. I did a search about memory foam and found it can cause allergic reactions, including swollen eyes. Thinking that was the problem, I switched to a silicone mask. Last night I got my first long sleep with the silicone mask, and woke up looking like I had been in a prizefight again. My eyelid is swollen to twice it's normal thickness. I have swelling around the eye, and a blister-like eruption on the cheek. So apparently it is not an allergy causing this, but I am at a loss to know what could be causing it. This only happens if I get 7 or more hours of sleep with the mask.

Prescribed for insomnia that was making me crazy, and nothing else was putting me down at night. In the beginning it was incredibly helpful, and I was very glad to get back to sleeping at night. Fast forward to last Tuesday. I ran out and my doctor was off having eye surgery. No big deal, I thought. I didnt think it would kill me to go without.I had been thinking about quitting them anyway because they had lost their efficacy over time. So I get ready for bed, and had trouble sleeping. I started sweating and immediately thought I was having symptoms of peri menopause and hypothyroid. Tossed and turned all night, and then slept not one wink Wednesday night. Then not again on Thursday night. By Friday I was experiencing all of the normal symptoms of sleep deprivation and was struggling at work. I actually managed to get several hours of sleep Friday night, but then comes Saturday morning. I awakened to discover that my entire body was numb. My scalp, teeth, gums, throat, my entire skin! AND get this.my lungs and stomach are numb as well. I cant even tell if food is in my stomach, because I cannot feel it. I cannot feel air in my lungs. I was totally freaked out at this, and knew this was not peri menopause and/ or hypothyroid. I began wondering if Id had a stroke. I started totally wigging outI had itches under my skin and when scratching, I cant feel a thing. I then these details with my boyfriend and tell him I may need to get to the hospital. Then it dawned on me that I had just suddenly stopped my sleeping medications and maybe I should look into it. So I did, and buddy was I SHOCKED!

Both were absolutely horrible experiences. I have insomnia anyway  since childhood  so that equipment simply made it horrible. I was freaking out. I think about 4:30 AM on the last one, they broght me some ambien, so I may have dosed a little bit between 5:00 and 5:30 AM, at which time they annoucned the study was over. Both studies said ""severe sleep apnea"". Of course, I don't know how they could diagnose that on about 30 minutes of sleep. Anyway, on both occasions I tried hard to use a CPAP for weeks. Those were about the worse 4 months or so of my life. Conclusion: If you want me to sleep any, I do not use the machine. If you want me to use the machine, I will get far, far less sleep than using it. I just cannot imagine how anyone can tolerate them? I have tried various masks including the little nose pillows. I find a comfortable spot and I feel air blowing in my eyes, which causes me so much anxiety. I was shamed  terribly shamed  by providers when I would tell them that I just cannot do it. Every single proivder now asks me about it and feel like they need to read me the riot act about what may happen if I don't use it. Nobody understands the situation  nor do they try. Yes, I am extremely tired many days, but less tired than trying the machine and getting so worked up about it every night. And, they wanted me to take it when I travel ?!?! Nope, not going to happen. Ever. My memories of wearing the mask  ""I cannot wait to get this thing off so I can get a little bit of sleep"". Frustrated as can be here. Follow Report"

There was no option for me to select a canadian province) and I am a 39 yr old woman. I have been diagnosed with an arachnoid cyst of the right posterior fossa which measures 2.11.61.6 cm. The diagnosis came from an MRI after I started experiencing tingling and numbing sensations in my hands and feet. Well, later to follow was extreme fatigue, extreme burning pain in the base of my head and neck, behind my left ear, dizziness, light headedness, feeling like air is trapped inside my head, ears popping and buzzing, mood swings and i have had two episodes where I have almost fainted holding my baby. I have seen one neurologist here in Ontario who tried to tell me i was pre-menopausal or depressed, neither of which is true. It seems like the medical profession here in canada do not recognize these tyes of cysts as being symptomatic, yet i have found thousands of people all over the world with the same cysts causing the same symptoms. It is so frustrating being told that my symptoms are not likely caused by this cyst, yet there has been no other medical reason found. The symptoms have progressivly gotten worse since I had my son, who is 20 mths old now. I am no longer working becuase the headaches and fatigue have become dibilitating. I want my life back!! I sleep endlessly during the day and night and feel as though my body just doesnt have enough energy to work for me. I am losing out on precious moments with my children and no one will help me. If anyone out there has experienced teh same thing or help me in any way please contact me. i desperately need help. I understand from my enormous research that I have done that these cysts are often triggered to be symptomatic after a c-section child birth (which is when this all happened for me) because of the epidural or spinal that has tapped into my spine because the cyst is near the top of my spinal cord and cerebellum. I also understand that neurosurgeons in other parts of the world are doing great things with these cysts. thanks in advance to anyone that can help me. Liked by ttourville, kydanzer Follow Report"

In 2006 I had a spinal fusion from T2 through L4. Actually the fusion failed and after one year had to be repeated, this time using a bone morphosizing protein that ensured fusion. Like most who have endured a surgery like this I am left with chronic pain. I have through the years also developed quite a dowagers hump. The surgeon explained that my problem went up so high that she actually bent the rod a bit forward during surgery otherwise noting that I may become off balance. As the years have gone by this hump is looking more and more pronounced. I absolutely hate it and feel so ugly, can anything safely be done or does it involve another dangerous surgical procedure? As you can imagine the thought of more surgery is frightening to me. What complicates matters is I am on Warfarin (blood thinner) due to aortic valve repelacement in 2001.

Because of the hand issue and how I did fine with the in-office shoulder manipulation, he feels my issue is from the cervical spine.

I know the C5-C6 innervates the infraspinatus (ironic that is where my partial tear is) and from what the pain doc noted when getting the first injection, the pain around the shoulder blade is common.

Example: went to physical therapy this morning and had traction done on the cervical spine for the second time. Came home and as I was reaching down to pick up a cat bowl of water from the floor with the left arm I heard a clunk, which sounded like it was coming from the back of the shoulder. Then I felt discomfort in that one spot near the shoulder blade and some hand tingles. Can these disc issues cause the shoulder blade not to work quite like it should?

How can it relieve pain? Lets discuss how MFR has improved our health and reduced pain and share articles about how MFR works. MFR helps so many different conditions that have compressed tissues, and entrapped blood vessels and nerves. The time to avoid MFR treatment would be if a person has cancer, because in releasing tight tissues, cancer cells could be released and able to migrate through the body. Myofascial release is a way to stretch the fascial layers that holds our body together. The fascia is connective tissue that forms a web matrix that interconnects everything in the body. It has recently been described as the Interstitium or a new organ in the body. Fascia can be too tight from injuries or surgical scar tissue, and hold the body in poor ergonomics which can lead to nerve compression. Fascia can be stretched or released and it will remodel itself by changing from a semi solid to liquid form which brings circulation to an area of compressed tissue which then expands the tissue and circulation, and it enables removal of metabolic waste products. Using their hands, the trained therapist will find the path of fascial restriction in the patients body and push against it gently in a shearing motion, and wait for the tissue to start to slide. The patient can feel the movement and become body aware. This path of fascial movement can reach the full length of the body and cross over between sides. This path changes as it unravels, and often there is a vasomotor response that can be seen on the skin temporarily as a reddish area where circulation has been restored which is shown on the photo below near the therapists hands. Treatment must be slow and gentle to prevent the body from guarding in a protective response. This is why aggressive methods to stretch fascia often fail and can cause injuries by tearing the fascia and forming scar tissue that just adds to the problem of fascial tightness. Fascia also holds tissue memory, and in releasing it, sometimes there is a release of emotions tied to an injury that was a cause of the problem. Stress and injury can cause guarding behavior and tissue tightness that become permanent over time, and MFR and working on emotional health helps a person recover from the physical and emotional effects of stress and trauma on the body. MFR is helpful to so many conditions that have an underlying physical cause. The physical therapist who developed this treatment method forty years ago is John Barnes. He has developed courses and MFR certifications for physical therapists. There is a lot of information about MFR at myofascialrelease.com as well as directory of therapists treating with MFR. A person may also contact Therapy on the Rocks in Sedona, AZ, and ask for recommendations of therapists who have been trained in the John Barnes Methods. MFR therapy is becoming better known and accepted healing therapy, although there are some doctors who are unaware of the benefits. I wanted to create this discussion to help organize this information and I thought the Neuropathy group would be a good place to start because someone in pain might look here, but we could have this discussion in many discussion groups. Animals such as dogs, cats and horses have also benefited from this therapy. Hopefully as we collect information here, this discussion can be referenced and shared in the many other discussions on Mayo Clinic Connect.

MFR helps so many different conditions that have compressed tissues, and entrapped blood vessels and nerves. The time to avoid MFR treatment would be if a person has cancer, because in releasing tight tissues, cancer cells could be released and able to migrate through the body. Myofascial release is a way to stretch the fascial layers that holds our body together. The fascia is connective tissue that forms a web matrix that interconnects everything in the body. It has recently been described as the Interstitium or a new organ in the body. Fascia can be too tight from injuries or surgical scar tissue, and hold the body in poor ergonomics which can lead to nerve compression. Fascia can be stretched or released and it will remodel itself by changing from a semi solid to liquid form which brings circulation to an area of compressed tissue which then expands the tissue and circulation, and it enables removal of metabolic waste products. Using their hands, the trained therapist will find the path of fascial restriction in the patients body and push against it gently in a shearing motion, and wait for the tissue to start to slide. The patient can feel the movement and become body aware. This path of fascial movement can reach the full length of the body and cross over between sides. This path changes as it unravels, and often there is a vasomotor response that can be seen on the skin temporarily as a reddish area where circulation has been restored which is shown on the photo below near the therapists hands. Treatment must be slow and gentle to prevent the body from guarding in a protective response. This is why aggressive methods to stretch fascia often fail and can cause injuries by tearing the fascia and forming scar tissue that just adds to the problem of fascial tightness. Fascia also holds tissue memory, and in releasing it, sometimes there is a release of emotions tied to an injury that was a cause of the problem. Stress and injury can cause guarding behavior and tissue tightness that become permanent over time, and MFR and working on emotional health helps a person recover from the physical and emotional effects of stress and trauma on the body. MFR is helpful to so many conditions that have an underlying physical cause. The physical therapist who developed this treatment method forty years ago is John Barnes. He has developed courses and MFR certifications for physical therapists. There is a lot of information about MFR at myofascialrelease.com as well as directory of therapists treating with MFR.

Didnt cause me much pain except for the yearly episodes of throwing my back out and being laid up for a week or so. But 2 years ago morphed into pretty much constant pain, especially when sitting. Doctor finally recommended surgical fusion option and I had the procedure done 9 days ago. According to him it went well and he is optimistic on the ultimate outcome. I am fairly mobile, doing about 90 minutes of walking each day, but by the end of the day, when its time to go to bed, the pain becomes almost unbearable without meds. During the day there is pain, but its quite manageable. Why does it peak at night? Am I doing too much during the day perhaps? Or some other reason? I do not take pain medication during the day, but do have to resort to a pill at night. Overall what does recovery from surgery look like, how long might it take for that whole area to calm down so that most of the pain is gone, even though it will be 3-6 months for the bone to grow? This recovery is not like any I have experienced before, meaning it feels plateaued where I dont have marked improvement on a day to day basis, but rather plateaus followed by slight improvement. Is that normal. I know my doctor should answer these questions, but while a highly respected surgeon he seems to have no time for these types of queries. Thanks Follow Report"

Hubby had a procedure done and it was snowing out so they all wanted to get home and let him out before the anesthesia wore off so I was holding on to him in the parking lot since he was still loopy and fumbled for my keys in my purse that I had pushed around in front of me. I clipped the edge of a cement car stop with my boot and went down flat on mhy face with my purse digging into my diaphrahm area. At the time I thought the worst was the 4 front teeth that broke. However a couple of months later I noticed I was slightly short of breath and I was diagnosed with exercise induced asthma. that kep getting worse over time. Then I noticed a posture change and they realized my spine was the problem . My diaphragm is up in my lungs and my spine is making its way across my chest towards my heart. My rib cage has shifted too at this point and esp. my left lung is being crused badly. I am on supplemental oxygen for exercise but do not use it where I should  on the stairs  as it is a portable that you carry and I always am carrying something up or down. I live in a multi level house so 3 flights with the laundry in the basement. Not good for someone who cant breathe. My prognosis is that eventually I will suffocate to death as I am 81, have severe osteoporosis so surgery is out as screws would not hold. I also have other conditions and it seems I have jnust been passed off. I have started to have some swallowing issues as my esophagus and trachea have a sharp bend at the collarbone area.

I am desperate for help. About 2 months ago, I went in for a routine chiropractic adjustment. I had been getting adjusted on a roughly weekly basis due to having a rib out of place, but my chiropractor had been adjusting my back and neck as well even though I wasn't having neck problems. My normal chiropractor wasn't in, so I saw the other chiropractor in the office. The new chiropractor was much rougher than my normal one. When he adjusted my neck, he was extremely aggressive and the adjustment itself was very painful, which is not normal for me. My neck was sore immediately after. When I got home that night, my neck pain began getting significantly worse and I developed a severe headache. I also started having chills, spiked a fever and became extremely nauseous/started vomiting a lot. I attributed the latter to acid reflux, although I hadn't had acid reflux in awhile. When I woke up the next day, the fever was gone but I still had very severe neck pain/headache and was vomiting uncontrollably. Throughout the day, the pain in my neck was so horrible that I was unable to do anything besides lie on the couch. When this continued for a third day, I called my doctor and chiropractor. The chiropractor insisted that my symptoms were normal and told me to come in for another adjustment. I came in to see my normal chiropractor, who said that my neck was very far out of alignment. He wanted to adjust it again so I reluctantly agreed to let him adjust it with a device that applies mild force to the neck instead of with his hands. After this, I had somewhat less pain but was still in enough pain that I couldn't drive or work. I also began having pains on one side of my neck/head and experiencing severe headaches arching from the base of my skull to my temple. The nausea went away at this point. I was able to get in to see my primary care several days later for a checkup. She seemed to think that the injury was not serious. I expressed concerns about the possibility of a dissected artery and she pretty much dismissed them. She did order an x-ray, as my spine was extremely tender at the base of my neck. The x-ray ended up showing no evidence of a fracture, so I was just told to take ibuprofen and use heating pads for the pain. The pain continued but eventually became intermittent and manageable. I started a new job about 2 weeks after the injury and was able to basically function at work if I took a lot of ibuprofen and used icy hot gel/patches. Sleeping and sitting (or any activity that put pressure on my neck) were both very painful and turning my head was painful and difficult. Walking around was better. I had to sleep propped up on my couch for a couple of weeks after the initial injury. Up until the first weekend of this month, my pain was getting better. On the 4th, I decided that I was feeling well enough to go mountain biking. I took a few hard landings and was pretty bumpy terrain while I was riding, so I was in pain but able to manage. Later that night, however, the pain went back to being excruciating and awful, almost as bad as the first night. Since then, it has only mildly improved. I have been taking ~1,000 mg of ibuprofen and ~600 mg of Tylenol every day, in addition to using Icy Hot about 4-5 times per day. I have horrible pain, especially at the base of my neck and top of my upper back. I have muscle spasms in my shoulders and moving my head feels painful and sometimes causes me to feel lightheaded. Driving, sitting and sleeping are painful. Doing my job is extremely difficult; I have had to call off work twice in the last week and need help for coworkers to lift objects and open doors. Working out and playing sports are completely out of the question. The pain radiates down my arms, legs and back  more on the right side than the left  and I sometimes feel pain and tingling in my right hand. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I've also had a lump in my throat for several days, accompanied by minor difficulties swallowing and breathing at times. I've also had to pee much more often than usual and have been extremely constipated since this injury occurred. My neck clicks every time I breathe deeply or move in certain ways, which never happened before. I have also had tenderness and pain at the sides of my neck as well. I had an MRI last Friday and was able to see the pictures, but I am not able to diagnose since I'm not a doctor. My neck looks relatively straight and my spinal cord doesn't look damaged, though I can only see my neck in one position. I'm still waiting on the results. I guess my question is, what could be wrong with me? Why am I in such horrible pain after this seemingly minor incident? Should I be concerned about my safety? Should I be pushing hard to see a specialist? Follow Report"

Now it seems that my my SI joints are shot as they are bearing the weight of my upper body that my spine was supposed to do. I have had 4 SI joint ESI's & RF ablation with no relief. It seems as if I am heading for bilateral SI Joint fusion. My question is, what is the post-op & recovery like? I am very limited in my pain med usage due to prior opioid usage.

The pain was unbearable for a couple of days and the anatomy of my lower ribs changed immediately (lower subluxation of right ribs/cartilage). I contacted my chiropractor and a couple orthopedic surgeons who cleared me for any spine injury. After a week, the pain subsided and I was able to get back to my normal activities; but, something wasnt right and things just felt out of place and kind of discordinated. In June of that year, I decided to take a 2 mile run to stretch out and possibly work out the bugs The celiac ganglion became aggravated to the point where it caused me to be overcome by debilitating nausea for months, caused delayed gastric emptying and caused my galbladder to stop working (didnt find out until 2/2018). This is when I started to aggressively persue help from the medical community. In August of the same year, I felt well enough to help my neighbor move household goods. I felt strong until I made one last jump up into the back of the truck from the bumper and I felt my back muscle completely let go from below my shoulder blade down to my lower back. I immediately fell into shock, had major muscle spasms from my lower ribs all the way down to my lower back and had to purge my bowels right away. Since then, Ive been through countless blood tests, X-rays and GI testing that have left me going nowhere fast while my back started coming apart on me. Now, Im working with a thoracic surgeon in yale who is still clueless of whats going on even though I told him exactly what happened, where the pain is and what causes things to become aggravated. We are currently stuck, we dont know and cannot locate a surgeon who could perform the surgery of the muscle trauma. Physical therapy is helping my back; but, is aggravating my nerves all over again.

Relief comes in the form of me moving/adjusting/stretching my back to make my muscles stop hurting  but relief only lasts a few seconds so I do it all the time. After having many MRIs and CT scans, the only oddity is a series of 3 syrinxes that span the entire length of my spine  and mild scoliosis. Most muscle problems make the muscles painful to touch, but that isnt the case for this. Its like theyre hurting themselves but thats it. I also have an incredibly tight back, with huge knots in my neck, shoulders, and back, and they twitch and move a lot.The amount of pain can be unbearable and Ive ended up in the ER a few times to try and get help. Sometimes shots of muscle relaxers help, sometimes they dont. Ive been accused of seeking pain killers because they dont believe Im in pain since the muscles arent sensitive to touch.

For the last two months they been doing EMG, other X-ray studies and they now have the MRIs. One neurosurgeon immediately said I needed to fuse all three vertebrae levels in my neck which didnt really appeal to me unless that was my only choice. Im in a tremendous amount of pain, laying on ice in bed most of the time. I did go back to a small amount of pain medication after moving back to my previous pain doctor, just so I could tolerate the pain until they decide what to do.

Maybe there needs to be a form just for people to chat and get to know each other and talk about their lives. I put my settings on one daily digest but I only thought that for one day, now thats not working and I seem to be not getting email at all.

My hardware is bitallerally fractured and is pushed it my nerve root. My L4 is so arthritic that they have to take that one out also. They would have to take out my whats left of my fusion with the fractured Hardware and then take out at L4 and then fuse up . I was given 3 options 1)- live with it , 2)- oblasion but the nerves do grow back in a couple of years, 3) have the extensive fusion? I work nurse in a orthopedic department so my job is alot of bending. Not sure what to do. Liked by lioness Follow Report"

The infected prosthesis will be removed and spacers treated with antibiotics and anti-fungal medicine will be inserted. Following that there will be a minimum of six weeks before a test is done to see if the infection has cleared up. I am told fungal infections are very difficult to get rid of. Its likely that I will not be able to put any weight on that right leg Ive already been through three months of limited moblity and pain.

First, I should mention that this is my first post to the group.I have had neuropathic pain issues in my feet for many years made worse by surgeries that have resulted in scar tissue that has formed around the nerves. Over the years I have become diabetic (Type 2), although, it has always been considered well controlled. However, I recently had a skin biopsy performed which indicated that I did not have the clinical definition of neuropathy since the nerve cell counts were well within normal ranges. The biopsy did show small anoxal swellings in the epidermis and sub epidermis. My doctor said this condition is often a forerunner of nerve cell loss and is correlated to patients experiencing burning pain. Ultrasound scans have also found scar tissue in the areas that I experience the burning nerve pain.I am hoping to hear from anyone who has tried one of the Radio Frequency wave ablation procedures to reduce neuropathic foot pain or knows of any literature on the subject.Thanks Follow Report"

I have been going to pain management clinics for about 6 years now. I have has wonderful relief from these injections. They are a TEMPORARY relief to the PERMANENT problem of chronic pain. They are temporary though. They can last as little as a week or as long as a year. They are used to relieve an acute problem for a time period to get me through until my medication works better or allow my PT to help correct the problems. I was told even with guided fluoroscopy the injection can miss the perfect target but still give some relief. My doctor is well trained and has done several on me and I always get some sort of relief. I have even gone into his office and begged for them because they work so well. But like he told me they are part of my over all plan to attack my pain and work to get me through a crisis of pain until I can get back to exercise. They are not a miracle cure and there is no miracle cure presently for my chronic pain. I keep positive and through his plan and my cooperation, education, medication and willingness to follow his plan to the extent, I do feel better.

I have had a surgeries on my lower discs and have had a laminectomy,microdiscectomy to remove the herniated disc and this was quit successful until recently i started to have pain and the same old feeling as before so i went back to the doctor who did the other surgeries after a few doctors told me there was nothing wrong and that i just had a sore back and after a few MRI and rays recently i have had a laminectomy with spinal fusion with implementation and i continue to have the same pain that i had when i first went in the last time to see the original doctor and although he tells me he does not see anything i ask him why do i still have the pain in my back and my leg,i got the impression that he wanted to admit he made a mistake or that the procedure did not work ( i would be fine either way but just be honest with me then i can make my own decisions) One of the interesting things that i have noticed is that after this last surgery the pain and numbness and tingling and burning have all remained the same with the exception that i now have pain down my left arm starting at the elbow and extending downward and the only relief i get is when i walk around holding my arms up and out like a mummy I do work alot of hrs ( Stay away from management,it will kill you lol ) and i do see a pain management doctor who does see and know that there is a problem but he just cant figure it out and he has referred me to the North American Spine Institute but i would be interested to learn if anyone here has had a similar problem or problems characteristic with mine? Do the folks at the mayo clinic get to the bottom of the problem or just like a few doctors do they tell you oh you just have a sore back? I can live with a 2 or a 3 level of pain but the 5 and 6 level of pain is becoming unacceptable unless i go on a stronger pain med which i do not want. I thank you all for reading this as it was lengthy and hopefully informative enough that you could offer me advice or other places that you might have experienced better relief,better care,better outcome / results.

When she was 77 she went into assisted living, moving three times. The first one was in her hometown, a small town where everyone knew her as a nurse and she felt she was taking care of them. The second one was near me and a big fancy facility with all the bells and whistles, but every time her dementia got worse she liked it less. The cost nearly doubled and they wanted to put her in the memory care wing, which we felt she didn't need quite then. Then I found an adult foster care home ran by a great family where there were just 5 residents. Once they had an opening, it was amazing how well she did there. No longer confined to one room, but she was a part of a family. They gave her the best care ever. They'd even take her out shopping! Their family became our family for one whole year. Of course, when I'd be there 2-3 times a week, we got to know one another very well. But, they gave me my own life back, because I didn't feel guilty when I wasn't with her anymore. She was in perfectly good hands! During the past 6 months or so, she started having more small bleeds and then the past few months they were in the back of her head, affecting her more. Usually she needed some real good sleep for a few days and all would be back to her new normal. In May she was put on hospice. Mom never really knew she was going to die, because she had her wisdom teeth pulled 6 months earlier and couldn't get over the holes in the back of her mouth. I'd bring her to the dentist to assure her all was okay. When she had her appointment with her doctor to discuss hospice, she thought he was a dentist. I asked her if she understood what we were talking about and if she understood what hospice meant. Even though she was a nurse her whole life, she replied she understood everything, and that she would get used to the gaps in the back of her mouth and would be ""good as new"" after that. I guess there is something sweet about not knowing. That day when I dropped Mom and her caretaker off, she got real mad at me for not bringing her to her house (2 hours away). Her boyfriend (also a resident) and she would always talk about moving into either his house or hers and that day she really meant it! A week or two later she was doing better and there was talk of taking her off of hospice. In addition to doing better, apparently the insurance / medicare / whatever looks at CAA as a condition, not a life-threatening prognoses. Then she had some more ""strokes"" (reworded the orders) and it became obvious she was unlikely to get better. Some days she could walk. Some days she couldn't get out of bed. Some days she wanted to go shopping (we used a wheelchair), and some days she was really quite good. The last few days in July, although she wanted to get up, her brain couldn't tell her legs what to do anymore. Her three sisters all came to visit so John (her caretaker) carried her to the living room so they had more room. She enjoyed the reminiscing, but was virtually bedridden from then on. She would want to get up, but her brain was not able to tell her feet/legs how move. She fed herself some ice cream on July 31st, but she was so very weak and slept almost all the time. I asked her if she was ready to go see dad (he died in 2013). She could talk just enough to say, ""Yes"". I promised her I'd make sure she looked pretty for him. My sisters both came that day prepared to stay for weeks or however long it took. The following morning we held the phone next to her ear as each grandchild (10 of them) called to say their goodbyes. That night I checked her oxygen and pulse (little finger monitor) on and off all night, holding her hand from 3 am on. My sisters were talking, as I was still holding her hand, half sleeping, when she peacefully slept away at 7:47 A.M. on August 2nd. As I had promised, I put some lipstick on her before they took her away. We watched our father suffer for 13 days from metastatic prostate cancer. My biggest regret with him was that we allowed Mom to control his meds and she refused to give him much (if any) morphine, claiming as a nurse it was her duty to keep him alive. Also, Mom didn't want people in her home and Dad could have and should have reaped the benefits of how great the hospice program really is. Not until he passed did we really understand how much her cognitive thinking was already off. CAA is an interesting condition. The first year after Dad died, she managed to spend thousands of dollars on anything and everything. I think there are peddlers who prey on widows and when they came knocking, selling cleaning supplies, or removing trees, etc. she handed over big bucks. She also thought everyone was stealing from her. She misplaced everything and hid things in weird places. We'd have to take her Bose remote with us wherever we took her! We learned to keep her room as simple as possible. She constantly thought she needed new cell phones (never admitting it was operator errors). She was very good at masking her disability, talking mostly about things like the weather and other small talk. There is a lot of fabrication or denial that occurs with CAA patients. Later on she would repeat certain phrases that were etched in her memory making her come across as perfectly normal. She could fiddle for HOURS with jewelry, usually breaking it and then blaming someone else. There were times she was nasty, nasty. But, then a few hours later she would forget she was mad and all was good again. The biggest change we saw was that she went boy crazy. But, she met Dad when she was 16 and would rather been with virtually any man than by herself. What she wanted mostly from us girls was to take her and her latest boyfriend out to eat. Men liked her because she was beautiful, classy and witty. She was insistent she was going to marry each one of them and would gladly have turned everything (assets) over to any one of them. But, luckily her guy friends were good people and we would take them to concerts and out to eat with us. We never sold the house that we grew up in, even though it was not lived in for 5 years. It gave Mom comfort knowing ""when she got better, she could go home."" There was no need to list the house with a realtor, as people have been wanting to buy it for years. By November it will be turned over to the new school superintendent and his children. Located right across from the city park & swimming pool, baseball/softball/football and track fields, it was the best place to grow up. If anyone is still reading this long message, and either have CAA or a loved one with it, my advice is to embrace it. It is not a bad way to live and it is not at all a bad way to die.

Her name is Terezinha. She is married and she is mother of 4, for whom she dedicated her life in while she worked hard in a Career in the Brazilian Education Department of SP State. Besides that, she gave a strong contribution to the Community, leading Social Programs like Parents Education about fertility control and family planning (Billings Method). She used to be focused on healthy habits, such as being physically active (yoga), eating a well-balanced diet, never drinking alcohol neither smoking, and visiting doctors regularly. She is not diabetic, her blood pressure usually is low. Cholesterol LDL had been more than 100 mg/dL and triglycerides more than 150 mg/dL, thats the reason she had been taking statin for a long period of her adult life. She had some pains in hands and feet joints.Her parents also had neurological problems in the past, and both was diagnosed as Alzheimers disease, around 1970~1995. In addition, 2 of her 15 siblings was diagnosed with neurological problems. Around the year of 2013, when she was at 64 years-old, she had some falls on the street; she was drowsy while driving; and she had difficulty with sleep management. At this time, we started to watch her behavior full time, and it was the first time we asked her to avoid driving, and she didnt accept it. In the MRI of 2013, it was reported white matter damages, compatible with leukoencephalopathy microangiopatic supratentorial. The doctor prescribed aspirin and statin. She retired in 2015. In 2016, she had a serious fall, heating her head and having a brain bleeding, which was well treated by a neurologist (this fall didnt cause any instant change in her brain function). But considering the white matter damages, we started to be concerned about dementia, and trying avoid this. The doctor prescribed a cocktail of medicines in order to prevent strokes and dementia, with the following drugs/suplements:Resveratrol, Velija (Duloxetin Hydrochloride), Clopidogrel Bisulfate, Vytorin (Ezetimibe and Sinvastatin), Donepezil (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, 5mg), Losartana 25mg (antihypertensive) and Glucosamine. In february of 2017, she took a NOTCH3 testing to investigate the hypothesis of leukoencephalopathy (Cadasil), and the result was negative. Then, the doctor changed a little bit the prescription to:Resveratrol, Vitamin D, Velija (Duloxetin Hydrochloride), Omega3, Clopidogrel Bisulfate, Rosuvastatin (5mg), Losartana 25mg (antihypertensive), Donepezil (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, 10mg), Bromopride (to help the body accept the dose increasing for donepezil), and Glucosamine. In the second semester of 2017, her memory loss got worst significantly, and we cannot leave her by herself anymore. She had another fall heating her knee. We visited the neurologist again, new brain exams, and then, he diagnosed it as Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA). This is her current diagnosis, in which I dont believe 100%, because as far Ive been finding out other CAA diagnosed people, they are much better with their brain function than my mom.So, the doctor proposed a trial to do a immunosuppression, with 40% of chances to recover her brain function, by stopping auto-immune inflammation. We tried it, and it didnt work. Actually, it was the worst phase of her memory loss progression, instantly she lost much of her communication ability and memory. In addition, we had to go to emergency care in the hospital, and she received another diagnosis: fungal meningitis, due to the immunosuppression made, she was hospitalized for 1 month, in January of 2018. She was cured from meningitis. But her brain function never came back to normal. She started need to use diapers full time. She didnt accept pills anymore, only liquid medicines. After all these inefficient trying, we gave up of traditional medicines, and stopped it. In this phase, we had to modify the lifestyle of our family to adjust with this new reality, in order to take care of her. It was a tough phase for us, we learned a lot about caregiving, resilience, and love. In this moment, we also took an (expensive) genetic exam, but honestly I still didnt understand the results, neither her doctor helped us enough about that. We also tried acupuncture, for 4 weeks: no improvement. After 4 months of homecare, she become to be aggressive. Then we decided to get help from a caregiver homecare institution. Also, we accepted to try Depakene (Valproic Acid) to control the aggressiveness. It worked and she has been taking Depakene until nowadays (we reduced the dose by half a few months ago).Also, we found some supplements to allow her sleep well at night, which is a sedative compound of passiflora, mulungu, valerian and chamomile. Also, sometimes we give Miosan (Cyclobenzaprine) to muscle relaxation for sleep. The most recent critical issue was a convulsion, in May 2019. It was 1 day treated in the hospital. This quick event occurred just after she had took a vaccine for the common cold. In conclusion, for the moment, my feeling is: if we havent tried so many preventive strong medicines, maybe her cognition would be so much better than it is now, considering the fact that after we stopped strong medicines (e.g. donepezil), her cognitive declining got slowed. So, for those ones who have mild cognitive impairment, Id not recommend the use of Statin, Donepezil, neither Duloxetin. Immunosuppression neither.

This quick event occurred just after she had took a vaccine for the common cold. In conclusion, for the moment, my feeling is: if we havent tried so many preventive strong medicines, maybe her cognition would be so much better than it is now, considering the fact that after we stopped strong medicines (e.g. donepezil), her cognitive declining got slowed. So, for those ones who have mild cognitive impairment, Id not recommend the use of Statin, Donepezil, neither Duloxetin. Immunosuppression neither.

Her name is Terezinha. She is married and she is mother of 4, for whom she dedicated her life in while she worked hard in a Career in the Brazilian Education Department of SP State. Besides that, she gave a strong contribution to the Community, leading Social Programs like Parents Education about fertility control and family planning (Billings Method). She used to be focused on healthy habits, such as being physically active (yoga), eating a well-balanced diet, never drinking alcohol neither smoking, and visiting doctors regularly. She is not diabetic, her blood pressure usually is low. Cholesterol LDL had been more than 100 mg/dL and triglycerides more than 150 mg/dL, thats the reason she had been taking statin for a long period of her adult life. She had some pains in hands and feet joints.Her parents also had neurological problems in the past, and both was diagnosed as Alzheimers disease, around 1970~1995. In addition, 2 of her 15 siblings was diagnosed with neurological problems. Around the year of 2013, when she was at 64 years-old, she had some falls on the street; she was drowsy while driving; and she had difficulty with sleep management. At this time, we started to watch her behavior full time, and it was the first time we asked her to avoid driving, and she didnt accept it. In the MRI of 2013, it was reported white matter damages, compatible with leukoencephalopathy microangiopatic supratentorial. The doctor prescribed aspirin and statin. She retired in 2015. In 2016, she had a serious fall, heating her head and having a brain bleeding, which was well treated by a neurologist (this fall didnt cause any instant change in her brain function). But considering the white matter damages, we started to be concerned about dementia, and trying avoid this. The doctor prescribed a cocktail of medicines in order to prevent strokes and dementia, with the following drugs/suplements:Resveratrol, Velija (Duloxetin Hydrochloride), Clopidogrel Bisulfate, Vytorin (Ezetimibe and Sinvastatin), Donepezil (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, 5mg), Losartana 25mg (antihypertensive) and Glucosamine. In february of 2017, she took a NOTCH3 testing to investigate the hypothesis of leukoencephalopathy (Cadasil), and the result was negative. Then, the doctor changed a little bit the prescription to:Resveratrol, Vitamin D, Velija (Duloxetin Hydrochloride), Omega3, Clopidogrel Bisulfate, Rosuvastatin (5mg), Losartana 25mg (antihypertensive), Donepezil (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, 10mg), Bromopride (to help the body accept the dose increasing for donepezil), and Glucosamine. In the second semester of 2017, her memory loss got worst significantly, and we cannot leave her by herself anymore. She had another fall heating her knee. We visited the neurologist again, new brain exams, and then, he diagnosed it as Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA). This is her current diagnosis, in which I dont believe 100%, because as far Ive been finding out other CAA diagnosed people, they are much better with their brain function than my mom.So, the doctor proposed a trial to do a immunosuppression, with 40% of chances to recover her brain function, by stopping auto-immune inflammation. We tried it, and it didnt work. Actually, it was the worst phase of her memory loss progression, instantly she lost much of her communication ability and memory. In addition, we had to go to emergency care in the hospital, and she received another diagnosis: fungal meningitis, due to the immunosuppression made, she was hospitalized for 1 month, in January of 2018. She was cured from meningitis. But her brain function never came back to normal. She started need to use diapers full time. She didnt accept pills anymore, only liquid medicines. After all these inefficient trying, we gave up of traditional medicines, and stopped it. In this phase, we had to modify the lifestyle of our family to adjust with this new reality, in order to take care of her. It was a tough phase for us, we learned a lot about caregiving, resilience, and love. In this moment, we also took an (expensive) genetic exam, but honestly I still didnt understand the results, neither her doctor helped us enough about that. We also tried acupuncture, for 4 weeks: no improvement. After 4 months of homecare, she become to be aggressive. Then we decided to get help from a caregiver homecare institution. Also, we accepted to try Depakene (Valproic Acid) to control the aggressiveness. It worked and she has been taking Depakene until nowadays (we reduced the dose by half a few months ago).Also, we found some supplements to allow her sleep well at night, which is a sedative compound of passiflora, mulungu, valerian and chamomile.

Her name is Terezinha. She is married and she is mother of 4, for whom she dedicated her life in while she worked hard in a Career in the Brazilian Education Department of SP State. Besides that, she gave a strong contribution to the Community, leading Social Programs like Parents Education about fertility control and family planning (Billings Method). She used to be focused on healthy habits, such as being physically active (yoga), eating a well-balanced diet, never drinking alcohol neither smoking, and visiting doctors regularly. She is not diabetic, her blood pressure usually is low. Cholesterol LDL had been more than 100 mg/dL and triglycerides more than 150 mg/dL, thats the reason she had been taking statin for a long period of her adult life. She had some pains in hands and feet joints.Her parents also had neurological problems in the past, and both was diagnosed as Alzheimers disease, around 1970~1995. In addition, 2 of her 15 siblings was diagnosed with neurological problems. Around the year of 2013, when she was at 64 years-old, she had some falls on the street; she was drowsy while driving; and she had difficulty with sleep management. At this time, we started to watch her behavior full time, and it was the first time we asked her to avoid driving, and she didnt accept it. In the MRI of 2013, it was reported white matter damages, compatible with leukoencephalopathy microangiopatic supratentorial. The doctor prescribed aspirin and statin. She retired in 2015. In 2016, she had a serious fall, heating her head and having a brain bleeding, which was well treated by a neurologist (this fall didnt cause any instant change in her brain function). But considering the white matter damages, we started to be concerned about dementia, and trying avoid this. The doctor prescribed a cocktail of medicines in order to prevent strokes and dementia, with the following drugs/suplements:Resveratrol, Velija (Duloxetin Hydrochloride), Clopidogrel Bisulfate, Vytorin (Ezetimibe and Sinvastatin), Donepezil (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, 5mg), Losartana 25mg (antihypertensive) and Glucosamine. In february of 2017, she took a NOTCH3 testing to investigate the hypothesis of leukoencephalopathy (Cadasil), and the result was negative. Then, the doctor changed a little bit the prescription to:Resveratrol, Vitamin D, Velija (Duloxetin Hydrochloride), Omega3, Clopidogrel Bisulfate, Rosuvastatin (5mg), Losartana 25mg (antihypertensive), Donepezil (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, 10mg), Bromopride (to help the body accept the dose increasing for donepezil), and Glucosamine. In the second semester of 2017, her memory loss got worst significantly, and we cannot leave her by herself anymore. She had another fall heating her knee. We visited the neurologist again, new brain exams, and then, he diagnosed it as Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA). This is her current diagnosis, in which I dont believe 100%, because as far Ive been finding out other CAA diagnosed people, they are much better with their brain function than my mom.So, the doctor proposed a trial to do a immunosuppression, with 40% of chances to recover her brain function, by stopping auto-immune inflammation. We tried it, and it didnt work. Actually, it was the worst phase of her memory loss progression, instantly she lost much of her communication ability and memory. In addition, we had to go to emergency care in the hospital, and she received another diagnosis: fungal meningitis, due to the immunosuppression made, she was hospitalized for 1 month, in January of 2018. She was cured from meningitis. But her brain function never came back to normal. She started need to use diapers full time. She didnt accept pills anymore, only liquid medicines. After all these inefficient trying, we gave up of traditional medicines, and stopped it. In this phase, we had to modify the lifestyle of our family to adjust with this new reality, in order to take care of her. It was a tough phase for us, we learned a lot about caregiving, resilience, and love. In this moment, we also took an (expensive) genetic exam, but honestly I still didnt understand the results, neither her doctor helped us enough about that. We also tried acupuncture, for 4 weeks: no improvement. After 4 months of homecare, she become to be aggressive. Then we decided to get help from a caregiver homecare institution. Also, we accepted to try Depakene (Valproic Acid) to control the aggressiveness. It worked and she has been taking Depakene until nowadays (we reduced the dose by half a few months ago).Also, we found some supplements to allow her sleep well at night, which is a sedative compound of passiflora, mulungu, valerian and chamomile. Also, sometimes we give Miosan (Cyclobenzaprine) to muscle relaxation for sleep. The most recent critical issue was a convulsion, in May 2019. It was 1 day treated in the hospital. This quick event occurred just after she had took a vaccine for the common cold. In conclusion, for the moment, my feeling is: if we havent tried so many preventive strong medicines, maybe her cognition would be so much better than it is now, considering the fact that after we stopped strong medicines (e.g. donepezil), her cognitive declining got slowed. So, for those ones who have mild cognitive impairment, Id not recommend the use of Statin, Donepezil, neither Duloxetin. Immunosuppression neither.

In April he had a massive stroke (his 6th in total) and initially had complete paralysis on his left side  they were going to do surgery to remove the clot but then he started being able to move again so they put him in ICU.

Mayo saved my husbands life  Dr. Scharf told me nobody should have this many strokes without a physical cause and he felt it was the valve. They did the same tests as the hospital in NC and I believe a couple of extra ones and found that blood was forming behind the valve, causing clots and, in turn, causing the strokes. Dr. Pochettino (my angel) did a 12 hour surgery to remove everything the hospital in NC had done and replaced it with a mechanical heart  it was a successful surgery but his cognitive issues were horrible at first. He couldnt remember much of anything, was talking nonsense and had a vacant stare which was frightening  they said some of it was what they call ICU dementia and he would get better. Bottom line is that when we returned to NC in mid-May, I immediately got him into speech therapy for his cognitive issues  its been slow and he still has pretty severe memory issues but it has improved. He is working 3 days a week with a helper to make sure he doesnt make any mistakes. My question is, what do I expect for the future? I have been grieving the loss of our normal life but Im thrilled my husband is alive. I dont know how long the cognitive therapy continues to improve his cognition and since hes a realtor, he doesnt make any money until he does a sale so we are living on my salary which is a little scary.

I was having a CT scan for another reason and an aneurysm was discovered. Immediately had consults with neurology and neurosurgery and it was decided that it did not need immediate attention except taking a baby aspirin daily. It showed calcification that meant it had been there for a while. I have not had a stroke or other symptoms. I am 62 with no heart problems. But when you here aneurysm, you fear the worst. An angiogram was done few weeks later and results were: Right common carotid artery cervical angiogram demonstrates an aneurysm of the right internal carotid artery upper cervical segment which measures 33 x 25 x 29 mm. The surgeon said these types of aneurysm rarely burst and should follow up with another test after 6 months to see if there are any changes. If you have had similar diagnosis, what advice are your drs giving you? My doctors are at Mayo Rochester, so confident that diagnosis is correct.

I am also an occupational therapist with experience in neuro rehab. 1 month ago my father had a lobectomy, removing the top and middle lobes of his right lung due to dx of non small cell carcinoma. Afterwards, he went into a-fib. He was discharged home after 4 days. He had terrible hiccups (he swears this was the beginning of it all) and needed help with ambulation. (My dad is 64 and was super active before the surgery). As the week progressed we noticed slurred speech. The pulmonologist, noticing the speech and gait, prescribed blood thinner thinking my dad had a clot, but he did not run any tests. Few more days then vomiting, then headache. We went to the ER then ICU with dx of large bleed in the occipital lobe. He stayed for 12 days, discharged home and 4 days later was back at ER with more vomiting and headache. New CT scan revealed 9 new lesions spread throughout the brain. Radiologist and Neurologist have told us that the lung cancer has spread, even suggesting the cancer may have started in the brain. The neurosurgeon and oncologist feel strongly that these are bleeds and should be treated as a stroke. I want to take him to Mayo Clinic. My step mom wants to keep him here and try for rehab. I just want to completely rule out cancer. I saw the MRI with the neurologist, but I dont know what a bleed vs met would look like. Ive tried looking online but dont think this is the best practice. Now it is the Christmas season and my dad is in the ICU with a skeleton crew, little therapy, and waiting for the doctors to come back from vacation. I am scared and frustrated.

Also bouts of anxiety, sleeplessness, as well of severe fatigue and increasing bouts of depresion.

This had happened a year prior to my stroke and I just thought it was a strange moment. Since then my daily life is migraines, off balance, extreme tiredness, forgetfulness and sometime I just blank off into space. I feel like I am looking at life through a dream state. I have had a ct scan and an MRI in the last four weeks non of which found another stroke nor further damage from what I already have in my brain from my first stroke. It has been a year and 4 months since my first stroke and now I feel as if I am living a totally new life. I repeat myself and often feel out of it. I am seeing my neurologist next Monday for a follow up, I have been logging my blood pressure (which on medication seems to still average 130/95, sometimes higher sometimes a tad lower) I log when I forget things, when I am told I am repeating myself and when I am very drained.

She still has left side paralysis, but making some progress. One of her major issues is weight gain which is making her recovery more difficult. She is experiencing a feeling of always being hungry and has not had the feeling of being full since her stroke. She also does not remember what and when she eats. I continually remind her of what she ate, portions and the time she ate. I have tried recording everything she eats so she realizes how much she is consuming, but she doesnt have any interest and is only concerned about how hungry she is at the moment. We have inquired with her neurological Doctor, family doctor and brain surgeon, but none of them have offered any solutions. Her family doctor suggested a wellness plan, but I know she will not follow it. This hunger issue is also causing her frequent emotional breakdowns. Any suggestions would be appreciated!

I had a thyroid lobectomy a week ago (in the middle of Covid-19!), due to suspicious nodule that did indeed turn out to be cancer. There was a small incidence of columnar variant cells, but not 100%. Everything was encapsulated in the nodule, they caught it early, and nothing had spread. I am still waiting for my specialist and the board at UCLA to discuss my pathology and make a recommendation as to the best plan for monitoring me moving forward, but my question is this: Do I go for a second surgery to remove the other half of the thyroid (healthy) in order to be able to monitor potential recurrence via the Thyroglobulin blood test? OR, leave everything as it is and monitor via ultrasounds every 6 months? I really don't want to go through a second surgery or be on medication for the rest of my life, but I also don't want to put myself at risk for not detecting recurring cancer.

I am not feeling particularly sick, but with such a large nodule (almost 2 inches), I realize it could be cancer or something else and I am coming to terms with that. I guess they will want to do a FNA, but I know that is not always a correct indicator of cancer. The endocrinologist wants to do a radioscan of my nearby glands before the FNA.

They did an ultrasound and found more cancer positive lymph nodes on right of neck confirmed by FNA biopsy. I was back on October 2nd to have right and central neck dissection. I go back again in February for follow up. In 3 months it popped up in other spots so I wonder. How many of us will never reach No Evidence of Disease? What is that journey like???? 3 of many lymph nodes removed were positive besides the 2 killed by ablation all in under a year :(. No RAI and my meds work great. I feel no effects from not having a thyroid. Follow Report

I had such a struggle finding food that was soft enough to eat, but also tasted good. There is only so much soup a person can stand, right??? I had a feeding tube during several rounds of treatment, but had to eat by mouth during my first few diagnoses. Did anyone land on some food that worked really well post-surgically or during treatment? I ate way too many of my moms peanut butter pies. It has a smooth texture, and I would make it without the crust  Pudding and cheesecake were also winners in my book. Definitely not a low sugar diet, but it worked for me. What about you?

So here I am.  Mostly I was curious to see if anyone else who had donated had posted about what their lives (and bodies) are like after that donation. I.E. are there are any knock-on effects they may have noticed, or other things theyre experiencing because of their donation. Me: Im a kidney donor, I donated in Nov 2018, I just turned 44.Health wise: I run, I do yoga, I talk lots of walks. Im active.I have a high-stress job, though, and other external (non-donation related) forces that really increased my stress and anxiety levels in 2019. One year after my donation I basically feel I am back to normal, save for two things: 1) I get an occasional little muscular pang from my scar tissues during yoga if I move in certain ways. So I can feel that theres still some lingering after-effects and scarring, but these are extremely minimal these days. They were worse in early 2019 but gradually faded out. 2) My 6-month and 1-year bloodwork are both good, but I can sometimes feel that my system has changed  for lack of a better word for it. For example Im pretty sure my blood pressure has been affected  I can feel a slight change in now when Im super anxious and/or stressed out. I can get lightheaded, I can feel my ears ring, I can just feel that somethings off  etc. So Im pretty sure thats basically some hypertension/blood pressure saying hello. Also: Im acknowledge that I didnt live as healthily as I possibly could have in 2019, which probably contributed to this. There were certainly some adverse health choices I made that I know werent the greatest in the world. But Im way more conscious of this kind of thing now. Because of that, and because of point #2 Ive been very into doing a couple of things differently in 2019 and 2020: a) Im adjusting my diet. Ive also just read a really interesting book** on food and diet that also prompted me to re-evaluate my eating habits in general, so the combination has me more conscious of my diet and how that affects the rest of my body. b) Im doing a lot of regular yoga. It helps my overall body feeling in general, and its a stress reducer. c) Im being more conscious of my overall stress levels at all times All in all Im pretty surprised at how little of a difference I feel. Ive been able to reconnect in person with my recipient*** since our donation  and I have zero regrets about my decision to donate. All of these things in this post are honestly very minor when I put it all in perspective. But I think its good to post about them anyway. And thats me.

I am beyond grateful to my donor for this gift! I am also feeling very isolated as I try to heal from a surgery, I was not prepared would feel so catastrophic. Some days I am able to take short nature walks, cook dinner and do light housekeeping. Other days, like today, I can hardly stand without excruciating backaches and the sensation my insides might tumble out of my abdomen, if I dont hold my stomach muscles with everything Ive got. Are there any other nephrectomy patients,, who could help me not feel so alone in this process, by sharing what their recovery was like? I am a 54 year old dance teacher, who is wondering if she will ever feel whole and healthy again. The transplant patients I have talked to had kidney transplants but not a nephrectomy, and at least for me, their experience doesnt sound anything like what I am experiencing.Thank you!

They have me on the ""active"" list and am in the discussion at their weekly team meetings. I have venous congestion that is of major concern because if it continues to grow it causes other operative problems. I have had esophageal varices banded  6-8 times (no bleeding so far)  but that has precluded using a blood thinner to allow the body to dissolve the clot on its own. If my next upper endoscopy  in the next 2 weeks here in Tucson  shows no new varices we may try the blood thinner even with my low platelet counts. Though it increases the risk of bleeding, with weekly monitoring its a risk/reward decision. The bloid thinner will likely raise my INR and temporarily raise my MELD, it's worth a shot if the body breaks up the clot.

I am 16 months post Heart transplant. I was diagnosed with 2 different viruses one shortly after my transplant CMV and the other last November of Parvovirus B19. Ill start with CMV they put me on a heavy dose of Valcyte 900 mg twice a day. They tried once to take me off but the CMV came right back. The other virus it was detected in November ov last year and caused my hemoglobin to drop into the 6 range (normal is 14 to 20 but there happy at 10) which propted a blood transfusion and a ivig treatment over a 2 day period. Tjat helped mainly do to the whole blood which got me up to 10 fast. Well they thought we got it but this past February my hemoglobin dropped again and this time it put me in the hospital. More whole blood and a 6 day regiment of IVIG. Well i found out two fays ago the parvovirus is back. I have been working with a hematologist on the blood issue. There not positive its due to parvo. I know mayo said if this didnt work this time they want me to see a infectious disease specialist at Mayo. Im now waiting for approval from tricare to see the doctors at Mayo. Hopefully i find out tomorrow when i see my PCM. But my question is has anyone hade similar problems with parvo or CMV and how you were able to beat it.

I'm still on the weekly blood test and monthly liver ultrasound regimen. The liver has shown improvement in function but blood tests have remained mostly the same, continuing the anemia and kidney issues. I received the call at 5:15 AM on December 28. The offer was a high risk liver  cardiac death donor who was Hep-C and Epstein Barr positive (I was negative on both.) We arrived at Mayo at 9:30 AM to begin prep. They hoped to do the surgery at 3:00 pm but the donor's family had not yet authorized the removal of life support system  I know that had to be an emotional time for all of them. Folks have wondered how you might be in a situation where you got the call and had to go back home. This was a situation where that could have happened but thankfully the dominoes fell into place. Surgery began around 6:00 PM and ended around 11:30 PM. My husband is keeping the text sent from the OR that said ""old liver out, new one going in"". Until after I saw the surgical report, I never knew that I did not have a gall bladder anymore  I somehow missed that in all my reading. The pathology report was interesting  I had a liver biopsy 11 years ago at UPenn (I was living in NJ at the time) that showed Sarcoidosis in the liver but upon review post-surgery I had nodular regenerative hyperplasia and not cirrhosis with no Sarcoidosis present. They assured me that the liver transplant was needed  my liver was toast. The disease has the same symptoms as cirrhosis  portal hypertension and esophageal varices. Dr. Aqel showed me a picture of my old liver  it looked like bad meat  as well as a picture they took after the new liver went in, which was cool. It is probably the only time you can see what the inside of your body looks like. I woke up the day after surgery around Noon in ICU  my husband said I struggled a bit earlier when they removed the breathing tube, but thankfully I remember none of it. That afternoon they had me up and walking and I was sent to a step down room early the next morning. I was doing so well that they contemplating sending me home after 4 days, but that morning's blood work showed a sudden decrease in the kidney function that kept me at the hospital for 11 days. I roamed the hallways around the nurse's station a few times each day, which helped me keep sane! Food smells and taste were a problem, so they let my husband bring in food from the outside after one of my surgeons said it was OK  I never ate hospital food after day 2. When I was at the Liver Support Group meeting in Phoenix, I told that story and one of the prior liver recipients commented that they wish they had my doctor! Surgical staples  I had 70  were removed after 3.5 weeks. I wanted to keep the staples as I plan to include them in an art project when I feel better. After hospital discharge, we stayed at the Residence Inn on the Mayo campus for about 2-3 weeks until I was discharged from the clinic. Just to make things interesting, my medical coverage changed on January 1  not my choice as the provider moved everyone to the new plan. When I checked in, I gave them the cards for my then insurance plan as well as the one that would start on the 1st and let them handle it. It caused some confusion with early prescriptions but that resolved eventually. Medicine changes have happened regularly since, keeping hubby on his toes as he prepares my meds. On a positive note, after 1 month of treatment, the HEP-C virus I acquired via the liver transplant is now undetected in my system. I still have 2 more months of treatment followed by 3 more months of testing before they will consider me cured, but I can handle that. I am blessed to have good insurance  the monthly wholesale price of the HEP-C medicine is $13,000 (I only paid $150). We need a better heath care system. I know I am one of the lucky ones who got a liver transplant  many are not eligible or die while waiting. I am grateful for the care I received from my Tucson GI doctor, Cristiana Bortuzzo, over the past 8 years keeping me healthy and the Mayo team over the last 2 years while on the transplant list. I wish that everyone who has a serious health issue could be cared for at a place like Mayo.

Food smells and taste were a problem, so they let my husband bring in food from the outside after one of my surgeons said it was OK  I never ate hospital food after day 2. When I was at the Liver Support Group meeting in Phoenix, I told that story and one of the prior liver recipients commented that they wish they had my doctor! Surgical staples  I had 70  were removed after 3.5 weeks. I wanted to keep the staples as I plan to include them in an art project when I feel better. After hospital discharge, we stayed at the Residence Inn on the Mayo campus for about 2-3 weeks until I was discharged from the clinic. Just to make things interesting, my medical coverage changed on January 1  not my choice as the provider moved everyone to the new plan. When I checked in, I gave them the cards for my then insurance plan as well as the one that would start on the 1st and let them handle it. It caused some confusion with early prescriptions but that resolved eventually. Medicine changes have happened regularly since, keeping hubby on his toes as he prepares my meds. On a positive note, after 1 month of treatment, the HEP-C virus I acquired via the liver transplant is now undetected in my system. I still have 2 more months of treatment followed by 3 more months of testing before they will consider me cured, but I can handle that. I am blessed to have good insurance  the monthly wholesale price of the HEP-C medicine is $13,000 (I only paid $150). We need a better heath care system. I know I am one of the lucky ones who got a liver transplant  many are not eligible or die while waiting. I am grateful for the care I received from my Tucson GI doctor, Cristiana Bortuzzo, over the past 8 years keeping me healthy and the Mayo team over the last 2 years while on the transplant list. I wish that everyone who has a serious health issue could be cared for at a place like Mayo.

My husband was the 26 year old male who received the precious gift from your loved one ..i know there are no words that can express mine and my husbands feelings for your family ;it takes a very special kind of person to make such a sacrifice in their time of grief and need.. I continue to keep you and your loved one in my prayers I wanted to tell you a short summery of who my husband was My husband had diabetes since since he was 9 ..he was on insulin injecting 3+ times a day ..when I met him his diabetes was very uncontrolled and after a couple years it messed up his kidneys and on November 2016 we were given the horrific news that he was going to need dialysis to basically keep him alive ..as you can imagine its not something a young person who is just starting his life wants to hear ..we were both heart broken we knew it was going to be tuff specially with the survival rates  he wanted to live so bad ..he wanted another chance he wanted to be healthy but at the same time he was tired of hospitals ,injections, treatments and now dialysis I did my best to encourage him to keep going forward and to never compare our lives with other peoples .. it was going to be tuff but i always told him GOD IS BIG and he loves us he will cure him and he will live a happy life ..my husband never missed a treatment and we signed up at two different hospitals to get the gift of life with a donor .. I did try to give him one of my kidneys but because of my low weight I wasnt able to also because doctors recommended he get a pancreas and kidney to cure his diabetes as well as his kidney disease ,he honestly struggled a lot during that waiting time there was a lot of times he would end up in the icu due to his illness a lot of hospital stays ..he went from having a caterer on his chest that was connected to his heart to a new better form of dialysis that didnt drain him as much ..he started doing peritoneal dialysis its a form of dialysis done at home instead of 3 times a week at a hospital he had a catheter on his lower stomach and he would connect to a machine that would do the job that hs kidneys couldnt do anymore .. it was a 10 hour treatment we would do it over night but it was still hard on his body he was on many medications for blood pressure as well  we had to go to the hospital a couple times during each month and he would get monthly labs to make sure his dialysis was working okay .. let me tell you it was so hard he was always sad and scared of passing .. he wanted to live more than anything we were so in love he wanted a normal life ..grow old have a family with me and just be hospital free .. we found out the waiting list at Loma Linda for kidney-pancreas organ donation is 10 years ! he didnt believe he would live that long  but months after that on November 2017 his doctors recommended him at mayo clinic in Arizona ..we were told the waiting list there is shorter so we signed him up  on February 14 2018 valentines day we finally got married something we wanted to experience together me 23 years old and him 25 .. on march 2017 we found out I was pregnant .. we were both very excited and now had more reasons to keep going and on may 2017 mayo called and told us they had a donor .. we rushed to mayo and he got your gift of life and let me tell you your loved one really changed his life .. the organs were a perfect match and worked right away .. he was no longer a diabetic he was able to drink a soda and not worry about insulin injections or feeling sick afterwards .. the kidney worked right away as well and he didnt need dialysis any longer ! your beloved ones gift of life changed my husbands life completely .. you have no idea how much .. my husband was living a normal life now and all his doctors always congratulated him and thanked him for always taking care of that precious gift ..my husband never missed an appointment and always did what the doctors wanted him to do to keep them healthy .. please know that he took great care of them and was thankful everyday  we would thank god for the new life my husband was privileged to have and pray for your loved one and your family as well  Edwin is my husbands name .. he wanted to write this letter himself but on November 2018 he had an accident ..not related to your loved ones donation .. it was a fall ..he passed away as well.. I was 8 months pregnant at that time .. I share your pain .. but your loved one had a purpose just like my husband and your loved one is so amazing he gave my husband 6 months of a normal life thanks to your gift  he was happy he was always smiling he got to eat all kind of things he was neer aloud to have and let me tell you he was so thankful in every bite ..he got the chance to go back to work and he developed a new interest in deers .. he enjoyed eating meat a lot and he was even more loving and thankful for life .. although he didnt get the opportunity to meet you guys to thank you .. he left a beautiful baby girl and me behind to do so for him ..i know it was in his to do list he just wanted to to wait for the right time to do so ..you know our baby looks just like him and I just want you guys to know who he was ..that your loved ones gift went to another angel like your loved one he was a donor as well and now 4 more people were given a new chance at life with his organ donations  nothing I say will ease your pain and I can never thank you enough for the big impact your loved one made and continues to do so in our lives .. my husband was a fighter a real warrior and an angel just like your loved one .. if youre interested i would want to know at least a little of the person who gave my husband and myself that enormous gift of life ..whatever your decision is I respect it I will keep you in my heart forever and in my daughters as well.

I continue to keep you and your loved one in my prayers I wanted to tell you a short summery of who my husband was My husband had diabetes since since he was 9 ..he was on insulin injecting 3+ times a day ..when I met him his diabetes was very uncontrolled and after a couple years it messed up his kidneys and on November 2016 we were given the horrific news that he was going to need dialysis to basically keep him alive ..as you can imagine its not something a young person who is just starting his life wants to hear ..we were both heart broken we knew it was going to be tuff specially with the survival rates  he wanted to live so bad ..he wanted another chance he wanted to be healthy but at the same time he was tired of hospitals ,injections, treatments and now dialysis I did my best to encourage him to keep going forward and to never compare our lives with other peoples .. it was going to be tuff but i always told him GOD IS BIG and he loves us he will cure him and he will live a happy life ..my husband never missed a treatment and we signed up at two different hospitals to get the gift of life with a donor .. I did try to give him one of my kidneys but because of my low weight I wasnt able to also because doctors recommended he get a pancreas and kidney to cure his diabetes as well as his kidney disease ,he honestly struggled a lot during that waiting time there was a lot of times he would end up in the icu due to his illness a lot of hospital stays ..he went from having a caterer on his chest that was connected to his heart to a new better form of dialysis that didnt drain him as much ..he started doing peritoneal dialysis its a form of dialysis done at home instead of 3 times a week at a hospital he had a catheter on his lower stomach and he would connect to a machine that would do the job that hs kidneys couldnt do anymore .. it was a 10 hour treatment we would do it over night but it was still hard on his body he was on many medications for blood pressure as well  we had to go to the hospital a couple times during each month and he would get monthly labs to make sure his dialysis was working okay .. let me tell you it was so hard he was always sad and scared of passing .. he wanted to live more than anything we were so in love he wanted a normal life ..grow old have a family with me and just be hospital free .. we found out the waiting list at Loma Linda for kidney-pancreas organ donation is 10 years ! he didnt believe he would live that long  but months after that on November 2017 his doctors recommended him at mayo clinic in Arizona ..we were told the waiting list there is shorter so we signed him up  on February 14 2018 valentines day we finally got married something we wanted to experience together me 23 years old and him 25 .. on march 2017 we found out I was pregnant .. we were both very excited and now had more reasons to keep going and on may 2017 mayo called and told us they had a donor .. we rushed to mayo and he got your gift of life and let me tell you your loved one really changed his life .. the organs were a perfect match and worked right away .. he was no longer a diabetic he was able to drink a soda and not worry about insulin injections or feeling sick afterwards .. the kidney worked right away as well and he didnt need dialysis any longer ! your beloved ones gift of life changed my husbands life completely .. you have no idea how much .. my husband was living a normal life now and all his doctors always congratulated him and thanked him for always taking care of that precious gift ..my husband never missed an appointment and always did what the doctors wanted him to do to keep them healthy .. please know that he took great care of them and was thankful everyday  we would thank god for the new life my husband was privileged to have and pray for your loved one and your family as well  Edwin is my husbands name .. he wanted to write this letter himself but on November 2018 he had an accident ..not related to your loved ones donation .. it was a fall ..he passed away as well.. I was 8 months pregnant at that time .. I share your pain .. but your loved one had a purpose just like my husband and your loved one is so amazing he gave my husband 6 months of a normal life thanks to your gift  he was happy he was always smiling he got to eat all kind of things he was neer aloud to have and let me tell you he was so thankful in every bite ..he got the chance to go back to work and he developed a new interest in deers .. he enjoyed eating meat a lot and he was even more loving and thankful for life .. although he didnt get the opportunity to meet you guys to thank you .. he left a beautiful baby girl and me behind to do so for him ..i know it was in his to do list he just wanted to to wait for the right time to do so ..you know our baby looks just like him and I just want you guys to know who he was ..that your loved ones gift went to another angel like your loved one he was a donor as well and now 4 more people were given a new chance at life with his organ donations  nothing I say will ease your pain and I can never thank you enough for the big impact your loved one made and continues to do so in our lives .. my husband was a fighter a real warrior and an angel just like your loved one .. if youre interested i would want to know at least a little of the person who gave my husband and myself that enormous gift of life ..whatever your decision is I respect it I will keep you in my heart forever and in my daughters as well.

It occurred to me that taking immunosuppressants means I have no defenses to fight this cold off like regular people. This may seem very minor, but what do people do when they have something like this? Antibiotics don't help with a cold of course so what can a person do to lessen the severity and length of time of the cold or whatever else a person may have?

Have many of you experienced these sweats from those pharmaceuticals? There is a thought too that they may be from my thyroid and perhaps my dosage of leverthyroxine should be decreased. I literally get drenched from the top of my head to the soles of my feet. Not pleasant. If you have experienced these lower digestive problems did they finally get resolved, and if so how? I am having a little bit of hair loss too and was told to try taking biotin but the nurse did not say what dosage. Is anyone using that to help with hair loss, and if so what dosage was suggested? Any help or suggestions are appreciated. I sometimes have a hard time getting through to the nurse who is my contact on the transplant team. I positively love my transplant center, MGH, but their one negative is responding to communications. Of course if its serious they do but I think the nurse puts less serious concerns on the back burner and then forgets about them. She is very nice but not terribly helpful.

I weighed about 240 lbs. at the time of transplant; when I returned home I continued to lose down to my lowest since age 14. I stated earlier in the PICS conversation that I had lost a bunch of weight. I actually was able to buy jeans in a size 14. I did not feel right at this weight. Gradually, I regained all of it back. I started my journey in 2010 prior to transplant in 2011. I shared my whole story on PICS and am enjoying this forum to talk about my experiences. I am about to celebrate my 6th year postsurgery for liver/kidney and, although it took me a while to recover, I am doing well at this time. I just need to start working on the weight issues again.

I realize these night sweats are from one of the immunosuppresants, I have not investigated to determine which one, but they are a necessary evil after transplant. Has anyone else suffered with these, and if so is there anything you can do to prevent them? Thankfully they dont last more than 10 minutes but the interruption of sleep is very tiring. It has been suggested to put something cold against your neck but I dont know if once that warms up it will help at all, plus I reposition a lot while I am sleeping. Thanks for any suggestions.

I am a walker and a hiker. I had been walking 4,5,6 miles consistently in May. In mid June, I noticed that my ability to walk, especially on hills, diminished somewhat. An attempted hiking trip was ruined because I had to stop and wait for my breathing and heart to slow down. First week July, walking 2 miles became too much for me. I had difficulty catching my breath and felt my heart pounding. Just last week, a climb up the stairs in my house left me so out of breath that my family physician had me admitted to local hospital for observation. All heart tests have come back negative for heart issues. My next step is to see a pulmonologist.- Now the reason for this post: My dose of Tacrolimus was increased in early June. And my breathlessness thing seems to correspond to that change. My Tacrolimus dosage is lowered to where it was in May. I am experiencing some improvement, ie, I can go up stairs again, I can walk short distances more easily. I am hoping that I will continue to improve. I have already notified my transplant nurse and am waiting for a reply. Has anyone experienced anything like this? I am also in between a taper off and back on prednisone, but those side effects are not in sinc with this. My local doctors are curious, but admit unfamiliarity with Tacrolimus. If you have any similar experience I would appreciate hearing from you. Liked by Colleen Young, Connect Director Follow Report"

We have been with Mayo for almost 4 years. It has been wonderful service. I've also had a great BCBS PPO that was practically seamless. I never saw a bill, just an occasional $20 copay. And then, I turned 65, went on Medicare, and the billing nightmares began. Without a chronic illness, it has taken 18 months for me to realize how difficult this is going to be from now on. In April my wife turns 65, so the billing/paperwork dysfunction will double. Example: Last October my Mayo primary care prescribed a colon cancer screening colonoscopy. It had been 10 years since my last (paid for 100% by BCBS). While there, they found 2 polyps worthy of biopsy. (They were negative.) Mayo filed with Medicare first, as my primary insurance. It turns out that the two procedure codes conflict: one a screening test, the other a diagnostic procedure (the polyp biopsy). Because of the code conflict, Medicare will only pay for one of the two parts. I now have to appeal to Medicare by re-submitting all of Mayo's medical notes myself. Whatever Medicare declines to pay, the secondary (my BCBS) automatically declines to pay as well. Now, two weeks ago I had a $48,000 TKR. I am sure that the surgery was first rate, world class at Mayo. But, I am now watching the billing itemization role in to Medicare. There was, for example, a $3 blood draw charge, an $18.30 EKG for which Medicare has now sent me a $2.98 check to pay Mayo etc etc  up to $48K Sure, Mayo has a great reputation. But as a patient having to deal with these Byzantine medical billing and coding issues, and having to manually pay Mayo with the checks that Medicare sends me, is it worth the time and headaches? I am sure that in a big city like Phoenix, there are plenty of good, qualified doctors who work with Medicare. Why would we stay with Mayo? I see a lot of seniors over at Mayo. How are they dealing with this ?!? Follow Report"

In April my wife turns 65, so the billing/paperwork dysfunction will double. Example: Last October my Mayo primary care prescribed a colon cancer screening colonoscopy. It had been 10 years since my last (paid for 100% by BCBS). While there, they found 2 polyps worthy of biopsy. (They were negative.) Mayo filed with Medicare first, as my primary insurance. It turns out that the two procedure codes conflict: one a screening test, the other a diagnostic procedure (the polyp biopsy). Because of the code conflict, Medicare will only pay for one of the two parts. I now have to appeal to Medicare by re-submitting all of Mayo's medical notes myself. Whatever Medicare declines to pay, the secondary (my BCBS) automatically declines to pay as well. Now, two weeks ago I had a $48,000 TKR. I am sure that the surgery was first rate, world class at Mayo. But, I am now watching the billing itemization role in to Medicare. There was, for example, a $3 blood draw charge, an $18.30 EKG for which Medicare has now sent me a $2.98 check to pay Mayo etc etc  up to $48K Sure, Mayo has a great reputation. But as a patient having to deal with these Byzantine medical billing and coding issues, and having to manually pay Mayo with the checks that Medicare sends me, is it worth the time and headaches? I am sure that in a big city like Phoenix, there are plenty of good, qualified doctors who work with Medicare. Why would we stay with Mayo? I see a lot of seniors over at Mayo. How are they dealing with this ?!? Follow Report"

I explained that we have been given several tentative diagnoses and have had several tests done, but nothing firm was ever diagnosed. We are seeking a second opinion and do not understand why he cannot be seen. I assumed the Mayo Clinic sees many patients with unclear diagnosesany words of advice to get by the appointment gatekeepers?

We always spend winters at our vacation home in Mexico. I became very sick in January with infections in my stomach and urinary tract. I waited too long to see a doctor (the symptoms came and went for a few weeks, until they got really bad in mid-January). When I got to the hospital here, they also ran a CT scan with oral contrast; the results were normal, other than an area of the cecum that was abnormal. The sense of the local Mexican doctor was that it could have been inflamed due to the severity of my infections and he suggested repeating the scan after my treatment. The antibiotics did the trick, and the pain and infections are gone and I am back to normal as of 10+ days ago. They reran the CT scan with contrast a few days ago and there remains an area at the cecum that is described in the first scan (my translation) as ""a narrowing with no obvious thickening"" while the second scan report says, ""irregular conformation in the cecal region and thickening of the wall."" Different radiologists did each report. The doctor suggests a colonoscopy which I would prefer to have in the US. However I cannot get a sense from the local doctor here whether this is something that needs to be done quickly, or if it can wait until our next planned trip to AZ in March. It would be very costly for us to change airline flights and find lodging in February in AZ on short notice (high snowbird season). Like I said, I feel fine but just not sure if this is an emergency or not. Is it possible for Mayo in AZ to read my Mexican CT scans and reports remotely and let me know whether time is of the essence? Just looking for some piece of mind. Follow Report"

I am unable to function mainly due to the fatigue, dizziness, and pain. I cant work (and trust me I want to) and have become majorly dependent financially and in other ways on others. I explained this all when I requested an appointment for mayo, I have no referral but I was told I didnt need to have one for internal medicine. I have no diagnosis with my doctors where I am and truly believe I can expedite getting a diagnosis and shorten my suffering if I can get an appointment at mayo.

A bit of background on my condition: I have classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder. I injured my knee in 2013 (ruptured/torn patellar tendon) and Ive spent the last 6 years trying to get it fixed. Ive had 12 surgeries, a major post-op infection, two allografts, a bunch of hardware, injections, six or seven braces, crutches, a wheelchair, lots of pain, and tons of therapy. I currently have a knee cap that is WAY too high, a patellar tendon that is over twice as long as it should be, MCL and PCL laxity, a knee cap that has been drilled into more times than is probably safe, arthritis, meniscus thats been torn and repaired several times, and probably other things I dont know about. Ive seen the top knee specialist in sports medicine/ortho surgeon in my area, and shes out of ideas (and shes asked around!), hence the visit to Mayo. The connective tissue disorder complicates things because my tissues stretch and my wounds can heal poorly. The past infection also complicates things as Ive had two terrible, unidentifiable infections in that knee (one due to a fall on a treadmill and the other a post-op infection). They never made it in the joint, but they were hard to fight. So, Im coming in knowing what my condition is, what the problem is, how its been treated in the past, my current treatments, etc. There arent many mysteries other than what caused my previous infection, but its not why Im coming to Mayo.

Well he has 2 diagnosis but even with treatment for those he is still sick and getting worse so we believe there is still an underlying issue yet to be found. His symptoms started as GI only but now more recently affect several different body systems (and really they may be completely separate issues not related at all!) and he has had tons of testing already and most being very recently. We have taken the plunge and got an appointment however I am concerned because most of the appointments booked so far look to be heart related and only one GI related way far out (we are on the wait lists for the GI to move it closer). So my first question would be can I call whoever is deciding the appointments and ask to not have any heart related appointments? His heart has been checked extensively out here in Canada and appears to be fine. It looks like his bradycardia is simply a side effect of his hypothyroidism. We do not have unlimited funds and our main reason for wanting to visit Mayo is his unrelenting abdominal pain. In the write up for why we wanted to visit mayo we mentioned all the other symptoms including the slow heart beat in case they are related but it is really just the GI pain that we need figured out. My second question is: I also see on the list of appointments several we just had done in December (EKG and 24 hour holter monitor). I did already ask about those and mentioned they were just recently done and we will be bringing the paperwork regarding those with us and the lady (who is very kind and helpful I may add) said if the Internal Medicine Doctor does not think those are needed they may be cancelled and it is easier to cancel them than to add them in later. My concern is they are on the first day we arrive so are they really going to cancel those so short notice? Again this has to do with my first question above I suppose and us not really being concerned about heart problems. Third and final question (for now!): We had some testing done recently from Germany for infectious diseases and a couple things came up. None of that was sent to Mayo as we only just did it. We feel that it may warrant an appointment with an Infectious Disease Doctor. Should I mention that to the person booking the appointments? I would hate to get out there and then not even be able to get an appointment where we need. I'm not sure which specialties are the hardest to book into. I'm worried I wasn't clear in what we were hoping to accomplish. I am probably over thinking the whole thing Liked by JK, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

Mid-July, after a ton of testing and the only thing consistently abnormal in my blood work for two weeks was a slightly elevated CRP, my primary care doctor said if the multitude of specialists I was seeing didn't come up with anything else, I either needed to ""just push through it"" or apply to Mayo (the slightly elevated CRP could be from something as minor as gingivitis, she said). In August, after the results of my Upper Endoscopy biopsy was negative for H. Pylori (although that's another side story), the gastroenterologist suggested my gastritis could be caused by anxiety.

For the past 2 years, he has been going through medical issues. Different things, one after another. He was a perfectly healthy 27 year old, and then out of no where, all this stuff hit him at once. He has seen so many doctors, that Ive lost count. Hes been on medical leave for almost 2 years now (with a short break in between where we thought he was okay, but then something ELSE popped up) As his partner, it really scares me that no one can diagnose what hes going through and we really want some resolve Ill start from the beginning, but Ill try not to make this too long. It started off with him having bowel issues. He would go to the bathroom 9-10 times a day. Sometimes he would be in the bathroom for half an hour. We thought maybe it was IBS. Maybe Crohns Disease. Eventually, they did a colonoscopy and an endoscopy and they found inflammation in his intestines. Gave him meds, and now the inflammation is gone and we dont worry about that anymore. However  during this time of his bowel issues  he also started getting chest pain, and side/flank pain. After his bowel issues resolved, his side pain is gone, but he still gets random chest pain. No one can figure out why. They did x-rays and EKGs on his heart. Its all good. I looked some stuff up and thought maybe it was pleurisy? Doctors said, very vaguely, he has inflammation in his muscles. One doctor chalked it up to asthma. Another said it was anxiety (which he doesnt have). The only thing that seems to help temporarily is going to a chiropractic neurologist who helps him stretch his chest out. That, plus applying heat to the area. However, it doesnt resolve the issue permanently, and STILL no one can tell us WHAT exactly it is and what is causing the pain. It comes and goes in waves. Fast forward to this past July  he got an ear infection. Didnt worry about it too much. However, he was complaining of INSANE ear pain. We put garlic oil and a couple homemade remedies in his ear to try to help still thinking the pain was from an ear ache. Eventually after a week or so, we took him to the doctor for the second time and they told us that the ear infection was gone. Ok  so what is causing the pain? They said perhaps its a damaged nerve. So they referred him to a neurologist. First one told him it was all in his head Needless to say, we were NOT happy hearing that. So he started seeing a different neurologist. This new neurologist says MAYBE its migraines. From what hes telling me, what hes feeling is like lightning shocks of pain in his face. They come on unexpectedly out of the blue, then it subsides. Aside from that, sometimes the left side of his face just hurts and he says it feels like his left eye is bigger or feelings like its coming out, due to the pain only on one side of his face. Hes got blood work done, xrays, a brain scan.. Nothing. We thought MAYBE it was an autoimmune disease? So he tested for a bunch. All came back negative. Cancer came back negative. While all of these tests coming back negative is a great relief because it tells us what he doesnt have  it also causes a lot of grief because NOTHING is telling us what he DOES have. And as if that isnt enough  he recently started getting random leg pain. Every day. His legs will be so sore to the point where he doesnt want to move. He CAN move, but he doesnt want to. All were hearing is a lot of guesses, but NO DIAGNOSES. Neurologist says maybe its a migraine thats so bad that its affecting his legs.. But, I just dont think this is a migraine. So to sum up: Hes suffering from random chest pains that come and go, face paint on one side of his face, and extreme leg soreness. Were at the end of our rope here. I found Mayo Clinic and I know they deal with rare conditions.

For the past 2 years, he has been going through medical issues. Different things, one after another. He was a perfectly healthy 27 year old, and then out of no where, all this stuff hit him at once. He has seen so many doctors, that Ive lost count. Hes been on medical leave for almost 2 years now (with a short break in between where we thought he was okay, but then something ELSE popped up) As his partner, it really scares me that no one can diagnose what hes going through and we really want some resolve Ill start from the beginning, but Ill try not to make this too long. It started off with him having bowel issues. He would go to the bathroom 9-10 times a day. Sometimes he would be in the bathroom for half an hour. We thought maybe it was IBS. Maybe Crohns Disease. Eventually, they did a colonoscopy and an endoscopy and they found inflammation in his intestines. Gave him meds, and now the inflammation is gone and we dont worry about that anymore. However  during this time of his bowel issues  he also started getting chest pain, and side/flank pain. After his bowel issues resolved, his side pain is gone, but he still gets random chest pain. No one can figure out why. They did x-rays and EKGs on his heart. Its all good. I looked some stuff up and thought maybe it was pleurisy? Doctors said, very vaguely, he has inflammation in his muscles. One doctor chalked it up to asthma. Another said it was anxiety (which he doesnt have). The only thing that seems to help temporarily is going to a chiropractic neurologist who helps him stretch his chest out. That, plus applying heat to the area. However, it doesnt resolve the issue permanently, and STILL no one can tell us WHAT exactly it is and what is causing the pain. It comes and goes in waves. Fast forward to this past July  he got an ear infection. Didnt worry about it too much. However, he was complaining of INSANE ear pain. We put garlic oil and a couple homemade remedies in his ear to try to help still thinking the pain was from an ear ache. Eventually after a week or so, we took him to the doctor for the second time and they told us that the ear infection was gone. Ok  so what is causing the pain? They said perhaps its a damaged nerve. So they referred him to a neurologist. First one told him it was all in his head Needless to say, we were NOT happy hearing that. So he started seeing a different neurologist.

So they referred him to a neurologist. First one told him it was all in his head Needless to say, we were NOT happy hearing that. So he started seeing a different neurologist. This new neurologist says MAYBE its migraines. From what hes telling me, what hes feeling is like lightning shocks of pain in his face. They come on unexpectedly out of the blue, then it subsides. Aside from that, sometimes the left side of his face just hurts and he says it feels like his left eye is bigger or feelings like its coming out, due to the pain only on one side of his face. Hes got blood work done, xrays, a brain scan.. Nothing. We thought MAYBE it was an autoimmune disease? So he tested for a bunch. All came back negative. Cancer came back negative. While all of these tests coming back negative is a great relief because it tells us what he doesnt have  it also causes a lot of grief because NOTHING is telling us what he DOES have. And as if that isnt enough  he recently started getting random leg pain. Every day. His legs will be so sore to the point where he doesnt want to move. He CAN move, but he doesnt want to. All were hearing is a lot of guesses, but NO DIAGNOSES. Neurologist says maybe its a migraine thats so bad that its affecting his legs.. But, I just dont think this is a migraine. So to sum up: Hes suffering from random chest pains that come and go, face paint on one side of his face, and extreme leg soreness. Were at the end of our rope here. I found Mayo Clinic and I know they deal with rare conditions. Ive read articles where people who havent been able to get diagnoses for years, and then they go to Mayo Clinic and get a diagnoses within a week of being there.

For the past 2 years, he has been going through medical issues. Different things, one after another. He was a perfectly healthy 27 year old, and then out of no where, all this stuff hit him at once. He has seen so many doctors, that Ive lost count. Hes been on medical leave for almost 2 years now (with a short break in between where we thought he was okay, but then something ELSE popped up) As his partner, it really scares me that no one can diagnose what hes going through and we really want some resolve Ill start from the beginning, but Ill try not to make this too long. It started off with him having bowel issues. He would go to the bathroom 9-10 times a day. Sometimes he would be in the bathroom for half an hour. We thought maybe it was IBS. Maybe Crohns Disease. Eventually, they did a colonoscopy and an endoscopy and they found inflammation in his intestines. Gave him meds, and now the inflammation is gone and we dont worry about that anymore. However  during this time of his bowel issues  he also started getting chest pain, and side/flank pain. After his bowel issues resolved, his side pain is gone, but he still gets random chest pain. No one can figure out why. They did x-rays and EKGs on his heart. Its all good. I looked some stuff up and thought maybe it was pleurisy? Doctors said, very vaguely, he has inflammation in his muscles. One doctor chalked it up to asthma. Another said it was anxiety (which he doesnt have). The only thing that seems to help temporarily is going to a chiropractic neurologist who helps him stretch his chest out. That, plus applying heat to the area. However, it doesnt resolve the issue permanently, and STILL no one can tell us WHAT exactly it is and what is causing the pain. It comes and goes in waves. Fast forward to this past July  he got an ear infection. Didnt worry about it too much. However, he was complaining of INSANE ear pain. We put garlic oil and a couple homemade remedies in his ear to try to help still thinking the pain was from an ear ache. Eventually after a week or so, we took him to the doctor for the second time and they told us that the ear infection was gone. Ok  so what is causing the pain? They said perhaps its a damaged nerve. So they referred him to a neurologist. First one told him it was all in his head Needless to say, we were NOT happy hearing that. So he started seeing a different neurologist.

After that killed me, literally, was on life support for a week after they finally revived me, I tapered myself off almost all of them and now not seeing a dr regularly I have to get some of my meds from people who no longer need theirs or had a death from a family member who used them or if it is something my vet can prescribe I go that route or ask at the er if they'll write it with refills when it comes to my inhalers.

I dont faint, Im not lightheaded, theyre not drop attacks (theyre not random), its not deconditioning, its not paralysis, Im not sure if its strength or fatigue or what, but on good days I can use cane/crutches (or clench all my muscles really hard to give me an extra few minutes of standing time); on bad days I just collapse. Still continuing (although a little better than it was 1 yr ago); only thing that works to manage it is mobility aids, sleep, and a lot of sit-down and lie-down breaks; still no answers. #2 is a symptom cluster  episodes of confusion, visual disturbance, double vision, sometimes not recognizing faces of people I know, sometimes not being able to talk (or talking very labored and slurred), partial paralysis (bottom half  sometimes lasts 20 mins, sometimes 24-72hrs) or more widespread paralysis (episode aura hit, then couldnt move anything but my eyes, and it took 1-3hrs for everything else to come back (legs always the last thing).

All the doctors Ive consulted for answers to #1-3 have either said a) its in your head, b) _()_/, or c) go to Mayo, so I made an appointment. I got my prearranged schedule packet in the mail, though, and they put me in pain management and the Fibromyalgia Integrative Medicine and Health Self-Management program (with one neurology consult and one neurophysiology consult). I dont need pain management  pain isnt my problem  and I cant mindfulness meditate away not being able to stand up. Im looking for a dx, or at least something other than _()_/. So, my question  do I call them and tell them that the pain management stuff isnt necessary, that Im looking for answers for #1-3? Would my schedule change when I got there to my initial evaluation and I told them all this? I dont want to be labeled difficult or treatment resistant or noncompliant, but spending 4 days out of a 7-day visit in a clinical program I dont need or want (plus the money to travel there!!!) seems like a total waste of time for me and everyone there.

Over the last three years I have been having seizures again, lately I had six seizures over the last five months. So I plan to fly out to a Mayo Clinic very soon, but would like more details from those that have been to the clinic. Here a list of questions. Out of all the Mayo clinics out there, which one has the latest and most advance diagnosis tools for Epilepsy? Im hoping with the latest diagnosis, they can isolate which part of my brain is giving me issues. Im been told that I would need to spend 5 to 7 business days. Just looking for a basic Idea what happens during this time, I understand that each person visit is different. Ill have to stay at a Hotel for my visit. Are there places pretty close to the clinic? Ill will not be allow to drive. During this test period, does a single Doctor work with you or is it more like a team of Doctors? Anything else that you can think of would be very help.

I joined this group with the hope that I can come to Mayo as prepared as possible. Ill be coming out to see a medical geneticist on Jan 3rd to be evaluated for a connective tissue disorder. So far I only have one appt scheduled but in addition to the genetics group, I know I will need to see at least a cardiologist and possibly a pulmonologist, ortho, thoracic surgeon and possibly a vascular surgeon. Im not comfortable booking a hotel room, taking off of work and traveling all the way out there for ONE appointment. I know my paperwork says to prepare for 5-7 business days but I feel like I should call and schedule more appts myself with the other doctors? How efficient is this system? I hear good things but this is not what Im used to! As of now, I see a medical geneticist for a 90-120min appointment on Jan 3rd. Which gives me the rest of Wed, Thurs and Fri and Im hoping to be heading home after those 3 days without having to stay for the weekend. Ay advice about visiting the medical genetics groups would be helpful. Especially if you went for a connective tissue disease! My medical history is a bit long so Ill try to sum it up as best as possible so you know why I am coming out to Rochester when I have access to great doctors in Chicago. My strange medical history goes back to 2004-2006 when I had 5 spontaneous pneumothoraces (collapsed lungs). I ended up having surgery on my left lung in 2006 (VATS with blebectomy, wedge resection and mechanical pleurodesis). I was healthy for many years until 2014 when I tore the labrum in my left hip and had surgery to fix that and the FAI. I then tore the right labrum in 2016 and had the same surgery to fix that hip. My right lung then got jealous and collapsed Aug 24th, 2017. After giving my history to the doctors, I had nearly 6 of them say, you need to go to Mayo, this isnt normal. Okay, okay, it wasnt the first time a doctor thought I was a medical mystery. In 2006, I had 3 pulmonologists and a thoracic surgeon ask if I had been tested for a connective tissue disorder. I looked at them cock-eyed. That was my first time hearing connective tissue disorder. I forgot about it until 2014 when I had a CT scan for chronic abdominal pain and the tech took one look at my tall, thin, lanky body and asked if Id been evaluated for Marfan Syndrome (a connective tissue disorder). I told him about 2006 and that I had been asked the same question back then, so I decided to finally follow through. Saw a cardiologist at Northwestern who specializes in Marfan Syndome in woman. She said I was borderline because I had enough minor characteristics but no major characteristics. She said a genetic test would be the only way to know for sure but I declined at the time. My echo at the time (2014) showed 3 leaky valves but they were all functional. When I started having back/rib/chest/abdominal pain in April 2017, all on my right side, I tried every doctor and test to figure it out. MRIs were normal, xrays were normal, bloodwork normal. A rheumatologist at Rush concluded I had a connective tissue disorder but he could not pinpoint which one. A vascular surgeon at Cleveland Clinic and North Shore (Chicago) both thought I had a vascular compression disorder affecting my celiac artery. An interventional radiologist disagreed and did an arteriogram showing I was born without a celiac artery and rather, I have a mild compression of my splenic artery. There is NO research or published literature showing a connection between a splenic artery compression and right sided abdominal pain. He suspected it was my lung the whole time causing the pain and did intercostal nerve blocks to prove it. My lung collapsed while I was going through this diagnostic process and while in the hospital, I had a new echo that showed my mitral valve, while functional, is degenerating. Im coming to Mayo primarily to see if a connective tissues disorder is the underlying cause of my multiple bleb-induced bilateral spontaneous pneumothoraces. But I also need to talk to a cardiologist about my mitral valve degenerating. Oh and maybe a sports medicine doctor since I train and race long distance triathlon (Ironman distance) so Id like to know my risk of sudden death from heart failure. But at the same time, since I am coming to the best hospital in the US, I figured Id sort out the celiac artery/not-celiac artery/splenic artery compression. I just wish the appt scheduling was a bit more organized ahead of time to make sure everything is covered! Although it does seem like once Im there, everything will be looked at so I go home with some answers and a game plan. Liked by Kelly, Alumna Mentor Follow Report"

When I started having back/rib/chest/abdominal pain in April 2017, all on my right side, I tried every doctor and test to figure it out. MRIs were normal, xrays were normal, bloodwork normal. A rheumatologist at Rush concluded I had a connective tissue disorder but he could not pinpoint which one. A vascular surgeon at Cleveland Clinic and North Shore (Chicago) both thought I had a vascular compression disorder affecting my celiac artery. An interventional radiologist disagreed and did an arteriogram showing I was born without a celiac artery and rather, I have a mild compression of my splenic artery. There is NO research or published literature showing a connection between a splenic artery compression and right sided abdominal pain. He suspected it was my lung the whole time causing the pain and did intercostal nerve blocks to prove it. My lung collapsed while I was going through this diagnostic process and while in the hospital, I had a new echo that showed my mitral valve, while functional, is degenerating. Im coming to Mayo primarily to see if a connective tissues disorder is the underlying cause of my multiple bleb-induced bilateral spontaneous pneumothoraces. But I also need to talk to a cardiologist about my mitral valve degenerating. Oh and maybe a sports medicine doctor since I train and race long distance triathlon (Ironman distance) so Id like to know my risk of sudden death from heart failure. But at the same time, since I am coming to the best hospital in the US, I figured Id sort out the celiac artery/not-celiac artery/splenic artery compression. I just wish the appt scheduling was a bit more organized ahead of time to make sure everything is covered!

My medical history is a bit long so Ill try to sum it up as best as possible so you know why I am coming out to Rochester when I have access to great doctors in Chicago. My strange medical history goes back to 2004-2006 when I had 5 spontaneous pneumothoraces (collapsed lungs). I ended up having surgery on my left lung in 2006 (VATS with blebectomy, wedge resection and mechanical pleurodesis). I was healthy for many years until 2014 when I tore the labrum in my left hip and had surgery to fix that and the FAI. I then tore the right labrum in 2016 and had the same surgery to fix that hip. My right lung then got jealous and collapsed Aug 24th, 2017. After giving my history to the doctors, I had nearly 6 of them say, you need to go to Mayo, this isnt normal. Okay, okay, it wasnt the first time a doctor thought I was a medical mystery. In 2006, I had 3 pulmonologists and a thoracic surgeon ask if I had been tested for a connective tissue disorder. I looked at them cock-eyed. That was my first time hearing connective tissue disorder. I forgot about it until 2014 when I had a CT scan for chronic abdominal pain and the tech took one look at my tall, thin, lanky body and asked if Id been evaluated for Marfan Syndrome (a connective tissue disorder). I told him about 2006 and that I had been asked the same question back then, so I decided to finally follow through. Saw a cardiologist at Northwestern who specializes in Marfan Syndome in woman.

I have to battle with my former employer to pay for my knee replacement and I want but now they have put down Things that need to be done before I can have my surgery. I need to get off the pain pills I need to make sure my dental is in good health and they want me to lose more weight. I was taking 3 methadone pills thats 30 milligrams every 6 hours and also Vicodin as needed in between. I suffer a lot with my eating problem because of having that surgery I get sick very often on foods that I eat what the bad part is that one day I can tolerate one type of food and the next day I can eat the same thing and it will get me sick. Losing the weight has been the hardest thing to do one would think that getting off the pain meds would be the hardest but it is but it is something that I am accomplishing. I have an appointment to get admitted into a hospital to help me get off the pain meds but I have reduced the amount that I take considerably on my own even though I have had many withdrawals in many different ways like my mood swings are really bad I get fevers my body aches so much But I needed to start it while trying to lose more weight and do the other things that need to get done so I can have the knee replacement. when I had the injury I had gained almost up to 400 pounds and I was told I was too young to have knee replacement so I was told I needed to have the gastric bypass if not they did not expect me to live another 5 years so having that choice I had to have the surgery I lost down to 200 pounds and I kept it down for quite a while but then my knee started to get worse and I gain weight up to 275 I have not been able Toulouse to go back down to the 200 I lost 25 and I am at 250 I just cannot lose more then that. this is just so hard to do cold hurts my bones and I dont want to leave my room I try and watch what I eat. I try very hard to do the things I need to get done but I am in my room most of the time not wanting to leave Cold hurts my bones and theres just not much I want to do because I cannot stand for a long time or walk for a long time and I feel very uncomfortable going out even to my childrens home when I go for a visit I just want to rush back home. Im looking for is a doctor that is willing to do the knee replacement even though I weigh 250 pounds Ive been battling with this for the last three years first trying to get my former job to pay for my knee replacement but in that time that I was waiting is when I gain the weight that now is preventing me from having the surgery. I am right now taking only one pill every 6 hours of the methadone and sometimes just to a day ice take the Vicodin when I feel that Im eating another methadone I feel that that is one of the Lesser evils so I really cant say how many Vicodins I take a day but maybe 3 at the most I still want to go into treatment at the hospital in patients so they could find another type of pain medication that is not open that will help me with my knee pain. I know that something was tried in the beginning that was not open and it did not work I cant remember what medication they put me on and it just did not work and this is what made my doctor put me on methadone and Vicodin but I am willing to try again and find something else I hate taking pain medication I hate taking medication at all for anything but the pain medication I was not aware of all the side effects that it has and I am paying the price for that now losing my teeth is something that is dreadful for me and did not expect my family keep their teeth to very old but I am not one of those because of the medication Ive been taking. there is no way I could save any of my teeth anymore and already Ventures are being mentioned and Ive been wanting to have the transplant or permanent transplant but I cant afford it and my priority is the knee replacement my doctor every time I go ahead put that as a reason not to get it done is because of my weight Ive already taken most of my teeth out and I can get an okay from my dentist saying I could have the surgery but in regards to the pain medication I am going to get admitted in a week or two to the hospital to get off of what I have been taking recently and hopefully find another medication that is not open to take the pain away that I feel I am doing everything I am being told but the weight loss is just something I cannot get done I cant afford any weight loss meals like Nutrisystem or or Jenny Craig I am in debt and my husband is one paying all the bills I just having a hard time losing the 25 pounds a doctor wants me to lose to have this surgery so I need to find a doctor that is willing to do the surgery with the way that I am now I am happy with my weight I dont feel that I am overweight I am not looking to be a model or someone that needs to be very active I just want a normal life to enjoy my family and find a job that I like and can do knee replacement is a hardship for some but it is doable surgery still can be done but I need to fin doctor that can work with me and do this I have a lawyer who I need to talk to to see if I could change doctors because this doctor doesnt seem to wanna work with the weight that I am on now I already lost a lot with the bypass that I had I cant do no more can you help me Follow Report"

994,C0270724,Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy,C0037088,Signs and Symptoms,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/insurance-question/,Insurance Question,"I am scheduled to visit the Rochester Mayo Clinic, which is in my insurance network. This is a question that is specific to how a facility such as the Mayo Clinic works with insurance, so please dont tell me to contact my insurance company :-), other than telling me is that Im in network, the information Ive gotten from my insurance company is lacking. I have been given only an initial appointment, and told to plan on being in Rochester for a week. I assume the initial appointment will determine what additional tests need to be done during that week. With all other significant tests (at other facilities) to date, what always happens is the doctors office submits requests to the insurance company for approval, then I wait several days for the approval, and only then are the tests scheduled days or weeks later. Since it appears the Mayo Clinic uses a shotgun approach (I used that term in the most positive of ways), and evidently a lot of tests are all going to happen within this one week, how will I know the tests being done will be covered? In other words, if Im showing up on Monday, and theyre actually going to be doing tests that week, it seems as though there would not be time for the insurance company to approve the tests? Will the Mayo Clinic be getting approvals, or are they somehow immune from this requirement? Ive had very bad experiences with insurance companies and my worst fear is going home and finding out I have a hundred thousands dollars worth of bills my insurance company does not approve. Thank you in advance for any insight you can provide. Follow Report"

Besides arthritis and several bad discs I have pain in my muscles and sometimes feel like I am being poked by my bones. I exercise daily, that and ice and Voltaren Jell are the only things that keep me for going mad from the pain. I have been thru everything, short of surgery. But I am writing for my husband, not myself. I had a very bad experience. Although my mris were 3 years old they didnt take new ones. They did some blood tests and were very nice, but all they ended up doing was suggesting I go to physical therapy, (we are a 6 hour drive round trip from them and I had done the physical therapy locally with no relief) All they ended up telling me was it was a mystery why I was/am in so much pain, but my back was to far gone for surgery, although the surgeon chose not to see me personally. I was not seeking drugs, I have been thru the pain management w/drugs and it almost killed me. I was pretty much shuffled out after a few hours and we had set such high hopes on the Mayo Clinic being the answer My husband is having a number of issues, pain in his legs, he had lime disease when he lived up north and we dont know if that is a factor. He has terrible trouble with his stomach, and has had is gallbladder removed some time ago. He has been tested for just about everything here, and no one seems to be able to find anything. He is depressed, and getting more and more withdrawn. We want to give it another try but dont know how to make sure we get the full value of a trip up there. Our primary doctor cant seem to help and I dont know where to start. We have BC/BS and I am wondering if the MC really doesnt like dealing with it? How do we figure out who we will be seeing in advance. What info to have collected, anything anyone can think of that might help his visit work out better than mine.. we are getting desperate. Michael is 63, as am I, a little over weight, but not bad. Better diet than most, we used to walk daily, but he doesnt seem to have the energy for that anymore.
