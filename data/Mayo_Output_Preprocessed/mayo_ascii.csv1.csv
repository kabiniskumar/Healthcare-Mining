It came on very suddenly and has been constant and severe (8-9/10). He had many tests done with no answers before being referred to a pain clinic where he has been a patient the past 3 months. He has been given a vague diagnosis of a nerve injury or myofascial pain. He had a nerve block injection in July which was not successful, however the lidocaine injection that preceded it did relieve his pain for about 30 minutes. He has a rigorous physio therapy and psychology regime, and though his coping and function have improved he has had no relief of pain. He is vomiting daily from pain and only managing 1-2 hours of school daily (with a huge effort). He has been able to be very active, but needs to regulate the intensity of activity as deep breathing increases his pain. There seems to be some connection with the diaphragm/psoas. Just looking for others who have perhaps dealt with similar issues and ideas of what has helped. So far nothing provides even the slightest relief. Follow Report"

His last episode was him sitting at a dinner table, when all of the sudden he experienced what he believed to be a bright light coming towards him. He completely zoned out, terrified of this light approaching him, and was drenched in sweat in the following minutes. He did not experience a seizure at this time, as his family was nearby him and were able to speak to him and calm him down. Has anyone had a similar experience? This is very strange behavior, and we believe there may be something else to it other than chronic seizures. Some additional information: the child also experienced a very short migraine like head pain immediately after the bright light. Liked by Leonard Follow Report"

37,C0085207,Gestational Diabetes,C0683369,Clouded consciousness,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/iron-supplementation-guidance-for-infants/,Iron Supplementation Guidance for Infants,"Hi folks, The American Academy of Pediatrics' official guidance essentially states all exclusively (or primarily) breastfed infants should receive iron supplementation at four months of age (at 1 mg/kg/day dosage). The guidance of universal supplementation is widely-cited by countless healthcare sources, particularly American ones, including the Mayo Clinic's own website. However, there appears to be unsettled controversy, confusion, and disagreement with these guidelines. For example, the WHO, Canadian Pediatric Society, and every Pediatrician I've spoken with does not suggest universal supplementation at four months. In fact, in April 2011, a letter to the an AAP Journal editor, sent on behalf of the AAP Section on Breastfeeding, was published citing ""major concerns"" about the guidance of universal supplementation  highlighting the fact that there is disagreement within their very own organizational members. There are several websites, albeit generally not ones of major American medical institutions, that seem to credibly discuss the potential hazards of this guidance and the flaws in the original small-scale study that was the basis of this recommendation. There is even at least one study that seems to indicate universal supplementation at that age might be more detrimental than helpful overall. I understand every infant is different  and factors such as low birth weight, premature delivery, and even gestational diabetes can have an impact on iron stores. The vast majority of an infant's store is accumulated in the last trimester. Perhaps the safest guidance is ""consult with your Pediatrician."" Yet, I imagine viewpoints vary  and I have both a point of discussion and concern: 1. I would love to gather more information on how other healthcare professionals think about and make this decision of whether to supplement at four months or not, and learn about the various viewpoints that may exist. I would love to hear from this community on this topic. 2. I am concerned that by not clarifying, revisiting, or outright changing the AAP guidance provided, a disservice is being done to the community at large. While this issue has been seemingly left unaddressed for nearly a decade  the importance of the matter remains, along with the confusion it has caused for what I can only imagine is countless healthcare professionals and parents who encounter conflicting guidance. At worst, it seems possible that this guidance could be detrimental to some. It is amplified by the fact that it is widely-quoted. To that end, I have reached out to the AAP highlighting the concern and requesting further clarification on this matter. Appreciate any thoughts and insights. My intent is one of a good faith effort to promote the publication of better, clearer, and hopefully less controversial guidance on this matter, as I believe that would be in everybody's best interest. Again, I would love to hear from this community on how folks approach and think about this potentially consequential decision. Thanks, Pankaj Follow Report"

In January she had a really bad cold and missed several days of school. Just when we thought she was better she got a headache that didnt go away for several weeks. Once the head started to ease up she became very week, tired and extremely dizzy. There are days that she can barley make it to the bathroom. Our family doctor sent us to a Neurologist. We didnt get any answers. We then went to a cardiologist still no answers. Meanwhile my daughter has been in counseling to see if there is something else going on. My daughter is a very happy out going kiddo. She had a great group of friends and does well in school. She has missed out on so many activities in the last several months.

Talkative and excessively hyper are words that have always been closely assosciated with me. Also, lack of attention was a topic often talked about between my teachers parents, and a goal they often set for me. My parents, who I dont blame whatsoever, dismissed these as issues requiring a doctor and figured I would grow out of this, which makes sense considering these were in my elementary days. Now, atleast 4 years later, I still experience all of these issues and more, at a heightened amount. As far as attention, I feel like I have no choice and fall victum to it. I can be paying attention to the most interesting thing and boom, my imagination swoops me out of wherever and I cant pull my head out of the sky until it falls. I never felt weird in my hyperness, but my friends would often be like chill and I would be confused because I didnt realize I wasnt being chill. Anyways, to sum things up, I think I might talk to my parents and pediatrician, but I dont want it to to seem like a cry for attention or such sorts. Should I talk to my parents/doctor about it or is this a normal experience for high schoolers? If I should seek help about this, I dont really know how to. How do I?

It began when she was 3, she began bruising very easily & often. We were sent to a Hemotologist, who diagnosed her with ITP, or idiopathic thrombocytopenia. While testing her bone marrow due to the ITP, the doctors also diagnosed her with hypothyroidism, & started her on levothyroxin to control that. She was never symptomatic with the hypothyroidism, & all of the symptoms of it were opposite her, but Endocrine doctors assured us that she needed to be treated, so we remain on the meds for that all these years later. On top of those two issues, when she was 5, she developed a Giant central cell granuloma in her lower left mandible, which was so rare that none of the doctors we saw had ever seen a case of it. They treated her with daily calcitonin injections for 18 months hoping the tumor would shrink. The injections did seem to prohibit further growth, but were not shrinking the tumor, so they decided to remove it, which went well & she has has no regrowth so far. About a year after that hurdle, she developed migraines, as well as severe leg pains. For the past 3 years we have been sent to specialist after specialist trying to figure out what is causing her to have this pain. Her legs have gotten so bad that we are considering the use of a wheelchair for her, since she cannot go any distance without suffering for days. The pain & lack of treatment for it have led her to be considerablely depressed. The depression recently got so bad she was feeling suicidal, which I took her to the ER for & was told she was being sent home due to them not feeling she was suicidal enough. So, Im wondering, 1. Any ideas on what kind of specialist who could possibly help in getting a definitive diagnosis for her pain and 2. What not suicidal enough even means. Because honestly, I think being suicidal at all & being brave enough to ask for help should be way more than enough to get some help! Im very worried & extremely desperate to get this beautiful child the help shes so desperately in need of. Exhausted kid, Exhausted mom, need expert advice to see some hope.

We pushed on for a diagnosis and finally got a diagnosis of Autonomic Dysfunction at the Mayo clinic last summer. If you are a parent with a child like mine, Id love to connect.

She is not getting good sleep because this bubble wakes her up, she has dark circles around her eyes, and she is constantly tired. We have brought her to out pediatrician, they did an x-ray which she thought looked normal, bloodwork which was fine and autoimmune tests (celiac) which was negative. They put her on antacids and said it must be acid reflux, but the medication has not helped and the bubble in constantly there and my poor daughter is not herself and completely run down. I also worry because she has been sick since the end of December every two weeks with some sort of illness. The end of December she had 103 temperature and was having labored breathing, headache and cough at times  they said it was croup. She seemed to get bette than two weeks later had bad headaches, tired constantly, had stuffed up nose, hard to breathe they said they could test her for pneumonia but when listening to her chest she sounded ok. She got better for a couple weeks than end of January she had bad headaches, congested, body aches and tired all the time. They said it was a sinus infection. She got better for a week and a half and then came home one night after school and started vomiting she threw up at least 15 times and could not even lay down or take a spoonful of water or it would come right back up. She got better for a week and now we are dealing with this feeling of a bubble in her throat, headaches and nauseas all the time and this has been going on since March 7th. Oh and after they did her stomach x-ray that looked normal the radiologist called my pediatrician to say there is a tumor on her hip they found so we need to bring her back and do a hip x-ray. They said after the hip x-ray that it seems to be benign. I just worry with her immune system getting kicked down all the time and in a house of 6 she is the only one getting sick constantly. I don;t know if it is a gastro issue, auto immune issue, or what to do. My daughter asks me if she is ever going to feel normal and good again??

Other than the scabs hurting, I feel perfectly fine. No fever, no other symptoms. I am staying home from school, but we have been planning this trip for months and I have been really looking forward to it. Follow Report"

It all started with a cold, I have two other kids 6 year old and 2 year old perfectly healthy. They all got sick at the same time but the baby never seem to get better. It was nonstop mucus to the point I had to do nasal irrigation everyday sometimes multiple times. The first time I took him to the dr. He was prescribed augmentum antibiotic. Still on the antibiotic he kept having alot of mucus secretion though it had change colors, from yellow, greenish to clear. I communicated this to his pediatrician and he advice to finish the antibiotic treatment. The minute he was done he began to have the same mucus and fevers. i changed three pediatrician at this point he had been already on 4 different antibiotics and none worked. I finally got a dr. To listen and sent me to an ENT which immediately stated he had chronic sinus infection he needed his adenoids removed and clean him up. He actually grew a lump on the parotid gland ( a lymph node got swollen). She than changed him to another antibiotic, by the fifth day on the antibiotic he started having high fevers and was just miserable but I was out of the area. I reached out to the ENT she recommended to see another ENT where I was. This ENT saw my baby and immediately addressed a concern on his enlarged lymph nodes. He did say he had a chronic sinus infection but he was more concern about the lymph nodes. I left there with another antibiotic and his recommendation that he needed surgery immediately because he was extremely congested. I head back and surgery was perform he had his adenoids removed, and put some tubes in his ears ( at that point he had bad ear infection). They took cultures of his sinus which stated he had H influenza, adenovirus, pseudonomas and endovirus. Once the surgery was done we head home two days later he was left in observation. Once home the lump started to grow dramatically. I head back to the EnT they perform a ct scan and he gets hospitalize again to get antibiotics thru the IV. Infectious disease gets involve and they discover that the antibiotic he was in was not covering the pseudonomas so we left home with another antibiotic (levoquin) 8th antibiotic at this point. 2 weeks later he creates an abscess, back to the surgery room to drain it and get a biopsy. Immunology gets involve and they start making test at first one of the test stated he had very low DHR which lead them to believe he had CGD. They did a repeat and the numbers came normal. PCR came negative for atypical mycobacterium but Infectious disease swears he has a mycobacteria so he was put on azithromycin and rafampin. This has been three months he has been on those antibiotics and he still has inflammation and swelling. Immunology continues their work up and find that he might have a bcell disorder. It stated that his transitional b cells are enlarged and his memory b cell are very small amount. But with even these results they decide not to proceed with anything since he is very young in age plus he was looking stable. Now he has another sinus infection and ear infection. ENT performed an MRI and confirmed he has severe edema so refuse to go in and remove the infected lymph node. At this point nothing has grown on the cultures , we cant confirm he has an atypical mycobacteria. When they did biopsy the lymph node pathology found necrosis and granulatomous. And that is the only thing that leads to believe it is a mycobacteria. But besides the mycobacteria he keeps getting these infections and bacteria and though immunology had those results from the b cells they believe he might not have an underlying issue or maybe it was just bad luck. I see him getting sicker by the minute even under those antibiotics. I have to do the nasal irrigation twice a day and its chunk and chunks of mucus. Something is not right and I would hate to see him get chronically sick as he was with the sinus just because we are waiting to see if he grows out of it.

I reached out to the ENT she recommended to see another ENT where I was. This ENT saw my baby and immediately addressed a concern on his enlarged lymph nodes. He did say he had a chronic sinus infection but he was more concern about the lymph nodes. I left there with another antibiotic and his recommendation that he needed surgery immediately because he was extremely congested. I head back and surgery was perform he had his adenoids removed, and put some tubes in his ears ( at that point he had bad ear infection). They took cultures of his sinus which stated he had H influenza, adenovirus, pseudonomas and endovirus. Once the surgery was done we head home two days later he was left in observation. Once home the lump started to grow dramatically. I head back to the EnT they perform a ct scan and he gets hospitalize again to get antibiotics thru the IV. Infectious disease gets involve and they discover that the antibiotic he was in was not covering the pseudonomas so we left home with another antibiotic (levoquin) 8th antibiotic at this point. 2 weeks later he creates an abscess, back to the surgery room to drain it and get a biopsy. Immunology gets involve and they start making test at first one of the test stated he had very low DHR which lead them to believe he had CGD. They did a repeat and the numbers came normal. PCR came negative for atypical mycobacterium but Infectious disease swears he has a mycobacteria so he was put on azithromycin and rafampin. This has been three months he has been on those antibiotics and he still has inflammation and swelling. Immunology continues their work up and find that he might have a bcell disorder. It stated that his transitional b cells are enlarged and his memory b cell are very small amount. But with even these results they decide not to proceed with anything since he is very young in age plus he was looking stable. Now he has another sinus infection and ear infection. ENT performed an MRI and confirmed he has severe edema so refuse to go in and remove the infected lymph node. At this point nothing has grown on the cultures , we cant confirm he has an atypical mycobacteria. When they did biopsy the lymph node pathology found necrosis and granulatomous. And that is the only thing that leads to believe it is a mycobacteria. But besides the mycobacteria he keeps getting these infections and bacteria and though immunology had those results from the b cells they believe he might not have an underlying issue or maybe it was just bad luck. I see him getting sicker by the minute even under those antibiotics. I have to do the nasal irrigation twice a day and its chunk and chunks of mucus. Something is not right and I would hate to see him get chronically sick as he was with the sinus just because we are waiting to see if he grows out of it. What I do know is all these recurrent infections are not normal and my two other kids are perfectly healthy. I need someone to help me before its too late. And if there is someone that has been thru this I greatly appreciate any advice, reference, referrals anything! Follow Report"

It was nonstop mucus to the point I had to do nasal irrigation everyday sometimes multiple times. The first time I took him to the dr. He was prescribed augmentum antibiotic. Still on the antibiotic he kept having alot of mucus secretion though it had change colors, from yellow, greenish to clear. I communicated this to his pediatrician and he advice to finish the antibiotic treatment. The minute he was done he began to have the same mucus and fevers. i changed three pediatrician at this point he had been already on 4 different antibiotics and none worked. I finally got a dr. To listen and sent me to an ENT which immediately stated he had chronic sinus infection he needed his adenoids removed and clean him up. He actually grew a lump on the parotid gland ( a lymph node got swollen).

Please help me!!!,"I posted this discussion several days ago and got no reply so I decided to try again to see if maybe this time someone will see it. Im honestly desperate right now. I am a fifteen year old girl and I have been struggling with numerous chronic health issues for about 4 years now but everything has gotten even more severe in the past year. I have struggled with migraines, widespread chronic pain, chronic fatigue, over active bladder, suspected fibromyalgia, swollen lymph nodes, continuous throwing up, hair loss, Gilberts syndrome, elevated bilirubin causing jaundice, atypical seizures, stroke-like symptoms twice without the prescience of a known blood clot, easily bruising, vitamin D deficiency, depression, low focus levels, trouble swallowing, weak immune system, swelling, sun sensitivity, low blood pressure, high pulse, memory problems, and so much more. I have been in and out of the hospital and it has been difficult on me. Two particular cases hospitalized me for a long period of time. I began to seize, but I was conscious and it lasted for 45 minutes the first time before they injected muscle relaxers that stopped the seizure. After this happened I couldnt talk or understand who people were or what was going on. I was really scared and I couldnt walk. The pain was absolutely unbearable. I was on vacation when this happened the first time, but it happened a second time when I got home about a week later. No one could explain this, but they finally came up with an atypical migraine diagnosis due to my past with migraines. The doctors are still unsure of a diagnosis of that situation. I also had two occurrences when my under arms turned dark blue and it felt like a bruise. My rheumatologist, general practitioner, and neuroapthamalogist could not explain this either. We have done many different blood tests, MRIs, CT Scan, EKGs, EEGs, and so much more. I have had chest pains, acid reflux, and left side pain. None of which can be explained. I have been out of school for 8 weeks due to my health issues and can barely do anything without feeling very ill. If Im around anyone who is sick I become sick. It is horrible and we have an appointment at Riley Childrens Hospital in Indianapolis for June 7 with a pediatric rheumatologist. I also have a positive ANA but no other signs of Lupus in my blood work. I have had troubles sleeeping and waking up multiple times in the middle of the night to use the restroom.

It all started Last year. I went to dinner with the family. I got home. Started playing video games on my laptop (sims). Then all of a sudden I think I felt my heart stop for a brief moment (it also felt like I couldnt breathe for that brief second). Then I felt my heart and it felt fine. I started to panic and my heart started racing. I ran inside to my mom just incase anything did happen to me. But after I sat next to mom my heart rate went back to normal. I started to PANIC for the next 2 weeks. I finally told mom and she took me to the doctor and they got me an EKG. The doctor said I was fine and that I shouldnt be worrying. I was having panic attacks. So I calmed down. But every now and again my heart skips a beat and I get that same loss of breath when it happens. I dont know what to call it. I just feel it stop then I touch my chest to feel my heart or maybe cough and its back to normal again. Its been a year and its still happening so idk what to do about it. Another random thing that happened this morning was I was in bed on my phone then my heart went from a resting beat to a full on RAPID beat like you see in movies when someone is having a heart attack. Then I stood up and took a big cough and boom i was fineidk if this is really happening or if its all in my head. Please can I have your intake on this?

I havent really had anyone to talk to about my problems and how I should handle things. I have tried to talk to my husband, after all I have known him for nearly 20 years. I dont really have any friends, and I cant expect a 15 year old to understand how I feel when she is worried about what her friends at school are doing all the time, and boys. My 18 year old daughter doesnt live in the house any more and she was never one to care about anyone else. So, I have sought out help elsewhere. I dont know if anyone is out there at 2:30 in the morning but if they are it would be great to talk to someone. To tell you what is going on with me, its due to the loss of a child, my daughter was taken from her school on Dec. 15, 2010 by her biological father who lied to a Court to obtain temporary custody. After being in Court with this so called Judge it became evident to me that this situation wasnt about the truth it was about control. So, this judge starts issueing warrants for my arrest and keeps my daughter from me and all of this is based off of hear say. They have no evidence of abuse, no evidence of wrong doing on my part. They just took her. I have been fighting for 1 year and 4 months. Well, it will be four months on the 15th of this month. But whos counting right? I guess you would say that I am a little stressed! Finding an attorney that will go against this judge has been very difficult and still paying on a retainer fee for the one who accepted the job. I have lost faith in everyone around me because of this. I dont trust anyone with anything. My 18 year old was taking advantage of others and lieing to people about getting married, being pregnant, and she virtually ran away from home and went and stayed with my mother and sister which were instructing her to do things at home to anger me. NICE HUH? Yeah, now you might understand why I trust no one. My mother has suffered from phycological problems her whole life and my sister well, she happens to be off the wall! Now, my daughter is gone and I know it makes for a better atsmophere for everyone here but it still hurts that she would do such a thing. ANYWAY, life sucks for me right now. I have tired to preoccupy my mind and keep myself busy but that has stopped working. I actually started my own business because I havent been able to do what I was trained to do (nursing) because of my panic attacks. Hell, I cant even drive a car anymore! I have a lot of attacks at night time. I wake up soaked in sweat, and I cant breathe. It feels like I am having a heart attack and ofcourse when the thought crosses my mind, it makes the attack worse. I have sleepless nights and days for that matter. The longest I have stayed up is 38 hours. At that point I take something to help me sleep. Which that only lasts about 3 hours or so and then I am back up. I cant do my job that I created for myself anymore because I cant concentrate long enough to stay on task. I make Native American Crafts and go to powwows and other events, but I think I am not going to be able to follow through with that right now. I dont know what else to do. What used to work isnt working anymore and I have been completely devoured with thoughts of suicide, loneliness, distrust, and the constant fear that I am never going to see my baby girl again. HELP!

I found scissors, and grease in her pillow, some lotion or something all over her face and hair. barbie hair everywhere. I have also a two yr old, and 8 month old twins. My daughter is well aware of the dangers of whats under the sink coupled with my other younger kids. Busting locked cabinets is a battle I choose to take on for the safety of all. Because I was upset, I put her in shower, and stripped her bed and cleaned up debris (barbie hair and grease paper). I explained she would get her discipline after her shower. We discipline biblically in our home. Busting cabinet locks is grounds for discipline. Most days time out and redirection is all thats needed. every two weeks or so she goes crazy for 48 hours until we get to the rules she breaks like harming family members, lying and stealing, busting through locked doors and cabinets. Tonight she physically fought me when it was time for her discipline. I had to wrestle her to the ground to stop from kicking at least three times. She is 5!!! I need help, her psychiatrist and therapist are not doing anything. I dont know what to do. This could get real ugly as she ages. Follow Report"

And two, how many of the symptoms are already showing. I was given the blood test by my doctor for unusual back and joint pain(thought to be caused by a motorcycle crash). I had always thought the stiffness and joint pain was usual for everybody, I guesss not. And after looking online I have discovered just how many symptoms I show. Joint pain, Stiffness in the morning, loss of some movement in pinky knuckle(both), and the numbness and tingling in feet. For those of you who have this condition..

I have been under emotional turmoil since about the 4th grade because I was struggling with having a learning disorder (SLD), a new school, and experiencing bullying. This carried on into middle school where it just got so bad trying so hard to make good grades and making Ds and Fs on top of being called a retard, gay, freak, you name it, that I became very distant from reality and desired to take my own life very much. Now that I am I high school things are better and I am not being bullied but I still struggle with school because I did very well freshman year and was recommended for honors classes. Sophomore year was very hard and I didnt do so well in some classes which stressed me out to the point of having frequent panic attacks, I stopped eating, sleeping, and self-harming (cutting and scratching to be exact). Now that I am a junior, I am under about the same level of stress maybe even more so and I have tried so hard to stop harming myself but when I stress, in my head Im saying, I need to cut, I need to cut!. Also, the fact that it is fall makes things worse because I get very sad during the cold times and I cant stand to be outside and I dont know why but when I see the sun setting, it depresses me. I really dont know what is wrong with me, I have done many symptom checkers and they give me depression and anxiety disorders and I have never been to the doctor about this and no one knows about this except myself. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Also sorry about the length I just want you to know everything, I just wanted to point out that I am not always like this. Sometimes I am quite happy and content and I feel very confident like I could do anything and then it will change to being upset, angry, confused, suicidal, etc. Liked by Roxie43 Follow Report"

We flew all day. The problem is, my dad scared the heck out of me because he overused an anxiety med he got for the plane travel. The thing is he already takes multiple medications that increase sleepiness and cognition when taken together. Well, maybe from noon on, he began talking funny, mumbling, in and out of sleep, poor memory, trouble with walking. I told my mother she needs to take that from him, she did. After coming out of it later tonight he realized he lost his mouth partial, so he was ranting and they were searching everywhere. I had enough, told my mom they needed to figure this out, went to bed. He was dropping his new phone and computer, etc. a lot. I had to help him out. And I know you can make that mistake but I was scared and they are treating it too lightly. Again, I feel like my feelings dont matter. I even asked my mom if he could have had a mini stroke, she just laughed. I have 2 weeks with these people, and no way out. Trapped and stunned by my parents behavior.

I have no doubts what so ever that I am an alcoholic, and it will kill me if I dont stop. The best I can do is to make a day or two, and then I relapse. Ive worked with AA for over 5 years, and I am still drinking. It is a huge burden, and maybe Ive painted myself in a corner tight enough that I have no choice but not to drink. I would like to join in a discussion with people who have successfully stopped their alcohol abuse, and could possibly assist me as I attempt once again not to drink. I have no delusions about ever being able to drink alcohol sensibly in the future. I know, that for me, the only option is total and permanent abstinence. Typically by the weekend, Ill be feeling rather well, and then I decide I can have some. If I drink beer, on average, I drink at least 12 and sometimes up to 14. I usually dont drink hard liquor of wine as it really sneaks up on me, and the next thing I know its the next morning, and I dont remember much. The one thing I am trying is to eat late in the afternoon so I have a full stomach as I approach my alcohol abuse hour/hours (typically starting around 3 to 5, and then drinking for 4 hours after starting).

Our first ""date"" was fishing together and watching steelhead attempt to leap over a waterfall. He became the second editor of the fly fishing magazine the publisher and I had started five years earlier. Although my job managing the publication of two magazines, a quarterly, an annual, and six books/year was demanding and meant working an average of 70 hours/week, I was paid well and loved it. Because he was a male, the publisher expected him to be off fishing at least a couple of days every week. We were able to fish at many luxury lodges because we made a great writing/photography team. I'm five years older, so expected that we would be able to ageand fishtogether. After a few years, the publisher's children were old enough to be a big part of the business, so we started our own design and marketing business to serve the sport fishing industry. We shared an 18' driftboat we'd helped designand market, of course! Lots of work, but lots of wonderful times spent together. Eleven years ago, he ruptured a disc in his lower back, had surgery by a really bad fellow who sought out people with underlying health conditions so that he could claim repeated surgery (at his day surgery center, of course) was necessary. Three back surgeries in one year, the final one a fusion. He had persistent pain, was a brittle diabetic with less than 30% kidney function, but he worked full time for our boat mfg. client while I did all the nuts and bolts of design and marketing for all our clients. We still fished every few days, except in the worst of winter weather. He trailered stacks of boats to nine trade shows every winter, each show being a five-day event generally several hours distant. Eight years ago, he had to go on dialysis, so he couldn't travel to trade shows but continued to sell boats from the factory. Even though he was working full time and going to dialysis three nights a week, we still fished most weekends. I continued to do fish surveys in a wild little stream, a project we had started together in 1993, even though following back surgery he wasn't able to hike long distances over difficult terrain. The project is closing in on 30 years, and I'm still volunteering in the same wild watershed. When he got the kidney transplant, I visualized great days ahead. At the same time, he had planned to retire, i.e., do absolutely nothing, not even the few chores he had been doing around the house, because he felt he had earned retirement. Hmmmwhat about those years where I worked long hours while, because he was male, he was allowed to ""work"" onstream???? His recovery was ultra-smooth, perfect labs, virtually no fine-tuning necessary for the various meds. When he came home from the hospital, he began his retirement routine: he reclines in his recliner and expects me to fetch whatever he needs. He eats all his meals there, watches TV, readsexcept for frequent breaks to lie on the couch. We moved to this acreage on the coast, which I had initially purchased when I was 19, and, as a retired person, he expected me to do the packing, haul everything out to the trailer and van, drive it here, and pack much of it upstairs to our new loft. After six months, he had lost most most of his muscle tone, and he had far worse pain. Since then, I've tried to get him to go to PT many times. He did go to a local person, who gave him a pass from doing anything even slightly difficult; that was relatively worthless and only lasted a few weeks. Later, I insisted that he return to the pain mgmt. clinic to which he'd been referred by the transplant team. They sent him to a PT who expected him to work, but she gave up on his lack of progress after 10 months. Since then, he rarely leaves the house other than for doc appts. I nagged him into joining the local fly fishing club, and he did agree to go on a very easy outing, the first time he'd fished at all in years. However, after 15 minutes of me rowing him around a lake, he announced he needed to lie down. I left him at the car and rowed around the lake for 45 minutes or so, got a great photo of a heron and test casted a new fly rod. it's too difficult for him to sit upright more than a short time, so lots of activities are not open to us. If I suggest dinner out, he insists on ordering takeout, which isn't the same at all. I never expected that marrying someone five years younger would work out this badly! Once a week, I escape by making the 110-mile drive to the Portland area to load 400-600 loaves of bread donated to our local Backpack program. That's an entire day away from watching him steadily lose balance function and strength. If he gets much worse, I'll need to use all the money we've saved to pay for care at the only decent facility in this small town. Meanwhile, I work every day to conquer my problems with lack of balance and hearing due to the reappearance almost a year ago of the Meniere's monster. I'm working hard to get a remission in order to lock him in the closet and nail it shut! No matter how bad I feel, I am not retired but must keep the household running, care for the pets, do all the yardwork that acreage requires. Bah, humbug! I know I'm not the only woman in this situation.

Thank you! After questioning an increasing number on my echo two years ago, I was told that it was an ascending aortic aneurysm. My cardiologist here told me I would be OK ""as long as it didn't burst like John Ritter"". I felt numb and confused when I left his office with no information as to what happens next. After arriving home that day, I phoned a retired cardiac nurse acquaintance (75 yrs. old) who told me that she would not have the surgery and to just get my ""life affairs in order"". Maybe you can imagine how I felt at that point in time. I was only 66. After the whole encounter settled down a bit in my mind, I went on a quest to learn and find help if possible which lead me to a doc at Mayo with whom I have opened correspondence and sent records. This process took months of research at different hospitals across the country as medical institutions do not readily identify their best surgeons or post outcome stats. The docs here said to forget about going to a large hospital because they would only put me through a lot of tests. I did not agree and have since seen some of the local stats. Consequently, I feel that I am on the right course by turning to Mayo. My husband (75 yrs. old) has been a great support to me and in that I am very lucky. We have no children or close family members, but do have many good friends who are scattered across the US and Europe. There is no great local support regarding this medical issue, not even a local Mended Hearts Society. Thinking about possible medical complications after such a surgery, we are contemplating moving closer to Mayo. So, next week we will make our first visit to Rochester just to become acquainted a bit with the surroundings and people. I have been reading a lot about Mayo's history on their website as there are some lovely movies, videos, and books to be found. But what impressed me most was their values.

Ive always enjoyed them as pets, and my wife has usually had a cat.My life went upside down in 2005. I was falling into a really deep depression and made multiple suicide attempts. I kept thinking Id hit bottom, but then Id go down deeper and darker. I admitted myself to a small facility for survivors of suicide attempts, and stayed for 6 weeks, until I felt like Id be safe again. I wasnt really, but life went on. I retired and began therapy, and after a couple of years I talked with my therapist about training my dog to be a service dog. I had an Aussie/Border Collie mix, who was a wonderful dog, and after working with him for over a year, he became my service animal.Barnabas went everywhere with me, and was of great service to me with depression, PTSD and suicidal thoughts. Everybody loved him. But last year at Valentines, he had a stroke or some other brain event, a week after a checkup at the vets, where I was told he had years left in him (he was only 9). That was really hard, especially since I didnt have a therapist right then, and couldnt get one until a year later. That was an 18 month stretch without a therapist, and the last six were pretty dark. I was fortunate to find my next dog at our local humane shelter, a few weeks after Barnabas died. Sadie had just been brought in that day because the people had too many dogs, and decided to return her to the shelter. She was fearful and skittish, but I felt an immediate bond with her. We left her alone for a couple of days, so she could become comfortable in our home, with us, and with my wifes little dog, Pete. After a year, shes joined to me at the hip. If I go outside, she follows, and comes in when I do. We have ten acres, so she has lots of room to run, rodents to catch, cows and horses to herd  they either ignore her or run her off  but she always comes back to me and sits down near me and watches me work in the yard. If Im kneeling, she sits right in front of me for some petting. Shes very attentive, obedient and therapeutic for me. When Im extra depressed or feeling the anxiety level rising, she lies in my lap and the pressure of the weight of her body provides calming therapy on my torso, for as long as I need her.One challenge of having a service dog is public ignorance. Everytime we go out, someone asks if they can pet her (No), or just pets her without asking. If they dont pet her, they talk to her, which is pretty much the same as petting because theyre drawing her attention away from me. Cesar teaches dont touch, dont talk, dont make eye contact.An issue Ive been dealing with is lack of understanding of the difference between service and therapy dogs. A service dog serves only its handler. A therapy dog is trained to serve others, such as in hospitals, to provide calming therapy for people. I was asked to have Sadie certified as a therapy dog, but I couldnt agree to it because of the differing purposes of the service and therapy animals. For 5 years, I was a Hospice volunteer, visiting patients for an hour a week, in their homes, in the hospital, in care homes  wherever they were. A few had house pets, so I left my dog in the car during the visit (always in safe, shaded places, with water). Every other patient loved having my dog come with me to visit them. I made an exception to the no pet rule with hospice patients because it meant so much to them. I had to resign a few months ago because they wrote a set of guidelines that specifies only certified therapy dogs could go with volunteers. I hated to give up that volunteer job. I think it helped me get out and interact with others, and it gave me a chance to give out to those who have a real need. How has a pet or animal helped you? Share your story with us. Of course, Sadies more than a pet, though she is that, too, but she provides the companionship of a pet, the devotion and unconditional love. Ill try to share pictures of Barnabas (brown and white) and Sadie (black and white). (Sorry I couldnt change the orientation of the picture of Sadie.)

I had flu-like symptoms along with flares of joint pain. I have a rare genetic disorder called Familial Mediterranean Fever. However, I have had seemingly unrelated pain flares (atypical of symptoms) along with a worsening chronic pain for ten years that have left me on disability and unable to work. My emails were complicated. They included mentioning I had a flu that later turned to itchy lungs and joint pain. Then I described symptoms of being freezing cold despite 80-degree weather, itchy lungs, an enlarged lymph node behind my right ear, and low-grade fevers. Then I had inflammation in my lungs and needed to have cough syrup to calm the itching and pain. I emailed my primary care doctor and my rheumatologist. When I saw my primary care doctor at the end of May, she did no tests but gave me allergy medication and nasal spray. Mid-June, I had a week where the joint pain was too debilitating to sleep, running from the base of my right thumb to the right side at the base of my neck, to vertabrae mid-back connecting through my lower ribs. When I started having left-side lung inflammation while breathing in, I went to urgent care and a rheumatologist made me wait for a long time before telling me to try swimming and massage due to a Fibromyalgia diagnosis. My doctors are all through one big health system and they are able to access each others notes. He ended up prescribing Methylprednisolone last minute due a past prescription of Prednisone. It quickly worked to bring the pain down and stop the lung inflammation. The Methylprednisolone was the most effective medication I have ever tried and even helped the chronic pain far more than currently prescribed medications of weak Meloxicam, Colchicine (for the FMF) and Gabapentin. I visited the Emergency Department once my pain improved because I realized I had also been shivering cold with the lung symptoms since May. My heart was normal and my left lung, where I had the pain, had multiple tiny subsolid nodules. My rapid strep test was negative but the follow-up culture was positive for a small amount of Beta Strep Group C. I was negative for HIV or TB, didnt have a fever, had a normal white blood count and inflammatory markers were normal. My primary care doctor referred me to someone to look at the nodules in my lungs to make sure they have cleared. She said that it was normal for anyone to have Strep C and that it didnt require antibiotics and a nurse said She probably thinks its part of your natural flora. I pointed out that all my symptoms started on the same timeline at the beginning of May through mid-June, including 12 pounds of weight loss that had gone unnoticed by doctors, and that the only result so far was the strep. I printed out the email of detailed descriptions of illness and flares and the timeline they were on. I included past rheumatology labs or imaging tests that were positive before becoming a patient there and even made a little summary of history that included recurrent strep and strep before developing my joint flares ten years before. I am switching to another rheumatologist in the same department soon and messaged that it was urgent for me due to the severity of my last flare-up and the hope that the Methylprednisolone had provided a path toward diagnosis and treatment that will prevent and treat pain. I at least never want to experience such debilitating symptoms again. The appointment was canceled and postponed a week. I tried to point out that my flare was acute pain and not something that was normal for me  I could not rotate to the right on the toilet, sleep for four days, use my right hand, or walk sometimes. The cold causes pain in my hands and feet and it affects my tendons, causing plantar fasciitis to act up. It felt as if most of the right-side joints were affected, along with the base of my big toes and thumbs, and that there was a tightness of connective tissue. My rheumatologist has been dismissive of symptoms for over a year, only stating that the inflammatory markers are normal and that I am fine on current medications. At our consultation, I told her that my cousin on my moms side has Ankylosing Spondylitis but she put in her notes mother has lupus and would not change it when I brought it up. She responded to one email to say I did not have rheumatoid arthritis or Raynauds disease but I have never suggested that I have any specific disorder  I have only described my symptoms and emailed during acute flares. I dont know why tests are negative for inflammation but it seems like it should be enough that a powerful steroid was effective. A few days into the pack of Methylprednisolone, my joints all started popping like pressure was being released. I am actually questioning whether I should switch to an entirely new health system based off these experiences. I could swear that there is something that comes up in my chart that is making doctors so lazy, rude, and dismissive. My interpersonal style is a little different due to inattentive ADHD, being autism spectrum. I am also trans and I dont know who has access to this information but receptionists have also become very rude recently. But my questions are : Is it normal to not be prescribed an antibiotic for a small amount of recovered Strep Group C? Especially with the symptoms like itchy throat and yellow mucus in the back of my throat that required cough medicine? Am I crazy in thinking I could have had an infection that went untreated? Could the nodules in my lungs be from an untreated infection? Is Strep C really part of my natural flora? Could I have an undiagnosed autoimmune disorder that might be connected with the strep? Could my symptoms be cancer since I have had rapid weight loss and the nodules on the lung or is it illness? Could I really just have a severe allergy? I have been referred to a specialist for it. Is there a better place in the U.S. to find the answers I need? Someone please help.

I had flu-like symptoms along with flares of joint pain. I have a rare genetic disorder called Familial Mediterranean Fever. However, I have had seemingly unrelated pain flares (atypical of symptoms) along with a worsening chronic pain for ten years that have left me on disability and unable to work. My emails were complicated. They included mentioning I had a flu that later turned to itchy lungs and joint pain. Then I described symptoms of being freezing cold despite 80-degree weather, itchy lungs, an enlarged lymph node behind my right ear, and low-grade fevers. Then I had inflammation in my lungs and needed to have cough syrup to calm the itching and pain. I emailed my primary care doctor and my rheumatologist. When I saw my primary care doctor at the end of May, she did no tests but gave me allergy medication and nasal spray. Mid-June, I had a week where the joint pain was too debilitating to sleep, running from the base of my right thumb to the right side at the base of my neck, to vertabrae mid-back connecting through my lower ribs.

It felt as if most of the right-side joints were affected, along with the base of my big toes and thumbs, and that there was a tightness of connective tissue. My rheumatologist has been dismissive of symptoms for over a year, only stating that the inflammatory markers are normal and that I am fine on current medications. At our consultation, I told her that my cousin on my moms side has Ankylosing Spondylitis but she put in her notes mother has lupus and would not change it when I brought it up. She responded to one email to say I did not have rheumatoid arthritis or Raynauds disease but I have never suggested that I have any specific disorder  I have only described my symptoms and emailed during acute flares. I dont know why tests are negative for inflammation but it seems like it should be enough that a powerful steroid was effective. A few days into the pack of Methylprednisolone, my joints all started popping like pressure was being released. I am actually questioning whether I should switch to an entirely new health system based off these experiences. I could swear that there is something that comes up in my chart that is making doctors so lazy, rude, and dismissive. My interpersonal style is a little different due to inattentive ADHD, being autism spectrum. I am also trans and I dont know who has access to this information but receptionists have also become very rude recently. But my questions are : Is it normal to not be prescribed an antibiotic for a small amount of recovered Strep Group C? Especially with the symptoms like itchy throat and yellow mucus in the back of my throat that required cough medicine? Am I crazy in thinking I could have had an infection that went untreated? Could the nodules in my lungs be from an untreated infection? Is Strep C really part of my natural flora? Could I have an undiagnosed autoimmune disorder that might be connected with the strep? Could my symptoms be cancer since I have had rapid weight loss and the nodules on the lung or is it illness? Could I really just have a severe allergy? I have been referred to a specialist for it. Is there a better place in the U.S. to find the answers I need? Someone please help.

I had flu-like symptoms along with flares of joint pain. I have a rare genetic disorder called Familial Mediterranean Fever. However, I have had seemingly unrelated pain flares (atypical of symptoms) along with a worsening chronic pain for ten years that have left me on disability and unable to work. My emails were complicated. They included mentioning I had a flu that later turned to itchy lungs and joint pain. Then I described symptoms of being freezing cold despite 80-degree weather, itchy lungs, an enlarged lymph node behind my right ear, and low-grade fevers. Then I had inflammation in my lungs and needed to have cough syrup to calm the itching and pain. I emailed my primary care doctor and my rheumatologist. When I saw my primary care doctor at the end of May, she did no tests but gave me allergy medication and nasal spray. Mid-June, I had a week where the joint pain was too debilitating to sleep, running from the base of my right thumb to the right side at the base of my neck, to vertabrae mid-back connecting through my lower ribs. When I started having left-side lung inflammation while breathing in, I went to urgent care and a rheumatologist made me wait for a long time before telling me to try swimming and massage due to a Fibromyalgia diagnosis. My doctors are all through one big health system and they are able to access each others notes. He ended up prescribing Methylprednisolone last minute due a past prescription of Prednisone. It quickly worked to bring the pain down and stop the lung inflammation. The Methylprednisolone was the most effective medication I have ever tried and even helped the chronic pain far more than currently prescribed medications of weak Meloxicam, Colchicine (for the FMF) and Gabapentin. I visited the Emergency Department once my pain improved because I realized I had also been shivering cold with the lung symptoms since May. My heart was normal and my left lung, where I had the pain, had multiple tiny subsolid nodules. My rapid strep test was negative but the follow-up culture was positive for a small amount of Beta Strep Group C. I was negative for HIV or TB, didnt have a fever, had a normal white blood count and inflammatory markers were normal. My primary care doctor referred me to someone to look at the nodules in my lungs to make sure they have cleared. She said that it was normal for anyone to have Strep C and that it didnt require antibiotics and a nurse said She probably thinks its part of your natural flora. I pointed out that all my symptoms started on the same timeline at the beginning of May through mid-June, including 12 pounds of weight loss that had gone unnoticed by doctors, and that the only result so far was the strep. I printed out the email of detailed descriptions of illness and flares and the timeline they were on. I included past rheumatology labs or imaging tests that were positive before becoming a patient there and even made a little summary of history that included recurrent strep and strep before developing my joint flares ten years before. I am switching to another rheumatologist in the same department soon and messaged that it was urgent for me due to the severity of my last flare-up and the hope that the Methylprednisolone had provided a path toward diagnosis and treatment that will prevent and treat pain.

I had flu-like symptoms along with flares of joint pain. I have a rare genetic disorder called Familial Mediterranean Fever. However, I have had seemingly unrelated pain flares (atypical of symptoms) along with a worsening chronic pain for ten years that have left me on disability and unable to work. My emails were complicated. They included mentioning I had a flu that later turned to itchy lungs and joint pain. Then I described symptoms of being freezing cold despite 80-degree weather, itchy lungs, an enlarged lymph node behind my right ear, and low-grade fevers. Then I had inflammation in my lungs and needed to have cough syrup to calm the itching and pain. I emailed my primary care doctor and my rheumatologist. When I saw my primary care doctor at the end of May, she did no tests but gave me allergy medication and nasal spray. Mid-June, I had a week where the joint pain was too debilitating to sleep, running from the base of my right thumb to the right side at the base of my neck, to vertabrae mid-back connecting through my lower ribs. When I started having left-side lung inflammation while breathing in, I went to urgent care and a rheumatologist made me wait for a long time before telling me to try swimming and massage due to a Fibromyalgia diagnosis. My doctors are all through one big health system and they are able to access each others notes. He ended up prescribing Methylprednisolone last minute due a past prescription of Prednisone. It quickly worked to bring the pain down and stop the lung inflammation. The Methylprednisolone was the most effective medication I have ever tried and even helped the chronic pain far more than currently prescribed medications of weak Meloxicam, Colchicine (for the FMF) and Gabapentin. I visited the Emergency Department once my pain improved because I realized I had also been shivering cold with the lung symptoms since May. My heart was normal and my left lung, where I had the pain, had multiple tiny subsolid nodules. My rapid strep test was negative but the follow-up culture was positive for a small amount of Beta Strep Group C. I was negative for HIV or TB, didnt have a fever, had a normal white blood count and inflammatory markers were normal. My primary care doctor referred me to someone to look at the nodules in my lungs to make sure they have cleared. She said that it was normal for anyone to have Strep C and that it didnt require antibiotics and a nurse said She probably thinks its part of your natural flora. I pointed out that all my symptoms started on the same timeline at the beginning of May through mid-June, including 12 pounds of weight loss that had gone unnoticed by doctors, and that the only result so far was the strep. I printed out the email of detailed descriptions of illness and flares and the timeline they were on. I included past rheumatology labs or imaging tests that were positive before becoming a patient there and even made a little summary of history that included recurrent strep and strep before developing my joint flares ten years before. I am switching to another rheumatologist in the same department soon and messaged that it was urgent for me due to the severity of my last flare-up and the hope that the Methylprednisolone had provided a path toward diagnosis and treatment that will prevent and treat pain. I at least never want to experience such debilitating symptoms again. The appointment was canceled and postponed a week. I tried to point out that my flare was acute pain and not something that was normal for me  I could not rotate to the right on the toilet, sleep for four days, use my right hand, or walk sometimes. The cold causes pain in my hands and feet and it affects my tendons, causing plantar fasciitis to act up. It felt as if most of the right-side joints were affected, along with the base of my big toes and thumbs, and that there was a tightness of connective tissue. My rheumatologist has been dismissive of symptoms for over a year, only stating that the inflammatory markers are normal and that I am fine on current medications. At our consultation, I told her that my cousin on my moms side has Ankylosing Spondylitis but she put in her notes mother has lupus and would not change it when I brought it up. She responded to one email to say I did not have rheumatoid arthritis or Raynauds disease but I have never suggested that I have any specific disorder  I have only described my symptoms and emailed during acute flares.

Could my symptoms be cancer since I have had rapid weight loss and the nodules on the lung or is it illness? Could I really just have a severe allergy? I have been referred to a specialist for it. Is there a better place in the U.S. to find the answers I need? Someone please help.

Problem communicating with others and forming friendships. He is also experiencing anxiety as well as difficulty concentrating, fatigue, recent significant weight loss ( 95 pounds in 14 months.he is 6 feet tall) and difficulty being around anyone (prefers being alone in his room). He also lost consciousness prompting a fall while showering twice Some history: He was bullied emotionally his junior year in High School which then led to extremely low self esteem and withdrawal from activities he enjoyed. He went to a psychologist for a year and was diagnosed with depression and placed on medication. The medication prompted weight gain (45 lbs) within 6 months. He decided to go off the medication because he did not like how it made him feel nor did he like the weight gain; however he remained in therapy. Medical tests given: Blood work checking for anemia, kidney and liver function and thyroid all normal. Cholesterol tests normal. A brain scan checking for tumors normal. At this point he refuses to go to a psychologist and will not go on antidepressant or anxiety medication. However, he has recently started cutting himself ( 3 times that I know of the last 7 months). I do not know what to do. He will not discuss his feelings with anyone: however I think he would be open to more medical tests. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Follow Report"

Undiagnosed and dont know where to go next,"I am posting here in hopes that someone out there has experienced something similar or can at least tell me where to turn next when it comes to figuring out my illness. A friend of mine who has lupus said it sounded like it could be autoimmune but I really dont know anymore! The following chunk is going to be a long medical history and I apologize, I just want to give as much information as possible in hopes of getting help. I was born premature but had amazing algae scores and was sent home that day. My mother tells me I was always sick as a baby with chronic throat infections of some kind or other. She made the doctors remove my tonsils before I was 2 in hopes that it would help but it didnt seem to. Growing up I remember always being sick. I seemed to get every bug going around but was always especially susceptible to strep throat infections and sinus infections. I was sick so much that by highschool I am pretty sure I only was actually able to attend around 2/3 of the total days in the school year. Maybe even less than that and this wasnt me staying home with colds, this was constant stomach flu, upset respritory infections, and of course strep throat. I also had constant hives and dermatographia since I was young and still have it to this day! The doctors always wrote it off, saying it was probably a food allergy, but never really looked into it. I also never ran fevers as a kid and instead run at a constant 97.6. In 2016 my constant bad health seemed to take a turn for the worst. Right after graduating highschool I got so sick I was bedridden for the whole summer. I was throwing up, having joint pain, and sleeping all the time. No fever but I NEVER run fevers. After a month of it my mother took me in to my family doctor. She ran a mono test and Lyme test which both came back negative but she was sure it was mono so she told me to come back in a few weeks. I did but the test was negative again, and then again when I came in another month later. My white counts were high but they couldnt figure out what was wrong other than that. Finally after 4 months I got better and stopped going back to the doctor, just in time for me to go to my freshmen year of college. I made it through my first semester, despite the fact I got stomach flu and strep a few times but then part way through my second semester I got sick again. I was throwing up to the point I had to be hospitalized for fluids. All of my lymph nodes were so swollen I didnt even look like I had a neck and was having a hard time swallowing. This time it turned out I actually did have mono. I had to leave my college and go home to recover. It took a total of about 4 months to get better but I never felt 100% again after that. My doctor told me it could take up to a year to feel fully better so I decided to take time off of college and get a job. The job lasted about three months. I was so tired in that time that I would get up to go to work, struggle through my shift, go home, and immediately go to sleep. I was only awake about 10 hours a day but I figured it was just because I wasnt used to working and would adjust. Then I started developing severe joint pain and stiffness, to the point that it was hard to get up off the couch simply because I couldnt unbend. Both of my parents have rheumatoid arthritis so I assumed it was that and went in to my doctor for testing. I was only 20 and knew I shouldnt be feeling as old as I suddenly felt. She ran an ANA that came back normal. A week later I passed out in the shower. My parents and I assumed maybe the water had been to hit and left it at that. Another week later I passed out at work. The fainting episodes became a normal part of my life which led to me quitting my job. I went to see my primary physician again but she was clueless. She ran a complete blood count, metobolic panel, and tested me for Addisons disease. It all came back fine aside from a slightly elevated white blood count. She then referred me to doctor number 2, an internist. Doctor number 2 was probably the best I had ever seen. Listened to my story then tested me for dermatographia before I had even mentioned the hives or dermatographia. He sent me to an allergist. Doctor number 3, the allergist. I explained the dermatographia and the fact that I had it, along with hives, since I was a kid. We had never been able to link the hives to any food and explained that sometimes I would break out in hives because of the heat or because of crying or getting stressed. He told me he couldnt test me with the scratch test because I had dermatographia but that he could test my blood for allergies. He told me he didnt think this would be helpful however because the would only be able to test for a few things and he said my hives sounded idiopathic. I went home without the test. I followed up with my internist, doctor number 2, but while the nurse was taking my vitals she found I had a heart murmur. I was sent for an ultrasound of my heart and they found I had a mitral valve prolapse but told me it was nothing to be concerned about. I went back in later for the follow up and the nurse took my vitals and found I had a heart arythmia. They gave me a 24 hour heart monitor. I only actually ended up wearing the monitor for 20 hours because the sticky pad things they used caused my skin to blister up and peel off. The cardiologist I saw, doctor number 4, told me my heart murmur was benign and then went on to suggest that maybe I was on too many medications due to the fact that I take an anti anxiety, and antidepressant. Back to doctor number 2, my internist. He gave me two different anti-histamines and sent me home in hopes it would improve my symptoms. All of my symptoms kept getting worse. I developed brain fog, trouble concentrating, headaches, and none of my previous symptoms improved. I turned to the internet in hopes of figuring out why I was fainting and read about postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or POTS for short. I went to my doctor that week and asked if he had ever heard of it. He told me he didnt think that was what I had, as it was rare, and sent me home. My mother convinced me to go back and demand to be tested, and it turns out I do have POTS. On an average day, my heart rate laying is 55 and it jumps to 130 when I am standing. Thankfully now that I know what is going on I was able to start managing symptoms and hoped it would help with everything from the fainting to fatigue, joint pain to brain fog. I started developing new symptoms. My brain seems to scramble words when I read now or it messes up grammar. I have a persistent pain in my left side that doctors cant explain. My rib cage in the front on my left side also goes through flair ups where it hurts when I breath and I have been developing migraines. The fatigue got worse until I was only awake about 2-4 hours a day total and all of my lymph glands swelled up again. It felt like when I had mono so I went in to try and figure out what was going on. My internist sent me to doctor number 5, an infectious disease specialist, who told me I had a mono reactivation. At this point it had been exactly a year since I left college with my first bout of mono. He said it was really rare and he wanted to test my immune system. He ran a complete blood count, C-reactive protein test, t-cell test, and a few others. Everything came back normal. My doctor said he had no idea why I got mono again and seems to have no idea what to do with my other symptoms! I want to ask for more tests but I dont even know what tests to ask for anymore or what doctors to ask to see and I am afraid they are going to diagnose me as a hypochondriac! Currently my symptoms are dermatographia hives (particularly when upset but often without obvious cause) migraines joint pain joint stiffness Nausea loss of appitite brain fog trouble concentrating extreme fatigue vomiting, sometimes without even feeling ill beforehand dizziness pain in my left side, about where my spleen is, but doctors say my spleen is not enlarged pain in my ribs sometimes when I breath that lasts a few hours no fevers ever.-numbness and tingling in my hands and feet at times mouth ulcers. (I have had these since I was a kid. The come and go. I sort of get break outs of them) Anyone have any ideas? Anything helps. I just want to go finish college and move on to my career but cant do that while I am this sick! I am a 21 year old white female if that helps anything. Liked by lucky1038 Follow Report"

Undiagnosed and dont know where to go next,"I am posting here in hopes that someone out there has experienced something similar or can at least tell me where to turn next when it comes to figuring out my illness. A friend of mine who has lupus said it sounded like it could be autoimmune but I really dont know anymore! The following chunk is going to be a long medical history and I apologize, I just want to give as much information as possible in hopes of getting help. I was born premature but had amazing algae scores and was sent home that day. My mother tells me I was always sick as a baby with chronic throat infections of some kind or other. She made the doctors remove my tonsils before I was 2 in hopes that it would help but it didnt seem to. Growing up I remember always being sick. I seemed to get every bug going around but was always especially susceptible to strep throat infections and sinus infections. I was sick so much that by highschool I am pretty sure I only was actually able to attend around 2/3 of the total days in the school year. Maybe even less than that and this wasnt me staying home with colds, this was constant stomach flu, upset respritory infections, and of course strep throat. I also had constant hives and dermatographia since I was young and still have it to this day! The doctors always wrote it off, saying it was probably a food allergy, but never really looked into it. I also never ran fevers as a kid and instead run at a constant 97.6. In 2016 my constant bad health seemed to take a turn for the worst. Right after graduating highschool I got so sick I was bedridden for the whole summer. I was throwing up, having joint pain, and sleeping all the time. No fever but I NEVER run fevers. After a month of it my mother took me in to my family doctor. She ran a mono test and Lyme test which both came back negative but she was sure it was mono so she told me to come back in a few weeks. I did but the test was negative again, and then again when I came in another month later. My white counts were high but they couldnt figure out what was wrong other than that. Finally after 4 months I got better and stopped going back to the doctor, just in time for me to go to my freshmen year of college. I made it through my first semester, despite the fact I got stomach flu and strep a few times but then part way through my second semester I got sick again. I was throwing up to the point I had to be hospitalized for fluids. All of my lymph nodes were so swollen I didnt even look like I had a neck and was having a hard time swallowing. This time it turned out I actually did have mono. I had to leave my college and go home to recover. It took a total of about 4 months to get better but I never felt 100% again after that. My doctor told me it could take up to a year to feel fully better so I decided to take time off of college and get a job. The job lasted about three months. I was so tired in that time that I would get up to go to work, struggle through my shift, go home, and immediately go to sleep. I was only awake about 10 hours a day but I figured it was just because I wasnt used to working and would adjust. Then I started developing severe joint pain and stiffness, to the point that it was hard to get up off the couch simply because I couldnt unbend. Both of my parents have rheumatoid arthritis so I assumed it was that and went in to my doctor for testing. I was only 20 and knew I shouldnt be feeling as old as I suddenly felt. She ran an ANA that came back normal. A week later I passed out in the shower. My parents and I assumed maybe the water had been to hit and left it at that. Another week later I passed out at work. The fainting episodes became a normal part of my life which led to me quitting my job. I went to see my primary physician again but she was clueless. She ran a complete blood count, metobolic panel, and tested me for Addisons disease. It all came back fine aside from a slightly elevated white blood count. She then referred me to doctor number 2, an internist. Doctor number 2 was probably the best I had ever seen. Listened to my story then tested me for dermatographia before I had even mentioned the hives or dermatographia. He sent me to an allergist. Doctor number 3, the allergist. I explained the dermatographia and the fact that I had it, along with hives, since I was a kid. We had never been able to link the hives to any food and explained that sometimes I would break out in hives because of the heat or because of crying or getting stressed. He told me he couldnt test me with the scratch test because I had dermatographia but that he could test my blood for allergies. He told me he didnt think this would be helpful however because the would only be able to test for a few things and he said my hives sounded idiopathic. I went home without the test. I followed up with my internist, doctor number 2, but while the nurse was taking my vitals she found I had a heart murmur. I was sent for an ultrasound of my heart and they found I had a mitral valve prolapse but told me it was nothing to be concerned about. I went back in later for the follow up and the nurse took my vitals and found I had a heart arythmia. They gave me a 24 hour heart monitor. I only actually ended up wearing the monitor for 20 hours because the sticky pad things they used caused my skin to blister up and peel off. The cardiologist I saw, doctor number 4, told me my heart murmur was benign and then went on to suggest that maybe I was on too many medications due to the fact that I take an anti anxiety, and antidepressant. Back to doctor number 2, my internist. He gave me two different anti-histamines and sent me home in hopes it would improve my symptoms. All of my symptoms kept getting worse. I developed brain fog, trouble concentrating, headaches, and none of my previous symptoms improved. I turned to the internet in hopes of figuring out why I was fainting and read about postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or POTS for short. I went to my doctor that week and asked if he had ever heard of it. He told me he didnt think that was what I had, as it was rare, and sent me home. My mother convinced me to go back and demand to be tested, and it turns out I do have POTS. On an average day, my heart rate laying is 55 and it jumps to 130 when I am standing. Thankfully now that I know what is going on I was able to start managing symptoms and hoped it would help with everything from the fainting to fatigue, joint pain to brain fog. I started developing new symptoms. My brain seems to scramble words when I read now or it messes up grammar. I have a persistent pain in my left side that doctors cant explain. My rib cage in the front on my left side also goes through flair ups where it hurts when I breath and I have been developing migraines. The fatigue got worse until I was only awake about 2-4 hours a day total and all of my lymph glands swelled up again. It felt like when I had mono so I went in to try and figure out what was going on. My internist sent me to doctor number 5, an infectious disease specialist, who told me I had a mono reactivation. At this point it had been exactly a year since I left college with my first bout of mono. He said it was really rare and he wanted to test my immune system. He ran a complete blood count, C-reactive protein test, t-cell test, and a few others. Everything came back normal. My doctor said he had no idea why I got mono again and seems to have no idea what to do with my other symptoms! I want to ask for more tests but I dont even know what tests to ask for anymore or what doctors to ask to see and I am afraid they are going to diagnose me as a hypochondriac! Currently my symptoms are dermatographia hives (particularly when upset but often without obvious cause) migraines joint pain joint stiffness Nausea loss of appitite brain fog trouble concentrating extreme fatigue vomiting, sometimes without even feeling ill beforehand dizziness pain in my left side, about where my spleen is, but doctors say my spleen is not enlarged pain in my ribs sometimes when I breath that lasts a few hours no fevers ever.-numbness and tingling in my hands and feet at times mouth ulcers.

He told me he didnt think this would be helpful however because the would only be able to test for a few things and he said my hives sounded idiopathic. I went home without the test. I followed up with my internist, doctor number 2, but while the nurse was taking my vitals she found I had a heart murmur. I was sent for an ultrasound of my heart and they found I had a mitral valve prolapse but told me it was nothing to be concerned about. I went back in later for the follow up and the nurse took my vitals and found I had a heart arythmia. They gave me a 24 hour heart monitor. I only actually ended up wearing the monitor for 20 hours because the sticky pad things they used caused my skin to blister up and peel off. The cardiologist I saw, doctor number 4, told me my heart murmur was benign and then went on to suggest that maybe I was on too many medications due to the fact that I take an anti anxiety, and antidepressant. Back to doctor number 2, my internist. He gave me two different anti-histamines and sent me home in hopes it would improve my symptoms. All of my symptoms kept getting worse. I developed brain fog, trouble concentrating, headaches, and none of my previous symptoms improved. I turned to the internet in hopes of figuring out why I was fainting and read about postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or POTS for short. I went to my doctor that week and asked if he had ever heard of it. He told me he didnt think that was what I had, as it was rare, and sent me home. My mother convinced me to go back and demand to be tested, and it turns out I do have POTS. On an average day, my heart rate laying is 55 and it jumps to 130 when I am standing. Thankfully now that I know what is going on I was able to start managing symptoms and hoped it would help with everything from the fainting to fatigue, joint pain to brain fog. I started developing new symptoms. My brain seems to scramble words when I read now or it messes up grammar. I have a persistent pain in my left side that doctors cant explain. My rib cage in the front on my left side also goes through flair ups where it hurts when I breath and I have been developing migraines. The fatigue got worse until I was only awake about 2-4 hours a day total and all of my lymph glands swelled up again. It felt like when I had mono so I went in to try and figure out what was going on. My internist sent me to doctor number 5, an infectious disease specialist, who told me I had a mono reactivation. At this point it had been exactly a year since I left college with my first bout of mono. He said it was really rare and he wanted to test my immune system. He ran a complete blood count, C-reactive protein test, t-cell test, and a few others. Everything came back normal. My doctor said he had no idea why I got mono again and seems to have no idea what to do with my other symptoms! I want to ask for more tests but I dont even know what tests to ask for anymore or what doctors to ask to see and I am afraid they are going to diagnose me as a hypochondriac! Currently my symptoms are dermatographia hives (particularly when upset but often without obvious cause) migraines joint pain joint stiffness Nausea loss of appitite brain fog trouble concentrating extreme fatigue vomiting, sometimes without even feeling ill beforehand dizziness pain in my left side, about where my spleen is, but doctors say my spleen is not enlarged pain in my ribs sometimes when I breath that lasts a few hours no fevers ever.-numbness and tingling in my hands and feet at times mouth ulcers.

A friend of mine who has lupus said it sounded like it could be autoimmune but I really dont know anymore! The following chunk is going to be a long medical history and I apologize, I just want to give as much information as possible in hopes of getting help. I was born premature but had amazing algae scores and was sent home that day. My mother tells me I was always sick as a baby with chronic throat infections of some kind or other. She made the doctors remove my tonsils before I was 2 in hopes that it would help but it didnt seem to. Growing up I remember always being sick. I seemed to get every bug going around but was always especially susceptible to strep throat infections and sinus infections. I was sick so much that by highschool I am pretty sure I only was actually able to attend around 2/3 of the total days in the school year. Maybe even less than that and this wasnt me staying home with colds, this was constant stomach flu, upset respritory infections, and of course strep throat. I also had constant hives and dermatographia since I was young and still have it to this day! The doctors always wrote it off, saying it was probably a food allergy, but never really looked into it. I also never ran fevers as a kid and instead run at a constant 97.6. In 2016 my constant bad health seemed to take a turn for the worst. Right after graduating highschool I got so sick I was bedridden for the whole summer. I was throwing up, having joint pain, and sleeping all the time. No fever but I NEVER run fevers. After a month of it my mother took me in to my family doctor. She ran a mono test and Lyme test which both came back negative but she was sure it was mono so she told me to come back in a few weeks. I did but the test was negative again, and then again when I came in another month later. My white counts were high but they couldnt figure out what was wrong other than that. Finally after 4 months I got better and stopped going back to the doctor, just in time for me to go to my freshmen year of college. I made it through my first semester, despite the fact I got stomach flu and strep a few times but then part way through my second semester I got sick again. I was throwing up to the point I had to be hospitalized for fluids. All of my lymph nodes were so swollen I didnt even look like I had a neck and was having a hard time swallowing. This time it turned out I actually did have mono. I had to leave my college and go home to recover. It took a total of about 4 months to get better but I never felt 100% again after that. My doctor told me it could take up to a year to feel fully better so I decided to take time off of college and get a job. The job lasted about three months. I was so tired in that time that I would get up to go to work, struggle through my shift, go home, and immediately go to sleep. I was only awake about 10 hours a day but I figured it was just because I wasnt used to working and would adjust. Then I started developing severe joint pain and stiffness, to the point that it was hard to get up off the couch simply because I couldnt unbend. Both of my parents have rheumatoid arthritis so I assumed it was that and went in to my doctor for testing. I was only 20 and knew I shouldnt be feeling as old as I suddenly felt. She ran an ANA that came back normal. A week later I passed out in the shower. My parents and I assumed maybe the water had been to hit and left it at that. Another week later I passed out at work. The fainting episodes became a normal part of my life which led to me quitting my job. I went to see my primary physician again but she was clueless. She ran a complete blood count, metobolic panel, and tested me for Addisons disease. It all came back fine aside from a slightly elevated white blood count. She then referred me to doctor number 2, an internist. Doctor number 2 was probably the best I had ever seen. Listened to my story then tested me for dermatographia before I had even mentioned the hives or dermatographia. He sent me to an allergist. Doctor number 3, the allergist. I explained the dermatographia and the fact that I had it, along with hives, since I was a kid. We had never been able to link the hives to any food and explained that sometimes I would break out in hives because of the heat or because of crying or getting stressed. He told me he couldnt test me with the scratch test because I had dermatographia but that he could test my blood for allergies.

Maybe even less than that and this wasnt me staying home with colds, this was constant stomach flu, upset respritory infections, and of course strep throat. I also had constant hives and dermatographia since I was young and still have it to this day! The doctors always wrote it off, saying it was probably a food allergy, but never really looked into it. I also never ran fevers as a kid and instead run at a constant 97.6. In 2016 my constant bad health seemed to take a turn for the worst. Right after graduating highschool I got so sick I was bedridden for the whole summer. I was throwing up, having joint pain, and sleeping all the time. No fever but I NEVER run fevers. After a month of it my mother took me in to my family doctor. She ran a mono test and Lyme test which both came back negative but she was sure it was mono so she told me to come back in a few weeks. I did but the test was negative again, and then again when I came in another month later. My white counts were high but they couldnt figure out what was wrong other than that. Finally after 4 months I got better and stopped going back to the doctor, just in time for me to go to my freshmen year of college. I made it through my first semester, despite the fact I got stomach flu and strep a few times but then part way through my second semester I got sick again. I was throwing up to the point I had to be hospitalized for fluids. All of my lymph nodes were so swollen I didnt even look like I had a neck and was having a hard time swallowing. This time it turned out I actually did have mono. I had to leave my college and go home to recover. It took a total of about 4 months to get better but I never felt 100% again after that. My doctor told me it could take up to a year to feel fully better so I decided to take time off of college and get a job. The job lasted about three months. I was so tired in that time that I would get up to go to work, struggle through my shift, go home, and immediately go to sleep. I was only awake about 10 hours a day but I figured it was just because I wasnt used to working and would adjust. Then I started developing severe joint pain and stiffness, to the point that it was hard to get up off the couch simply because I couldnt unbend. Both of my parents have rheumatoid arthritis so I assumed it was that and went in to my doctor for testing. I was only 20 and knew I shouldnt be feeling as old as I suddenly felt. She ran an ANA that came back normal. A week later I passed out in the shower. My parents and I assumed maybe the water had been to hit and left it at that. Another week later I passed out at work. The fainting episodes became a normal part of my life which led to me quitting my job. I went to see my primary physician again but she was clueless. She ran a complete blood count, metobolic panel, and tested me for Addisons disease. It all came back fine aside from a slightly elevated white blood count. She then referred me to doctor number 2, an internist. Doctor number 2 was probably the best I had ever seen. Listened to my story then tested me for dermatographia before I had even mentioned the hives or dermatographia. He sent me to an allergist. Doctor number 3, the allergist. I explained the dermatographia and the fact that I had it, along with hives, since I was a kid. We had never been able to link the hives to any food and explained that sometimes I would break out in hives because of the heat or because of crying or getting stressed. He told me he couldnt test me with the scratch test because I had dermatographia but that he could test my blood for allergies. He told me he didnt think this would be helpful however because the would only be able to test for a few things and he said my hives sounded idiopathic. I went home without the test. I followed up with my internist, doctor number 2, but while the nurse was taking my vitals she found I had a heart murmur. I was sent for an ultrasound of my heart and they found I had a mitral valve prolapse but told me it was nothing to be concerned about. I went back in later for the follow up and the nurse took my vitals and found I had a heart arythmia. They gave me a 24 hour heart monitor. I only actually ended up wearing the monitor for 20 hours because the sticky pad things they used caused my skin to blister up and peel off. The cardiologist I saw, doctor number 4, told me my heart murmur was benign and then went on to suggest that maybe I was on too many medications due to the fact that I take an anti anxiety, and antidepressant. Back to doctor number 2, my internist. He gave me two different anti-histamines and sent me home in hopes it would improve my symptoms. All of my symptoms kept getting worse. I developed brain fog, trouble concentrating, headaches, and none of my previous symptoms improved. I turned to the internet in hopes of figuring out why I was fainting and read about postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or POTS for short. I went to my doctor that week and asked if he had ever heard of it. He told me he didnt think that was what I had, as it was rare, and sent me home. My mother convinced me to go back and demand to be tested, and it turns out I do have POTS. On an average day, my heart rate laying is 55 and it jumps to 130 when I am standing. Thankfully now that I know what is going on I was able to start managing symptoms and hoped it would help with everything from the fainting to fatigue, joint pain to brain fog. I started developing new symptoms. My brain seems to scramble words when I read now or it messes up grammar. I have a persistent pain in my left side that doctors cant explain. My rib cage in the front on my left side also goes through flair ups where it hurts when I breath and I have been developing migraines. The fatigue got worse until I was only awake about 2-4 hours a day total and all of my lymph glands swelled up again. It felt like when I had mono so I went in to try and figure out what was going on. My internist sent me to doctor number 5, an infectious disease specialist, who told me I had a mono reactivation. At this point it had been exactly a year since I left college with my first bout of mono. He said it was really rare and he wanted to test my immune system. He ran a complete blood count, C-reactive protein test, t-cell test, and a few others. Everything came back normal. My doctor said he had no idea why I got mono again and seems to have no idea what to do with my other symptoms! I want to ask for more tests but I dont even know what tests to ask for anymore or what doctors to ask to see and I am afraid they are going to diagnose me as a hypochondriac! Currently my symptoms are dermatographia hives (particularly when upset but often without obvious cause) migraines joint pain joint stiffness Nausea loss of appitite brain fog trouble concentrating extreme fatigue vomiting, sometimes without even feeling ill beforehand dizziness pain in my left side, about where my spleen is, but doctors say my spleen is not enlarged pain in my ribs sometimes when I breath that lasts a few hours no fevers ever.-numbness and tingling in my hands and feet at times mouth ulcers. (I have had these since I was a kid. The come and go. I sort of get break outs of them) Anyone have any ideas? Anything helps. I just want to go finish college and move on to my career but cant do that while I am this sick! I am a 21 year old white female if that helps anything. Liked by lucky1038 Follow Report"

He ran a complete blood count, C-reactive protein test, t-cell test, and a few others. Everything came back normal. My doctor said he had no idea why I got mono again and seems to have no idea what to do with my other symptoms! I want to ask for more tests but I dont even know what tests to ask for anymore or what doctors to ask to see and I am afraid they are going to diagnose me as a hypochondriac!

A friend of mine who has lupus said it sounded like it could be autoimmune but I really dont know anymore! The following chunk is going to be a long medical history and I apologize, I just want to give as much information as possible in hopes of getting help. I was born premature but had amazing algae scores and was sent home that day. My mother tells me I was always sick as a baby with chronic throat infections of some kind or other. She made the doctors remove my tonsils before I was 2 in hopes that it would help but it didnt seem to. Growing up I remember always being sick. I seemed to get every bug going around but was always especially susceptible to strep throat infections and sinus infections. I was sick so much that by highschool I am pretty sure I only was actually able to attend around 2/3 of the total days in the school year. Maybe even less than that and this wasnt me staying home with colds, this was constant stomach flu, upset respritory infections, and of course strep throat. I also had constant hives and dermatographia since I was young and still have it to this day! The doctors always wrote it off, saying it was probably a food allergy, but never really looked into it. I also never ran fevers as a kid and instead run at a constant 97.6. In 2016 my constant bad health seemed to take a turn for the worst. Right after graduating highschool I got so sick I was bedridden for the whole summer. I was throwing up, having joint pain, and sleeping all the time. No fever but I NEVER run fevers. After a month of it my mother took me in to my family doctor. She ran a mono test and Lyme test which both came back negative but she was sure it was mono so she told me to come back in a few weeks. I did but the test was negative again, and then again when I came in another month later. My white counts were high but they couldnt figure out what was wrong other than that. Finally after 4 months I got better and stopped going back to the doctor, just in time for me to go to my freshmen year of college. I made it through my first semester, despite the fact I got stomach flu and strep a few times but then part way through my second semester I got sick again. I was throwing up to the point I had to be hospitalized for fluids. All of my lymph nodes were so swollen I didnt even look like I had a neck and was having a hard time swallowing. This time it turned out I actually did have mono. I had to leave my college and go home to recover. It took a total of about 4 months to get better but I never felt 100% again after that. My doctor told me it could take up to a year to feel fully better so I decided to take time off of college and get a job. The job lasted about three months. I was so tired in that time that I would get up to go to work, struggle through my shift, go home, and immediately go to sleep. I was only awake about 10 hours a day but I figured it was just because I wasnt used to working and would adjust. Then I started developing severe joint pain and stiffness, to the point that it was hard to get up off the couch simply because I couldnt unbend. Both of my parents have rheumatoid arthritis so I assumed it was that and went in to my doctor for testing. I was only 20 and knew I shouldnt be feeling as old as I suddenly felt. She ran an ANA that came back normal. A week later I passed out in the shower. My parents and I assumed maybe the water had been to hit and left it at that. Another week later I passed out at work. The fainting episodes became a normal part of my life which led to me quitting my job. I went to see my primary physician again but she was clueless. She ran a complete blood count, metobolic panel, and tested me for Addisons disease. It all came back fine aside from a slightly elevated white blood count. She then referred me to doctor number 2, an internist. Doctor number 2 was probably the best I had ever seen. Listened to my story then tested me for dermatographia before I had even mentioned the hives or dermatographia. He sent me to an allergist. Doctor number 3, the allergist. I explained the dermatographia and the fact that I had it, along with hives, since I was a kid. We had never been able to link the hives to any food and explained that sometimes I would break out in hives because of the heat or because of crying or getting stressed. He told me he couldnt test me with the scratch test because I had dermatographia but that he could test my blood for allergies. He told me he didnt think this would be helpful however because the would only be able to test for a few things and he said my hives sounded idiopathic. I went home without the test. I followed up with my internist, doctor number 2, but while the nurse was taking my vitals she found I had a heart murmur. I was sent for an ultrasound of my heart and they found I had a mitral valve prolapse but told me it was nothing to be concerned about. I went back in later for the follow up and the nurse took my vitals and found I had a heart arythmia. They gave me a 24 hour heart monitor. I only actually ended up wearing the monitor for 20 hours because the sticky pad things they used caused my skin to blister up and peel off. The cardiologist I saw, doctor number 4, told me my heart murmur was benign and then went on to suggest that maybe I was on too many medications due to the fact that I take an anti anxiety, and antidepressant. Back to doctor number 2, my internist. He gave me two different anti-histamines and sent me home in hopes it would improve my symptoms. All of my symptoms kept getting worse. I developed brain fog, trouble concentrating, headaches, and none of my previous symptoms improved. I turned to the internet in hopes of figuring out why I was fainting and read about postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or POTS for short. I went to my doctor that week and asked if he had ever heard of it. He told me he didnt think that was what I had, as it was rare, and sent me home. My mother convinced me to go back and demand to be tested, and it turns out I do have POTS. On an average day, my heart rate laying is 55 and it jumps to 130 when I am standing. Thankfully now that I know what is going on I was able to start managing symptoms and hoped it would help with everything from the fainting to fatigue, joint pain to brain fog. I started developing new symptoms. My brain seems to scramble words when I read now or it messes up grammar. I have a persistent pain in my left side that doctors cant explain.

I would like to see if anyone has changed/found a certain diet/foods helpful in keeping inflammation in check. Hes a newbie, so we would live your feedback. virgo 1952 (my online name) Follow Report"

I am a 58 year old woman who had JDM from age 4-17. However, I have had so many health problems as an adult that seem related to the damage done by that disease, such as widespread muscle atrophy, foot drop, and severe calcinosis in my leg muscles, as well as some sort of very painful neuropathy that comes in relapses and remissions (small fiber neuropathy or CRPS). I'm wondering if there are other adults who had a severe juvenile dermatomyositis with some of these leftovers and if so, what have you tried for the calcinosis? I'm also very interested to see if anyone with dermatomyositis has permanent foot drop that began along with the other initial symptoms of skin problems and proximal muscle weakness, suggesting maybe a neuromyositis along with the dermato. Recently (at least in the last 3 years) the calcinosis in my legs has been getting larger faster and has become painful and sometimes swells and is now causing some superficial vein issues in my calf. There seems to be nothing known that helps arrest the growth of these masses which are now about 9""x3"" in 3-4 places in my thighs and calf, and it is encasing my sciatic nerve which is causing lots of pain. If it doesn't stop growing, I envision not being able to sit or bend my left leg before many more years pass. I am on Diltiazem, which isn't arresting it, and I've been on Alendronate for a year or so in the past. I've had rounds of IVIG for the CRPS/SFN years ago, and many rounds of IV steroids and oral Prednisone, along with Methotrexate a couple different times. Steroids help the pain associated with these masses, but they don't stop them growing. I also have pretty severe osteoporosis so steroids are not so much of an option unless I'm in absolute misery. I'd love to hear from anyone who has similar experiences, or who has children with JDM and calcinosis. Thank you. Follow Report"

Things have gotten better since December but I seem to be having new issues since then. I have had issues with my back for approximately 10 years on and off mainly tightness of muscles in my back always in the right scapular area. I have always seen a chiropractor for this it gets better after but soon comes back. 2 yrs ago I stayed having pain in my right wrist and my knees were bothering me. I did not seek medical attention for this as the symptoms would come and go and I could go months in between of having nothing until it acted up again. I summed it up as I was working out to much, I was doing CrossFit type classes and running quite a bit.Last fall things really changed however, I started having these terrible back spasms? It felt like a bolt of electricity down my spine and the pain would radiate out. It hurt to move or breath. The pain would eventually ease up but that would take almost all day for any relief. I had 3 of these episodes of which I seen my chiropractor for and he said he couldnt make much since of it. Then I started having electric like shocks in the left side of my face this lasted for about 2 mos. During this time the muscles in my back grew drastically stiffer. The stiffness involved my whole back and neck. I finally went to my Dr. who sent me to Physcial Therapy. I went to 2 sessions and quit because they told me they were not for sure what the issue was and things were getting worse. I ended up back at my primary cares office due to worsening of symptoms. I started having low grade fevers every evening along with chills. I had no appetite (I ended up losing 10lbs in about 3 wks time). I have muscle twitches throughout my body, this has been constant since it started in early December. I have them every day regardless of how Im feeling they seem worse when I feeling bad though. I had tensions headaches that were horrible no over the counter pain medicine would help. I also had an extremely sore throat and at times it felt like something was stuck in my throat this also caused trouble swallowing. I also had joint pain and muscle aches all over my body. I also suffer extreme fatigue. Heart palpitations, I had every test ran on my heart and they couldnt find anything wrong. During this time I had tons of lab tests run and they found I had a positive ANA- 1:320, low positive Rheumatoid Factor- 37. I was sent to a Rheumatologist. Since this time I have seen 2 different rheumatologist the second I am still seeing today between the 2 I think they have ran every lab they could run and have only found a positive anti-RO SSA- >8.0. I had a salivary gland ultrasound that came back normal and a Schirmer test which was also normal- 18-20mm in both eyes for 5 mins. I had an MRI without contrast of my brain and cervical spine which came back normal. Lyme disease test which came back negative but I have had several drs tell me that that test is worthless. Which makes me second guess its findings. I also had an EMG done on arms and hands only which only found I had mild carpal tunnel. Dispite all the tests I have had done my rheumatologist has not been able to make a diagnosis. YWhile things have gotten a bit better since December I still have flare ups. Ill have days and weeks I almost feel like my old self then all of a sudden I have several days in a row or weeks in a row where all my symptoms come back.My rheumatologist has sent me back to the neurologist and Im currently waiting for my appt. She says I need re-evaluated by him due to some new neurological symptoms Im experiencing. Those include pins and needles feeling in my hands at night, a vibrating sensation in my left thigh and also my feet. The left side of my tongue and lips feel numb/tingling. And the persistent muscle twitching which has not resolved in its own. I also have trouble thinking at times (brain fog).Im sorry for the long post but I wanted to put it all out there to see if someone else has had anything similar. To add Im a 33 yr old female and have been a type 1 diabetic for 32 yrs. my diabetes is very well controlled. My endocrinologist has ordered every lab she can to rule out anything on her side which included a celiac panel, adrenal panel, B-12, and there was one other but all of those tests came back normal. My ferritin level is low this was found about two years ago and they were never able to figure out why. When this flared up in December my primary checked my iron and the ferritin level was 19, borderline low which is what it always has been. She rechecked 4mos later and it had dropped to 6. I am back on my iron supplements currently.Thanks in advance to anyone that can add any info that would be helpful to me figuring this out! Liked by Lyn Follow Report"

To add Im a 33 yr old female and have been a type 1 diabetic for 32 yrs. my diabetes is very well controlled. My endocrinologist has ordered every lab she can to rule out anything on her side which included a celiac panel, adrenal panel, B-12, and there was one other but all of those tests came back normal. My ferritin level is low this was found about two years ago and they were never able to figure out why. When this flared up in December my primary checked my iron and the ferritin level was 19, borderline low which is what it always has been. She rechecked 4mos later and it had dropped to 6.

Things have gotten better since December but I seem to be having new issues since then. I have had issues with my back for approximately 10 years on and off mainly tightness of muscles in my back always in the right scapular area. I have always seen a chiropractor for this it gets better after but soon comes back. 2 yrs ago I stayed having pain in my right wrist and my knees were bothering me. I did not seek medical attention for this as the symptoms would come and go and I could go months in between of having nothing until it acted up again. I summed it up as I was working out to much, I was doing CrossFit type classes and running quite a bit.Last fall things really changed however, I started having these terrible back spasms? It felt like a bolt of electricity down my spine and the pain would radiate out. It hurt to move or breath. The pain would eventually ease up but that would take almost all day for any relief. I had 3 of these episodes of which I seen my chiropractor for and he said he couldnt make much since of it. Then I started having electric like shocks in the left side of my face this lasted for about 2 mos. During this time the muscles in my back grew drastically stiffer. The stiffness involved my whole back and neck. I finally went to my Dr. who sent me to Physcial Therapy. I went to 2 sessions and quit because they told me they were not for sure what the issue was and things were getting worse. I ended up back at my primary cares office due to worsening of symptoms. I started having low grade fevers every evening along with chills. I had no appetite (I ended up losing 10lbs in about 3 wks time). I have muscle twitches throughout my body, this has been constant since it started in early December. I have them every day regardless of how Im feeling they seem worse when I feeling bad though. I had tensions headaches that were horrible no over the counter pain medicine would help. I also had an extremely sore throat and at times it felt like something was stuck in my throat this also caused trouble swallowing. I also had joint pain and muscle aches all over my body. I also suffer extreme fatigue. Heart palpitations, I had every test ran on my heart and they couldnt find anything wrong. During this time I had tons of lab tests run and they found I had a positive ANA- 1:320, low positive Rheumatoid Factor- 37. I was sent to a Rheumatologist. Since this time I have seen 2 different rheumatologist the second I am still seeing today between the 2 I think they have ran every lab they could run and have only found a positive anti-RO SSA- >8.0. I had a salivary gland ultrasound that came back normal and a Schirmer test which was also normal- 18-20mm in both eyes for 5 mins. I had an MRI without contrast of my brain and cervical spine which came back normal. Lyme disease test which came back negative but I have had several drs tell me that that test is worthless. Which makes me second guess its findings. I also had an EMG done on arms and hands only which only found I had mild carpal tunnel. Dispite all the tests I have had done my rheumatologist has not been able to make a diagnosis. YWhile things have gotten a bit better since December I still have flare ups. Ill have days and weeks I almost feel like my old self then all of a sudden I have several days in a row or weeks in a row where all my symptoms come back.My rheumatologist has sent me back to the neurologist and Im currently waiting for my appt. She says I need re-evaluated by him due to some new neurological symptoms Im experiencing.

She was a high school athlete and healthy. She multi-tasked 3 sports, Club Volley, MAYB, college credit hours and work. College is less stressful for her as she is taking 16 credit hours and not working. We feel that going to class and doing her best in classes is her job during her college years so we are not asking her to work a job. I don't feel STRESS is the cause of this sudden onset of hair loss. About six weeks ago she noticed a small bald spot starting on her front hairline. We went to see a dermatologist and he took a glance at her and diagnosed her with Alopecia Areata. He did not want to do any lab work but started treatment of corticosteriod injections and 10 days of prednisone. My friend who is an OBGYN agreed to check her thyroid and check for Lupus. The Lupus came back negative and her TSH was 6.1 and T4 was within normal limits. The tests did show elevated ferritin levels. At that point we made an appt to see an endocrinologist. He did not want to treat her thyroid unless the TSH was elevated to 10 and only if her T4 went out of range. He did run tests for Hashimoto's, testrone levels and antibodies. Those were all negative. At this point, weeks have passed by and the significant hair loss is now multiple bald spots growing into each other making large patchy spots. Her hair is constantly falling out all over and we are now looking at hair pieces and wigs. I wanted a second opinion and was able to see another endocrinologist and he started her on Synthroid. Another week has passed. We are into week 7 and she is still losing hair by the handfuls. I am so frustrated that I cannot find a doctor who wants to dive deeper into the root cause of the hair loss. The doctors are wanting to treat the symptoms but I don't feel they want to figure out what might be causing the hair follicles to react the way they are. I understand she has an autoimmune disorder but what is causing this reaction? Is there anyone who can help? We are thinking we may need to take her to Mayo Clinic.

I was referred by my ortho surgeon to a rheumatologist after blood work revealed an elevated CRP and Sed rate. I had several foot surgeries involving melted tendons (my surgeons words). He always found inordinate amounts of inflammation during the 5 surgeries he had performed. He sent me for tests following the second surgery but RF and Sed were normal. Several years and three surgeries later he re-tested because I had developed debilitating fatigue, nodules on my fingers, along with extreme joint pain in my hands and wrists. He put me on a round of steroids and had my appt expedited. Of course the steroids calmed down the symptoms but the rheumy did find warmth and swelling in fingers, wrists, knees, elbows, and ankles. He felt sure my inflammation markers would be through the roof. Thus it begansigh. All tests were NORMAL He repeated them in a month with the same result. After the third month with clinical findings (still normal test results) he started me on Plaquenil. It slowly calmed down the joint pain over a few months. All tests still normal. About 6 months into treatment I developed photosensitive rashes, and chronic mouth ulcers. The fatigue continued and the swollen, inflamed joints were present at every 3 month follow-up. I then had a positive ANA at 1:160 Homogenous pattern. All other tests were normal.

About a year ago I developed mild Reynauds, chronic anemia, low calcium. and low Vit D and elevated EOS. I developed thyroid nodules and had thyroidectomy April 2015. All other tests remain negative. Yesterday I got the results of my last blood work. Anemia improved but still there, Vit D and calcium normal. EOS is11.5. I remain in a constant state of frustration at the lack of diagnosis.

Not so unusual,since she us a high school teacher and is exposed to a variety of things throughout the year. She was also running a low grade fever, usually in the afternoons, but wasnt at the time of her visit to the doctor. She was given a short course of antibiotics. While she was there she was persuaded to take a flu and Prevnar 13 shot (she is 65). By the time she got home, a rash developed at the injection site. By the next day, her back was covered with a rash two feet wide by three feet long. It looked like a poison ivy reaction. She continued to work but got weaker by the day. She did not want to go back to the doctor. At the end of September, I took her to the ER because of her deteriorating condition and she was experiencing periodic double vision. They did a pretty full work up on her (including a head and neck cT scan, one with iodine and one without, and xrays). She has mild bronchiectasis and the doctor  focusing on her low grade temperature and white blood cell count concluded she had a mild case of pneumonia. Two powerful antibiotics were prescribed and she was sent home. My wife has never taken much medication, and after three days the antibiotics had pretty much destroyed her stomach. On day four she stopped taking them. She had Abdominal pain and nausea. Her appetite began to fade. The rash was still present a month after it first appeared. Back to the doctor. We were referred to a neurologist, a pulmonologist, a rheumatologist and she underwent extensive testing, including for west Nile, HIV, valley fever, lupus, Sjgrens, RA, and myasthenia gravis. She tested positive for RA but showed no symptoms of it. Negative on everything else. She continued to decline. I took her back to the ER and they admitted her to the hospital. Her kidneys were beginning to fail. In the hospital, the tests Continued. She could not (and still cannot) tolerate solid food because of the intense nausea. At the hospital she was given three different anti nausea medications through iv. She was even throwing up water. After four days, kidney function improved and the nausea was alleviated by medication. She was sent home. That was three weeks ago. Since then, she has remained very weak and has nausea almost all the time. She ingests only Boost/Ensure and water and occasionally a few tablespoons of cream of wheat. Since this started, she has lost 12 lbs, and is to all intents an invalid. The weight loss has stopped. The rash is gone. Every other day she consumes about 800 -1400 calories. The rest of the time we are lucky if she takes in 300-400. At times, she has muscle pain in her jaws. She can walk only 10 feet unassisted. We are trying major league probiotics, CBC oil and drops, vitamins, and electrolyte supplements. In short, after innumerable visits to the doctor, numerous phone consultations, 74 vials of blood drawn for testing, CT/MRI/X-ray, four days in the hospital, we are no closer to an solution or explanation than we were when we started. The nausea renders her incapable of sleeping more than three hours at a time. She drinks copious amounts of water (dry mouth). Her temperature spikes every afternoon between 6 and 7 pm at 100.5-101.8. Tomorrow we have more blood tests to monitor kidney function, to test for infectious disease, and to do a CT scan of her stomach and abdomen. Needless to say, her career as an AP teacher and Academic Decathlon coach are over. At this point, the best diagnosis we have is a general severe autoimmune disorder.

I have the skin lichen planus as well as oral lichen planus which affects my gums, cheeks, and tongue. It is very , very painful. I had a very large back surgery in April and I got lichen planus sores on my back as a result of the trauma from surgery my incision that is twenty inches long healed but my sores from lichen planus are still open.

The pain is so deep in the nerves that I feel like my teeth are going to explode and I can feel my pulse under my teeth. I cant explain the pain and I am begging for someone to tell me if they found anything that helps with the pain. Also I never heard of lichen planus , what can I expect from this disease? How often will I have outbreaks? will it ever go away? Should I have my teeth pulled out or will dentures make it even worse?

Prednisone was increased to10m daily. In Jan prednisone was lowered to 9m but has not been lowered since even though doctor says my labs all look perfect.At this point Im losing faith in my doctor and not sure how to proceed with treatment. Because I have no family or support system in this country I have no one to discuss this with so Im hoping someone out there can give me some insight.Ive recently been diagnosed with Sjorgens syndrome and was told treatment was the same as PR and GCA. so nothing further need be done.Im now dealing with facial pain, fatigue, chronic constipation, swelling in my legs and hands and insomnia.My recent lab tests show high bilirubin scores, high total neutrophils, plus low eosinophils absolute, low monocytes, and low monocytes absolute.I dont know what all that means but when I question my rheumatologist about it she does nothing to alleviate my fears and just says your labs all look perfect and maybe you should see a therapist.Im very afraid of what is happening to me and would really appreciate advice from anyone out there with knowledge and information about my health problems.Thank youAnya Liked by Dee Follow Report"

Ive never heard of such a thing! What on earth? Well Clippers is real and is one of the newer Autoimmune Diseasesit was only given a name in 2010. Its similar to many other AD Ive read about on Connect: vague, random symptoms that can be debilitating and difficult to diagnose. An MRI and brain biopsy are needed to confirm diagnosis. My journey with Clippers (Chronic Lymphocytic Inflammation with Pontine Perivascular Enhancement Responsive to Steroids) began with unexplainable vomiting. After many trips to the ER and being shrugged off be doctors, someone decided that it must be a gallbladder problem, so it was taken out, but nothing changed. The vomiting got worse and, eventually, I couldnt walk without help, I choked on foods and water, my voice changed, and I lost 20 pounds. I was finally taken seriously by doctors when husband again took me to the ER and I was basically unresponsive. I was admitted and given an MRI (which I had repeatedly begged for) and the scan showed a large area of demyelination of my brain. None of the doctors knew what was going on, but the neurologist finally decided on intravenous steroids and a brain biopsy. I have no memory of that hospitalization. When I got to rehab, my husband took me to University of Colorado medical center where I continue to get treatment in their neurology-immunology department. My message is to encourage anyone, with unexplainable symptoms, to tell the doctors to think outside the box and to advocate for themselves. Have someone go with you to appointments and to take notes! Dont keep information only in your head! Anyone else out there?

The theory that I read says that many autoimmune issues are caused by a deficiency in endorphins, endorphins regulate the immune system. LDN temporarily blocks the bodys natural endorphin production for a few hours, this tricks the body into thinking it needs to increase endorphin production. When the blockade wears off, all the endorphins are released into the body, regulating the immune system and providing natural pain relief for the rest of the day. Apparently, LDN can increase your endorphins by up to 300% LDNscience.org has a lot of information and research about it. You can also look at the writer, Annie Habler (@hablerannie) on Medium.com who wrote an article recently about the fascinating background and history of LDN. Please let me know if you have tried it and what your experience was like. If you could let me know any details your condition,the dosage you used, any side effects, etc it would be helpful.

The rest of the week is kind of a blur do to being so stuffed up. This morning I noticed my skin is completely clear and where the plaques were is flat. I am loving it as my skin is rarely completely clear. I was able to wear a v neck shirt today and put my hair up as I am not trying to hide the marks. Has anyone else experienced this?

My cheek(s) and/or ear(s) get beat red, hot to the touch, and swell. I got tested up and down, no not lupus, not anything they could pin down. I finally saw an infectious disease dr who blamed this inflammation on recurring ebstein barr virus. Anyway, no one has really helped me out with this and im having attacks daily. My hands and feet will sometimes do the same. I feel like im on fire. Im concerned about all the ibuprofen im taking, though im taking under daily max.

In May a doctor tested my anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs). The titre was 1:2560. I know ANAs can be elevated by autoimmune diseases, cancer, and viral/bacterial infections, among other things. So far, doctors havent been able to figure out whats wrong, despite a host of weird symptoms and irregular tests.

Ive repeatedly read that the titres caused by viruses and bacterial infections are usually mild, presumably <640. Is that true?

305,C0393639,Hashimoto's encephalitis,C0542476,Forgetful,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/autoimmune-encephalitis-autoimmune-dementia/,Autoimmune Encephalitis/ Autoimmune Dementia,"Has anyone on here been treated at Mayo Florida for either autoimmune dementia or autoimmune encephalitis? My 46 year old son went there for almost 1 year with debilitating symptoms and also has the Ganglionic AChR antibodies, some things showing up in brain MRI that are not right for his age, and many irregularities in some bloodwork. Because one psychiatrist saw him for 1 hour, one time, we were told he had depression. Im still in shock that was their total answer! We went to Mayo Florida last year because my 46 year old son started acting strange, he would do things like wake up at 3am and go swimming in the ocean. He knew that something was wrong with him and his thinking because he kept forgetting things. Finally he forgot how to do his usual work, he couldnt remember things like how to play the guitar, he was making decisions that didnt make sense. After the local doctors couldnt figure it out, we went to Mayo Florida. He saw a neurologist and endocrinologist, they did tests and found that he had the Ganglionic AChR antibodies, some T2 intensities on MRI, and some bloodwork that was off. The report came back that he had a 46% chance of having autoimmune dementia and 30% chance of having cancer. Long story short, they did PET scan for cancer and couldnt find any. Sent him to a psychiatrist for 1 hour, one time. Psych doc says he has depression and after that, no one cared that he was having so many autoimmune symptoms, they chocked everything up to depression. They kept telling me that he needed to be on depression meds and all his many symptoms were being caused by depression. I had never heard of depression causing a person to have ganglionic Achr antibodies or bloodwork that was way off (like when his IGF1 was 50 to 100 points above the highest reference rangein 5 separate tests, for over a year) I didnt know depression could cause your knee to buckle and make you fall down. Even when I told them he was having major speech problems, personality differences, strange facial expressions, major cognitive and memory problems, still they kept insisting that he was depressed and they were not happy that I wanted to know real answers and would not put him on depression meds for something obviously not depression! His neurologist and endocrinologist saw him in the very beginning but after that, they just did tests that they posted on the portal. I had to call and write to get any response. I had suspected his thyroid since the beginning because he has had thyroid issues all his life, but all the doctors kept telling me his thyroid was fine aside from a few nodules. Finally, after a needle biopsy on his thyroid that said possible cancer, I insisted on having his thyroid taken out. Mayo fought me on this but since it was possible cancer, it was our choice. 8 days after thyroid removal and replacement meds, we all started noticing a big difference in him. Over the next 6 weeks, he was almost normal again. The one thing he never got back though was his personality, that has changed drastically. I called Mayo because this is a huge symptom that it was autoimmune and I wanted follow up treatment. None of his doctors wanted to see him again. They all told me that depression was causing the personality change and apparently they dont think the surgery had anything to do with him getting better. All of us hat truly know him, We know that he has something autoimmune or else he would not of improved so drastically right after surgery and hormone replacement. He has had every symptom of autoimmune dementia/encephalitis but they think its depression. How would they really know? They have barely seen him and they ignore any tests that dont point to depression. Once you get that diagnosis, they just stop looking for real answers! I was also told that since he owes $2,000 on his bill, they wouldnt consider seeing him til thats cleared up. Our insurance has paid many many many thousands of dollars to this hospital. I cannot believe they are withholding treatment for $2,000. I paid $900 out of my pocket for the first consult that lasted for 1 hour and forty minutes. Then insurance took over after that. Biggest mistake I ever made taking him there because now he thinks hes better and doesnt realize his personality change for the much worse. The rest of us can not believe what Mayo totally overlooked! Follow Report"

Her disease is debilitating, and like many of you in this group, shes been labelled an attention seeker, a chronic complainer, etc., etc., etc. I am not certain that her illness is autoimmune, but I suspect it very strongly. Her symptoms are widespread (intestinal, epidermal, muscular/skeletal, and on and on). Recently, her family doctor in Canada, where we live, made a referral to Mayo which was highly detailed, chronicling her complicated medical history, progression of symptoms, and the day to day grim reality of this progressively treacherous disease. To our utter shock and disappointment, we received word today that the referral had passed through internal medicine, down to gastroenterology, and was, with regret, not accepted. According to the letter, they felt there was nothing to be done. I cant say how disheartening this news is. A young and vibrant person that I love is ill and suffering desperately. Our doctor has promised to write a strident letter of appeal. I called the international appointments office today, and the representative I spoke with said that she would be sure to resubmit our application, and advised that we wait until the doctors appeal is received also, so that that can be reviewed along with the referral. I am anxious to hear if anyone has a similar experience of at first being denied an appointment, and through contestation eventually received one. I fear that our window of opportunity to receive meaningful treatment is shrinking. Liked by heatherg Follow Report"

I felt tired and was dealing with nausea, headaches, bloating, shoulder pain and so on. She then sent me to a hematologist who in turn did a lot of blood work, x-rays, and another ultrasound.

I have a question that maybe someone whos been through something similar can help me with. Im a 33 year old Hispanic male. Whole thing started late June of 2018. I noticed a big lump about size of an egg on left side of neck above collarbone. My doc did blood work and sent me to do a ultrasound. I was told blood work came back ok but but radiologist thought lump was lymph node. She then sent me to have CT scan. By this time I had already been feeling a little off at times. I felt tired and was dealing with nausea, headaches, bloating, shoulder pain and so on. She then sent me to a hematologist who in turn did a lot of blood work, x-rays, and another ultrasound. He said he thought lump was a muscle and not lymph node. Whooo, but then he said blood work keeps showing positive ana. He then did a ena panel and came back positive for scleroderma, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Wow! So now he sends me to a rheumatologist. A week before appt I got strep throat. It was the worst thing I have ever been through. Every bone in my body hurt so bad for three days and I had a massive headache the whole time. I never ever miss work but I did this time. I explained all this to him. He then said well since you dont have any swelling I dont think you have an auto immune disease. I think you have fibromyalgia. He sent me to do a bone density scan and a lot more blood work. Ill see him in two more weeks. Just wanted to get you guys take on this.

I was 23, no other known health problems, then suddenly I got extremely fatigued for about 2 weeks back in November then I started getting muscle spasms, too. Now, I have been chronically fatigued for 9 months, & nothing eases the fatigue there are only things that make it worse. Sleep does nothing, caffeine does nothing, rest does nothing but if I dont sleep, or miss a meal, or do any amount of exercise, or use my brain for more than very basic functions, my fatigue gets worse & it can take a few days to recover if I push myself too far. In addition, I have muscle spams only on the right side of my body that are triggered by physical activity. They make walking pretty impossible because my right leg has major random muscle contractions that I cant control walking makes my fatigue & spasms worse, anyways. On top of all of that, I have brain fog, too. I used to work as a junior scientist in a lab researching muscular dystrophy at the University of Minnesota Id just graduated from college with a B.S. in biochemistry 6 months before all this started happening. Basically, I am trying to say that I really enjoyed being mentally stimulated and I liked to work out complex problems. Now, if I try to stimulate myself mentally, I cant concentrate at all and I get really, REALLY tired. I get kind of confused and my short-term memory has gone to crap. I literally dont even hear when people are talking to me unless they specifically get my attention first my poor husband will tell me an entire story and my brain doesnt even pick up that someone was talking if Id been doing something other than talking to him when he began telling his story. I feel awful every time he has to ask, Did you hear what I just said? & thats the first time I even registered his voice. So now, Ive seen several doctors (4 neurologists, a rheumatologist, 2 PCPs, an endocrinologist, & a psychotherapist). I have had a few abnormal test results that apparently dont actually mean anything which makes me wonder why the doctors had me pay to have them done in the first place. I had high insulin & C-peptide levels when I was tested in November (not a diabetic), but then it was never tested again. I had high Epstein-Barr Virus antibody titers in January, but then I was never tested again. I had high antibody titers against antistreptolysin O (Group A Strep) in June, but was told that didnt mean anything (then why did the doctor order this test!!!). I had low acylcarnitine levels in January, then I was tested again in June and they were even lower, but I switched from a rheumatologist (who thought this was significant but didnt know what it meant exactly) to a neurologist, and the neurologist literally ignored me when I mentioned it to him. So, theres my 5 abnormal test results that apparently mean nothing, because the doctors Ive spoken to either ignore them entirely or tell me that they are insignificant. Ive never had mono (epstein-barr virus) or strep throat (antistreptolysin-O) before either, at least Ive never thought I did or been diagnosed with either of them before, so idk why my antibody titers would be high (IgG antibodies for both, so the ones that indicate a previous infection but not a current one). I was diagnosed with Functional Movement Disorder by a neurologist very recently for my muscle spasms only (not the fatigue & brain fog, so these are still 100% unresolved issues). He told me to get physical therapy, then told me most patients see a dramatic decrease in symptoms within 2-3 PT sessions & total & permanent absence of symptoms within 4-5 months. I got physical therapy for 4 months earlier this year (late December  mid-April), but I assumed that was not specifically targeting my muscle spasms & was more to prevent muscle atrophy, so I thought that this new PT was going to specifically target my symptoms. So, I saw the physical therapist that he highly recommended to me, & she told me that she looked over the previous physical therapists notes, and said shed have done exactly the same therapy with me for Functional Movement Disorder. So like what the hell, honestly? Did the doctor not know that Id received PT for 4 months already? I called his office yesterday explaining that the new physical therapist just told me Id basically already received treatment for the thing he diagnosed me with & that obviously it didnt work after 4 months the first time, so it would be ridiculous to do the exact same thing again hoping for different results (still waiting on a call back regarding this). Also, the physical therapist he recommended ignored me when I told her at least 4 times during our 40-minute appointment that I crash if I push myself too hard, then she pushed me way too hard, & I had a horrible crash she actually managed to induce new, worse symptoms in me because she pushed me too hard. Great, I really love being ignored by people who are supposed to be helping me & then ultimately being made sicker by them because they ignored me (sarcasm). I have a whole slew of other, smaller symptoms, but these are the big ones. My question now is this: How on Earth do I get Mayo Clinic to accept me as a patient? My rheumatologist referred me to Neurology at Mayo & I was denied. Then a few days ago I tried to self-refer to Internal Medicine at Mayo as a last-ditch effort because Id heard of someone who was rejected with a doc referral but got in on self-referral, & I got an email this morning saying I was rejected from Internal Medicine, too. Do I just have to wait until Ive been sick for years and years like all the other people Ive read on here who have stories of finally getting diagnosed? I do not want to keep wasting my time with doctors who ignore what I say & keep telling me they dont know whats wrong with me without giving me any advice on what to do next. I am beyond frustrated that I have spent thousands of dollars I do not have only to still be at square 1 of diagnosis. My only thought of how to get diagnosed is to go to Mayo Clinic (Rochester, as I live in MN I cannot afford to travel farther), but they are too full of other desperate people trying to get their diagnoses, and I cant get in. Tl;dr: Anyone have any tips on how I can get into Mayo Clinic  Rochester after being denied entry into both Neurology (w/ doctor referral) & Internal Medicine (self-referral)?

Ive never had mono (epstein-barr virus) or strep throat (antistreptolysin-O) before either, at least Ive never thought I did or been diagnosed with either of them before, so idk why my antibody titers would be high (IgG antibodies for both, so the ones that indicate a previous infection but not a current one). I was diagnosed with Functional Movement Disorder by a neurologist very recently for my muscle spasms only (not the fatigue & brain fog, so these are still 100% unresolved issues). He told me to get physical therapy, then told me most patients see a dramatic decrease in symptoms within 2-3 PT sessions & total & permanent absence of symptoms within 4-5 months. I got physical therapy for 4 months earlier this year (late December  mid-April), but I assumed that was not specifically targeting my muscle spasms & was more to prevent muscle atrophy, so I thought that this new PT was going to specifically target my symptoms. So, I saw the physical therapist that he highly recommended to me, & she told me that she looked over the previous physical therapists notes, and said shed have done exactly the same therapy with me for Functional Movement Disorder. So like what the hell, honestly? Did the doctor not know that Id received PT for 4 months already? I called his office yesterday explaining that the new physical therapist just told me Id basically already received treatment for the thing he diagnosed me with & that obviously it didnt work after 4 months the first time, so it would be ridiculous to do the exact same thing again hoping for different results (still waiting on a call back regarding this). Also, the physical therapist he recommended ignored me when I told her at least 4 times during our 40-minute appointment that I crash if I push myself too hard, then she pushed me way too hard, & I had a horrible crash she actually managed to induce new, worse symptoms in me because she pushed me too hard. Great, I really love being ignored by people who are supposed to be helping me & then ultimately being made sicker by them because they ignored me (sarcasm). I have a whole slew of other, smaller symptoms, but these are the big ones. My question now is this: How on Earth do I get Mayo Clinic to accept me as a patient? My rheumatologist referred me to Neurology at Mayo & I was denied. Then a few days ago I tried to self-refer to Internal Medicine at Mayo as a last-ditch effort because Id heard of someone who was rejected with a doc referral but got in on self-referral, & I got an email this morning saying I was rejected from Internal Medicine, too. Do I just have to wait until Ive been sick for years and years like all the other people Ive read on here who have stories of finally getting diagnosed? I do not want to keep wasting my time with doctors who ignore what I say & keep telling me they dont know whats wrong with me without giving me any advice on what to do next. I am beyond frustrated that I have spent thousands of dollars I do not have only to still be at square 1 of diagnosis. My only thought of how to get diagnosed is to go to Mayo Clinic (Rochester, as I live in MN I cannot afford to travel farther), but they are too full of other desperate people trying to get their diagnoses, and I cant get in. Tl;dr: Anyone have any tips on how I can get into Mayo Clinic  Rochester after being denied entry into both Neurology (w/ doctor referral) & Internal Medicine (self-referral)?

I was 23, no other known health problems, then suddenly I got extremely fatigued for about 2 weeks back in November then I started getting muscle spasms, too. Now, I have been chronically fatigued for 9 months, & nothing eases the fatigue there are only things that make it worse. Sleep does nothing, caffeine does nothing, rest does nothing but if I dont sleep, or miss a meal, or do any amount of exercise, or use my brain for more than very basic functions, my fatigue gets worse & it can take a few days to recover if I push myself too far. In addition, I have muscle spams only on the right side of my body that are triggered by physical activity. They make walking pretty impossible because my right leg has major random muscle contractions that I cant control walking makes my fatigue & spasms worse, anyways. On top of all of that, I have brain fog, too. I used to work as a junior scientist in a lab researching muscular dystrophy at the University of Minnesota Id just graduated from college with a B.S. in biochemistry 6 months before all this started happening. Basically, I am trying to say that I really enjoyed being mentally stimulated and I liked to work out complex problems. Now, if I try to stimulate myself mentally, I cant concentrate at all and I get really, REALLY tired. I get kind of confused and my short-term memory has gone to crap. I literally dont even hear when people are talking to me unless they specifically get my attention first my poor husband will tell me an entire story and my brain doesnt even pick up that someone was talking if Id been doing something other than talking to him when he began telling his story. I feel awful every time he has to ask, Did you hear what I just said? & thats the first time I even registered his voice. So now, Ive seen several doctors (4 neurologists, a rheumatologist, 2 PCPs, an endocrinologist, & a psychotherapist). I have had a few abnormal test results that apparently dont actually mean anything which makes me wonder why the doctors had me pay to have them done in the first place. I had high insulin & C-peptide levels when I was tested in November (not a diabetic), but then it was never tested again. I had high Epstein-Barr Virus antibody titers in January, but then I was never tested again. I had high antibody titers against antistreptolysin O (Group A Strep) in June, but was told that didnt mean anything (then why did the doctor order this test!!!). I had low acylcarnitine levels in January, then I was tested again in June and they were even lower, but I switched from a rheumatologist (who thought this was significant but didnt know what it meant exactly) to a neurologist, and the neurologist literally ignored me when I mentioned it to him.

I believed them of-course. Nothing would take it away. Prednisone never worked. It was in the sixties so I will admit I smoked hives gone???? Every Time!!!!! I told drs about it. Mar. in my case must have done something to my Immune system? I wonder if Mayo Clinic would do a little research on it? I would be so happy and very curious as to why that worked? Remission, than back again for years nothing helped. Saw a International dr. in S. Carolina who put me on Cyclosporin, they were gone in a short time!!! Remission. I was given Cymbalta, that evening they were back, again to the ER. Stopped the drug. Immunologist, I received shots every week for months. They are gone now and I hope forever!

That kind of diagram is new for me because in the past my pain was much more localized.

Ever since I had my second child, I have developed bronchitis and/or walking pneumonia at least once or twice a year. I spent about 3 years of not getting referred out to a specialist and finally decided to take things into my own hands and find a new doctor outside the small town we lived in. That doctor referred me to an asthma and allergy clinic where I was diagnosed with asthma at the age of 33. Since then, I've been on a daily inhaler called Symbicort taking two puffs twice a day, Albuterol as needed, Zyrtec once a day for allergies, Prednisone 1-3x a year when I get sick, and a wide variety of antibiotics. If I get a cold, it immediately turns into a bacterial infection. My doctors have done all the standard autoimmune disease tests and everything comes back okay. I am an archaeologist, so perhaps I developed this in relation to my job. All I know is that I spend a good part of the year sick, and want to find a solution beyond taking more and more antibiotics. My doctor suggested that it might be a rare/undiagnosed autoimmune disease since everything goes right to my chest/walking pneumonia/bacterial infection. Thanks in advance for the help and advice.

I was diagnosed a few years ago with Discoid Lupus although the Drs are not really sure. I have been using liquid Clobetesol on my scalp for the itching and soreness with inflammation. It is basically one area of my scalp on the top of my scalp and slightly to the left although the remainder of my scalp is also somewhat itchy. Recently a new dermatologist suggested that I try 5mg injections of the same steroid into my scalp in the irritated area. They did not help and so she increased the dose to 10mgs. Immediately I worsened and in the center I had a slight bump and then my hair fell out. It is not a huge area and I can cover it with the rest of my hair but I am remaining very sore, inflamed and itchy. I feel that my hair is becoming thinner all around this area and tonight I cannot sleep because of the itching which seems to be spreading. I am also taking Plaquinel by mouth and they tell me that it doesnt work for 3-4 months. I have been on it for about 3 weeks. Does anyone else have a similar problem and have you had any good results? Has anything helped? I am scared of losing all my hair. Thanks. Jennifer Liked by Becky, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

Two years ago this month I noticed the beginning of facial swelling. It started on both eyelids and then migrated to both cheeks and then to my Parotid glands. Within two months my face was noticeably puffy and swollen. To this day, the facial swelling is still there and NO other parts of my body have been affected. Initial trips to my primary care physician, Emergency Room visits, two ENTs and an allergist yielded zero results and no opinions of what was possibly wrong. Following that I made the decision to go to a holistic doctor. He ran multiple blood tests, allergy tests(high yeast count which prompted him to put me on the Candida diet; this did nothing), thyroid tests (low Normal results, he suggested Synthroid but recommended the diet initially). Acknowledging that there may be something bigger than he could handle he recommended me to a special diagnostic clinic at Emory Hospital in Atlanta. The unit at Emory consisted of a number of specialists who saw patients with undiagnosed conditions. The disciplines they represented included; ENT, Hematologist, Rheumatologist, Endocrinologist, Immunologist. Over the course of three months I had individual appointments with each group. The bloodwork that each doctor ordered came back with no indication of any illness outside of a low white blood count and low platelet count. As part of this process I also had chest x-rays, biopsy of sub-mandibular gland, head and neck CT scan, Bone marrow biopsy which also came back normal. I left Emory because they told me that they couldnt identify what was wrong with me and frankly didnt have any defined next steps. I then decided to go to an infectious disease doctor and all of the tests that were run came back negative; Lymes disease, infections etc The doctor could clearly see my facial swelling and she recommended that I go back to a rheumatologist, which I did. The Rheumy, who I have been going to for the last 5 months, reviewed all of my past history of blood test results and previous doctors notes. He diagnosed me with what he termed an immune deficiency which he felt was manifesting as an auto-immune disease, even though all my blood work never revealed any markers for any known auto-immune diseases and I dont exhibit any symptoms from the neck down. He prescribed a course of Prednisone over a 6-week period/20mg/10mg/5mg (facial swelling was extremely responsive and face looked normal BUT swelling returned within three days of going off the steroids). He then prescribed plaquenol with a low dose of prednisone(5mg) which I have been on for 90 days now and the swelling has not gone away. My Rheumy has mentioned going on either, Azathioprine, Methatrexate or Sulfasalazine to see what that would do but I have opted not to because I feel that I need a valid diagnosis prior to taking any drug like that. I am not sure if this is truly a rheumatological or an endocrine issue. I have exhibited zero markers for a rheumatological disease and only a low normal for thyroid disease.

However, I have had seemingly unrelated pain flares (atypical of symptoms) along with a worsening chronic pain for ten years that have left me on disability and unable to work. My emails were complicated. They included mentioning I had a flu that later turned to itchy lungs and joint pain. Then I described symptoms of being freezing cold despite 80-degree weather, itchy lungs, an enlarged lymph node behind my right ear, and low-grade fevers. Then I had inflammation in my lungs and needed to have cough syrup to calm the itching and pain. I emailed my primary care doctor and my rheumatologist. When I saw my primary care doctor at the end of May, she did no tests but gave me allergy medication and nasal spray. Mid-June, I had a week where the joint pain was too debilitating to sleep, running from the base of my right thumb to the right side at the base of my neck, to vertabrae mid-back connecting through my lower ribs. When I started having left-side lung inflammation while breathing in, I went to urgent care and a rheumatologist made me wait for a long time before telling me to try swimming and massage due to a Fibromyalgia diagnosis. My doctors are all through one big health system and they are able to access each others notes. He ended up prescribing Methylprednisolone last minute due a past prescription of Prednisone. It quickly worked to bring the pain down and stop the lung inflammation. The Methylprednisolone was the most effective medication I have ever tried and even helped the chronic pain far more than currently prescribed medications of weak Meloxicam, Colchicine (for the FMF) and Gabapentin. I visited the Emergency Department once my pain improved because I realized I had also been shivering cold with the lung symptoms since May. My heart was normal and my left lung, where I had the pain, had multiple tiny subsolid nodules. My rapid strep test was negative but the follow-up culture was positive for a small amount of Beta Strep Group C. I was negative for HIV or TB, didnt have a fever, had a normal white blood count and inflammatory markers were normal. My primary care doctor referred me to someone to look at the nodules in my lungs to make sure they have cleared. She said that it was normal for anyone to have Strep C and that it didnt require antibiotics and a nurse said She probably thinks its part of your natural flora. I pointed out that all my symptoms started on the same timeline at the beginning of May through mid-June, including 12 pounds of weight loss that had gone unnoticed by doctors, and that the only result so far was the strep. I printed out the email of detailed descriptions of illness and flares and the timeline they were on. I included past rheumatology labs or imaging tests that were positive before becoming a patient there and even made a little summary of history that included recurrent strep and strep before developing my joint flares ten years before. I am switching to another rheumatologist in the same department soon and messaged that it was urgent for me due to the severity of my last flare-up and the hope that the Methylprednisolone had provided a path toward diagnosis and treatment that will prevent and treat pain. I at least never want to experience such debilitating symptoms again. The appointment was canceled and postponed a week. I tried to point out that my flare was acute pain and not something that was normal for me  I could not rotate to the right on the toilet, sleep for four days, use my right hand, or walk sometimes. The cold causes pain in my hands and feet and it affects my tendons, causing plantar fasciitis to act up. It felt as if most of the right-side joints were affected, along with the base of my big toes and thumbs, and that there was a tightness of connective tissue. My rheumatologist has been dismissive of symptoms for over a year, only stating that the inflammatory markers are normal and that I am fine on current medications. At our consultation, I told her that my cousin on my moms side has Ankylosing Spondylitis but she put in her notes mother has lupus and would not change it when I brought it up. She responded to one email to say I did not have rheumatoid arthritis or Raynauds disease but I have never suggested that I have any specific disorder  I have only described my symptoms and emailed during acute flares. I dont know why tests are negative for inflammation but it seems like it should be enough that a powerful steroid was effective. A few days into the pack of Methylprednisolone, my joints all started popping like pressure was being released. I am actually questioning whether I should switch to an entirely new health system based off these experiences. I could swear that there is something that comes up in my chart that is making doctors so lazy, rude, and dismissive. My interpersonal style is a little different due to inattentive ADHD, being autism spectrum. I am also trans and I dont know who has access to this information but receptionists have also become very rude recently. But my questions are : Is it normal to not be prescribed an antibiotic for a small amount of recovered Strep Group C? Especially with the symptoms like itchy throat and yellow mucus in the back of my throat that required cough medicine? Am I crazy in thinking I could have had an infection that went untreated? Could the nodules in my lungs be from an untreated infection? Is Strep C really part of my natural flora? Could I have an undiagnosed autoimmune disorder that might be connected with the strep? Could my symptoms be cancer since I have had rapid weight loss and the nodules on the lung or is it illness? Could I really just have a severe allergy? I have been referred to a specialist for it. Is there a better place in the U.S. to find the answers I need? Someone please help.

However, I have had seemingly unrelated pain flares (atypical of symptoms) along with a worsening chronic pain for ten years that have left me on disability and unable to work. My emails were complicated. They included mentioning I had a flu that later turned to itchy lungs and joint pain. Then I described symptoms of being freezing cold despite 80-degree weather, itchy lungs, an enlarged lymph node behind my right ear, and low-grade fevers. Then I had inflammation in my lungs and needed to have cough syrup to calm the itching and pain. I emailed my primary care doctor and my rheumatologist. When I saw my primary care doctor at the end of May, she did no tests but gave me allergy medication and nasal spray. Mid-June, I had a week where the joint pain was too debilitating to sleep, running from the base of my right thumb to the right side at the base of my neck, to vertabrae mid-back connecting through my lower ribs. When I started having left-side lung inflammation while breathing in, I went to urgent care and a rheumatologist made me wait for a long time before telling me to try swimming and massage due to a Fibromyalgia diagnosis. My doctors are all through one big health system and they are able to access each others notes. He ended up prescribing Methylprednisolone last minute due a past prescription of Prednisone. It quickly worked to bring the pain down and stop the lung inflammation. The Methylprednisolone was the most effective medication I have ever tried and even helped the chronic pain far more than currently prescribed medications of weak Meloxicam, Colchicine (for the FMF) and Gabapentin. I visited the Emergency Department once my pain improved because I realized I had also been shivering cold with the lung symptoms since May. My heart was normal and my left lung, where I had the pain, had multiple tiny subsolid nodules. My rapid strep test was negative but the follow-up culture was positive for a small amount of Beta Strep Group C. I was negative for HIV or TB, didnt have a fever, had a normal white blood count and inflammatory markers were normal. My primary care doctor referred me to someone to look at the nodules in my lungs to make sure they have cleared. She said that it was normal for anyone to have Strep C and that it didnt require antibiotics and a nurse said She probably thinks its part of your natural flora. I pointed out that all my symptoms started on the same timeline at the beginning of May through mid-June, including 12 pounds of weight loss that had gone unnoticed by doctors, and that the only result so far was the strep. I printed out the email of detailed descriptions of illness and flares and the timeline they were on. I included past rheumatology labs or imaging tests that were positive before becoming a patient there and even made a little summary of history that included recurrent strep and strep before developing my joint flares ten years before. I am switching to another rheumatologist in the same department soon and messaged that it was urgent for me due to the severity of my last flare-up and the hope that the Methylprednisolone had provided a path toward diagnosis and treatment that will prevent and treat pain. I at least never want to experience such debilitating symptoms again. The appointment was canceled and postponed a week. I tried to point out that my flare was acute pain and not something that was normal for me  I could not rotate to the right on the toilet, sleep for four days, use my right hand, or walk sometimes. The cold causes pain in my hands and feet and it affects my tendons, causing plantar fasciitis to act up. It felt as if most of the right-side joints were affected, along with the base of my big toes and thumbs, and that there was a tightness of connective tissue. My rheumatologist has been dismissive of symptoms for over a year, only stating that the inflammatory markers are normal and that I am fine on current medications. At our consultation, I told her that my cousin on my moms side has Ankylosing Spondylitis but she put in her notes mother has lupus and would not change it when I brought it up. She responded to one email to say I did not have rheumatoid arthritis or Raynauds disease but I have never suggested that I have any specific disorder  I have only described my symptoms and emailed during acute flares. I dont know why tests are negative for inflammation but it seems like it should be enough that a powerful steroid was effective. A few days into the pack of Methylprednisolone, my joints all started popping like pressure was being released. I am actually questioning whether I should switch to an entirely new health system based off these experiences. I could swear that there is something that comes up in my chart that is making doctors so lazy, rude, and dismissive. My interpersonal style is a little different due to inattentive ADHD, being autism spectrum. I am also trans and I dont know who has access to this information but receptionists have also become very rude recently. But my questions are : Is it normal to not be prescribed an antibiotic for a small amount of recovered Strep Group C? Especially with the symptoms like itchy throat and yellow mucus in the back of my throat that required cough medicine? Am I crazy in thinking I could have had an infection that went untreated? Could the nodules in my lungs be from an untreated infection? Is Strep C really part of my natural flora? Could I have an undiagnosed autoimmune disorder that might be connected with the strep? Could my symptoms be cancer since I have had rapid weight loss and the nodules on the lung or is it illness? Could I really just have a severe allergy? I have been referred to a specialist for it. Is there a better place in the U.S. to find the answers I need? Someone please help.

However, I have had seemingly unrelated pain flares (atypical of symptoms) along with a worsening chronic pain for ten years that have left me on disability and unable to work. My emails were complicated. They included mentioning I had a flu that later turned to itchy lungs and joint pain. Then I described symptoms of being freezing cold despite 80-degree weather, itchy lungs, an enlarged lymph node behind my right ear, and low-grade fevers. Then I had inflammation in my lungs and needed to have cough syrup to calm the itching and pain. I emailed my primary care doctor and my rheumatologist. When I saw my primary care doctor at the end of May, she did no tests but gave me allergy medication and nasal spray. Mid-June, I had a week where the joint pain was too debilitating to sleep, running from the base of my right thumb to the right side at the base of my neck, to vertabrae mid-back connecting through my lower ribs. When I started having left-side lung inflammation while breathing in, I went to urgent care and a rheumatologist made me wait for a long time before telling me to try swimming and massage due to a Fibromyalgia diagnosis. My doctors are all through one big health system and they are able to access each others notes. He ended up prescribing Methylprednisolone last minute due a past prescription of Prednisone. It quickly worked to bring the pain down and stop the lung inflammation. The Methylprednisolone was the most effective medication I have ever tried and even helped the chronic pain far more than currently prescribed medications of weak Meloxicam, Colchicine (for the FMF) and Gabapentin. I visited the Emergency Department once my pain improved because I realized I had also been shivering cold with the lung symptoms since May. My heart was normal and my left lung, where I had the pain, had multiple tiny subsolid nodules. My rapid strep test was negative but the follow-up culture was positive for a small amount of Beta Strep Group C. I was negative for HIV or TB, didnt have a fever, had a normal white blood count and inflammatory markers were normal. My primary care doctor referred me to someone to look at the nodules in my lungs to make sure they have cleared. She said that it was normal for anyone to have Strep C and that it didnt require antibiotics and a nurse said She probably thinks its part of your natural flora. I pointed out that all my symptoms started on the same timeline at the beginning of May through mid-June, including 12 pounds of weight loss that had gone unnoticed by doctors, and that the only result so far was the strep. I printed out the email of detailed descriptions of illness and flares and the timeline they were on. I included past rheumatology labs or imaging tests that were positive before becoming a patient there and even made a little summary of history that included recurrent strep and strep before developing my joint flares ten years before. I am switching to another rheumatologist in the same department soon and messaged that it was urgent for me due to the severity of my last flare-up and the hope that the Methylprednisolone had provided a path toward diagnosis and treatment that will prevent and treat pain. I at least never want to experience such debilitating symptoms again. The appointment was canceled and postponed a week. I tried to point out that my flare was acute pain and not something that was normal for me  I could not rotate to the right on the toilet, sleep for four days, use my right hand, or walk sometimes. The cold causes pain in my hands and feet and it affects my tendons, causing plantar fasciitis to act up. It felt as if most of the right-side joints were affected, along with the base of my big toes and thumbs, and that there was a tightness of connective tissue. My rheumatologist has been dismissive of symptoms for over a year, only stating that the inflammatory markers are normal and that I am fine on current medications. At our consultation, I told her that my cousin on my moms side has Ankylosing Spondylitis but she put in her notes mother has lupus and would not change it when I brought it up. She responded to one email to say I did not have rheumatoid arthritis or Raynauds disease but I have never suggested that I have any specific disorder  I have only described my symptoms and emailed during acute flares. I dont know why tests are negative for inflammation but it seems like it should be enough that a powerful steroid was effective. A few days into the pack of Methylprednisolone, my joints all started popping like pressure was being released. I am actually questioning whether I should switch to an entirely new health system based off these experiences. I could swear that there is something that comes up in my chart that is making doctors so lazy, rude, and dismissive. My interpersonal style is a little different due to inattentive ADHD, being autism spectrum. I am also trans and I dont know who has access to this information but receptionists have also become very rude recently. But my questions are : Is it normal to not be prescribed an antibiotic for a small amount of recovered Strep Group C? Especially with the symptoms like itchy throat and yellow mucus in the back of my throat that required cough medicine? Am I crazy in thinking I could have had an infection that went untreated? Could the nodules in my lungs be from an untreated infection? Is Strep C really part of my natural flora? Could I have an undiagnosed autoimmune disorder that might be connected with the strep? Could my symptoms be cancer since I have had rapid weight loss and the nodules on the lung or is it illness? Could I really just have a severe allergy? I have been referred to a specialist for it. Is there a better place in the U.S. to find the answers I need? Someone please help.

However, I have had seemingly unrelated pain flares (atypical of symptoms) along with a worsening chronic pain for ten years that have left me on disability and unable to work. My emails were complicated. They included mentioning I had a flu that later turned to itchy lungs and joint pain. Then I described symptoms of being freezing cold despite 80-degree weather, itchy lungs, an enlarged lymph node behind my right ear, and low-grade fevers. Then I had inflammation in my lungs and needed to have cough syrup to calm the itching and pain. I emailed my primary care doctor and my rheumatologist. When I saw my primary care doctor at the end of May, she did no tests but gave me allergy medication and nasal spray. Mid-June, I had a week where the joint pain was too debilitating to sleep, running from the base of my right thumb to the right side at the base of my neck, to vertabrae mid-back connecting through my lower ribs. When I started having left-side lung inflammation while breathing in, I went to urgent care and a rheumatologist made me wait for a long time before telling me to try swimming and massage due to a Fibromyalgia diagnosis. My doctors are all through one big health system and they are able to access each others notes. He ended up prescribing Methylprednisolone last minute due a past prescription of Prednisone. It quickly worked to bring the pain down and stop the lung inflammation. The Methylprednisolone was the most effective medication I have ever tried and even helped the chronic pain far more than currently prescribed medications of weak Meloxicam, Colchicine (for the FMF) and Gabapentin. I visited the Emergency Department once my pain improved because I realized I had also been shivering cold with the lung symptoms since May. My heart was normal and my left lung, where I had the pain, had multiple tiny subsolid nodules. My rapid strep test was negative but the follow-up culture was positive for a small amount of Beta Strep Group C. I was negative for HIV or TB, didnt have a fever, had a normal white blood count and inflammatory markers were normal. My primary care doctor referred me to someone to look at the nodules in my lungs to make sure they have cleared. She said that it was normal for anyone to have Strep C and that it didnt require antibiotics and a nurse said She probably thinks its part of your natural flora. I pointed out that all my symptoms started on the same timeline at the beginning of May through mid-June, including 12 pounds of weight loss that had gone unnoticed by doctors, and that the only result so far was the strep. I printed out the email of detailed descriptions of illness and flares and the timeline they were on. I included past rheumatology labs or imaging tests that were positive before becoming a patient there and even made a little summary of history that included recurrent strep and strep before developing my joint flares ten years before. I am switching to another rheumatologist in the same department soon and messaged that it was urgent for me due to the severity of my last flare-up and the hope that the Methylprednisolone had provided a path toward diagnosis and treatment that will prevent and treat pain. I at least never want to experience such debilitating symptoms again. The appointment was canceled and postponed a week. I tried to point out that my flare was acute pain and not something that was normal for me  I could not rotate to the right on the toilet, sleep for four days, use my right hand, or walk sometimes. The cold causes pain in my hands and feet and it affects my tendons, causing plantar fasciitis to act up. It felt as if most of the right-side joints were affected, along with the base of my big toes and thumbs, and that there was a tightness of connective tissue. My rheumatologist has been dismissive of symptoms for over a year, only stating that the inflammatory markers are normal and that I am fine on current medications. At our consultation, I told her that my cousin on my moms side has Ankylosing Spondylitis but she put in her notes mother has lupus and would not change it when I brought it up. She responded to one email to say I did not have rheumatoid arthritis or Raynauds disease but I have never suggested that I have any specific disorder  I have only described my symptoms and emailed during acute flares. I dont know why tests are negative for inflammation but it seems like it should be enough that a powerful steroid was effective. A few days into the pack of Methylprednisolone, my joints all started popping like pressure was being released. I am actually questioning whether I should switch to an entirely new health system based off these experiences. I could swear that there is something that comes up in my chart that is making doctors so lazy, rude, and dismissive. My interpersonal style is a little different due to inattentive ADHD, being autism spectrum. I am also trans and I dont know who has access to this information but receptionists have also become very rude recently. But my questions are : Is it normal to not be prescribed an antibiotic for a small amount of recovered Strep Group C? Especially with the symptoms like itchy throat and yellow mucus in the back of my throat that required cough medicine? Am I crazy in thinking I could have had an infection that went untreated? Could the nodules in my lungs be from an untreated infection? Is Strep C really part of my natural flora? Could I have an undiagnosed autoimmune disorder that might be connected with the strep? Could my symptoms be cancer since I have had rapid weight loss and the nodules on the lung or is it illness? Could I really just have a severe allergy? I have been referred to a specialist for it. Is there a better place in the U.S. to find the answers I need? Someone please help.

Got colonoscopy done that came out good, had the light ran down my stomach, that was good. My vision became blurry and had to get eye glasses, been having headaches and dizziness, the neurologist gave me medication for the dizziness that hasn't helped, tried meclizine, that hasn't helped. Waiting to get MRI done. Went to cardiologist, something is going on with my heart. Had a stress test, he needed me to stay up there for 6 minutes. I could only stay up there 4:43, that gave him no lead way. he ordered labs and found out that my RA factor was high, now I have to see a rheumatologist, I feel tired and weak all the time, feels like I'm about to fall sometimes, off balance.

I am a 40-yr old female and am currently a patient at Mayo (Rochester). Im usually a high-energy, Type A, productive type although my life has been turned upside down with a mystery illness I developed around mid-March. Prior to that Id had a sinus infections, treated with Levaquin, which didnt seem to help. At the time I wondered whether the infection had progressed into a viral infection. For a couple weeks I thought I was having a hard time recovering but then the symptoms progressed triggering a cascade of events unlike anything Ive ever experienced: dizziness/disorientation (not vertigo), uncharacteristically debilitating fatigue (bedridden for days & couldnt even go downstairs for a week), very weak, heart rate seemed to increase with any physical exertion, and what finally triggered me to see a Dr. was short-term memory problems. The memory problems were becoming more severe & frequent, and after a major incident I knew something was definitely wrong. I was also having a perpetual mental fogdifficulty concentrating and performing ALL life functions. At times it was like an altered state of consciousness & I had no concept whether minutes or hours had passed. At other times the fatigue was so severe I had trouble sitting up, holding my head up, or even keeping my eyes open. To sum things up, here were some of the specialists I saw and their diagnostic impressions: ENTnoticed poor coordination/balance and great difficulty walking straight linefelt it was either neurological or metabolic Otolaryngologistnoticed nystagmus & blood pressure dropped upon standing; referred me to a cardiologist While waiting for cardio. appt., I stumbled upon the only thing that seemed to helpI started adding salt & water to my diet and each day the dizziness subsided until it was completely gone at 10 days. Cardiologistgave echo, electrocardiogram, and Tilt Table Test. Told me to continue salt & water. On TTT at 11 minutes (< nitro) my systolic blood pressure dropped to 43 (baseline of 130) and my heart rate was 58. The test was immediately stopped and I was given IV saline. Diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope (aka vasovagal syncope, aka neurally mediated syncope). Dr. prescribed me midodrine but had poor response, tried raising and lowering dose over next few weeks but unsuccessful. Began suspecting adrenal dysfunction or Addisons Disease, put me on Florinef. Not sure if this helped as I developed another sinus infection (again treated w/Levaquin & again seemed ineffective & possible progression into virus?) In the process of all this my husband took me to the ER 3 times (4/1, 5/20, & 6/9I was admitted for 2 nights on 6/9). In retrospect now, each time the IV saline solution helped although symptoms (in one form or another) returned, presumably when the saline left my body. On 5/29 horrible piercing back pain set in and while I was in the hospital 6/9 I was diagnosed with C-Diff. This of course depleted my body further of fluid although I got a steady dose of IV saline during my inpatient stay. Despite being discharged w/C-Diff, I felt better than I had in months & cleaned the house, enjoyed doing laundry, etc. It was then I started putting together that administration of IV fluid seemed to bring great improvement (the more the better) until it tapered off. 5 days after my discharge, I could almost feel the effects of the fluid leaving my body setting in (not sure if its dehydration or what??) anddetermined not to plunge into the depths of the horrible symptoms again, I began consuming lots of Pedialyte. Thisalong with the Florinef (I think) helped. While hospitalized the ACTH provocation test was administered to me although did not indicate Addisons. The caveat, however, is the tech who drew my blood was too busy to make the draws at the proper times. The 30 minute was drawn at 43 minutes, the 60 minute was drawn at 75 minutes. My aldosterone was very low (1) but cortisol increased appropriately (albeit barely making the gains required). My Drs at home have hypothesized everything from partial complex seizures to cervical spine d/o. I put all my hopes in the Mighty Mayo Clinic pinpointing my problem but after being here 10 days, Im no further along in finding answers. In fact, Im more frustrated at this point than when I arrived here. Ive seen a Mayo cardiologist (who repeated the echo & electrocardiogram as well as a 24-hour Halter) who is emphatic that I do NOT have neurocardiogenic syncope and must be released from the clutches of a cardiologist. However, other than saying a cardiologist cannot help me, he had little other suggestion or help to offer me. Here at Mayo I saw a neurologist (which I requested before coming here) who is similarly emphatic that there is nothing neurologically that can explain my symptoms. She had me go through the Autonomic Reflex Screen yesterday; I had no further appts. with her but pleaded with her nurse to call me with the results. The test showed suppression of postganglionic response although the Dr. suspects this was caused by taking Tylenol PM the night before and recommends retaking the test when Im T-PM free for 3 days. Meanwhile we thought we had a *breakthrough* when a Dr. from back home called to give me the results of an overnight oximetry test Id taken pre-Mayo. My O2 levels were normal although I had an avg. of 15.5 episodes of sleep apnea per hour (over 6 hours, with a max. of 35 in hour 4). My Dr. at home recommended an overnight sleep study so Ive been doing everything to try to get this done while were here at Mayo. I was fortunate enough to be called on a wait list (called a checker here at Mayo) yesterday to see a Dr. in the sleep d/o dept. for a consult. He looked at the results, talked to me for a bit, and assured me he is certain that I do not have sleep apnea. He showed me that my O2 levels did not fluctuate during the oximetry test and was not impressed at all with the test showing my episodes of sleep apnea. He pretty much discounted those results altogether since it was from a home health clinic (his words not mine), there was no explanation of the results on the forms, and the description of the test itself was vague. From that he concluded it to be invalid & did not recommend a sleep study. So now Im in no mans land as far as understanding what in the world is going on inside my body. A couple Drs. here have suggested post-viral fatigue syndrome and have referred me to the fibromyalgia clinic (where Im spending my days as a checker since the 1st appt isnt for several weeks). The one common thread that seems to persist, however, is FLUID. I feel that surely that must mean something to someoneI had to stop the Florinef a couple of weeks ago prior to coming to Mayo (Ive also stopped the salt tablets). Although I wasnt convinced it was helping, I am now that Ive started to to regress since Ive discontinued it. From my own research on what conditions can cause chronic dehydration, Sjogrens Syndrome seems to keep coming up. Is anyone familiar with this? If so, what kind of specialist would I need to see? A rheumatologist? Opthalmologist? I didnt think my severely dry eyes had anything to do with the current symptoms but Im now wondering. Ive had severely dry eyes my entire life and have been using Rx Restasis for several years. (I had LASIK in 2001 and the Drs. told me my eyes were so severely dry I should actually reconsider having the surgery.) I also have severely dry throat & am hoarse a lot (I dont smoke or drink) and have to drink continuously water during meetings at work just to continue making presentations.

On 5/29 horrible piercing back pain set in and while I was in the hospital 6/9 I was diagnosed with C-Diff. This of course depleted my body further of fluid although I got a steady dose of IV saline during my inpatient stay. Despite being discharged w/C-Diff, I felt better than I had in months & cleaned the house, enjoyed doing laundry, etc. It was then I started putting together that administration of IV fluid seemed to bring great improvement (the more the better) until it tapered off. 5 days after my discharge, I could almost feel the effects of the fluid leaving my body setting in (not sure if its dehydration or what??) anddetermined not to plunge into the depths of the horrible symptoms again, I began consuming lots of Pedialyte. Thisalong with the Florinef (I think) helped. While hospitalized the ACTH provocation test was administered to me although did not indicate Addisons. The caveat, however, is the tech who drew my blood was too busy to make the draws at the proper times. The 30 minute was drawn at 43 minutes, the 60 minute was drawn at 75 minutes. My aldosterone was very low (1) but cortisol increased appropriately (albeit barely making the gains required). My Drs at home have hypothesized everything from partial complex seizures to cervical spine d/o. I put all my hopes in the Mighty Mayo Clinic pinpointing my problem but after being here 10 days, Im no further along in finding answers. In fact, Im more frustrated at this point than when I arrived here. Ive seen a Mayo cardiologist (who repeated the echo & electrocardiogram as well as a 24-hour Halter) who is emphatic that I do NOT have neurocardiogenic syncope and must be released from the clutches of a cardiologist. However, other than saying a cardiologist cannot help me, he had little other suggestion or help to offer me. Here at Mayo I saw a neurologist (which I requested before coming here) who is similarly emphatic that there is nothing neurologically that can explain my symptoms. She had me go through the Autonomic Reflex Screen yesterday; I had no further appts. with her but pleaded with her nurse to call me with the results. The test showed suppression of postganglionic response although the Dr. suspects this was caused by taking Tylenol PM the night before and recommends retaking the test when Im T-PM free for 3 days. Meanwhile we thought we had a *breakthrough* when a Dr. from back home called to give me the results of an overnight oximetry test Id taken pre-Mayo. My O2 levels were normal although I had an avg. of 15.5 episodes of sleep apnea per hour (over 6 hours, with a max. of 35 in hour 4). My Dr. at home recommended an overnight sleep study so Ive been doing everything to try to get this done while were here at Mayo. I was fortunate enough to be called on a wait list (called a checker here at Mayo) yesterday to see a Dr. in the sleep d/o dept. for a consult. He looked at the results, talked to me for a bit, and assured me he is certain that I do not have sleep apnea. He showed me that my O2 levels did not fluctuate during the oximetry test and was not impressed at all with the test showing my episodes of sleep apnea. He pretty much discounted those results altogether since it was from a home health clinic (his words not mine), there was no explanation of the results on the forms, and the description of the test itself was vague. From that he concluded it to be invalid & did not recommend a sleep study. So now Im in no mans land as far as understanding what in the world is going on inside my body. A couple Drs. here have suggested post-viral fatigue syndrome and have referred me to the fibromyalgia clinic (where Im spending my days as a checker since the 1st appt isnt for several weeks). The one common thread that seems to persist, however, is FLUID. I feel that surely that must mean something to someoneI had to stop the Florinef a couple of weeks ago prior to coming to Mayo (Ive also stopped the salt tablets). Although I wasnt convinced it was helping, I am now that Ive started to to regress since Ive discontinued it. From my own research on what conditions can cause chronic dehydration, Sjogrens Syndrome seems to keep coming up. Is anyone familiar with this? If so, what kind of specialist would I need to see? A rheumatologist? Opthalmologist? I didnt think my severely dry eyes had anything to do with the current symptoms but Im now wondering. Ive had severely dry eyes my entire life and have been using Rx Restasis for several years. (I had LASIK in 2001 and the Drs. told me my eyes were so severely dry I should actually reconsider having the surgery.) I also have severely dry throat & am hoarse a lot (I dont smoke or drink) and have to drink continuously water during meetings at work just to continue making presentations.

Not sure if this helped as I developed another sinus infection (again treated w/Levaquin & again seemed ineffective & possible progression into virus?) In the process of all this my husband took me to the ER 3 times (4/1, 5/20, & 6/9I was admitted for 2 nights on 6/9). In retrospect now, each time the IV saline solution helped although symptoms (in one form or another) returned, presumably when the saline left my body. On 5/29 horrible piercing back pain set in and while I was in the hospital 6/9 I was diagnosed with C-Diff. This of course depleted my body further of fluid although I got a steady dose of IV saline during my inpatient stay. Despite being discharged w/C-Diff, I felt better than I had in months & cleaned the house, enjoyed doing laundry, etc. It was then I started putting together that administration of IV fluid seemed to bring great improvement (the more the better) until it tapered off. 5 days after my discharge, I could almost feel the effects of the fluid leaving my body setting in (not sure if its dehydration or what??) anddetermined not to plunge into the depths of the horrible symptoms again, I began consuming lots of Pedialyte. Thisalong with the Florinef (I think) helped. While hospitalized the ACTH provocation test was administered to me although did not indicate Addisons. The caveat, however, is the tech who drew my blood was too busy to make the draws at the proper times. The 30 minute was drawn at 43 minutes, the 60 minute was drawn at 75 minutes. My aldosterone was very low (1) but cortisol increased appropriately (albeit barely making the gains required). My Drs at home have hypothesized everything from partial complex seizures to cervical spine d/o. I put all my hopes in the Mighty Mayo Clinic pinpointing my problem but after being here 10 days, Im no further along in finding answers. In fact, Im more frustrated at this point than when I arrived here. Ive seen a Mayo cardiologist (who repeated the echo & electrocardiogram as well as a 24-hour Halter) who is emphatic that I do NOT have neurocardiogenic syncope and must be released from the clutches of a cardiologist. However, other than saying a cardiologist cannot help me, he had little other suggestion or help to offer me. Here at Mayo I saw a neurologist (which I requested before coming here) who is similarly emphatic that there is nothing neurologically that can explain my symptoms. She had me go through the Autonomic Reflex Screen yesterday; I had no further appts. with her but pleaded with her nurse to call me with the results. The test showed suppression of postganglionic response although the Dr. suspects this was caused by taking Tylenol PM the night before and recommends retaking the test when Im T-PM free for 3 days. Meanwhile we thought we had a *breakthrough* when a Dr. from back home called to give me the results of an overnight oximetry test Id taken pre-Mayo. My O2 levels were normal although I had an avg. of 15.5 episodes of sleep apnea per hour (over 6 hours, with a max. of 35 in hour 4). My Dr. at home recommended an overnight sleep study so Ive been doing everything to try to get this done while were here at Mayo. I was fortunate enough to be called on a wait list (called a checker here at Mayo) yesterday to see a Dr. in the sleep d/o dept. for a consult. He looked at the results, talked to me for a bit, and assured me he is certain that I do not have sleep apnea. He showed me that my O2 levels did not fluctuate during the oximetry test and was not impressed at all with the test showing my episodes of sleep apnea. He pretty much discounted those results altogether since it was from a home health clinic (his words not mine), there was no explanation of the results on the forms, and the description of the test itself was vague. From that he concluded it to be invalid & did not recommend a sleep study. So now Im in no mans land as far as understanding what in the world is going on inside my body. A couple Drs. here have suggested post-viral fatigue syndrome and have referred me to the fibromyalgia clinic (where Im spending my days as a checker since the 1st appt isnt for several weeks). The one common thread that seems to persist, however, is FLUID. I feel that surely that must mean something to someoneI had to stop the Florinef a couple of weeks ago prior to coming to Mayo (Ive also stopped the salt tablets). Although I wasnt convinced it was helping, I am now that Ive started to to regress since Ive discontinued it. From my own research on what conditions can cause chronic dehydration, Sjogrens Syndrome seems to keep coming up. Is anyone familiar with this? If so, what kind of specialist would I need to see? A rheumatologist? Opthalmologist? I didnt think my severely dry eyes had anything to do with the current symptoms but Im now wondering. Ive had severely dry eyes my entire life and have been using Rx Restasis for several years. (I had LASIK in 2001 and the Drs. told me my eyes were so severely dry I should actually reconsider having the surgery.) I also have severely dry throat & am hoarse a lot (I dont smoke or drink) and have to drink continuously water during meetings at work just to continue making presentations.

Diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope (aka vasovagal syncope, aka neurally mediated syncope). Dr. prescribed me midodrine but had poor response, tried raising and lowering dose over next few weeks but unsuccessful. Began suspecting adrenal dysfunction or Addisons Disease, put me on Florinef.

On 5/29 horrible piercing back pain set in and while I was in the hospital 6/9 I was diagnosed with C-Diff. This of course depleted my body further of fluid although I got a steady dose of IV saline during my inpatient stay. Despite being discharged w/C-Diff, I felt better than I had in months & cleaned the house, enjoyed doing laundry, etc. It was then I started putting together that administration of IV fluid seemed to bring great improvement (the more the better) until it tapered off. 5 days after my discharge, I could almost feel the effects of the fluid leaving my body setting in (not sure if its dehydration or what??) anddetermined not to plunge into the depths of the horrible symptoms again, I began consuming lots of Pedialyte. Thisalong with the Florinef (I think) helped. While hospitalized the ACTH provocation test was administered to me although did not indicate Addisons. The caveat, however, is the tech who drew my blood was too busy to make the draws at the proper times. The 30 minute was drawn at 43 minutes, the 60 minute was drawn at 75 minutes. My aldosterone was very low (1) but cortisol increased appropriately (albeit barely making the gains required). My Drs at home have hypothesized everything from partial complex seizures to cervical spine d/o. I put all my hopes in the Mighty Mayo Clinic pinpointing my problem but after being here 10 days, Im no further along in finding answers. In fact, Im more frustrated at this point than when I arrived here. Ive seen a Mayo cardiologist (who repeated the echo & electrocardiogram as well as a 24-hour Halter) who is emphatic that I do NOT have neurocardiogenic syncope and must be released from the clutches of a cardiologist. However, other than saying a cardiologist cannot help me, he had little other suggestion or help to offer me. Here at Mayo I saw a neurologist (which I requested before coming here) who is similarly emphatic that there is nothing neurologically that can explain my symptoms. She had me go through the Autonomic Reflex Screen yesterday; I had no further appts. with her but pleaded with her nurse to call me with the results. The test showed suppression of postganglionic response although the Dr. suspects this was caused by taking Tylenol PM the night before and recommends retaking the test when Im T-PM free for 3 days. Meanwhile we thought we had a *breakthrough* when a Dr. from back home called to give me the results of an overnight oximetry test Id taken pre-Mayo. My O2 levels were normal although I had an avg. of 15.5 episodes of sleep apnea per hour (over 6 hours, with a max. of 35 in hour 4). My Dr. at home recommended an overnight sleep study so Ive been doing everything to try to get this done while were here at Mayo. I was fortunate enough to be called on a wait list (called a checker here at Mayo) yesterday to see a Dr. in the sleep d/o dept. for a consult. He looked at the results, talked to me for a bit, and assured me he is certain that I do not have sleep apnea. He showed me that my O2 levels did not fluctuate during the oximetry test and was not impressed at all with the test showing my episodes of sleep apnea. He pretty much discounted those results altogether since it was from a home health clinic (his words not mine), there was no explanation of the results on the forms, and the description of the test itself was vague. From that he concluded it to be invalid & did not recommend a sleep study. So now Im in no mans land as far as understanding what in the world is going on inside my body. A couple Drs. here have suggested post-viral fatigue syndrome and have referred me to the fibromyalgia clinic (where Im spending my days as a checker since the 1st appt isnt for several weeks). The one common thread that seems to persist, however, is FLUID. I feel that surely that must mean something to someoneI had to stop the Florinef a couple of weeks ago prior to coming to Mayo (Ive also stopped the salt tablets). Although I wasnt convinced it was helping, I am now that Ive started to to regress since Ive discontinued it. From my own research on what conditions can cause chronic dehydration, Sjogrens Syndrome seems to keep coming up. Is anyone familiar with this? If so, what kind of specialist would I need to see? A rheumatologist? Opthalmologist? I didnt think my severely dry eyes had anything to do with the current symptoms but Im now wondering. Ive had severely dry eyes my entire life and have been using Rx Restasis for several years. (I had LASIK in 2001 and the Drs. told me my eyes were so severely dry I should actually reconsider having the surgery.) I also have severely dry throat & am hoarse a lot (I dont smoke or drink) and have to drink continuously water during meetings at work just to continue making presentations.

I thought it was my ammonia levels. Instead it was my appendix. When l went to the hospital and before surgery the surgeon explained how she was going to do the surgery. She asked all the regular questions about your medical history before the surgery. She didnt ask me about my shunts in my liver. Strange. I told her because l am very careful about it. So she tells me well dont die on me. Now l didnt want to do the surgery after she said that. So my family said you have to or it can bust and you will die. I understand all that. Then my daughter tells me someone told her that it was the first time at the surgery they did my TIP procedure. I was in shock, l smell a rat l said because everytime l have to go to the hospital or see the doctors at that hospital they always say l have a mental problem and l am depressed and so on. So while l was in the hospital there was three meds they didnt give me. I told them and they were in shock they overlooked that and l daught that. Then l was having problems breathing and l was calling the nurse 3 times. I told them you didnt give me my inhaler or my cpac machine. They really was scared. Then they asked me if l take oxygen because my l was having breathing issues and my oxygen levels went down while was sleeping. I told them no. So they gave me oxygen and a breathing treatment. I told them this wouldnt have happened if they would have read my chart and see l have a cpac machine and take 2 inhalers. And they also didnt give me my eye medication even when they asked me if l had glaucoma. I had to have an ultrasound of my neck. They said it was ok. Then when l was discharged the medicine l was allergic to for my liver they had it on my chart that l take it after telling them that and my hepatologist that see at the same hospital.

I am at my wits end with all these erosive sores in my mouth. I've had two biopsies , one in the inside cheek and one under the side of my tongue. The spot under the tongue is extremely sore to touch and has been for over a year. It scares me because the soreness never goes away, sometimes it isn't as sore but nothing helps. Any home remedies for this dreadful condition? Follow Report"

That and a couple of other little things like psoriasis and migraines. (Its still weird to lump Crohns and migraines in as little things.) However, in the last 5 years, Ive had a cascade of issues that has led to a laundry list of diagnoses that are autoimmune or related conditions. Among these are Rheumatoid Arthritis, Reynauds, CFIDS, Fibromyalgia, etc. Many of my issues are still unexplained. One of the most annoying, concerning to me is, in a nutshell, bilateral monocular vertical diplopia. That is, double vision where the ghost images are above and below the actual thing, its still present when one eye is closed, and both eyes are affected. This problem is getting worse as time goes by. Ive seen several ophthalmologists, a neuro-ophthalmologist, and a retina specialist since I am taking Plaquenil for my RA. The Plaquenil use was ruled out as the issue. The only thing (that I am aware of) that they were not able to rule out was another autoimmune disease. Several of my doctors have expressed concerns about MS, but 3 brain MRIs in the last 5 years have not shown any lesions. Myasthenia Gravis is another potential, but my primary is unable to order the antibody tests, and I fired my rheumatologist for being a total jerk. I am in the process of finding a new one, but its difficult to find a doctor that is willing to take input from the patient or another doctor (in my experience). So, to stop my post from getting any longer, has anyone experienced this type of diplopia? Or does anyone have MG with ocular problems that sounds like this?

My daughter is 16 (17 in just a few days). 1.5 years ago she was a healthy girl that danced 5-6 days a week. First her primary noticed increased heart rates 170+. After a couple monitors, tests and trips to Childrens Hospital in KC they diagnosed her with POTS and EDS. Then she slowly began getting more tired, unable to complete dance classes ect. By Mid July this year we noticed she was losing weight and she was losing some hair. She was under some stress so we dismissed it. But by August she had lost 22 pounds and no longer was under stress. After a trip to the Primary he was thinking auto immune so he ran a ANA. Her titer was 1:320 so he thought it was worth investigating and sent her to a Rheumatologist and GI Doc. The Rheumatologist ran another ANA along with other tests. Her titer was 1:1280 at that time. However other tests came back 'within limits'. The GI has also done some test that were within limits. She maintained her weight but it takes us 2800 calories a day to do so. And in the mean time has had urine tests that were abnormal, developed kidney stone, cyst on kidney, multiple cysts on her ovaries, still can't get energy to even go to school, dance ect She has had 3 GI infections in the last 8 months and the list goes on.

And in the mean time has had urine tests that were abnormal, developed kidney stone, cyst on kidney, multiple cysts on her ovaries, still can't get energy to even go to school, dance ect She has had 3 GI infections in the last 8 months and the list goes on. Rheumatologist say well some people test positive even at 1280 and have no autoimmune disease. But what else could it be. And even though my Primary is amazing there is only so much they can do. I KNOW there is something wrong with my child if not autoimmune then what? Liked by Lyn Follow Report"

Maybe someone has a clue as to what might be going on with me. It is always good to use the experience and expertise of people around the world when it comes to finding solutions for seemingly difficult cases (I can't get rid of the feeling that my case is not so difficult after all, we just haven't found the piece that is linking it all yet). Moderators, please feel free to move this topic into another subgroup if you think it isn't in the right place. So here we go: I am 30 years old, male, from Switzerland and considered myself healthy all my life. I was building a career, did lots of sports, travelled the world and we where ready to get married in 2017  when in June 2015 my symptoms showed up to stay. Id like to give you a short overview on how this illness developed over time, on my current symptoms and on what medical testing has been conducted so far. General course of development: At first things deteriorated gradually. Everything started in 2015 when I was recovering from a few days of having the flu and went back on my road bike, which went fine. A few days later, I had this sudden onset of fatigue. I woke up in the morning and thought that something is really wrong. I've already had episodes where I felt sick and very tired during the 12 months before June 2015 with symptoms similar to what I was about to experience later on. But these episodes usually subsided after a few days and at that time it was still possible to exercise as the tiredness would usually go away a few minutes into training. Everyday life was never really affected at that point. In June 2015, this changed dramatically. Endurance sports were not possible anymore but I was still able to play a little bit of tennis if I pushed through and to go for short walks. Working was still possible even though it needed a huge effort from my side. I was ultimately forced to completely stop working in May 2016 after gradually reducing my workload beforehand. So over the following months I slowly started developing all the other symptoms mentioned in more detail below: Ear ringing and sleep disturbances were the first to arrive apart from the extreme exhaustion. Brain fog showed up. My fatigue and malaise started getting worse and worse. I then developed all the muscle aches and pains. Episodes where I felt like having the flu with general malaise but without a fever started arriving more frequently. At first they came for a few days every month and then increased to several days a week where I felt like this. Then the digestive symptoms came along. It was as if my whole body had started to break down and more and more systems were getting involved. Medical testing that was done by my family practitioner during that time did not render any conclusive results. I was then diagnosed with Hashimoto's in 2016 by thyroid ultrasound (very small thyroid volume of 4ml total, hyper-perfused tissue, free T-values in the low normal range, no antibodies). I was started on synthetic T4 but thyroid medication did not bring any relieve. I experimented with hormone brands and types from T4-only, T4&T3 synthetics, T3-only and finally ended up on a combination of synthetics and NDT. Most symptoms are still persisting and did not even improve much. Thyroidectomy performed in October 2018 relieved local symptoms but the systemic ones have persisted so far. I tried different diet changes as well. I have been gluten-free for almost two years now and even experimented with an autoimmune protocol diet for more than 3 month. Neither that nor any supplements did bring about any change. A short trial with Prednisone (5mg daily) in order to see whether this may calm down inflammation had strong adverse effects. I ended up with panic attacks and hypoglycemia. Symptoms overview: I am mostly exercise intolerant. Even 20 minutes of easy walking triggers fatigue. It is as if someone pulled the plug on me and I could literally fall asleep at the side of the road. I used to do several hundreds of kilometers on my road bike. It feels like this fatigue isn't muscle, cardiovascular or respiratory related, it rather seems like my central nervous system would go haywire. Within the last 7 months I have at least been able to reintegrate some light strength workout into my daily routine again (push-ups, sit-ups and core exercises in moderate quantities). Also, I have been able to go for short strolls but I rarely feel well while doing it  my brain seems to get fogged and fatigue creeps in. Then there is this feeling of malaise, like having the flu but without a fever although the doctor I saw recently measured 37.9 degrees Celsius within my ear (slightly elevated temperature). This feeling is not here every day but comes and goes in waves. When it gets bad, the only thing I can do is to lay down and rest. Ive had several episodes of sudden hypoglycemia within the last 3 years. When measuring blood sugar levels, they then tend to be around 2mmol/l and the typical symptoms of shakiness, weakness, cold sweat, dizziness, extreme sugar craving, etc. appear. I cannot link them to anything, sometimes they seem to be reactive to meals, sometimes they happen late at night. Apart from that blood sugar levels seem normal. They have certainly never been elevated. I get spells of ocular migraines (without pain so just the aura) that usually last for 20-30 minutes. I don't know what triggers them (hormonal fluctuation as the usually happen first thing in the morning?) but I do have them about 2-3 times a month, sometimes a few in just a few days, sometimes just one and a few weeks pass until the next one. I get days where my vision gets blurred and my eyes are clotted with a yellowish substance in the morning. It does not seem to be related to the fit of my contact lenses I wear for my Keratoconus as these episodes usually pass after a couple of days. I am having mouth sores quite often (usually 2 or three at the same time) that are really big and hurting badly. They tend to stay for about 2 weeks. They also seem to come and go in waves (see pictures attached). I was able to establish a link to fluctuations of thyroid hormone levels. Usually my ulcers are a good indicator that levels are shifting. Furthermore, my tongue has a thick white coating and pimples, all of it mainly in the back half of the tongue. Also, my tongue always has teeth marks in it at the edges. My voice often seems to be ""covered"" with a slimy substance after meals that I have to cough off. I experience constant high-pitched ear ringing. Also I get spells of sudden hearing loss that recover after a few minutes (mostly just on one ear, but not always on the same ear) and dizziness that goes away after a few seconds or minutes. This also happens randomly. My sleep is disturbed (non refreshing, light with episodes of vivid and bizarre dreams) and I feel hung over and poisoned upon waking in the morning. I get muscle pain all over my body (mainly leg, back and neck, feels like the pain I had when I was growing as a kid or after an intense workout). My skin is extremely dry and I get rashes out of nowhere (Urticaria like itchy bumps, exclusively in my face but without being able to identify the triggers). My thinking is impaired as well as I am struggling with brain fog all the time. Feels like everything is far away and perceived through a thick fog. I am mostly constipated with severe bloating and gas and sudden episodes of diarrhea that cannot be linked to food triggers (except very specific ones like grilled Tuna who gives me cramping and diarrhea within 30 minutes). Overview of testing performed: 2015: I have been thoroughly checked for any heart diseases (ultrasound, normal- and stress-electrocardiogram) with no results. 2017 & 2018: I had gastrointestinal ultrasound and stool sampling with no conclusive results. Calprotectin, Alpha1-Antitrypsin and Eosinophilic Protein X were ones slightly elevated. Colonoscopy did not show any abnormalities. 2017: I have been diagnosed with leaky gut, candida overgrowth and SIBO by functional medical doctors and a gastroenterologist. 2015-18: Different Endocrinologists did extensive testing with no abnormalities apart from my thyroid (Hashimoto's) and testosterone deficiency compared to healthy males of my age. 2016 & 2017: Brain MRIs showed some abnormalities. The doctors saw several small, round, non-specific T2w/FLAIR-hyperintense white matter lesions (bi-frontal, subcortical mainly in Gyrus frontalis superior. With regards to differential diagnosis Microangiopathy seems unlikely, most likely these were caused by the ocular migraines I am experiencing. 2015-2018: Neurological examinations (the ordinary type of testing every doctor does when thoroughly examining a patient fort he first time) did not render any abnormalities either. 2018: I was extensively tested for infectious diseases. Everything came back negative (including Lyme, EBV, Bartonella, CMV, Tuberculosis, Rickettsia, Coxiella, etc.) except for Parvovirus B-19, which was IgG positive. Extensive stool testing for parasites (also rather exotic ones) was negative. CRP was tested on several occasion and always normal. Hence, acute infectious disease of any kind was excluded. I was also tested for Autoantibodies (ANA, ANCA) which all came back within the normal range as well. So are my Immuneglobulins IgG and IgE. 2015 & 2016: I even went to see psychologists and psychiatrists in order to rule out any possibly hidden stress-related conditions, although they have never made sense to me in the first place  again no results. 2017: I was put on different kinds of functional medicine treatments after different kinds of testing: e.g. IV-therapy, acupuncture and infrared-fever-therapy, the latter of which led to severe adverse reactions presenting as severe cramping, paralysis and paraesthesia which all resolved after heat was reduced. None of them improved my condition while some made me even worse. After 3 months of trying we put a halt to this. Conclusion: Apart from my diagnosed Hashimotos, there is nothing to put a finger on that could explain my current state of health. There are several pieces to the puzzle that in my opinion must all be somehow related. As a matter of fact, I have been incapacitated for more than 3 years now without really knowing whats going on. This goes beyond frustration. I know that all of these symptoms are real. They are not in my head. And it truly is time to get my life back. Or at least for me to know what I am battling against and to get a chance to eventually conquer it. So any ideas you might have, I am happy to hear. I have recently stumbled across mast cell activation, which could be a possible explanation. Any experience on that would thus be helpful as well. Thanks for reading this and helping me improve!

Everything started in 2015 when I was recovering from a few days of having the flu and went back on my road bike, which went fine. A few days later, I had this sudden onset of fatigue. I woke up in the morning and thought that something is really wrong. I've already had episodes where I felt sick and very tired during the 12 months before June 2015 with symptoms similar to what I was about to experience later on. But these episodes usually subsided after a few days and at that time it was still possible to exercise as the tiredness would usually go away a few minutes into training. Everyday life was never really affected at that point. In June 2015, this changed dramatically. Endurance sports were not possible anymore but I was still able to play a little bit of tennis if I pushed through and to go for short walks. Working was still possible even though it needed a huge effort from my side. I was ultimately forced to completely stop working in May 2016 after gradually reducing my workload beforehand. So over the following months I slowly started developing all the other symptoms mentioned in more detail below: Ear ringing and sleep disturbances were the first to arrive apart from the extreme exhaustion. Brain fog showed up. My fatigue and malaise started getting worse and worse. I then developed all the muscle aches and pains. Episodes where I felt like having the flu with general malaise but without a fever started arriving more frequently. At first they came for a few days every month and then increased to several days a week where I felt like this. Then the digestive symptoms came along. It was as if my whole body had started to break down and more and more systems were getting involved. Medical testing that was done by my family practitioner during that time did not render any conclusive results. I was then diagnosed with Hashimoto's in 2016 by thyroid ultrasound (very small thyroid volume of 4ml total, hyper-perfused tissue, free T-values in the low normal range, no antibodies). I was started on synthetic T4 but thyroid medication did not bring any relieve. I experimented with hormone brands and types from T4-only, T4&T3 synthetics, T3-only and finally ended up on a combination of synthetics and NDT. Most symptoms are still persisting and did not even improve much. Thyroidectomy performed in October 2018 relieved local symptoms but the systemic ones have persisted so far. I tried different diet changes as well. I have been gluten-free for almost two years now and even experimented with an autoimmune protocol diet for more than 3 month. Neither that nor any supplements did bring about any change. A short trial with Prednisone (5mg daily) in order to see whether this may calm down inflammation had strong adverse effects. I ended up with panic attacks and hypoglycemia. Symptoms overview: I am mostly exercise intolerant. Even 20 minutes of easy walking triggers fatigue. It is as if someone pulled the plug on me and I could literally fall asleep at the side of the road. I used to do several hundreds of kilometers on my road bike. It feels like this fatigue isn't muscle, cardiovascular or respiratory related, it rather seems like my central nervous system would go haywire. Within the last 7 months I have at least been able to reintegrate some light strength workout into my daily routine again (push-ups, sit-ups and core exercises in moderate quantities). Also, I have been able to go for short strolls but I rarely feel well while doing it  my brain seems to get fogged and fatigue creeps in. Then there is this feeling of malaise, like having the flu but without a fever although the doctor I saw recently measured 37.9 degrees Celsius within my ear (slightly elevated temperature). This feeling is not here every day but comes and goes in waves. When it gets bad, the only thing I can do is to lay down and rest. Ive had several episodes of sudden hypoglycemia within the last 3 years. When measuring blood sugar levels, they then tend to be around 2mmol/l and the typical symptoms of shakiness, weakness, cold sweat, dizziness, extreme sugar craving, etc. appear. I cannot link them to anything, sometimes they seem to be reactive to meals, sometimes they happen late at night. Apart from that blood sugar levels seem normal. They have certainly never been elevated. I get spells of ocular migraines (without pain so just the aura) that usually last for 20-30 minutes. I don't know what triggers them (hormonal fluctuation as the usually happen first thing in the morning?) but I do have them about 2-3 times a month, sometimes a few in just a few days, sometimes just one and a few weeks pass until the next one. I get days where my vision gets blurred and my eyes are clotted with a yellowish substance in the morning. It does not seem to be related to the fit of my contact lenses I wear for my Keratoconus as these episodes usually pass after a couple of days. I am having mouth sores quite often (usually 2 or three at the same time) that are really big and hurting badly. They tend to stay for about 2 weeks. They also seem to come and go in waves (see pictures attached). I was able to establish a link to fluctuations of thyroid hormone levels. Usually my ulcers are a good indicator that levels are shifting. Furthermore, my tongue has a thick white coating and pimples, all of it mainly in the back half of the tongue. Also, my tongue always has teeth marks in it at the edges. My voice often seems to be ""covered"" with a slimy substance after meals that I have to cough off. I experience constant high-pitched ear ringing. Also I get spells of sudden hearing loss that recover after a few minutes (mostly just on one ear, but not always on the same ear) and dizziness that goes away after a few seconds or minutes. This also happens randomly. My sleep is disturbed (non refreshing, light with episodes of vivid and bizarre dreams) and I feel hung over and poisoned upon waking in the morning. I get muscle pain all over my body (mainly leg, back and neck, feels like the pain I had when I was growing as a kid or after an intense workout). My skin is extremely dry and I get rashes out of nowhere (Urticaria like itchy bumps, exclusively in my face but without being able to identify the triggers). My thinking is impaired as well as I am struggling with brain fog all the time. Feels like everything is far away and perceived through a thick fog. I am mostly constipated with severe bloating and gas and sudden episodes of diarrhea that cannot be linked to food triggers (except very specific ones like grilled Tuna who gives me cramping and diarrhea within 30 minutes). Overview of testing performed: 2015: I have been thoroughly checked for any heart diseases (ultrasound, normal- and stress-electrocardiogram) with no results. 2017 & 2018: I had gastrointestinal ultrasound and stool sampling with no conclusive results. Calprotectin, Alpha1-Antitrypsin and Eosinophilic Protein X were ones slightly elevated. Colonoscopy did not show any abnormalities. 2017: I have been diagnosed with leaky gut, candida overgrowth and SIBO by functional medical doctors and a gastroenterologist. 2015-18: Different Endocrinologists did extensive testing with no abnormalities apart from my thyroid (Hashimoto's) and testosterone deficiency compared to healthy males of my age. 2016 & 2017: Brain MRIs showed some abnormalities. The doctors saw several small, round, non-specific T2w/FLAIR-hyperintense white matter lesions (bi-frontal, subcortical mainly in Gyrus frontalis superior. With regards to differential diagnosis Microangiopathy seems unlikely, most likely these were caused by the ocular migraines I am experiencing. 2015-2018: Neurological examinations (the ordinary type of testing every doctor does when thoroughly examining a patient fort he first time) did not render any abnormalities either. 2018: I was extensively tested for infectious diseases. Everything came back negative (including Lyme, EBV, Bartonella, CMV, Tuberculosis, Rickettsia, Coxiella, etc.) except for Parvovirus B-19, which was IgG positive. Extensive stool testing for parasites (also rather exotic ones) was negative. CRP was tested on several occasion and always normal. Hence, acute infectious disease of any kind was excluded. I was also tested for Autoantibodies (ANA, ANCA) which all came back within the normal range as well. So are my Immuneglobulins IgG and IgE. 2015 & 2016: I even went to see psychologists and psychiatrists in order to rule out any possibly hidden stress-related conditions, although they have never made sense to me in the first place  again no results. 2017: I was put on different kinds of functional medicine treatments after different kinds of testing: e.g. IV-therapy, acupuncture and infrared-fever-therapy, the latter of which led to severe adverse reactions presenting as severe cramping, paralysis and paraesthesia which all resolved after heat was reduced. None of them improved my condition while some made me even worse. After 3 months of trying we put a halt to this. Conclusion: Apart from my diagnosed Hashimotos, there is nothing to put a finger on that could explain my current state of health. There are several pieces to the puzzle that in my opinion must all be somehow related. As a matter of fact, I have been incapacitated for more than 3 years now without really knowing whats going on. This goes beyond frustration. I know that all of these symptoms are real. They are not in my head. And it truly is time to get my life back. Or at least for me to know what I am battling against and to get a chance to eventually conquer it. So any ideas you might have, I am happy to hear. I have recently stumbled across mast cell activation, which could be a possible explanation. Any experience on that would thus be helpful as well. Thanks for reading this and helping me improve!

Maybe someone has a clue as to what might be going on with me. It is always good to use the experience and expertise of people around the world when it comes to finding solutions for seemingly difficult cases (I can't get rid of the feeling that my case is not so difficult after all, we just haven't found the piece that is linking it all yet). Moderators, please feel free to move this topic into another subgroup if you think it isn't in the right place. So here we go: I am 30 years old, male, from Switzerland and considered myself healthy all my life. I was building a career, did lots of sports, travelled the world and we where ready to get married in 2017  when in June 2015 my symptoms showed up to stay. Id like to give you a short overview on how this illness developed over time, on my current symptoms and on what medical testing has been conducted so far. General course of development: At first things deteriorated gradually. Everything started in 2015 when I was recovering from a few days of having the flu and went back on my road bike, which went fine. A few days later, I had this sudden onset of fatigue. I woke up in the morning and thought that something is really wrong. I've already had episodes where I felt sick and very tired during the 12 months before June 2015 with symptoms similar to what I was about to experience later on. But these episodes usually subsided after a few days and at that time it was still possible to exercise as the tiredness would usually go away a few minutes into training. Everyday life was never really affected at that point. In June 2015, this changed dramatically. Endurance sports were not possible anymore but I was still able to play a little bit of tennis if I pushed through and to go for short walks. Working was still possible even though it needed a huge effort from my side. I was ultimately forced to completely stop working in May 2016 after gradually reducing my workload beforehand. So over the following months I slowly started developing all the other symptoms mentioned in more detail below: Ear ringing and sleep disturbances were the first to arrive apart from the extreme exhaustion. Brain fog showed up. My fatigue and malaise started getting worse and worse. I then developed all the muscle aches and pains. Episodes where I felt like having the flu with general malaise but without a fever started arriving more frequently. At first they came for a few days every month and then increased to several days a week where I felt like this. Then the digestive symptoms came along. It was as if my whole body had started to break down and more and more systems were getting involved. Medical testing that was done by my family practitioner during that time did not render any conclusive results. I was then diagnosed with Hashimoto's in 2016 by thyroid ultrasound (very small thyroid volume of 4ml total, hyper-perfused tissue, free T-values in the low normal range, no antibodies). I was started on synthetic T4 but thyroid medication did not bring any relieve. I experimented with hormone brands and types from T4-only, T4&T3 synthetics, T3-only and finally ended up on a combination of synthetics and NDT. Most symptoms are still persisting and did not even improve much. Thyroidectomy performed in October 2018 relieved local symptoms but the systemic ones have persisted so far. I tried different diet changes as well. I have been gluten-free for almost two years now and even experimented with an autoimmune protocol diet for more than 3 month. Neither that nor any supplements did bring about any change. A short trial with Prednisone (5mg daily) in order to see whether this may calm down inflammation had strong adverse effects. I ended up with panic attacks and hypoglycemia. Symptoms overview: I am mostly exercise intolerant. Even 20 minutes of easy walking triggers fatigue. It is as if someone pulled the plug on me and I could literally fall asleep at the side of the road. I used to do several hundreds of kilometers on my road bike. It feels like this fatigue isn't muscle, cardiovascular or respiratory related, it rather seems like my central nervous system would go haywire. Within the last 7 months I have at least been able to reintegrate some light strength workout into my daily routine again (push-ups, sit-ups and core exercises in moderate quantities). Also, I have been able to go for short strolls but I rarely feel well while doing it  my brain seems to get fogged and fatigue creeps in. Then there is this feeling of malaise, like having the flu but without a fever although the doctor I saw recently measured 37.9 degrees Celsius within my ear (slightly elevated temperature). This feeling is not here every day but comes and goes in waves. When it gets bad, the only thing I can do is to lay down and rest. Ive had several episodes of sudden hypoglycemia within the last 3 years. When measuring blood sugar levels, they then tend to be around 2mmol/l and the typical symptoms of shakiness, weakness, cold sweat, dizziness, extreme sugar craving, etc. appear. I cannot link them to anything, sometimes they seem to be reactive to meals, sometimes they happen late at night. Apart from that blood sugar levels seem normal. They have certainly never been elevated. I get spells of ocular migraines (without pain so just the aura) that usually last for 20-30 minutes. I don't know what triggers them (hormonal fluctuation as the usually happen first thing in the morning?) but I do have them about 2-3 times a month, sometimes a few in just a few days, sometimes just one and a few weeks pass until the next one. I get days where my vision gets blurred and my eyes are clotted with a yellowish substance in the morning. It does not seem to be related to the fit of my contact lenses I wear for my Keratoconus as these episodes usually pass after a couple of days. I am having mouth sores quite often (usually 2 or three at the same time) that are really big and hurting badly. They tend to stay for about 2 weeks. They also seem to come and go in waves (see pictures attached). I was able to establish a link to fluctuations of thyroid hormone levels. Usually my ulcers are a good indicator that levels are shifting. Furthermore, my tongue has a thick white coating and pimples, all of it mainly in the back half of the tongue. Also, my tongue always has teeth marks in it at the edges. My voice often seems to be ""covered"" with a slimy substance after meals that I have to cough off. I experience constant high-pitched ear ringing. Also I get spells of sudden hearing loss that recover after a few minutes (mostly just on one ear, but not always on the same ear) and dizziness that goes away after a few seconds or minutes. This also happens randomly. My sleep is disturbed (non refreshing, light with episodes of vivid and bizarre dreams) and I feel hung over and poisoned upon waking in the morning. I get muscle pain all over my body (mainly leg, back and neck, feels like the pain I had when I was growing as a kid or after an intense workout). My skin is extremely dry and I get rashes out of nowhere (Urticaria like itchy bumps, exclusively in my face but without being able to identify the triggers). My thinking is impaired as well as I am struggling with brain fog all the time. Feels like everything is far away and perceived through a thick fog. I am mostly constipated with severe bloating and gas and sudden episodes of diarrhea that cannot be linked to food triggers (except very specific ones like grilled Tuna who gives me cramping and diarrhea within 30 minutes). Overview of testing performed: 2015: I have been thoroughly checked for any heart diseases (ultrasound, normal- and stress-electrocardiogram) with no results. 2017 & 2018: I had gastrointestinal ultrasound and stool sampling with no conclusive results. Calprotectin, Alpha1-Antitrypsin and Eosinophilic Protein X were ones slightly elevated. Colonoscopy did not show any abnormalities. 2017: I have been diagnosed with leaky gut, candida overgrowth and SIBO by functional medical doctors and a gastroenterologist. 2015-18: Different Endocrinologists did extensive testing with no abnormalities apart from my thyroid (Hashimoto's) and testosterone deficiency compared to healthy males of my age. 2016 & 2017: Brain MRIs showed some abnormalities. The doctors saw several small, round, non-specific T2w/FLAIR-hyperintense white matter lesions (bi-frontal, subcortical mainly in Gyrus frontalis superior. With regards to differential diagnosis Microangiopathy seems unlikely, most likely these were caused by the ocular migraines I am experiencing. 2015-2018: Neurological examinations (the ordinary type of testing every doctor does when thoroughly examining a patient fort he first time) did not render any abnormalities either. 2018: I was extensively tested for infectious diseases. Everything came back negative (including Lyme, EBV, Bartonella, CMV, Tuberculosis, Rickettsia, Coxiella, etc.) except for Parvovirus B-19, which was IgG positive. Extensive stool testing for parasites (also rather exotic ones) was negative. CRP was tested on several occasion and always normal. Hence, acute infectious disease of any kind was excluded. I was also tested for Autoantibodies (ANA, ANCA) which all came back within the normal range as well. So are my Immuneglobulins IgG and IgE. 2015 & 2016: I even went to see psychologists and psychiatrists in order to rule out any possibly hidden stress-related conditions, although they have never made sense to me in the first place  again no results. 2017: I was put on different kinds of functional medicine treatments after different kinds of testing: e.g. IV-therapy, acupuncture and infrared-fever-therapy, the latter of which led to severe adverse reactions presenting as severe cramping, paralysis and paraesthesia which all resolved after heat was reduced. None of them improved my condition while some made me even worse. After 3 months of trying we put a halt to this. Conclusion: Apart from my diagnosed Hashimotos, there is nothing to put a finger on that could explain my current state of health. There are several pieces to the puzzle that in my opinion must all be somehow related. As a matter of fact, I have been incapacitated for more than 3 years now without really knowing whats going on. This goes beyond frustration. I know that all of these symptoms are real. They are not in my head. And it truly is time to get my life back. Or at least for me to know what I am battling against and to get a chance to eventually conquer it. So any ideas you might have, I am happy to hear. I have recently stumbled across mast cell activation, which could be a possible explanation. Any experience on that would thus be helpful as well. Thanks for reading this and helping me improve!

Colonoscopy did not show any abnormalities. 2017: I have been diagnosed with leaky gut, candida overgrowth and SIBO by functional medical doctors and a gastroenterologist. 2015-18: Different Endocrinologists did extensive testing with no abnormalities apart from my thyroid (Hashimoto's) and testosterone deficiency compared to healthy males of my age. 2016 & 2017: Brain MRIs showed some abnormalities. The doctors saw several small, round, non-specific T2w/FLAIR-hyperintense white matter lesions (bi-frontal, subcortical mainly in Gyrus frontalis superior. With regards to differential diagnosis Microangiopathy seems unlikely, most likely these were caused by the ocular migraines I am experiencing. 2015-2018: Neurological examinations (the ordinary type of testing every doctor does when thoroughly examining a patient fort he first time) did not render any abnormalities either. 2018: I was extensively tested for infectious diseases. Everything came back negative (including Lyme, EBV, Bartonella, CMV, Tuberculosis, Rickettsia, Coxiella, etc.) except for Parvovirus B-19, which was IgG positive. Extensive stool testing for parasites (also rather exotic ones) was negative. CRP was tested on several occasion and always normal. Hence, acute infectious disease of any kind was excluded. I was also tested for Autoantibodies (ANA, ANCA) which all came back within the normal range as well. So are my Immuneglobulins IgG and IgE. 2015 & 2016: I even went to see psychologists and psychiatrists in order to rule out any possibly hidden stress-related conditions, although they have never made sense to me in the first place  again no results. 2017: I was put on different kinds of functional medicine treatments after different kinds of testing: e.g. IV-therapy, acupuncture and infrared-fever-therapy, the latter of which led to severe adverse reactions presenting as severe cramping, paralysis and paraesthesia which all resolved after heat was reduced. None of them improved my condition while some made me even worse. After 3 months of trying we put a halt to this. Conclusion: Apart from my diagnosed Hashimotos, there is nothing to put a finger on that could explain my current state of health. There are several pieces to the puzzle that in my opinion must all be somehow related. As a matter of fact, I have been incapacitated for more than 3 years now without really knowing whats going on. This goes beyond frustration. I know that all of these symptoms are real. They are not in my head. And it truly is time to get my life back. Or at least for me to know what I am battling against and to get a chance to eventually conquer it. So any ideas you might have, I am happy to hear. I have recently stumbled across mast cell activation, which could be a possible explanation. Any experience on that would thus be helpful as well. Thanks for reading this and helping me improve!

Maybe someone has a clue as to what might be going on with me. It is always good to use the experience and expertise of people around the world when it comes to finding solutions for seemingly difficult cases (I can't get rid of the feeling that my case is not so difficult after all, we just haven't found the piece that is linking it all yet). Moderators, please feel free to move this topic into another subgroup if you think it isn't in the right place. So here we go: I am 30 years old, male, from Switzerland and considered myself healthy all my life. I was building a career, did lots of sports, travelled the world and we where ready to get married in 2017  when in June 2015 my symptoms showed up to stay. Id like to give you a short overview on how this illness developed over time, on my current symptoms and on what medical testing has been conducted so far. General course of development: At first things deteriorated gradually. Everything started in 2015 when I was recovering from a few days of having the flu and went back on my road bike, which went fine. A few days later, I had this sudden onset of fatigue. I woke up in the morning and thought that something is really wrong. I've already had episodes where I felt sick and very tired during the 12 months before June 2015 with symptoms similar to what I was about to experience later on. But these episodes usually subsided after a few days and at that time it was still possible to exercise as the tiredness would usually go away a few minutes into training. Everyday life was never really affected at that point. In June 2015, this changed dramatically. Endurance sports were not possible anymore but I was still able to play a little bit of tennis if I pushed through and to go for short walks. Working was still possible even though it needed a huge effort from my side. I was ultimately forced to completely stop working in May 2016 after gradually reducing my workload beforehand. So over the following months I slowly started developing all the other symptoms mentioned in more detail below: Ear ringing and sleep disturbances were the first to arrive apart from the extreme exhaustion. Brain fog showed up. My fatigue and malaise started getting worse and worse. I then developed all the muscle aches and pains. Episodes where I felt like having the flu with general malaise but without a fever started arriving more frequently. At first they came for a few days every month and then increased to several days a week where I felt like this. Then the digestive symptoms came along. It was as if my whole body had started to break down and more and more systems were getting involved. Medical testing that was done by my family practitioner during that time did not render any conclusive results. I was then diagnosed with Hashimoto's in 2016 by thyroid ultrasound (very small thyroid volume of 4ml total, hyper-perfused tissue, free T-values in the low normal range, no antibodies). I was started on synthetic T4 but thyroid medication did not bring any relieve. I experimented with hormone brands and types from T4-only, T4&T3 synthetics, T3-only and finally ended up on a combination of synthetics and NDT. Most symptoms are still persisting and did not even improve much. Thyroidectomy performed in October 2018 relieved local symptoms but the systemic ones have persisted so far. I tried different diet changes as well. I have been gluten-free for almost two years now and even experimented with an autoimmune protocol diet for more than 3 month. Neither that nor any supplements did bring about any change. A short trial with Prednisone (5mg daily) in order to see whether this may calm down inflammation had strong adverse effects. I ended up with panic attacks and hypoglycemia. Symptoms overview: I am mostly exercise intolerant. Even 20 minutes of easy walking triggers fatigue. It is as if someone pulled the plug on me and I could literally fall asleep at the side of the road. I used to do several hundreds of kilometers on my road bike. It feels like this fatigue isn't muscle, cardiovascular or respiratory related, it rather seems like my central nervous system would go haywire. Within the last 7 months I have at least been able to reintegrate some light strength workout into my daily routine again (push-ups, sit-ups and core exercises in moderate quantities). Also, I have been able to go for short strolls but I rarely feel well while doing it  my brain seems to get fogged and fatigue creeps in. Then there is this feeling of malaise, like having the flu but without a fever although the doctor I saw recently measured 37.9 degrees Celsius within my ear (slightly elevated temperature). This feeling is not here every day but comes and goes in waves. When it gets bad, the only thing I can do is to lay down and rest. Ive had several episodes of sudden hypoglycemia within the last 3 years. When measuring blood sugar levels, they then tend to be around 2mmol/l and the typical symptoms of shakiness, weakness, cold sweat, dizziness, extreme sugar craving, etc. appear. I cannot link them to anything, sometimes they seem to be reactive to meals, sometimes they happen late at night. Apart from that blood sugar levels seem normal. They have certainly never been elevated. I get spells of ocular migraines (without pain so just the aura) that usually last for 20-30 minutes. I don't know what triggers them (hormonal fluctuation as the usually happen first thing in the morning?) but I do have them about 2-3 times a month, sometimes a few in just a few days, sometimes just one and a few weeks pass until the next one. I get days where my vision gets blurred and my eyes are clotted with a yellowish substance in the morning. It does not seem to be related to the fit of my contact lenses I wear for my Keratoconus as these episodes usually pass after a couple of days. I am having mouth sores quite often (usually 2 or three at the same time) that are really big and hurting badly. They tend to stay for about 2 weeks. They also seem to come and go in waves (see pictures attached). I was able to establish a link to fluctuations of thyroid hormone levels. Usually my ulcers are a good indicator that levels are shifting. Furthermore, my tongue has a thick white coating and pimples, all of it mainly in the back half of the tongue. Also, my tongue always has teeth marks in it at the edges. My voice often seems to be ""covered"" with a slimy substance after meals that I have to cough off. I experience constant high-pitched ear ringing. Also I get spells of sudden hearing loss that recover after a few minutes (mostly just on one ear, but not always on the same ear) and dizziness that goes away after a few seconds or minutes. This also happens randomly. My sleep is disturbed (non refreshing, light with episodes of vivid and bizarre dreams) and I feel hung over and poisoned upon waking in the morning. I get muscle pain all over my body (mainly leg, back and neck, feels like the pain I had when I was growing as a kid or after an intense workout). My skin is extremely dry and I get rashes out of nowhere (Urticaria like itchy bumps, exclusively in my face but without being able to identify the triggers). My thinking is impaired as well as I am struggling with brain fog all the time. Feels like everything is far away and perceived through a thick fog. I am mostly constipated with severe bloating and gas and sudden episodes of diarrhea that cannot be linked to food triggers (except very specific ones like grilled Tuna who gives me cramping and diarrhea within 30 minutes). Overview of testing performed: 2015: I have been thoroughly checked for any heart diseases (ultrasound, normal- and stress-electrocardiogram) with no results. 2017 & 2018: I had gastrointestinal ultrasound and stool sampling with no conclusive results.

I cannot link them to anything, sometimes they seem to be reactive to meals, sometimes they happen late at night. Apart from that blood sugar levels seem normal. They have certainly never been elevated. I get spells of ocular migraines (without pain so just the aura) that usually last for 20-30 minutes. I don't know what triggers them (hormonal fluctuation as the usually happen first thing in the morning?) but I do have them about 2-3 times a month, sometimes a few in just a few days, sometimes just one and a few weeks pass until the next one. I get days where my vision gets blurred and my eyes are clotted with a yellowish substance in the morning. It does not seem to be related to the fit of my contact lenses I wear for my Keratoconus as these episodes usually pass after a couple of days. I am having mouth sores quite often (usually 2 or three at the same time) that are really big and hurting badly. They tend to stay for about 2 weeks. They also seem to come and go in waves (see pictures attached). I was able to establish a link to fluctuations of thyroid hormone levels. Usually my ulcers are a good indicator that levels are shifting. Furthermore, my tongue has a thick white coating and pimples, all of it mainly in the back half of the tongue. Also, my tongue always has teeth marks in it at the edges. My voice often seems to be ""covered"" with a slimy substance after meals that I have to cough off. I experience constant high-pitched ear ringing. Also I get spells of sudden hearing loss that recover after a few minutes (mostly just on one ear, but not always on the same ear) and dizziness that goes away after a few seconds or minutes. This also happens randomly. My sleep is disturbed (non refreshing, light with episodes of vivid and bizarre dreams) and I feel hung over and poisoned upon waking in the morning. I get muscle pain all over my body (mainly leg, back and neck, feels like the pain I had when I was growing as a kid or after an intense workout). My skin is extremely dry and I get rashes out of nowhere (Urticaria like itchy bumps, exclusively in my face but without being able to identify the triggers). My thinking is impaired as well as I am struggling with brain fog all the time. Feels like everything is far away and perceived through a thick fog. I am mostly constipated with severe bloating and gas and sudden episodes of diarrhea that cannot be linked to food triggers (except very specific ones like grilled Tuna who gives me cramping and diarrhea within 30 minutes). Overview of testing performed: 2015: I have been thoroughly checked for any heart diseases (ultrasound, normal- and stress-electrocardiogram) with no results. 2017 & 2018: I had gastrointestinal ultrasound and stool sampling with no conclusive results. Calprotectin, Alpha1-Antitrypsin and Eosinophilic Protein X were ones slightly elevated. Colonoscopy did not show any abnormalities. 2017: I have been diagnosed with leaky gut, candida overgrowth and SIBO by functional medical doctors and a gastroenterologist. 2015-18: Different Endocrinologists did extensive testing with no abnormalities apart from my thyroid (Hashimoto's) and testosterone deficiency compared to healthy males of my age. 2016 & 2017: Brain MRIs showed some abnormalities. The doctors saw several small, round, non-specific T2w/FLAIR-hyperintense white matter lesions (bi-frontal, subcortical mainly in Gyrus frontalis superior. With regards to differential diagnosis Microangiopathy seems unlikely, most likely these were caused by the ocular migraines I am experiencing. 2015-2018: Neurological examinations (the ordinary type of testing every doctor does when thoroughly examining a patient fort he first time) did not render any abnormalities either. 2018: I was extensively tested for infectious diseases. Everything came back negative (including Lyme, EBV, Bartonella, CMV, Tuberculosis, Rickettsia, Coxiella, etc.) except for Parvovirus B-19, which was IgG positive. Extensive stool testing for parasites (also rather exotic ones) was negative. CRP was tested on several occasion and always normal. Hence, acute infectious disease of any kind was excluded. I was also tested for Autoantibodies (ANA, ANCA) which all came back within the normal range as well. So are my Immuneglobulins IgG and IgE. 2015 & 2016: I even went to see psychologists and psychiatrists in order to rule out any possibly hidden stress-related conditions, although they have never made sense to me in the first place  again no results. 2017: I was put on different kinds of functional medicine treatments after different kinds of testing: e.g. IV-therapy, acupuncture and infrared-fever-therapy, the latter of which led to severe adverse reactions presenting as severe cramping, paralysis and paraesthesia which all resolved after heat was reduced. None of them improved my condition while some made me even worse. After 3 months of trying we put a halt to this. Conclusion: Apart from my diagnosed Hashimotos, there is nothing to put a finger on that could explain my current state of health. There are several pieces to the puzzle that in my opinion must all be somehow related. As a matter of fact, I have been incapacitated for more than 3 years now without really knowing whats going on. This goes beyond frustration. I know that all of these symptoms are real. They are not in my head. And it truly is time to get my life back. Or at least for me to know what I am battling against and to get a chance to eventually conquer it. So any ideas you might have, I am happy to hear. I have recently stumbled across mast cell activation, which could be a possible explanation. Any experience on that would thus be helpful as well. Thanks for reading this and helping me improve!

Maybe someone has a clue as to what might be going on with me. It is always good to use the experience and expertise of people around the world when it comes to finding solutions for seemingly difficult cases (I can't get rid of the feeling that my case is not so difficult after all, we just haven't found the piece that is linking it all yet). Moderators, please feel free to move this topic into another subgroup if you think it isn't in the right place. So here we go: I am 30 years old, male, from Switzerland and considered myself healthy all my life. I was building a career, did lots of sports, travelled the world and we where ready to get married in 2017  when in June 2015 my symptoms showed up to stay. Id like to give you a short overview on how this illness developed over time, on my current symptoms and on what medical testing has been conducted so far. General course of development: At first things deteriorated gradually. Everything started in 2015 when I was recovering from a few days of having the flu and went back on my road bike, which went fine. A few days later, I had this sudden onset of fatigue. I woke up in the morning and thought that something is really wrong. I've already had episodes where I felt sick and very tired during the 12 months before June 2015 with symptoms similar to what I was about to experience later on. But these episodes usually subsided after a few days and at that time it was still possible to exercise as the tiredness would usually go away a few minutes into training. Everyday life was never really affected at that point. In June 2015, this changed dramatically. Endurance sports were not possible anymore but I was still able to play a little bit of tennis if I pushed through and to go for short walks. Working was still possible even though it needed a huge effort from my side. I was ultimately forced to completely stop working in May 2016 after gradually reducing my workload beforehand. So over the following months I slowly started developing all the other symptoms mentioned in more detail below: Ear ringing and sleep disturbances were the first to arrive apart from the extreme exhaustion. Brain fog showed up. My fatigue and malaise started getting worse and worse. I then developed all the muscle aches and pains. Episodes where I felt like having the flu with general malaise but without a fever started arriving more frequently. At first they came for a few days every month and then increased to several days a week where I felt like this. Then the digestive symptoms came along. It was as if my whole body had started to break down and more and more systems were getting involved. Medical testing that was done by my family practitioner during that time did not render any conclusive results. I was then diagnosed with Hashimoto's in 2016 by thyroid ultrasound (very small thyroid volume of 4ml total, hyper-perfused tissue, free T-values in the low normal range, no antibodies). I was started on synthetic T4 but thyroid medication did not bring any relieve. I experimented with hormone brands and types from T4-only, T4&T3 synthetics, T3-only and finally ended up on a combination of synthetics and NDT. Most symptoms are still persisting and did not even improve much. Thyroidectomy performed in October 2018 relieved local symptoms but the systemic ones have persisted so far. I tried different diet changes as well. I have been gluten-free for almost two years now and even experimented with an autoimmune protocol diet for more than 3 month. Neither that nor any supplements did bring about any change. A short trial with Prednisone (5mg daily) in order to see whether this may calm down inflammation had strong adverse effects. I ended up with panic attacks and hypoglycemia. Symptoms overview: I am mostly exercise intolerant. Even 20 minutes of easy walking triggers fatigue. It is as if someone pulled the plug on me and I could literally fall asleep at the side of the road. I used to do several hundreds of kilometers on my road bike. It feels like this fatigue isn't muscle, cardiovascular or respiratory related, it rather seems like my central nervous system would go haywire. Within the last 7 months I have at least been able to reintegrate some light strength workout into my daily routine again (push-ups, sit-ups and core exercises in moderate quantities). Also, I have been able to go for short strolls but I rarely feel well while doing it  my brain seems to get fogged and fatigue creeps in. Then there is this feeling of malaise, like having the flu but without a fever although the doctor I saw recently measured 37.9 degrees Celsius within my ear (slightly elevated temperature). This feeling is not here every day but comes and goes in waves. When it gets bad, the only thing I can do is to lay down and rest.

Episodes where I felt like having the flu with general malaise but without a fever started arriving more frequently. At first they came for a few days every month and then increased to several days a week where I felt like this. Then the digestive symptoms came along. It was as if my whole body had started to break down and more and more systems were getting involved. Medical testing that was done by my family practitioner during that time did not render any conclusive results. I was then diagnosed with Hashimoto's in 2016 by thyroid ultrasound (very small thyroid volume of 4ml total, hyper-perfused tissue, free T-values in the low normal range, no antibodies). I was started on synthetic T4 but thyroid medication did not bring any relieve. I experimented with hormone brands and types from T4-only, T4&T3 synthetics, T3-only and finally ended up on a combination of synthetics and NDT. Most symptoms are still persisting and did not even improve much. Thyroidectomy performed in October 2018 relieved local symptoms but the systemic ones have persisted so far. I tried different diet changes as well. I have been gluten-free for almost two years now and even experimented with an autoimmune protocol diet for more than 3 month. Neither that nor any supplements did bring about any change. A short trial with Prednisone (5mg daily) in order to see whether this may calm down inflammation had strong adverse effects. I ended up with panic attacks and hypoglycemia. Symptoms overview: I am mostly exercise intolerant. Even 20 minutes of easy walking triggers fatigue. It is as if someone pulled the plug on me and I could literally fall asleep at the side of the road. I used to do several hundreds of kilometers on my road bike. It feels like this fatigue isn't muscle, cardiovascular or respiratory related, it rather seems like my central nervous system would go haywire. Within the last 7 months I have at least been able to reintegrate some light strength workout into my daily routine again (push-ups, sit-ups and core exercises in moderate quantities). Also, I have been able to go for short strolls but I rarely feel well while doing it  my brain seems to get fogged and fatigue creeps in. Then there is this feeling of malaise, like having the flu but without a fever although the doctor I saw recently measured 37.9 degrees Celsius within my ear (slightly elevated temperature). This feeling is not here every day but comes and goes in waves. When it gets bad, the only thing I can do is to lay down and rest. Ive had several episodes of sudden hypoglycemia within the last 3 years. When measuring blood sugar levels, they then tend to be around 2mmol/l and the typical symptoms of shakiness, weakness, cold sweat, dizziness, extreme sugar craving, etc. appear. I cannot link them to anything, sometimes they seem to be reactive to meals, sometimes they happen late at night. Apart from that blood sugar levels seem normal. They have certainly never been elevated. I get spells of ocular migraines (without pain so just the aura) that usually last for 20-30 minutes. I don't know what triggers them (hormonal fluctuation as the usually happen first thing in the morning?) but I do have them about 2-3 times a month, sometimes a few in just a few days, sometimes just one and a few weeks pass until the next one. I get days where my vision gets blurred and my eyes are clotted with a yellowish substance in the morning. It does not seem to be related to the fit of my contact lenses I wear for my Keratoconus as these episodes usually pass after a couple of days. I am having mouth sores quite often (usually 2 or three at the same time) that are really big and hurting badly. They tend to stay for about 2 weeks. They also seem to come and go in waves (see pictures attached). I was able to establish a link to fluctuations of thyroid hormone levels. Usually my ulcers are a good indicator that levels are shifting. Furthermore, my tongue has a thick white coating and pimples, all of it mainly in the back half of the tongue. Also, my tongue always has teeth marks in it at the edges. My voice often seems to be ""covered"" with a slimy substance after meals that I have to cough off. I experience constant high-pitched ear ringing. Also I get spells of sudden hearing loss that recover after a few minutes (mostly just on one ear, but not always on the same ear) and dizziness that goes away after a few seconds or minutes. This also happens randomly. My sleep is disturbed (non refreshing, light with episodes of vivid and bizarre dreams) and I feel hung over and poisoned upon waking in the morning. I get muscle pain all over my body (mainly leg, back and neck, feels like the pain I had when I was growing as a kid or after an intense workout). My skin is extremely dry and I get rashes out of nowhere (Urticaria like itchy bumps, exclusively in my face but without being able to identify the triggers). My thinking is impaired as well as I am struggling with brain fog all the time. Feels like everything is far away and perceived through a thick fog. I am mostly constipated with severe bloating and gas and sudden episodes of diarrhea that cannot be linked to food triggers (except very specific ones like grilled Tuna who gives me cramping and diarrhea within 30 minutes). Overview of testing performed: 2015: I have been thoroughly checked for any heart diseases (ultrasound, normal- and stress-electrocardiogram) with no results. 2017 & 2018: I had gastrointestinal ultrasound and stool sampling with no conclusive results. Calprotectin, Alpha1-Antitrypsin and Eosinophilic Protein X were ones slightly elevated. Colonoscopy did not show any abnormalities. 2017: I have been diagnosed with leaky gut, candida overgrowth and SIBO by functional medical doctors and a gastroenterologist. 2015-18: Different Endocrinologists did extensive testing with no abnormalities apart from my thyroid (Hashimoto's) and testosterone deficiency compared to healthy males of my age. 2016 & 2017: Brain MRIs showed some abnormalities. The doctors saw several small, round, non-specific T2w/FLAIR-hyperintense white matter lesions (bi-frontal, subcortical mainly in Gyrus frontalis superior. With regards to differential diagnosis Microangiopathy seems unlikely, most likely these were caused by the ocular migraines I am experiencing. 2015-2018: Neurological examinations (the ordinary type of testing every doctor does when thoroughly examining a patient fort he first time) did not render any abnormalities either. 2018: I was extensively tested for infectious diseases. Everything came back negative (including Lyme, EBV, Bartonella, CMV, Tuberculosis, Rickettsia, Coxiella, etc.) except for Parvovirus B-19, which was IgG positive. Extensive stool testing for parasites (also rather exotic ones) was negative. CRP was tested on several occasion and always normal. Hence, acute infectious disease of any kind was excluded. I was also tested for Autoantibodies (ANA, ANCA) which all came back within the normal range as well. So are my Immuneglobulins IgG and IgE. 2015 & 2016: I even went to see psychologists and psychiatrists in order to rule out any possibly hidden stress-related conditions, although they have never made sense to me in the first place  again no results. 2017: I was put on different kinds of functional medicine treatments after different kinds of testing: e.g. IV-therapy, acupuncture and infrared-fever-therapy, the latter of which led to severe adverse reactions presenting as severe cramping, paralysis and paraesthesia which all resolved after heat was reduced. None of them improved my condition while some made me even worse. After 3 months of trying we put a halt to this. Conclusion: Apart from my diagnosed Hashimotos, there is nothing to put a finger on that could explain my current state of health. There are several pieces to the puzzle that in my opinion must all be somehow related. As a matter of fact, I have been incapacitated for more than 3 years now without really knowing whats going on. This goes beyond frustration. I know that all of these symptoms are real. They are not in my head. And it truly is time to get my life back. Or at least for me to know what I am battling against and to get a chance to eventually conquer it. So any ideas you might have, I am happy to hear. I have recently stumbled across mast cell activation, which could be a possible explanation. Any experience on that would thus be helpful as well. Thanks for reading this and helping me improve!

Maybe someone has a clue as to what might be going on with me. It is always good to use the experience and expertise of people around the world when it comes to finding solutions for seemingly difficult cases (I can't get rid of the feeling that my case is not so difficult after all, we just haven't found the piece that is linking it all yet). Moderators, please feel free to move this topic into another subgroup if you think it isn't in the right place. So here we go: I am 30 years old, male, from Switzerland and considered myself healthy all my life. I was building a career, did lots of sports, travelled the world and we where ready to get married in 2017  when in June 2015 my symptoms showed up to stay. Id like to give you a short overview on how this illness developed over time, on my current symptoms and on what medical testing has been conducted so far. General course of development: At first things deteriorated gradually. Everything started in 2015 when I was recovering from a few days of having the flu and went back on my road bike, which went fine. A few days later, I had this sudden onset of fatigue. I woke up in the morning and thought that something is really wrong. I've already had episodes where I felt sick and very tired during the 12 months before June 2015 with symptoms similar to what I was about to experience later on. But these episodes usually subsided after a few days and at that time it was still possible to exercise as the tiredness would usually go away a few minutes into training. Everyday life was never really affected at that point. In June 2015, this changed dramatically. Endurance sports were not possible anymore but I was still able to play a little bit of tennis if I pushed through and to go for short walks. Working was still possible even though it needed a huge effort from my side. I was ultimately forced to completely stop working in May 2016 after gradually reducing my workload beforehand. So over the following months I slowly started developing all the other symptoms mentioned in more detail below: Ear ringing and sleep disturbances were the first to arrive apart from the extreme exhaustion. Brain fog showed up. My fatigue and malaise started getting worse and worse. I then developed all the muscle aches and pains.

Its been 10 years since I was first diagnosed with this and each year it seems as if it gets worse. Ive seen Dermatologist, Rheumatologist, Immunologist and now a Neurologist. No one has ever been able to figure out why my flare ups come and there is no way to know when it will happen. Ive had blood tests after blood tests done as well as biopsies but they only show my platelets extremely high and inflammation, which I already knew about. The worst flare ups came in 2014 and did some kind of damage to my nerves or at least thats what drs think. For the past 2 1/2 years I have lived with chronic pain in my legs. Ive had tests done on my arteries & veins as well as the nerves & MRIs but NOTHING ever shows up. Its frustrating because I know Im in pain but nobody can figure out where it came from or why its happening. When I do have a flare up its easy for people to see why Im hurting but they still cant know the intensity of the pain the knots cause. When Im not having a flare up I still deal with the pain in my legs and then I get how I look fine so how can I be hurting. Even some drs Ive seen can question my pain. Its so frustrating. Im tired of taking meds when theyre obviously not helping. Im just wondering if anyone else may have some of the same symptoms I do or have any suggestions.

I have been referred to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester in an attempt to get a diagnosis. Should hopefully have an appt. soon. I thought I would make this post in hopes that someone else might be suffering from something similar, or someone may have an idea. I have suffered from food allergies for several years and have to follow a strict diet. I also have been diagnosed with Drug Induced Lupus six years ago. I had been on Nexium for a couple years and began to experience severe joint and muscle pain with hair loss on my lower legs from the inflammation. My Anti-histone AB test was ultimately a 6.2 and anything over a 0 to 0.9 is positive. I discontinued the medicine and slowly my symptoms improved but found that certain meds like other acid reducers, anti-histamines, and antibiotics would flare my symptoms up. I would also commonly wake up in the morning with leg pain, but it would always go away as I got up and moved around. In April of this year I had to have my GB removed as it has stopped working (no stones). In May I was recovering and starting to feel well when I developed severe insomnia and then severe joint/muscle pain and cognitive impairment along with muscle weakness. I also lost more hair on my lower legs. It was suspected that I was having an autoimmune/allergic reaction to the titanium clips used during the surgery and on July 3 I went into surgery and the metal clips were removed and one polymer clip had to be used as my artery was leaking. The worst of the symptoms have went away, but I am still suffering from muscle pain in my feet/lower legs/thighs, pelvic floor/ arms/shoulders/ and hands. The upper body pain seems to come when my symptoms are the worst, always have the lower body pain. In June I did test positive for the Anti-histone AB at a 3.3. In August it was a 4.4 and it was a 3.7 a month ago. I also had a weak positive ANA in August with homogeneous pattern. Even though I am testing positive for Drug Induced Lupus my Dr. doesnt think this is Drug Induced Lupus as the symptoms should go away in 3 to 6 months, though I have read it can take a year or more. Since July the only meds I take are a Benadryl every 10 days when I get my allergy shots and Tylenol when needed for other pain. Other than that I am taking a Multi-vitamin, fish oil, probiotic, and Quercetin. If I discontinue the Quercetin my symptoms seem to worsen, it is a natural anti-inflammatory. Im starting to wonder if my surgery triggered an autoimmune disease or maybe I have a rare case of Drug Induced Lupus. Im not for sure what has triggered the strong positive Anti-Histone AB tests, i suspect it was the antibiotics used during the surgeries and I was also on Ciproflaxin a couple years ago for a prostate infection after vasectomy and I have read it can cause drug induced lupus.

I was initially diagnosed with Hashimotos in April of 2018, but the three medications Ive tried havent help and have developed additional symptoms and am feeling worse which has lead to my doctor thinking I have something else, but we havent gotten anywhere yet. Most of my issues started about three years ago after completing my first and only Spartan Race. Up until then I was an avid weightlifter and runner. I got very sick with what I thought was food poisoning for almost a week and then it morphed into a terrible cold, ear infection, vertigo, etc for a month. After that I just never fully recovered. I was always out of breath running and my body was continuously sore. Ive had basic blood tests, lupus, arthritis and urine tests and theyve all come back within range aside for my thyroid tests (Ive also worn a holter monitor and had a sleep study which both came back normal).Im frustrated that I have to wait months in between appointments with zero answers. Ive asked for a referral to Mayo which my doctor has agreed to write up but she said unless I have a specific diagnosis that I may not get in. Because of the long wait list for rheumatology I dont have an appointment until July, and my docto will not prescribe me any medications until I meet with them. My Mom's twin sister has lupus and started around my age and it took her years to get a diagnosis and Im afraid Im on the same path. Work is getting more and more difficult to manage. I am a risk manager in a large company and need to be able to think clearly when making decisions. I feel like I cant keep up as a friend or as a partner in my relationships and am worried when Im not even 30 yet.

I was initially diagnosed with Hashimotos in April of 2018, but the three medications Ive tried havent help and have developed additional symptoms and am feeling worse which has lead to my doctor thinking I have something else, but we havent gotten anywhere yet. Most of my issues started about three years ago after completing my first and only Spartan Race. Up until then I was an avid weightlifter and runner. I got very sick with what I thought was food poisoning for almost a week and then it morphed into a terrible cold, ear infection, vertigo, etc for a month. After that I just never fully recovered. I was always out of breath running and my body was continuously sore. Ive had basic blood tests, lupus, arthritis and urine tests and theyve all come back within range aside for my thyroid tests (Ive also worn a holter monitor and had a sleep study which both came back normal).Im frustrated that I have to wait months in between appointments with zero answers. Ive asked for a referral to Mayo which my doctor has agreed to write up but she said unless I have a specific diagnosis that I may not get in. Because of the long wait list for rheumatology I dont have an appointment until July, and my docto will not prescribe me any medications until I meet with them. My Mom's twin sister has lupus and started around my age and it took her years to get a diagnosis and Im afraid Im on the same path. Work is getting more and more difficult to manage. I am a risk manager in a large company and need to be able to think clearly when making decisions. I feel like I cant keep up as a friend or as a partner in my relationships and am worried when Im not even 30 yet.

I will attempt to keep my story and questions succinct: The part that is clear: I had an adverse reaction to acetaminophen (=Tylenol, paracetamol, APAP) which resulted in a few patches (5 macules, 2 cm or less) on my normal skin (leg, hands), but mostly characterized (and most worrisome) by blistering: first on the palm of my hand (6 target spots, 1-1.5 cm, 3 became blood blisters within 24 hrs), the thin skin on my penis including part of the glans, and eventually (the second time, a month later, which is how I now know what caused it) blisters and erosions on my hard palate, and sores on my lips that felt like severe burns. The blisters on my penis and hard palate were larger (2cm or more) fluid-filled sacs (not taut) that burst within 24 hrs and left very raw underlying tissue exposed. Earlier in the year/last winter, I had a few strange and unexplained health issues (three bouts of flu-like symptoms lasting 10 days each 1 month apart, Jan-Mar 2018); C-reactive protein was high; blood work and liver function were off/unusual, but not indicative of anything specific; infections came back neg (flu, mono, heps A-C, HIV, blood and urine cultures). Not sure if that is related or a precursor to what happened more recently (Nov and Dec 2018) which was clearly an adverse drug reaction within 24 hours. In Nov, I got in to see immunology specialist on day 5 and started treatment (20 mg prednisone start, step down after 2 days) which resolved completely within 2 weeks. In Dec, did not get in to see PC for 7 days (weekend, New Years), didnt start treatment for 10 days (50 mg prednisone, step down 10 mg each week for 5 weeks). Yes, in retrospect, I know I should have gone to the ER, but because my vitals were normal, and I didnt know what was going on or how bad it was going to get, I figured theyd just tell me to go see my PC or dermatology. I also kept hope that by stopping the offending drug, the symptoms would get better on their own  which they did not. Im now on week 3 of decreasing prednisone, and the symptoms have resolved for the most part, albeit more slowly this time. I have a follow up next week with dermatology and I want to be prepared. Preliminary diagnosis is lichen planus (GP after consulting with dermatology), but from what Ive learned, that does not seem like the best match. Other conditions which seem to be more of a match are erythema multiforme and/or Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Its hard because a lot of these conditions seem to have generalized symptoms that are 50-75% present with x but some patients have no sign of symptom x and none of these conditions seem to be characterized by 100% present with x. I dont want to get into a disagreement with my doctor  and I dont really know how important it is, given that the treatment seems to be the same no matter what its called. I also understand that they went to medical school and I did not; but I also understand that they see many patients every day, day after day, and have 15 min to maybe an hour to focus on my health condition, but I have/had hours, days and weeks to try and figure out what the heck is/was going on with me and my body.

Earlier in the year/last winter, I had a few strange and unexplained health issues (three bouts of flu-like symptoms lasting 10 days each 1 month apart, Jan-Mar 2018); C-reactive protein was high; blood work and liver function were off/unusual, but not indicative of anything specific; infections came back neg (flu, mono, heps A-C, HIV, blood and urine cultures). Not sure if that is related or a precursor to what happened more recently (Nov and Dec 2018) which was clearly an adverse drug reaction within 24 hours. In Nov, I got in to see immunology specialist on day 5 and started treatment (20 mg prednisone start, step down after 2 days) which resolved completely within 2 weeks. In Dec, did not get in to see PC for 7 days (weekend, New Years), didnt start treatment for 10 days (50 mg prednisone, step down 10 mg each week for 5 weeks). Yes, in retrospect, I know I should have gone to the ER, but because my vitals were normal, and I didnt know what was going on or how bad it was going to get, I figured theyd just tell me to go see my PC or dermatology. I also kept hope that by stopping the offending drug, the symptoms would get better on their own  which they did not. Im now on week 3 of decreasing prednisone, and the symptoms have resolved for the most part, albeit more slowly this time. I have a follow up next week with dermatology and I want to be prepared. Preliminary diagnosis is lichen planus (GP after consulting with dermatology), but from what Ive learned, that does not seem like the best match. Other conditions which seem to be more of a match are erythema multiforme and/or Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Its hard because a lot of these conditions seem to have generalized symptoms that are 50-75% present with x but some patients have no sign of symptom x and none of these conditions seem to be characterized by 100% present with x. I dont want to get into a disagreement with my doctor  and I dont really know how important it is, given that the treatment seems to be the same no matter what its called. I also understand that they went to medical school and I did not; but I also understand that they see many patients every day, day after day, and have 15 min to maybe an hour to focus on my health condition, but I have/had hours, days and weeks to try and figure out what the heck is/was going on with me and my body. I can discuss my concern about my personal health (liver function, scarring, increased risk of cancer due to reaction) with my doctor, but what Im trying to wrap my head around here is how important is the label? And do adverse drug reactions (ADR), severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), etc, get coupled with a second diagnosis of lichen plans, erythema multiforme, SJS, depending on how the reaction manifests through the skin (and/or internal organs)?

My background is really long and I am now in a place where my efforts are threateningly short, but I wont give up on myself that easily. I know an answer is out there & Im here on the hope that someone, ANYONE can help me.Quick side-note: I first developed oral ulcers in late elementary school (around 4th grade), which slowly became progressive. While confiding in a co-worker in college about the painful severity of these lesions, she told me she had experienced the same issues & was diagnosed with Celiac disease. I visited my childhood allergist (I have had seasonal allergies since I was eight) who is also informed in food allergies wherein he tested me for a wheat ALLERGY (not a celiac panel  I am now aware of the differences now but was naive then) & said I wasnt allergic, but to try eating gluten free. I did & my ulcers improved drastically only to come back about a year later. I am currently a 25 year old female, but this all began & escalated in the summer of 2016 when I was just 23. I started experiencing changes in bowel habits & abdominal issues concerning pain, bloating, etc. I saw my first GI doctor in September & he placed me on 20mg of Omeprazole daily after concurring a diagnosis of GERD. I returned in February for a follow-up as my original symptoms failed to dissapate & after the development of new ones. In March of 2017 I had an upper GI endoscopy, which supported the diagnosis of GERD & gastritis. I know he only sent six biopsies out for Celiac disease (which I wasnt in favor of as Id been 100% gluten free for nearly three years at that point). He speculated I might have SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) and started me on a 2 week course of antibiotics Xifaxan specific for this condition. Diarrhea did not improve & my doctor introduced a drug called Questran (drink powder) to see if this would halt symptoms. This also failed. The next speculation was that my gallbladder or liver may be malfunctioning as fatty foods really, really escalate my abdominal issues. When I say fatty this term is inclusive of all fats  healthy or not, avocado or milkshake  all would have the same negative effect on my GI system & cause immediate diarrhea. Without testing for any specific conditions/diseases, my doctor places me on Creon, which helped somewhat (in the event Id eat fats, which was rare) but nowhere near enough to say it was the be all, end all. By this point I was now seeing blood in my stool  bright red occasionally, typically dark/tar appearing stools, which stick to the sides of the bowl. Or stool with red and black spots throughout. I called my GI doctor & he immediately scheduled me for a colonoscopy, which I had about two weeks later in May of 2017. In this time, I had talked with a family friend & she told me her son who is around my age was recently diagnosed with Crohns Disease & that my symptoms sounded identical to his. I mentioned this to my GI doctor & he agreed after I asked my biopsies be tested for Crohns & specifically that it be taken from the terminal ileum. Well, after waking up from the procedure my doctor said my colon did not look inflamed but that I had internal & external hemorrhoids. A few days later I received a call from the GI office that my biopsies were negative for colitis & microscopic colitis. The only response I could form was, what? Reading my report it stated I had two biopsies from my colon that were tested for colitis. Following this, I did have a pillcamera test & the results were normal but that I had a slow transit. My GI doctors answer was basically that I have IBS & sent me to a motility center at a neighboring hospital. I gave it a chance & went. Long story made short, it was a load of BS. Those with IBS dont bleed and I dont have time or energy to wait around anymore. I found a new GI doctor as I cant stand this run around without answers anymore. In the meantime, my primary doctor suggested I see a rheumatologist. I went & saw one of the worlds leading rheumatologists & he did a full genetic blood-typing on me. The results came back that I have two mutations on the NOD-2/CARD15 gene. I see a new rheumatologist now who did another test which found I also have a positive HLA-B27 gene. She diagnosed me with Anyklosing Spondylitis & said I may develop crohns Disease one day & if I did, would have a severe case as those genes are linked with such disease outcomes. My treatment is to take Celebrex daily & thats all. It helps my joint pain, but not my GI issues, which are my most debilitating crutch. To hopefully clear the air of confusion, as Im sure Ive created some, I will list my symptoms here:-GI: frequent diarrhea, blood in stool, weight loss & inability to gain/maintain weight, severe bloating/abdominal distention, pain/pinching feeling on right abdomen.-frequent, recurrent & severely painful oral ulcers lasting about 10-15 days. Swabbed & tested for Herpes Simplex 1 negative. Non-cancerous in origin.-heart palpitations: full cardiology workup: EKG, ECHO, stress test found no answers.-joint pain, diagnosis of Ankylosing Spondylitis supports arthritis of a rheumatologic condition.-sudden changes in eyesight causes need for glasses. Diagnosis of dry eye.-Kidney Stone in the left kidney as evidenced as calcification on X-ray report.-Believed benign tumor in the midpole of right kidney as evidenced in sonogram report. Further investigation is currently underway.-Anemia was discovered at one time in bloodwork.-Brain fog-Memory loss, mostly short-term.-Severe fatigue that leaves me unable to participate in my daily life the way I once did & would like to.-Frequent urination-Frequent thirst Again, I apologize for the length of this post. Even moreso, I am incredibly grateful to those who read & can offer a response on my behalf. I would give up almost anything to be half of the person I used to be before all of this happened. If there is anyone out there with any sort of genetic background (both professional & personal experiences are welcomed) please lend any expertise you may have. In my own research as Ive become my own advocate, I found a relationship between NOD-2 mutations & Crohns Disease. I feel as though genetics may really be of my benefit here. As I type this, I thank you again. I am currently reeling from a sleepless night thanks to diarrhea & severe heart palpitations, both of which hindered & woke me from my sleep. I now have a huge ulcer under & on the side of my tongue that is leaving me unable to even swallow my own spit, much less talk or eat. If I feel it is important, I will add anything I may have forgotten or feel is necessary as new things arise. Liked by Kanaaz Pereira, Connect Moderator Follow Report"

My background is really long and I am now in a place where my efforts are threateningly short, but I wont give up on myself that easily. I know an answer is out there & Im here on the hope that someone, ANYONE can help me.Quick side-note: I first developed oral ulcers in late elementary school (around 4th grade), which slowly became progressive. While confiding in a co-worker in college about the painful severity of these lesions, she told me she had experienced the same issues & was diagnosed with Celiac disease. I visited my childhood allergist (I have had seasonal allergies since I was eight) who is also informed in food allergies wherein he tested me for a wheat ALLERGY (not a celiac panel  I am now aware of the differences now but was naive then) & said I wasnt allergic, but to try eating gluten free. I did & my ulcers improved drastically only to come back about a year later. I am currently a 25 year old female, but this all began & escalated in the summer of 2016 when I was just 23. I started experiencing changes in bowel habits & abdominal issues concerning pain, bloating, etc. I saw my first GI doctor in September & he placed me on 20mg of Omeprazole daily after concurring a diagnosis of GERD. I returned in February for a follow-up as my original symptoms failed to dissapate & after the development of new ones. In March of 2017 I had an upper GI endoscopy, which supported the diagnosis of GERD & gastritis. I know he only sent six biopsies out for Celiac disease (which I wasnt in favor of as Id been 100% gluten free for nearly three years at that point). He speculated I might have SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) and started me on a 2 week course of antibiotics Xifaxan specific for this condition. Diarrhea did not improve & my doctor introduced a drug called Questran (drink powder) to see if this would halt symptoms. This also failed. The next speculation was that my gallbladder or liver may be malfunctioning as fatty foods really, really escalate my abdominal issues. When I say fatty this term is inclusive of all fats  healthy or not, avocado or milkshake  all would have the same negative effect on my GI system & cause immediate diarrhea. Without testing for any specific conditions/diseases, my doctor places me on Creon, which helped somewhat (in the event Id eat fats, which was rare) but nowhere near enough to say it was the be all, end all. By this point I was now seeing blood in my stool  bright red occasionally, typically dark/tar appearing stools, which stick to the sides of the bowl. Or stool with red and black spots throughout. I called my GI doctor & he immediately scheduled me for a colonoscopy, which I had about two weeks later in May of 2017. In this time, I had talked with a family friend & she told me her son who is around my age was recently diagnosed with Crohns Disease & that my symptoms sounded identical to his. I mentioned this to my GI doctor & he agreed after I asked my biopsies be tested for Crohns & specifically that it be taken from the terminal ileum. Well, after waking up from the procedure my doctor said my colon did not look inflamed but that I had internal & external hemorrhoids. A few days later I received a call from the GI office that my biopsies were negative for colitis & microscopic colitis. The only response I could form was, what? Reading my report it stated I had two biopsies from my colon that were tested for colitis. Following this, I did have a pillcamera test & the results were normal but that I had a slow transit. My GI doctors answer was basically that I have IBS & sent me to a motility center at a neighboring hospital. I gave it a chance & went. Long story made short, it was a load of BS. Those with IBS dont bleed and I dont have time or energy to wait around anymore. I found a new GI doctor as I cant stand this run around without answers anymore.

While confiding in a co-worker in college about the painful severity of these lesions, she told me she had experienced the same issues & was diagnosed with Celiac disease. I visited my childhood allergist (I have had seasonal allergies since I was eight) who is also informed in food allergies wherein he tested me for a wheat ALLERGY (not a celiac panel  I am now aware of the differences now but was naive then) & said I wasnt allergic, but to try eating gluten free. I did & my ulcers improved drastically only to come back about a year later. I am currently a 25 year old female, but this all began & escalated in the summer of 2016 when I was just 23. I started experiencing changes in bowel habits & abdominal issues concerning pain, bloating, etc. I saw my first GI doctor in September & he placed me on 20mg of Omeprazole daily after concurring a diagnosis of GERD. I returned in February for a follow-up as my original symptoms failed to dissapate & after the development of new ones. In March of 2017 I had an upper GI endoscopy, which supported the diagnosis of GERD & gastritis. I know he only sent six biopsies out for Celiac disease (which I wasnt in favor of as Id been 100% gluten free for nearly three years at that point). He speculated I might have SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) and started me on a 2 week course of antibiotics Xifaxan specific for this condition. Diarrhea did not improve & my doctor introduced a drug called Questran (drink powder) to see if this would halt symptoms. This also failed. The next speculation was that my gallbladder or liver may be malfunctioning as fatty foods really, really escalate my abdominal issues. When I say fatty this term is inclusive of all fats  healthy or not, avocado or milkshake  all would have the same negative effect on my GI system & cause immediate diarrhea. Without testing for any specific conditions/diseases, my doctor places me on Creon, which helped somewhat (in the event Id eat fats, which was rare) but nowhere near enough to say it was the be all, end all. By this point I was now seeing blood in my stool  bright red occasionally, typically dark/tar appearing stools, which stick to the sides of the bowl. Or stool with red and black spots throughout. I called my GI doctor & he immediately scheduled me for a colonoscopy, which I had about two weeks later in May of 2017. In this time, I had talked with a family friend & she told me her son who is around my age was recently diagnosed with Crohns Disease & that my symptoms sounded identical to his. I mentioned this to my GI doctor & he agreed after I asked my biopsies be tested for Crohns & specifically that it be taken from the terminal ileum. Well, after waking up from the procedure my doctor said my colon did not look inflamed but that I had internal & external hemorrhoids. A few days later I received a call from the GI office that my biopsies were negative for colitis & microscopic colitis. The only response I could form was, what? Reading my report it stated I had two biopsies from my colon that were tested for colitis. Following this, I did have a pillcamera test & the results were normal but that I had a slow transit. My GI doctors answer was basically that I have IBS & sent me to a motility center at a neighboring hospital. I gave it a chance & went. Long story made short, it was a load of BS. Those with IBS dont bleed and I dont have time or energy to wait around anymore. I found a new GI doctor as I cant stand this run around without answers anymore. In the meantime, my primary doctor suggested I see a rheumatologist. I went & saw one of the worlds leading rheumatologists & he did a full genetic blood-typing on me. The results came back that I have two mutations on the NOD-2/CARD15 gene. I see a new rheumatologist now who did another test which found I also have a positive HLA-B27 gene. She diagnosed me with Anyklosing Spondylitis & said I may develop crohns Disease one day & if I did, would have a severe case as those genes are linked with such disease outcomes. My treatment is to take Celebrex daily & thats all. It helps my joint pain, but not my GI issues, which are my most debilitating crutch. To hopefully clear the air of confusion, as Im sure Ive created some, I will list my symptoms here:-GI: frequent diarrhea, blood in stool, weight loss & inability to gain/maintain weight, severe bloating/abdominal distention, pain/pinching feeling on right abdomen.-frequent, recurrent & severely painful oral ulcers lasting about 10-15 days. Swabbed & tested for Herpes Simplex 1 negative. Non-cancerous in origin.-heart palpitations: full cardiology workup: EKG, ECHO, stress test found no answers.-joint pain, diagnosis of Ankylosing Spondylitis supports arthritis of a rheumatologic condition.-sudden changes in eyesight causes need for glasses. Diagnosis of dry eye.-Kidney Stone in the left kidney as evidenced as calcification on X-ray report.-Believed benign tumor in the midpole of right kidney as evidenced in sonogram report. Further investigation is currently underway.-Anemia was discovered at one time in bloodwork.-Brain fog-Memory loss, mostly short-term.-Severe fatigue that leaves me unable to participate in my daily life the way I once did & would like to.-Frequent urination-Frequent thirst Again, I apologize for the length of this post. Even moreso, I am incredibly grateful to those who read & can offer a response on my behalf. I would give up almost anything to be half of the person I used to be before all of this happened. If there is anyone out there with any sort of genetic background (both professional & personal experiences are welcomed) please lend any expertise you may have. In my own research as Ive become my own advocate, I found a relationship between NOD-2 mutations & Crohns Disease. I feel as though genetics may really be of my benefit here. As I type this, I thank you again. I am currently reeling from a sleepless night thanks to diarrhea & severe heart palpitations, both of which hindered & woke me from my sleep. I now have a huge ulcer under & on the side of my tongue that is leaving me unable to even swallow my own spit, much less talk or eat. If I feel it is important, I will add anything I may have forgotten or feel is necessary as new things arise. Liked by Kanaaz Pereira, Connect Moderator Follow Report"

She diagnosed me with Anyklosing Spondylitis & said I may develop crohns Disease one day & if I did, would have a severe case as those genes are linked with such disease outcomes. My treatment is to take Celebrex daily & thats all. It helps my joint pain, but not my GI issues, which are my most debilitating crutch. To hopefully clear the air of confusion, as Im sure Ive created some, I will list my symptoms here:-GI: frequent diarrhea, blood in stool, weight loss & inability to gain/maintain weight, severe bloating/abdominal distention, pain/pinching feeling on right abdomen.-frequent, recurrent & severely painful oral ulcers lasting about 10-15 days. Swabbed & tested for Herpes Simplex 1 negative. Non-cancerous in origin.-heart palpitations: full cardiology workup: EKG, ECHO, stress test found no answers.-joint pain, diagnosis of Ankylosing Spondylitis supports arthritis of a rheumatologic condition.-sudden changes in eyesight causes need for glasses. Diagnosis of dry eye.-Kidney Stone in the left kidney as evidenced as calcification on X-ray report.-Believed benign tumor in the midpole of right kidney as evidenced in sonogram report. Further investigation is currently underway.-Anemia was discovered at one time in bloodwork.-Brain fog-Memory loss, mostly short-term.-Severe fatigue that leaves me unable to participate in my daily life the way I once did & would like to.-Frequent urination-Frequent thirst Again, I apologize for the length of this post. Even moreso, I am incredibly grateful to those who read & can offer a response on my behalf. I would give up almost anything to be half of the person I used to be before all of this happened. If there is anyone out there with any sort of genetic background (both professional & personal experiences are welcomed) please lend any expertise you may have. In my own research as Ive become my own advocate, I found a relationship between NOD-2 mutations & Crohns Disease. I feel as though genetics may really be of my benefit here. As I type this, I thank you again. I am currently reeling from a sleepless night thanks to diarrhea & severe heart palpitations, both of which hindered & woke me from my sleep. I now have a huge ulcer under & on the side of my tongue that is leaving me unable to even swallow my own spit, much less talk or eat.

My background is really long and I am now in a place where my efforts are threateningly short, but I wont give up on myself that easily. I know an answer is out there & Im here on the hope that someone, ANYONE can help me.Quick side-note: I first developed oral ulcers in late elementary school (around 4th grade), which slowly became progressive. While confiding in a co-worker in college about the painful severity of these lesions, she told me she had experienced the same issues & was diagnosed with Celiac disease. I visited my childhood allergist (I have had seasonal allergies since I was eight) who is also informed in food allergies wherein he tested me for a wheat ALLERGY (not a celiac panel  I am now aware of the differences now but was naive then) & said I wasnt allergic, but to try eating gluten free. I did & my ulcers improved drastically only to come back about a year later. I am currently a 25 year old female, but this all began & escalated in the summer of 2016 when I was just 23. I started experiencing changes in bowel habits & abdominal issues concerning pain, bloating, etc. I saw my first GI doctor in September & he placed me on 20mg of Omeprazole daily after concurring a diagnosis of GERD. I returned in February for a follow-up as my original symptoms failed to dissapate & after the development of new ones. In March of 2017 I had an upper GI endoscopy, which supported the diagnosis of GERD & gastritis. I know he only sent six biopsies out for Celiac disease (which I wasnt in favor of as Id been 100% gluten free for nearly three years at that point). He speculated I might have SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) and started me on a 2 week course of antibiotics Xifaxan specific for this condition. Diarrhea did not improve & my doctor introduced a drug called Questran (drink powder) to see if this would halt symptoms. This also failed. The next speculation was that my gallbladder or liver may be malfunctioning as fatty foods really, really escalate my abdominal issues. When I say fatty this term is inclusive of all fats  healthy or not, avocado or milkshake  all would have the same negative effect on my GI system & cause immediate diarrhea. Without testing for any specific conditions/diseases, my doctor places me on Creon, which helped somewhat (in the event Id eat fats, which was rare) but nowhere near enough to say it was the be all, end all. By this point I was now seeing blood in my stool  bright red occasionally, typically dark/tar appearing stools, which stick to the sides of the bowl. Or stool with red and black spots throughout. I called my GI doctor & he immediately scheduled me for a colonoscopy, which I had about two weeks later in May of 2017. In this time, I had talked with a family friend & she told me her son who is around my age was recently diagnosed with Crohns Disease & that my symptoms sounded identical to his. I mentioned this to my GI doctor & he agreed after I asked my biopsies be tested for Crohns & specifically that it be taken from the terminal ileum. Well, after waking up from the procedure my doctor said my colon did not look inflamed but that I had internal & external hemorrhoids. A few days later I received a call from the GI office that my biopsies were negative for colitis & microscopic colitis. The only response I could form was, what? Reading my report it stated I had two biopsies from my colon that were tested for colitis. Following this, I did have a pillcamera test & the results were normal but that I had a slow transit. My GI doctors answer was basically that I have IBS & sent me to a motility center at a neighboring hospital. I gave it a chance & went. Long story made short, it was a load of BS. Those with IBS dont bleed and I dont have time or energy to wait around anymore. I found a new GI doctor as I cant stand this run around without answers anymore.

While confiding in a co-worker in college about the painful severity of these lesions, she told me she had experienced the same issues & was diagnosed with Celiac disease. I visited my childhood allergist (I have had seasonal allergies since I was eight) who is also informed in food allergies wherein he tested me for a wheat ALLERGY (not a celiac panel  I am now aware of the differences now but was naive then) & said I wasnt allergic, but to try eating gluten free. I did & my ulcers improved drastically only to come back about a year later. I am currently a 25 year old female, but this all began & escalated in the summer of 2016 when I was just 23. I started experiencing changes in bowel habits & abdominal issues concerning pain, bloating, etc. I saw my first GI doctor in September & he placed me on 20mg of Omeprazole daily after concurring a diagnosis of GERD. I returned in February for a follow-up as my original symptoms failed to dissapate & after the development of new ones. In March of 2017 I had an upper GI endoscopy, which supported the diagnosis of GERD & gastritis. I know he only sent six biopsies out for Celiac disease (which I wasnt in favor of as Id been 100% gluten free for nearly three years at that point). He speculated I might have SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) and started me on a 2 week course of antibiotics Xifaxan specific for this condition. Diarrhea did not improve & my doctor introduced a drug called Questran (drink powder) to see if this would halt symptoms. This also failed. The next speculation was that my gallbladder or liver may be malfunctioning as fatty foods really, really escalate my abdominal issues. When I say fatty this term is inclusive of all fats  healthy or not, avocado or milkshake  all would have the same negative effect on my GI system & cause immediate diarrhea. Without testing for any specific conditions/diseases, my doctor places me on Creon, which helped somewhat (in the event Id eat fats, which was rare) but nowhere near enough to say it was the be all, end all. By this point I was now seeing blood in my stool  bright red occasionally, typically dark/tar appearing stools, which stick to the sides of the bowl. Or stool with red and black spots throughout. I called my GI doctor & he immediately scheduled me for a colonoscopy, which I had about two weeks later in May of 2017. In this time, I had talked with a family friend & she told me her son who is around my age was recently diagnosed with Crohns Disease & that my symptoms sounded identical to his. I mentioned this to my GI doctor & he agreed after I asked my biopsies be tested for Crohns & specifically that it be taken from the terminal ileum. Well, after waking up from the procedure my doctor said my colon did not look inflamed but that I had internal & external hemorrhoids. A few days later I received a call from the GI office that my biopsies were negative for colitis & microscopic colitis. The only response I could form was, what? Reading my report it stated I had two biopsies from my colon that were tested for colitis. Following this, I did have a pillcamera test & the results were normal but that I had a slow transit. My GI doctors answer was basically that I have IBS & sent me to a motility center at a neighboring hospital. I gave it a chance & went. Long story made short, it was a load of BS. Those with IBS dont bleed and I dont have time or energy to wait around anymore. I found a new GI doctor as I cant stand this run around without answers anymore. In the meantime, my primary doctor suggested I see a rheumatologist. I went & saw one of the worlds leading rheumatologists & he did a full genetic blood-typing on me. The results came back that I have two mutations on the NOD-2/CARD15 gene. I see a new rheumatologist now who did another test which found I also have a positive HLA-B27 gene. She diagnosed me with Anyklosing Spondylitis & said I may develop crohns Disease one day & if I did, would have a severe case as those genes are linked with such disease outcomes. My treatment is to take Celebrex daily & thats all. It helps my joint pain, but not my GI issues, which are my most debilitating crutch. To hopefully clear the air of confusion, as Im sure Ive created some, I will list my symptoms here:-GI: frequent diarrhea, blood in stool, weight loss & inability to gain/maintain weight, severe bloating/abdominal distention, pain/pinching feeling on right abdomen.-frequent, recurrent & severely painful oral ulcers lasting about 10-15 days. Swabbed & tested for Herpes Simplex 1 negative. Non-cancerous in origin.-heart palpitations: full cardiology workup: EKG, ECHO, stress test found no answers.-joint pain, diagnosis of Ankylosing Spondylitis supports arthritis of a rheumatologic condition.-sudden changes in eyesight causes need for glasses. Diagnosis of dry eye.-Kidney Stone in the left kidney as evidenced as calcification on X-ray report.-Believed benign tumor in the midpole of right kidney as evidenced in sonogram report. Further investigation is currently underway.-Anemia was discovered at one time in bloodwork.-Brain fog-Memory loss, mostly short-term.-Severe fatigue that leaves me unable to participate in my daily life the way I once did & would like to.-Frequent urination-Frequent thirst Again, I apologize for the length of this post. Even moreso, I am incredibly grateful to those who read & can offer a response on my behalf. I would give up almost anything to be half of the person I used to be before all of this happened. If there is anyone out there with any sort of genetic background (both professional & personal experiences are welcomed) please lend any expertise you may have. In my own research as Ive become my own advocate, I found a relationship between NOD-2 mutations & Crohns Disease. I feel as though genetics may really be of my benefit here. As I type this, I thank you again. I am currently reeling from a sleepless night thanks to diarrhea & severe heart palpitations, both of which hindered & woke me from my sleep. I now have a huge ulcer under & on the side of my tongue that is leaving me unable to even swallow my own spit, much less talk or eat. If I feel it is important, I will add anything I may have forgotten or feel is necessary as new things arise. Liked by Kanaaz Pereira, Connect Moderator Follow Report"

The results came back that I have two mutations on the NOD-2/CARD15 gene. I see a new rheumatologist now who did another test which found I also have a positive HLA-B27 gene. She diagnosed me with Anyklosing Spondylitis & said I may develop crohns Disease one day & if I did, would have a severe case as those genes are linked with such disease outcomes. My treatment is to take Celebrex daily & thats all. It helps my joint pain, but not my GI issues, which are my most debilitating crutch. To hopefully clear the air of confusion, as Im sure Ive created some, I will list my symptoms here:-GI: frequent diarrhea, blood in stool, weight loss & inability to gain/maintain weight, severe bloating/abdominal distention, pain/pinching feeling on right abdomen.-frequent, recurrent & severely painful oral ulcers lasting about 10-15 days. Swabbed & tested for Herpes Simplex 1 negative. Non-cancerous in origin.-heart palpitations: full cardiology workup: EKG, ECHO, stress test found no answers.-joint pain, diagnosis of Ankylosing Spondylitis supports arthritis of a rheumatologic condition.-sudden changes in eyesight causes need for glasses. Diagnosis of dry eye.-Kidney Stone in the left kidney as evidenced as calcification on X-ray report.-Believed benign tumor in the midpole of right kidney as evidenced in sonogram report. Further investigation is currently underway.-Anemia was discovered at one time in bloodwork.-Brain fog-Memory loss, mostly short-term.-Severe fatigue that leaves me unable to participate in my daily life the way I once did & would like to.-Frequent urination-Frequent thirst Again, I apologize for the length of this post. Even moreso, I am incredibly grateful to those who read & can offer a response on my behalf. I would give up almost anything to be half of the person I used to be before all of this happened. If there is anyone out there with any sort of genetic background (both professional & personal experiences are welcomed) please lend any expertise you may have. In my own research as Ive become my own advocate, I found a relationship between NOD-2 mutations & Crohns Disease. I feel as though genetics may really be of my benefit here. As I type this, I thank you again. I am currently reeling from a sleepless night thanks to diarrhea & severe heart palpitations, both of which hindered & woke me from my sleep. I now have a huge ulcer under & on the side of my tongue that is leaving me unable to even swallow my own spit, much less talk or eat.

My background is really long and I am now in a place where my efforts are threateningly short, but I wont give up on myself that easily. I know an answer is out there & Im here on the hope that someone, ANYONE can help me.Quick side-note: I first developed oral ulcers in late elementary school (around 4th grade), which slowly became progressive. While confiding in a co-worker in college about the painful severity of these lesions, she told me she had experienced the same issues & was diagnosed with Celiac disease. I visited my childhood allergist (I have had seasonal allergies since I was eight) who is also informed in food allergies wherein he tested me for a wheat ALLERGY (not a celiac panel  I am now aware of the differences now but was naive then) & said I wasnt allergic, but to try eating gluten free. I did & my ulcers improved drastically only to come back about a year later. I am currently a 25 year old female, but this all began & escalated in the summer of 2016 when I was just 23. I started experiencing changes in bowel habits & abdominal issues concerning pain, bloating, etc. I saw my first GI doctor in September & he placed me on 20mg of Omeprazole daily after concurring a diagnosis of GERD. I returned in February for a follow-up as my original symptoms failed to dissapate & after the development of new ones. In March of 2017 I had an upper GI endoscopy, which supported the diagnosis of GERD & gastritis. I know he only sent six biopsies out for Celiac disease (which I wasnt in favor of as Id been 100% gluten free for nearly three years at that point). He speculated I might have SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) and started me on a 2 week course of antibiotics Xifaxan specific for this condition. Diarrhea did not improve & my doctor introduced a drug called Questran (drink powder) to see if this would halt symptoms. This also failed. The next speculation was that my gallbladder or liver may be malfunctioning as fatty foods really, really escalate my abdominal issues. When I say fatty this term is inclusive of all fats  healthy or not, avocado or milkshake  all would have the same negative effect on my GI system & cause immediate diarrhea. Without testing for any specific conditions/diseases, my doctor places me on Creon, which helped somewhat (in the event Id eat fats, which was rare) but nowhere near enough to say it was the be all, end all. By this point I was now seeing blood in my stool  bright red occasionally, typically dark/tar appearing stools, which stick to the sides of the bowl. Or stool with red and black spots throughout. I called my GI doctor & he immediately scheduled me for a colonoscopy, which I had about two weeks later in May of 2017. In this time, I had talked with a family friend & she told me her son who is around my age was recently diagnosed with Crohns Disease & that my symptoms sounded identical to his. I mentioned this to my GI doctor & he agreed after I asked my biopsies be tested for Crohns & specifically that it be taken from the terminal ileum. Well, after waking up from the procedure my doctor said my colon did not look inflamed but that I had internal & external hemorrhoids. A few days later I received a call from the GI office that my biopsies were negative for colitis & microscopic colitis. The only response I could form was, what? Reading my report it stated I had two biopsies from my colon that were tested for colitis. Following this, I did have a pillcamera test & the results were normal but that I had a slow transit. My GI doctors answer was basically that I have IBS & sent me to a motility center at a neighboring hospital. I gave it a chance & went. Long story made short, it was a load of BS.

430,C0024138,"Lupus Erythematosus, Discoid",C0015230,Exanthema,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/freaking-lupus/,Lupus and how symptoms don't always fit inside a disease,"I had posted for the first time a few days or so ago with questions regarding time it takes to diagnose and ease. I expressed frustration because it has been more than 8 years since my first symptoms surfaced, although minor at that time, and I dismissed them multiple times. Well, I found out its lupus. And from what Im reading on the internet, its very common for the diagnosis to take many years, an average of 6. And to be misdiagnosed multiple times. I hate the fact that I have this disease, but I am extremely relieved to know that Im not a crazy hypochondriac with 30 separate diseases and countless symptoms, that all of it has been caused by one autoimmune disease as a domino effect. I never thought in a million years that I had lupus because I didnt have the butterfly rash. I found that only about 50% of people with lupus have that rash. Instead, I have inflamed ulcer like lesions that leak clear fluid on my skin, and sores in my mouth and gums. Sores in the mouth and gums are more common than that rash. Moral of the story: dont assume that your ideas of what a disease looks like encompass your symptoms, and dont feel like you are a hypochondriac when you feel so terrible everyday. Dont be afraid to get medical help and go to many doctors until you get the help you need. Dont be afraid of the negative things people may think or say about you being concerned with your health. And dont let any of that stop you from getting help. Because only you know how you feel, only you will care enough about your health to get help. And it may take a whole lot of work, but dont give up and keep fighting for your health. Liked by John, Volunteer Mentor, gypsy71 Follow Report"

His form of the disease is in his abdomen and was confirmed by doing a lymph node biopsy. He was treated with high dose steroids for two weeks and began to do better for a few weeks until his pain came back. He was admitted again and it was found that his disease had spread from the right side of his abdomen to the middle. He was started on steroids again and has been on them for 6 1/2 weeks now with no improvement and he is actually getting worse. He is being weaned off of them very slowly and has 6 more weeks left of the steroids. He is continuing to get worse and his current rheumatologist just told me last week that he doesnt need to see my son again for 3 months. My son has severe pain in his abdomen, is constantly nauseous and says his pain is getting even worse. We are going on almost 4 months of him being sick and in pain. I have been told by his rheumatologist he has a severe case. Is there anyone else out there that has experienced abdominal Kikuchi? Im feeling quite helpless at this point. Im also looking to find a new doctor to see him. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated! Follow Report"

I have been having right shoulder pain which doctors told me for years was bursitis. The pain got worse so I went to a neurologist because i honestly thought the pain was too bad to be only bursitis. Also, the pain radiated past the elbow and to my wrist. Nerve testing turned out normal. I never had any imaging done. Fast forward to Oct. I got a flu shot 22Oct in my left arm. About a week later I had a bursitis flare (right shoulder) that lasted about 3 days. 2 days later the pain started again, but it was so severe I literally had no range of motion due to pain. It was sharp, stabbing, radiating pain in the front of my shoulder/armpit and tip of my shoulder. The pain was constant and severe but I would still have these episodes where it got even more severe and I bawled my eyes out. Ibuprofen always worked to relieve my bursitis but even the ibuprofen 800, muscle relaxer, and tylenol I was taking didnt touch the pain. Urgent care x rayed my shoulder  found a huge calcium deposit. Went to the ortho, gave me a coristone injection that did absolutely nothing. Severe pain continued. Then I woke up and couldnt hardly move my arm. This wasnt due to pain, it was as if my arm just stopped working. It had no strength, but it was only my upper arm, not forearm. Sleeping was impossible as pressure on my shoulder blade caused pain, too. A week later I got an MRI to prepare for arthroscopic shoulder surgery to remove the calcium. MRI showed several calcium deposits and mild tears. The surgeon said I would feel instantly better after surgery to remove the calcium. I was looking forward to no more pain as by this point it had been over a month.Oddly enough, About 3 days before surgery, I finally got my range of motion and strength back and little pain. Surgery to remove calcium and decompression went fine, but a few days later, I started to feel pain in the front of my shoulder from armpit/chest to clavicle  pretty much same pain as before. Then I felt almost like a popping  like a tendon or something popping out of place. It was so painful and occurred during minor movements and about 10x per day. Its 5 weeks after the surgery. I still have very little range of motion but not because of pain. My PT can move my arm much further in all directions than I can. After my first PT visit though, I had an episode of severe pain. I cannot even explain the level of severity. It almost made me go crazy. It lasted 2.5 hrs. It started in my armpit/chest/shoulder and radiated to my elbow/funny bone then to my forearm/wrist. It starts out small then gradually radiates and causes the most severe, intense pain. Ever since, Ive been having at least 1 episode a day. It is debilitating. The PA keeps telling me some people experience pain longer than others, but I dont think this is surgical pain at all. Aside from the episodes, I do still have more dull pain in the same areas  it just seems to constantly flare up. I am now on gabapentin, meloxicam, and vicodin. Ive researched some things and found that Parsonage Turner syndrome sounds very much like what I am experiencing. I have also found info on pancoast tumors which also cause symptoms as mine. How can I find someone who can help me rule out or diagnose these? I dont want to keep seeing different specialists for every little thing. Where do I start?

I tapered off in July 2018 and was busy dealing with getting back into shape. I got pregnant in november and oddly enough this is typically when I start a severe flare coinciding with the onset of a humid summer..since getting pregnant my lichen planus has disappeared. This is great obviously but I am wondering if this is also telling me something about my body. Any medicalperson our there who thinks progesterone might be the key to assisting lichen planus in woman? Thinking that is whay pregnancy does..change your hormones.. My real worry is that once my pregnancy is over the lichen planus may come back aggressively unless I try to understand at this stage what could help it.

Then the 2nd time l fell in his office and today l was his top patient. He tell me l am going to help you. What an answer to prayer. I told him all about my symptoms and he ask me where did you work. I said at a hospital. And then he said are you a nurse? Well l don't have to be a nurse but at that moment I felt like l was the medical doctor because I tell all my doctors what meds l can take and can't. This week l was given a sleeping pill that you are not suppose to take if you have liver disease and l kept telling the doctor my medical condition and he says your psychotic. I am so glad l took my friend with me, she said he acted psychotic. And he broke hippa rules, l wish l would have recorded him. Its amazing. But at this clinic the founder of the clinic stays on these doctors and if you feel you are not being respected the founder will personally come in and talk with you. So he said l had an infection and he had my blood drawn and he said l will talk to your doctor at the mayo clinic and we will decide if you need medicine or what.. And if you need to get to the mayo clinic l will make sure you get there. Today was a great day. Thank you Jesus an answer to prayer. I finding out we have to detoxify our bodies. So l am eating better and drinking water and also make sure your surroundings are clean. I use cleaning products that are so safe they don't have safety caps on it. And you have to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables and there are certain types of bath soaks to use. I am going to take a ginger and Epsom salts bath to remove the toxins out of my body since l can't do it on my own. And to everyone watch the meds you are taking.

I HAVE HYPOTHYROIDISM, ASTHMA AND PANIC/ANXIETY, HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY AND ACID RELUX WHICH I TAKE MEDS FOR. ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO I GOT SLAMMED WITH MULTIPLE INFECTIONS ALL AT THE SAME TIME (STAPH, UPPER RESPIRATORY, SINUS AND EAR) IN THE FOLLOWING 18 MONTHS I WAS SICK 9 MORE TIMES WITH MANY OTHER INFECTIONS. IN THAT TIME I WOULD HAVE EPISODES WITH SEVERE HEADACHES, VOMITING, DIZZINESS AND VISION PROBLEMS ABOUT 2 TIMES A MONTH. I WOULD TAKE SOME IBUPROFEN AND REST AND USUALLY IT RESOLVED IN LESS THAN A DAY. AROUND THE SAME TIME I NOTICED JOINT/BONE PAIN WAS INCREASING EVERY DAY, NIGHT SWEATS GOT REALLY BAD WHILE I WAS FREEZING AND ACCOMPANIED WITH SHAKING. IN JULY 2018 BACK AND ANKLES STARTED ITCHING SO BAD IT WAS DRIVING ME CRAZY. I ALSO WAS CHOCKING ON MY SALIVA FREQUENTLY WHICH IS NOT NORMAL FOR ME. IN AUGUST OF 2018 I HAD AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE THE NEXT FAZE OF MY TOOTH IMPLANT DONE WITH MY DENTIST. HE TOLD ME THAT MY JAW BONE WAS VERY SOFT AND THAT IT WOULD TAKE LONGER FOR THIS FAZE TO HEAL. SEPTEMBER 2018 I HAD INFECTED SKIN BIOPSIES, SO I STARTED MEDS FOR THAT THE WEEK OF LABOR DAY. THE SATURDAY FOLLOWING THAT I COULDN'T GET TO BATHROOM OR GO UP THE STAIRS. I THOUGHT WOW, I AM REALLY SICK! THEN THE ONSLAUGHT OF SYMPTOMS STARTED- HEADACHE CONSTANTLY, NAUSEA, WEAK, EXTREME FATIGUE, LOW GRADE FEVER, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, INTENSE BONE AND JOINT PAIN, SPLOTCHY RED SKIN WITH LITTLE RED DOTS, ABNORMAL UNEXPLAINED BRUISING, DIZZY/SHAKY/LIGHTHEADED, WOUNDS TAKING A LONG TIME TO HEAL, NO APPETITE, WEIGHT LOSS, NIGHT SWEATS, CHILLS, MY JOINTS AND BONES ARE POPING, CRACKING AND SNAPPING A LOT MORE THAN NORMAL AND THE FEELING OF BEING THE MOST SICK I HAVE EVER BEEN . OCTOBER 21ST 2018 CAME WITH ALL THE SAME SYMPTOMS ABOVE PLUS PERIODS OF LETHARGY, COUGHING, UNSTEADY/WOBBLY ON MY FEET, STIFFNESS, HOARSE VOICE, INTENSE ABDOMINAL PAIN, CONFUSION AND TIME LOSS, NUMBNESS AND TINGLING, FORGETFUL, SWOLLEN BODY, NOT SLEEPING, PERIODS OF TIME WHEN IT WAS A STRUGGLE TO KEEP MY HEAD UP AND SPEAK AND CHEST PAIN. DECEMBER 18TH 2018 ALL THE SAME AS ABOVE PLUS COORDINATION ISSUES, MUSCLE CRAMPS/SPASMS, DRY EYE AND MOUTH, EYE SIGHT/VISION PROBLEMS, BRAIN AND MIND ISSUES, CONSTIPATION OR DIARRHEA, LUMPS FORMING ON JOINTS AND BONES AND ITCHY SKIN. JANUARY 8TH 2018 ALL THE SAME ISSUES. AS I WRITE THIS I AM STRUGGLING TO SPELL WORDS, FORM SENTENCES, CONSTRUCT THIS LETTER AND COORDINATE MY FINGERS TO HIT THE RIGHT BUTTONS. IT'S BEEN 5 MONTHS AND HONESTLY IT FEELS LIKE I WILL BE SICK LIKE THIS THE REST OF MY LIFE! NOW, ON TO MY DOCTOR VISTS AND TEST RESULTS. IN THE 5 MONTHS I HAVE BEEN SICK I HAVE BEEN TO THE ER 4 TIMESTHEY ARE USELESS. I WAS DISMISSED, TREATED LIKE I WAS AN ATTENTION SEEKER AND PASSED OFF AS IF I HAD PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS. THE FIRST VISIT ON 9/10/18 I HAD A CHEST X-RAY WHICH WAS CLEAR, HE SUGGESTED I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE , BESIDES THAT, THEY IGNORED ME FOR 6 HOURS AND SENT ME HOME. THE NEXT VISIT ON 9/14/18 THEY INSINUATED THAT I WAS HAVING PANIC ISSUES AND GAVE MEDS TO ""CALM ME DOWN"". WITH SOME PUSHING BY MYSELF THE DOCTOR ORDERED A CAT SCAN OF MY CHEST AND ABDOMEN THAT SHOWED A NODE IN MY LUNG AND ALSO IN MY LIVER AND ANOTHER CHEST X-RAY THAT WAS CLEAR AND SUGGESTED I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE AND GAVE ME PAIN MEDS, STEROIDS AND ZANEX. THE STEROIDS WERE THE BURST METHOD WHICH I HAVE NEVER TAKEN BEFORE. I HAVE ASTHMA SO I HAVE TAKEN STEROIDS MANY TIMES, THIS TIME THEY MADE MY BREATHING WORSE AND MADE ME SO JITTERY I COULN'T SIT DOWN OR SLEEP. THE VISIT AFTER THAT ON 9/18/18 I WAS NEARLY COMATOSE, I COULDN'T WALK INTO THE HOSPITAL, I FELT LIKE I WAS FLOATING LAYING IN THE HOSPITAL BED, I WAS THERE 6 HOURS AND I FELT LIKE I WAS THERE ONLY A FEW MINUTES. THEY DID BLOOD TESTS THAT SHOWED EVERYTHING IN NORMAL RANGES EXCEPT FOR PHOSPHATASE BEING LOW, SLIGHTLY ELEVATED WBC AND GLUCOSE WAS 136. THIS DOCTOR TOLD MY HUSBAND AND I THAT WE WERE FAT AND SHOULD LOOK INTO INTERMITTENT FASTING. THE NEXT VISIT ON 10/25/18 THEY DID BLOOD WORK AGAIN. GLUCOSE WAS 113, ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE HAS DROPPED EVEN LOWER. NOW ON TO DOCTORS OUTSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL. I FIRST SAW MY PCP ON 9/1/2018 BECAUSE I WASN'T FEELING GOOD. SHE RAN BLOOD TESTS THAT SHOWED PHOSPHATASE IS LOW, RBC WAS HIGH, HEMATOCRIT WAS HIGH AND ABSOLUTE EOSINOPHILS WERE HIGH, GLUCOSE WAS 109 AND CHOLESTEROL WAS HIGH. SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME SO SHE SENT ME TO AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR. I SAW THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR ON 9/13/2018. HE RAN A TON OF BLOOD WORK. AGAIN PHOSPHATASE IS LOW, C-REACTIVE PROTEIN IS LOW AND ANCA AND ANA TESTS ARE POSITIVE. HE SENT ME ON MY WAY AFTER FINDING OUT I WAS NOT INFECTIOUS. I THEN WENT TO A HEART DOCTOR. I COULDN'T WALK, HARDLY TALK OR FILL OUT PAPERS. THEY HAD ME DO AN ULTRA SOUND OF MY HEART AND ARTERIES THEY WERE NEGATIVE. THE VASCULAR FOLKS SENT ME IMMEDIATELY TO THE RHEUMATOLOGIST UP STAIRS. HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG AND SUGGESTED I HAD FIBROMYALGIA. AGAIN I CAN'T WALK FAR, BARELY TALK, HOLD MY HEAD UP ECT. HE SAYS TAKE GABAPENTIN. I STILL TAKE THE GABAPENTIN 2 TIMES A DAY AND IT HAS HELPED WITH SOME OF THE PAIN BUT IT MAKES ME A HUNGRY MONSTER SO I HAVE GAINED WEIGHT. BEFORE I STARTED THIS MED I WAS LOOSING WEIGHT AND STRUGGLING TO EAT ANYTHING. I ALSO SWITCHED PCP. I WENT TO HIM WITH ALL MY SYMPTOMS, MEDS AND TESTS RESULTS. HE SAID, THE SECOND HE WALKED IN THE DOOR I AM GOING TO ORDER AN A1C TEST( WHICH TURNED OUT NORMAL) I WANT YOU TO SEE YOUR PSYCHIATRIST AND I WANT YOU TO DO A SLEEP STUDY. HE THEN MENTIONED THAT HE WANTS ME TO GET OFF SOME OF MY MEDS. I AM THINKING TO MY SELF WHAT MEDS DO YOU THINK I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT? THE ONES THAT HELP ME BREATH? THE ONES THAT STOP MY NONSTOP PANIC? THE ONES THAT FIX MY THYROID? WTF. HE THOUGHT HE HAD ME SORTED OUT BEFORE HE EVEN CAME IN THE ROOM. HE DIDN'T LISTEN TO ANYTHING I HAD TO SAY. I WENT TO THE PSYCHIATRIST AND SHE ASKED ME WHY I WAS THERE AS I ALREADY TAKE MEDS FOR MY ANXIETY (WHICH I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE UNTIL I REACHED MY 40'S)BUT SHE DOUBLED MY CYMBALTA. I HAVE A CPAP MACHINE NOW, I HAVE USED IT FOR OVER A MONTH NOW AND HAVE 0 RELIEF OF ANYTHING. ON 9/28/18 I WENT TO AN ONCOLOGIST BECAUSE, WELL, WHERE DO I GO NEXT! SHE RAN SOME TESTS. MY TEMP WAS A LIITLE ELEVATED, EOSINOPHILS WERE HIGH, MEAN PLATELET VOLUME IS LOW, MANUAL MONOCYTES ARE LOW, ATYPICAL/REACTIVE LYMPHOCYTES ARE HIGH AND AGIAN PHOSPHATASE IS EVEN LOWER. THE NEXT TIME I SAW HER SHE ORDERED A URINE CATCH AND SKELETAL SURVEY AND MORE BLOOD. SURVEY SAID NOTHING WAS ABNORMAL, CREATININE IS HIGH AND CATCH HAD A FAINT ALBUMIN LINE. ULTIMATELY SHE RELEASED ME FROM HER CARE. AFTER MY LAST ER VISIT I SAW A GASTROENTEROLOGIST AND HE WANTED TO DO A COLONOSCOPY AND ENDOSCOPY BUT I CAN'T STOP TAKING MY PAIN MEDS AND IBUPROFEN. I HAVE BEEN BACK TO THE RHEUMATOLOGIST MANY TIMES. I HAD THE AVISE TEST WHICH CAME UP WITH NOTHING FOR DIAGNOSIS. ANA AND ANCA ARE STILL POSITIVE BUT TITERS ARE LOW. THEY STARTED ME ON CHLOROQUINE I TOOK THAT FOR 2 MONTHS WITH NO RELIEF. THEY THEN WANTED ME TO TAKE ADDERALL TO HELP WITH MY FATIGUE, THAT DID NOTHING. LATEST TESTING SHOWS NO INFLAMMATION MARKERS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT TEST CAME BACK NEGATIVE. IF I DON'T TAKE 1500MG OF IBUPROFEN EVERY DAY I CAN'T BREATH, MY SKIN GETS BRIGHT RED AND ITCHY, I COUGH, LOOSE MY VOICE PLUS ALL THE OTHER SYMPTOMS I HAVE. THEY ARE SENDING ME TO PAIN MANAGEMENT WHICH I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO. THEY WILL NOT GIVE ME ANY MEDS THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE, SO I AM MOVING ON TO ANOTHER RHUEY AT THE END OF JANUARY 2019. THEY TELL ME I HAVE FIBROMYALGIA AND CRONIC FATIGUE BUT THERE IS MORE GOING ON. I SAW A NEUROLOGIST IN NOVEMBER 2018 AND HE SCHEDULED A CAT SCAN OF THE HEAD AND AN EEG. HE SAID MY BRAIN WAS OKAY. SO HE RELEASED ME FROM HIS CARE. THIS LEADS TO THE NOW. I AM HOME BOUND AND ALONE DURING THE DAY AS MY FAMILY ALL WORKS OR IS IN COLLEGE. MY MOM WAS HERE FOR 2 OF THE MONTHS I HAVE BEEN SICK WHICH WAS HELPFUL. I CAN'T DRIVE, MY BRAIN/MIND IS IN BAD SHAPE, I AM REALLY STRUGGLING WITH ALL THE SYMPTOMS I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED. I FEEL HORRIBLE! I KEEP IMAGING THAT THIS IS WHAT DYING FEELS LIKE! MY PAIN IS BAD, I CAN'T DO ANYTHING, NO COOKING, NO HOUSEWORK, NO GROCERY SHOPPING AND NO WORKING. I AM COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED FROM EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING. I WANT TO EAT BETTER BUT I CAN'T MAKE MUCH FOR MYSELF. PAIN IS ALMOST ALWAYS A 6-8. I JUST WANT AND NEED HELP! MY FAMILY DOES WHAT THEY CAN BUT I THINK THEY ARE FED UP. I THINK MY HUSBAND THINKS THAT THIS IS MEDICINE RELATED, ANXIETY RELATED, BEING OVERWEIGHT AND MAYBE EVEN BECAUSE HE THINKS I WANT ATTENTION. TEST RESULTS AREN'T TELLING US ANYTHING TO HELP WITH DIAGNOSIS. I KNOW WHAT IT'S NOT. I HAVE TONS OF MEDICAL BILLS. I DON'T THINK I COULD AFFORD TO GO TO MAYO OR ANY DIAGNOSTIC FACILITY. I AM THINKING OF GOING TO AN ENDOCRINOLOGIST NEXT. NOT SURE..SIGH. WHAT DO YOU ALL THINK? Follow Report"

IN THE 5 MONTHS I HAVE BEEN SICK I HAVE BEEN TO THE ER 4 TIMESTHEY ARE USELESS. I WAS DISMISSED, TREATED LIKE I WAS AN ATTENTION SEEKER AND PASSED OFF AS IF I HAD PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS. THE FIRST VISIT ON 9/10/18 I HAD A CHEST X-RAY WHICH WAS CLEAR, HE SUGGESTED I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE , BESIDES THAT, THEY IGNORED ME FOR 6 HOURS AND SENT ME HOME. THE NEXT VISIT ON 9/14/18 THEY INSINUATED THAT I WAS HAVING PANIC ISSUES AND GAVE MEDS TO ""CALM ME DOWN"". WITH SOME PUSHING BY MYSELF THE DOCTOR ORDERED A CAT SCAN OF MY CHEST AND ABDOMEN THAT SHOWED A NODE IN MY LUNG AND ALSO IN MY LIVER AND ANOTHER CHEST X-RAY THAT WAS CLEAR AND SUGGESTED I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE AND GAVE ME PAIN MEDS, STEROIDS AND ZANEX. THE STEROIDS WERE THE BURST METHOD WHICH I HAVE NEVER TAKEN BEFORE. I HAVE ASTHMA SO I HAVE TAKEN STEROIDS MANY TIMES, THIS TIME THEY MADE MY BREATHING WORSE AND MADE ME SO JITTERY I COULN'T SIT DOWN OR SLEEP. THE VISIT AFTER THAT ON 9/18/18 I WAS NEARLY COMATOSE, I COULDN'T WALK INTO THE HOSPITAL, I FELT LIKE I WAS FLOATING LAYING IN THE HOSPITAL BED, I WAS THERE 6 HOURS AND I FELT LIKE I WAS THERE ONLY A FEW MINUTES. THEY DID BLOOD TESTS THAT SHOWED EVERYTHING IN NORMAL RANGES EXCEPT FOR PHOSPHATASE BEING LOW, SLIGHTLY ELEVATED WBC AND GLUCOSE WAS 136. THIS DOCTOR TOLD MY HUSBAND AND I THAT WE WERE FAT AND SHOULD LOOK INTO INTERMITTENT FASTING. THE NEXT VISIT ON 10/25/18 THEY DID BLOOD WORK AGAIN. GLUCOSE WAS 113, ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE HAS DROPPED EVEN LOWER. NOW ON TO DOCTORS OUTSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL. I FIRST SAW MY PCP ON 9/1/2018 BECAUSE I WASN'T FEELING GOOD. SHE RAN BLOOD TESTS THAT SHOWED PHOSPHATASE IS LOW, RBC WAS HIGH, HEMATOCRIT WAS HIGH AND ABSOLUTE EOSINOPHILS WERE HIGH, GLUCOSE WAS 109 AND CHOLESTEROL WAS HIGH. SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME SO SHE SENT ME TO AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR. I SAW THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR ON 9/13/2018. HE RAN A TON OF BLOOD WORK. AGAIN PHOSPHATASE IS LOW, C-REACTIVE PROTEIN IS LOW AND ANCA AND ANA TESTS ARE POSITIVE. HE SENT ME ON MY WAY AFTER FINDING OUT I WAS NOT INFECTIOUS. I THEN WENT TO A HEART DOCTOR. I COULDN'T WALK, HARDLY TALK OR FILL OUT PAPERS. THEY HAD ME DO AN ULTRA SOUND OF MY HEART AND ARTERIES THEY WERE NEGATIVE. THE VASCULAR FOLKS SENT ME IMMEDIATELY TO THE RHEUMATOLOGIST UP STAIRS. HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG AND SUGGESTED I HAD FIBROMYALGIA. AGAIN I CAN'T WALK FAR, BARELY TALK, HOLD MY HEAD UP ECT. HE SAYS TAKE GABAPENTIN. I STILL TAKE THE GABAPENTIN 2 TIMES A DAY AND IT HAS HELPED WITH SOME OF THE PAIN BUT IT MAKES ME A HUNGRY MONSTER SO I HAVE GAINED WEIGHT. BEFORE I STARTED THIS MED I WAS LOOSING WEIGHT AND STRUGGLING TO EAT ANYTHING. I ALSO SWITCHED PCP. I WENT TO HIM WITH ALL MY SYMPTOMS, MEDS AND TESTS RESULTS. HE SAID, THE SECOND HE WALKED IN THE DOOR I AM GOING TO ORDER AN A1C TEST( WHICH TURNED OUT NORMAL) I WANT YOU TO SEE YOUR PSYCHIATRIST AND I WANT YOU TO DO A SLEEP STUDY. HE THEN MENTIONED THAT HE WANTS ME TO GET OFF SOME OF MY MEDS. I AM THINKING TO MY SELF WHAT MEDS DO YOU THINK I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT? THE ONES THAT HELP ME BREATH? THE ONES THAT STOP MY NONSTOP PANIC? THE ONES THAT FIX MY THYROID? WTF. HE THOUGHT HE HAD ME SORTED OUT BEFORE HE EVEN CAME IN THE ROOM. HE DIDN'T LISTEN TO ANYTHING I HAD TO SAY. I WENT TO THE PSYCHIATRIST AND SHE ASKED ME WHY I WAS THERE AS I ALREADY TAKE MEDS FOR MY ANXIETY (WHICH I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE UNTIL I REACHED MY 40'S)BUT SHE DOUBLED MY CYMBALTA. I HAVE A CPAP MACHINE NOW, I HAVE USED IT FOR OVER A MONTH NOW AND HAVE 0 RELIEF OF ANYTHING. ON 9/28/18 I WENT TO AN ONCOLOGIST BECAUSE, WELL, WHERE DO I GO NEXT! SHE RAN SOME TESTS. MY TEMP WAS A LIITLE ELEVATED, EOSINOPHILS WERE HIGH, MEAN PLATELET VOLUME IS LOW, MANUAL MONOCYTES ARE LOW, ATYPICAL/REACTIVE LYMPHOCYTES ARE HIGH AND AGIAN PHOSPHATASE IS EVEN LOWER. THE NEXT TIME I SAW HER SHE ORDERED A URINE CATCH AND SKELETAL SURVEY AND MORE BLOOD. SURVEY SAID NOTHING WAS ABNORMAL, CREATININE IS HIGH AND CATCH HAD A FAINT ALBUMIN LINE. ULTIMATELY SHE RELEASED ME FROM HER CARE. AFTER MY LAST ER VISIT I SAW A GASTROENTEROLOGIST AND HE WANTED TO DO A COLONOSCOPY AND ENDOSCOPY BUT I CAN'T STOP TAKING MY PAIN MEDS AND IBUPROFEN. I HAVE BEEN BACK TO THE RHEUMATOLOGIST MANY TIMES. I HAD THE AVISE TEST WHICH CAME UP WITH NOTHING FOR DIAGNOSIS. ANA AND ANCA ARE STILL POSITIVE BUT TITERS ARE LOW. THEY STARTED ME ON CHLOROQUINE I TOOK THAT FOR 2 MONTHS WITH NO RELIEF. THEY THEN WANTED ME TO TAKE ADDERALL TO HELP WITH MY FATIGUE, THAT DID NOTHING. LATEST TESTING SHOWS NO INFLAMMATION MARKERS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT TEST CAME BACK NEGATIVE. IF I DON'T TAKE 1500MG OF IBUPROFEN EVERY DAY I CAN'T BREATH, MY SKIN GETS BRIGHT RED AND ITCHY, I COUGH, LOOSE MY VOICE PLUS ALL THE OTHER SYMPTOMS I HAVE. THEY ARE SENDING ME TO PAIN MANAGEMENT WHICH I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO. THEY WILL NOT GIVE ME ANY MEDS THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE, SO I AM MOVING ON TO ANOTHER RHUEY AT THE END OF JANUARY 2019. THEY TELL ME I HAVE FIBROMYALGIA AND CRONIC FATIGUE BUT THERE IS MORE GOING ON. I SAW A NEUROLOGIST IN NOVEMBER 2018 AND HE SCHEDULED A CAT SCAN OF THE HEAD AND AN EEG. HE SAID MY BRAIN WAS OKAY. SO HE RELEASED ME FROM HIS CARE. THIS LEADS TO THE NOW. I AM HOME BOUND AND ALONE DURING THE DAY AS MY FAMILY ALL WORKS OR IS IN COLLEGE. MY MOM WAS HERE FOR 2 OF THE MONTHS I HAVE BEEN SICK WHICH WAS HELPFUL. I CAN'T DRIVE, MY BRAIN/MIND IS IN BAD SHAPE, I AM REALLY STRUGGLING WITH ALL THE SYMPTOMS I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED.

Help!,"HELLO, I WILL START WITH SOME BACK GROUND ON MYSELF. I AM A 47 YEAR OLD, OVERWEIGHT FEMALE. I WAS WORKING A VERY STRESSFUL, DEMANDING AND PHYSICAL JOB UNTIL 5 MONTHS AGO. I HAVE HYPOTHYROIDISM, ASTHMA AND PANIC/ANXIETY, HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY AND ACID RELUX WHICH I TAKE MEDS FOR. ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO I GOT SLAMMED WITH MULTIPLE INFECTIONS ALL AT THE SAME TIME (STAPH, UPPER RESPIRATORY, SINUS AND EAR) IN THE FOLLOWING 18 MONTHS I WAS SICK 9 MORE TIMES WITH MANY OTHER INFECTIONS. IN THAT TIME I WOULD HAVE EPISODES WITH SEVERE HEADACHES, VOMITING, DIZZINESS AND VISION PROBLEMS ABOUT 2 TIMES A MONTH. I WOULD TAKE SOME IBUPROFEN AND REST AND USUALLY IT RESOLVED IN LESS THAN A DAY. AROUND THE SAME TIME I NOTICED JOINT/BONE PAIN WAS INCREASING EVERY DAY, NIGHT SWEATS GOT REALLY BAD WHILE I WAS FREEZING AND ACCOMPANIED WITH SHAKING. IN JULY 2018 BACK AND ANKLES STARTED ITCHING SO BAD IT WAS DRIVING ME CRAZY. I ALSO WAS CHOCKING ON MY SALIVA FREQUENTLY WHICH IS NOT NORMAL FOR ME. IN AUGUST OF 2018 I HAD AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE THE NEXT FAZE OF MY TOOTH IMPLANT DONE WITH MY DENTIST. HE TOLD ME THAT MY JAW BONE WAS VERY SOFT AND THAT IT WOULD TAKE LONGER FOR THIS FAZE TO HEAL. SEPTEMBER 2018 I HAD INFECTED SKIN BIOPSIES, SO I STARTED MEDS FOR THAT THE WEEK OF LABOR DAY. THE SATURDAY FOLLOWING THAT I COULDN'T GET TO BATHROOM OR GO UP THE STAIRS. I THOUGHT WOW, I AM REALLY SICK! THEN THE ONSLAUGHT OF SYMPTOMS STARTED- HEADACHE CONSTANTLY, NAUSEA, WEAK, EXTREME FATIGUE, LOW GRADE FEVER, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, INTENSE BONE AND JOINT PAIN, SPLOTCHY RED SKIN WITH LITTLE RED DOTS, ABNORMAL UNEXPLAINED BRUISING, DIZZY/SHAKY/LIGHTHEADED, WOUNDS TAKING A LONG TIME TO HEAL, NO APPETITE, WEIGHT LOSS, NIGHT SWEATS, CHILLS, MY JOINTS AND BONES ARE POPING, CRACKING AND SNAPPING A LOT MORE THAN NORMAL AND THE FEELING OF BEING THE MOST SICK I HAVE EVER BEEN . OCTOBER 21ST 2018 CAME WITH ALL THE SAME SYMPTOMS ABOVE PLUS PERIODS OF LETHARGY, COUGHING, UNSTEADY/WOBBLY ON MY FEET, STIFFNESS, HOARSE VOICE, INTENSE ABDOMINAL PAIN, CONFUSION AND TIME LOSS, NUMBNESS AND TINGLING, FORGETFUL, SWOLLEN BODY, NOT SLEEPING, PERIODS OF TIME WHEN IT WAS A STRUGGLE TO KEEP MY HEAD UP AND SPEAK AND CHEST PAIN. DECEMBER 18TH 2018 ALL THE SAME AS ABOVE PLUS COORDINATION ISSUES, MUSCLE CRAMPS/SPASMS, DRY EYE AND MOUTH, EYE SIGHT/VISION PROBLEMS, BRAIN AND MIND ISSUES, CONSTIPATION OR DIARRHEA, LUMPS FORMING ON JOINTS AND BONES AND ITCHY SKIN. JANUARY 8TH 2018 ALL THE SAME ISSUES. AS I WRITE THIS I AM STRUGGLING TO SPELL WORDS, FORM SENTENCES, CONSTRUCT THIS LETTER AND COORDINATE MY FINGERS TO HIT THE RIGHT BUTTONS. IT'S BEEN 5 MONTHS AND HONESTLY IT FEELS LIKE I WILL BE SICK LIKE THIS THE REST OF MY LIFE! NOW, ON TO MY DOCTOR VISTS AND TEST RESULTS. IN THE 5 MONTHS I HAVE BEEN SICK I HAVE BEEN TO THE ER 4 TIMESTHEY ARE USELESS. I WAS DISMISSED, TREATED LIKE I WAS AN ATTENTION SEEKER AND PASSED OFF AS IF I HAD PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS. THE FIRST VISIT ON 9/10/18 I HAD A CHEST X-RAY WHICH WAS CLEAR, HE SUGGESTED I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE , BESIDES THAT, THEY IGNORED ME FOR 6 HOURS AND SENT ME HOME. THE NEXT VISIT ON 9/14/18 THEY INSINUATED THAT I WAS HAVING PANIC ISSUES AND GAVE MEDS TO ""CALM ME DOWN"". WITH SOME PUSHING BY MYSELF THE DOCTOR ORDERED A CAT SCAN OF MY CHEST AND ABDOMEN THAT SHOWED A NODE IN MY LUNG AND ALSO IN MY LIVER AND ANOTHER CHEST X-RAY THAT WAS CLEAR AND SUGGESTED I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE AND GAVE ME PAIN MEDS, STEROIDS AND ZANEX. THE STEROIDS WERE THE BURST METHOD WHICH I HAVE NEVER TAKEN BEFORE. I HAVE ASTHMA SO I HAVE TAKEN STEROIDS MANY TIMES, THIS TIME THEY MADE MY BREATHING WORSE AND MADE ME SO JITTERY I COULN'T SIT DOWN OR SLEEP. THE VISIT AFTER THAT ON 9/18/18 I WAS NEARLY COMATOSE, I COULDN'T WALK INTO THE HOSPITAL, I FELT LIKE I WAS FLOATING LAYING IN THE HOSPITAL BED, I WAS THERE 6 HOURS AND I FELT LIKE I WAS THERE ONLY A FEW MINUTES. THEY DID BLOOD TESTS THAT SHOWED EVERYTHING IN NORMAL RANGES EXCEPT FOR PHOSPHATASE BEING LOW, SLIGHTLY ELEVATED WBC AND GLUCOSE WAS 136. THIS DOCTOR TOLD MY HUSBAND AND I THAT WE WERE FAT AND SHOULD LOOK INTO INTERMITTENT FASTING. THE NEXT VISIT ON 10/25/18 THEY DID BLOOD WORK AGAIN. GLUCOSE WAS 113, ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE HAS DROPPED EVEN LOWER. NOW ON TO DOCTORS OUTSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL. I FIRST SAW MY PCP ON 9/1/2018 BECAUSE I WASN'T FEELING GOOD. SHE RAN BLOOD TESTS THAT SHOWED PHOSPHATASE IS LOW, RBC WAS HIGH, HEMATOCRIT WAS HIGH AND ABSOLUTE EOSINOPHILS WERE HIGH, GLUCOSE WAS 109 AND CHOLESTEROL WAS HIGH. SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME SO SHE SENT ME TO AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR. I SAW THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR ON 9/13/2018. HE RAN A TON OF BLOOD WORK. AGAIN PHOSPHATASE IS LOW, C-REACTIVE PROTEIN IS LOW AND ANCA AND ANA TESTS ARE POSITIVE. HE SENT ME ON MY WAY AFTER FINDING OUT I WAS NOT INFECTIOUS. I THEN WENT TO A HEART DOCTOR. I COULDN'T WALK, HARDLY TALK OR FILL OUT PAPERS. THEY HAD ME DO AN ULTRA SOUND OF MY HEART AND ARTERIES THEY WERE NEGATIVE. THE VASCULAR FOLKS SENT ME IMMEDIATELY TO THE RHEUMATOLOGIST UP STAIRS. HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG AND SUGGESTED I HAD FIBROMYALGIA. AGAIN I CAN'T WALK FAR, BARELY TALK, HOLD MY HEAD UP ECT. HE SAYS TAKE GABAPENTIN. I STILL TAKE THE GABAPENTIN 2 TIMES A DAY AND IT HAS HELPED WITH SOME OF THE PAIN BUT IT MAKES ME A HUNGRY MONSTER SO I HAVE GAINED WEIGHT. BEFORE I STARTED THIS MED I WAS LOOSING WEIGHT AND STRUGGLING TO EAT ANYTHING. I ALSO SWITCHED PCP. I WENT TO HIM WITH ALL MY SYMPTOMS, MEDS AND TESTS RESULTS. HE SAID, THE SECOND HE WALKED IN THE DOOR I AM GOING TO ORDER AN A1C TEST( WHICH TURNED OUT NORMAL) I WANT YOU TO SEE YOUR PSYCHIATRIST AND I WANT YOU TO DO A SLEEP STUDY. HE THEN MENTIONED THAT HE WANTS ME TO GET OFF SOME OF MY MEDS. I AM THINKING TO MY SELF WHAT MEDS DO YOU THINK I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT? THE ONES THAT HELP ME BREATH? THE ONES THAT STOP MY NONSTOP PANIC? THE ONES THAT FIX MY THYROID? WTF. HE THOUGHT HE HAD ME SORTED OUT BEFORE HE EVEN CAME IN THE ROOM. HE DIDN'T LISTEN TO ANYTHING I HAD TO SAY. I WENT TO THE PSYCHIATRIST AND SHE ASKED ME WHY I WAS THERE AS I ALREADY TAKE MEDS FOR MY ANXIETY (WHICH I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE UNTIL I REACHED MY 40'S)BUT SHE DOUBLED MY CYMBALTA. I HAVE A CPAP MACHINE NOW, I HAVE USED IT FOR OVER A MONTH NOW AND HAVE 0 RELIEF OF ANYTHING. ON 9/28/18 I WENT TO AN ONCOLOGIST BECAUSE, WELL, WHERE DO I GO NEXT! SHE RAN SOME TESTS. MY TEMP WAS A LIITLE ELEVATED, EOSINOPHILS WERE HIGH, MEAN PLATELET VOLUME IS LOW, MANUAL MONOCYTES ARE LOW, ATYPICAL/REACTIVE LYMPHOCYTES ARE HIGH AND AGIAN PHOSPHATASE IS EVEN LOWER. THE NEXT TIME I SAW HER SHE ORDERED A URINE CATCH AND SKELETAL SURVEY AND MORE BLOOD. SURVEY SAID NOTHING WAS ABNORMAL, CREATININE IS HIGH AND CATCH HAD A FAINT ALBUMIN LINE. ULTIMATELY SHE RELEASED ME FROM HER CARE. AFTER MY LAST ER VISIT I SAW A GASTROENTEROLOGIST AND HE WANTED TO DO A COLONOSCOPY AND ENDOSCOPY BUT I CAN'T STOP TAKING MY PAIN MEDS AND IBUPROFEN. I HAVE BEEN BACK TO THE RHEUMATOLOGIST MANY TIMES. I HAD THE AVISE TEST WHICH CAME UP WITH NOTHING FOR DIAGNOSIS. ANA AND ANCA ARE STILL POSITIVE BUT TITERS ARE LOW. THEY STARTED ME ON CHLOROQUINE I TOOK THAT FOR 2 MONTHS WITH NO RELIEF. THEY THEN WANTED ME TO TAKE ADDERALL TO HELP WITH MY FATIGUE, THAT DID NOTHING. LATEST TESTING SHOWS NO INFLAMMATION MARKERS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT TEST CAME BACK NEGATIVE. IF I DON'T TAKE 1500MG OF IBUPROFEN EVERY DAY I CAN'T BREATH, MY SKIN GETS BRIGHT RED AND ITCHY, I COUGH, LOOSE MY VOICE PLUS ALL THE OTHER SYMPTOMS I HAVE. THEY ARE SENDING ME TO PAIN MANAGEMENT WHICH I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO. THEY WILL NOT GIVE ME ANY MEDS THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE, SO I AM MOVING ON TO ANOTHER RHUEY AT THE END OF JANUARY 2019. THEY TELL ME I HAVE FIBROMYALGIA AND CRONIC FATIGUE BUT THERE IS MORE GOING ON. I SAW A NEUROLOGIST IN NOVEMBER 2018 AND HE SCHEDULED A CAT SCAN OF THE HEAD AND AN EEG. HE SAID MY BRAIN WAS OKAY. SO HE RELEASED ME FROM HIS CARE. THIS LEADS TO THE NOW. I AM HOME BOUND AND ALONE DURING THE DAY AS MY FAMILY ALL WORKS OR IS IN COLLEGE. MY MOM WAS HERE FOR 2 OF THE MONTHS I HAVE BEEN SICK WHICH WAS HELPFUL. I CAN'T DRIVE, MY BRAIN/MIND IS IN BAD SHAPE, I AM REALLY STRUGGLING WITH ALL THE SYMPTOMS I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED. I FEEL HORRIBLE! I KEEP IMAGING THAT THIS IS WHAT DYING FEELS LIKE! MY PAIN IS BAD, I CAN'T DO ANYTHING, NO COOKING, NO HOUSEWORK, NO GROCERY SHOPPING AND NO WORKING.

So now they want me to go to a GI consult. Can you figure that? And the er hospital that sent me is where l was first diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. Everytime l have symptoms they have a psychiatrist come to see me. Even when l fall or have a seizure or maybe allergic reaction. So l already saw a new neurologist and no extra test were ordered then last Friday they say you need a MRI and EEG test. I told them no but if the doctors want to pay for it then call me. And now today l get a call about a GI consult. Guess who dropped the ball???? Oh and my liver doctor practice at this hospital. This is the one in my state. Thank God l have one at the mayo clinic. I was to see my liver doctor at home next month but he's fired. He can't even read my diagnosis and it was given to him by many doctors. So l am back to start looking for another doctor.

A few nights ago, I was on the computer and started to feel a headache. No biggie, I took some ibuprofen. That headache turned into a migraine and I started to feel very nauseous. I went to sleep since it was already 10pm. I woke up to urinate and when I layed back down I felt weird. I started shaking and sweating, then before I know it Im just slimey and shaking. Checked my blood pressure and it was 141 over 95. I was freezing but sweating. I checked my oral temperature and it was 95.5 degrees. 10 minutes later my oral temperature was 93.8. This went on for about 25 minutes. So i called the ambulance and when they arrived they didnt check me out or anything. Basically they told me it was anxiety and that oral thermometers are garbage and not accurate. Thats fine to be biased towards oral thermometers but how can I feel ok and they read 98 degrees and then when these shaking episodes happen they read 95 degrees or under? After it subsided, which was about an hour later, I slept for 10 hours and then for the past 2 days I feel like I was hit by a truck. Completely sore. This might sound like the flu to some, but this happens regularly without any congestion, or cold related issues. It makes me feel depressed and anxious but its only after these harsh episodes that beat me up. Also when the episode happened, I urinated a lot that day and my stool felt burning. Normal stools but very acidic. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks. Liked by Becky, Volunteer Mentor, johnwes5819 Follow Report"

Seen a neurologist and dont have permanent damage yet but have flares from food and sometimes without. I ate a single chocolate cookie last night and now my feet are on fire along with arms hands and legs. No DR can figure this out, seems like something attacked my nerves during the treatment.

Random hypogastric cramping due to not being able to have a bowel movement. Usually, it was constipation, followed by diarrhea. Like a cork in a wine bottle. If I couldn't get the cork out, to get the wine out, I would faint. Keep in mind this was not due to straining to have a bowel movement, this is due to the hypogastric cramping pain. If I'm laying in bed and the pain goes on long enough, I will faint in the bed. *I'll try to keep the story brief.* **My Story:** 2 years ago I was at the gym doing the leg press. I felt a sharp pain in the colon area, left the machine and didn't think anything of it. I woke up in the middle of the night to urinate. After urinating (and standing) I fainted (Micturition Syncope). **Heart:** After that day, my health went downhill. While sitting, my heart rate would go as high as 160 bpm. An electrophysiologist examined my 30-day halter monitor report and said the spikes didn't seem to be like anxiety and he's not exactly sure what is causing the spikes. I mentioned pheochromocytoma, and catecholamines were checked but they were normal. No tumor on my adrenals. **Kidney:** Last week I had my first kidney stone and this week I go to the Urologist. I will take him my stone for further testing. **Liver:** I told my doctor I had yellow stools, constipation, and Terry's nails. He said ""but your hepatic tests were fine and you're not jaundice? You don't do drugs or drink, so why would you have liver issues?"" I pushed for an ultrasound and the report came back as ""Heterogenous known uniform echo pattern liver seen and findings suggest liver parenchymal disease, further testing is needed"" **Gastro:** I had a colonoscopy done and a benign polyp was removed in my colon. There were also signs of inflammation in the large intestine. IBS was diagnosed. No parasites found in stools. **Thyroid:** My hormones including testosterone, progesterone, estriol, and thyroid results were all in the normal range. Including the T3 Free and Reverse T3. However, none of my thyroid results are in the recommended ***optimal ranges*** according to top Endocrinologists, but they are in the reference range in my local area. My hands and feet are always cold and that never used to happen until this past year. I was also told that I'm not anemic. During my drop in temperature, I've tested my blood sugar at home and that has always been in normal range. A1c test was also normal. **Brain:** My cognitive functions are getting worse due to the brain fog, dizziness, and stress on my overall body. An MRI was done but no abnormalities were seen. **Mental Health:** I was told I have panic disorder when this all started. I was prescribed 5 anti-depressants over a 6 month period to which none of them helped. The last medication I tried was Zoloft caused a serious pain. It felt like my brain was literally on fire. Excruciating to say the least. A week after stopping that medication, I started having depression, which I never had before. **Sleep:** I sleep 6-8 hours a night but I never feel rested. Just constant fatigue. Sometimes I wake up due to colon pressure, causing sweating and dizziness, and adrenal surges but it's random. But what is consistent is I wake up and my tongue is as dry as a cactus, which indicates I breathe through my mouth when I sleep. **Abnormal tests from the last year of testing.** *Vitamin D and Vitamin B1 were low. (Blood)* *Vitamin B6 was 3x higher than the high range. (not sure why considering I wasn't taking loads of B6) (Blood)* *Coproporphyrin i and iii were slightly elevated (Urine)* **Amino Acids:** *Cystathionine was elevated (Urine)* **Fatty Acid Profile:** *Decenoic acid (High), Vaccenic Acid and Arachidic Acid (Low)* **Organic Acid Panel:** *Lactic, GLycolic, 3-Hydroxypropionic, 2-Hydroxyisovaleric, 3-Hdroxyisovaleric, Methylsuccinic, Uracil, Glutaric, 3-Methylglutaconic, Malic, 3-Hydroxyadipic, 5-Oxoproline, Citric, and VMA (All Low)* **Conclusion:** I've been to numerous doctors as you can tell and there hasn't been any direction. Only Mild COPD (due to years of cigarettes but no longer) and Parenchymal Liver Disease. I don't drink or do drugs so I believe whatever is happening to me and stressing my liver is either (A) all vagus /colon related or (B) I have a metabolic disorder or systemic disease of some kind.

I was prescribed 5 anti-depressants over a 6 month period to which none of them helped. The last medication I tried was Zoloft caused a serious pain. It felt like my brain was literally on fire. Excruciating to say the least. A week after stopping that medication, I started having depression, which I never had before. **Sleep:** I sleep 6-8 hours a night but I never feel rested. Just constant fatigue. Sometimes I wake up due to colon pressure, causing sweating and dizziness, and adrenal surges but it's random. But what is consistent is I wake up and my tongue is as dry as a cactus, which indicates I breathe through my mouth when I sleep. **Abnormal tests from the last year of testing.** *Vitamin D and Vitamin B1 were low. (Blood)* *Vitamin B6 was 3x higher than the high range. (not sure why considering I wasn't taking loads of B6) (Blood)* *Coproporphyrin i and iii were slightly elevated (Urine)* **Amino Acids:** *Cystathionine was elevated (Urine)* **Fatty Acid Profile:** *Decenoic acid (High), Vaccenic Acid and Arachidic Acid (Low)* **Organic Acid Panel:** *Lactic, GLycolic, 3-Hydroxypropionic, 2-Hydroxyisovaleric, 3-Hdroxyisovaleric, Methylsuccinic, Uracil, Glutaric, 3-Methylglutaconic, Malic, 3-Hydroxyadipic, 5-Oxoproline, Citric, and VMA (All Low)* **Conclusion:** I've been to numerous doctors as you can tell and there hasn't been any direction. Only Mild COPD (due to years of cigarettes but no longer) and Parenchymal Liver Disease. I don't drink or do drugs so I believe whatever is happening to me and stressing my liver is either (A) all vagus /colon related or (B) I have a metabolic disorder or systemic disease of some kind.

An electrophysiologist examined my 30-day halter monitor report and said the spikes didn't seem to be like anxiety and he's not exactly sure what is causing the spikes. I mentioned pheochromocytoma, and catecholamines were checked but they were normal. No tumor on my adrenals. **Kidney:** Last week I had my first kidney stone and this week I go to the Urologist. I will take him my stone for further testing. **Liver:** I told my doctor I had yellow stools, constipation, and Terry's nails. He said ""but your hepatic tests were fine and you're not jaundice? You don't do drugs or drink, so why would you have liver issues?"" I pushed for an ultrasound and the report came back as ""Heterogenous known uniform echo pattern liver seen and findings suggest liver parenchymal disease, further testing is needed"" **Gastro:** I had a colonoscopy done and a benign polyp was removed in my colon. There were also signs of inflammation in the large intestine. IBS was diagnosed. No parasites found in stools. **Thyroid:** My hormones including testosterone, progesterone, estriol, and thyroid results were all in the normal range. Including the T3 Free and Reverse T3. However, none of my thyroid results are in the recommended ***optimal ranges*** according to top Endocrinologists, but they are in the reference range in my local area. My hands and feet are always cold and that never used to happen until this past year. I was also told that I'm not anemic. During my drop in temperature, I've tested my blood sugar at home and that has always been in normal range. A1c test was also normal. **Brain:** My cognitive functions are getting worse due to the brain fog, dizziness, and stress on my overall body. An MRI was done but no abnormalities were seen. **Mental Health:** I was told I have panic disorder when this all started. I was prescribed 5 anti-depressants over a 6 month period to which none of them helped. The last medication I tried was Zoloft caused a serious pain. It felt like my brain was literally on fire. Excruciating to say the least. A week after stopping that medication, I started having depression, which I never had before. **Sleep:** I sleep 6-8 hours a night but I never feel rested. Just constant fatigue. Sometimes I wake up due to colon pressure, causing sweating and dizziness, and adrenal surges but it's random. But what is consistent is I wake up and my tongue is as dry as a cactus, which indicates I breathe through my mouth when I sleep. **Abnormal tests from the last year of testing.** *Vitamin D and Vitamin B1 were low. (Blood)* *Vitamin B6 was 3x higher than the high range. (not sure why considering I wasn't taking loads of B6) (Blood)* *Coproporphyrin i and iii were slightly elevated (Urine)* **Amino Acids:** *Cystathionine was elevated (Urine)* **Fatty Acid Profile:** *Decenoic acid (High), Vaccenic Acid and Arachidic Acid (Low)* **Organic Acid Panel:** *Lactic, GLycolic, 3-Hydroxypropionic, 2-Hydroxyisovaleric, 3-Hdroxyisovaleric, Methylsuccinic, Uracil, Glutaric, 3-Methylglutaconic, Malic, 3-Hydroxyadipic, 5-Oxoproline, Citric, and VMA (All Low)* **Conclusion:** I've been to numerous doctors as you can tell and there hasn't been any direction. Only Mild COPD (due to years of cigarettes but no longer) and Parenchymal Liver Disease. I don't drink or do drugs so I believe whatever is happening to me and stressing my liver is either (A) all vagus /colon related or (B) I have a metabolic disorder or systemic disease of some kind. It's really the only thing that makes any sense to me but I'm not a doctor. I've been told I'm a complex case and I agree.. I am. Most of my doctors are starting to see that it's not ""all in my head"" though but connecting the dots is the hardest part and that's why I'm putting this out there.

I am 20 years old girl who is desperate for answers. Any. I have chronic pain of limbs (doctors in my country are not able to tell if it is muscles or what), I an not even sleep properly because I can not lie on my tights. Everything started three years ago, I felt a sharp bad pain in my left tight, I was in school, not in a gym, not outside. The pain went on and off for few weeks, slowly more and more parts of my body started to ache. One tight, then another, one shoulder, then another, And it came more and more often. Until now, now it does not go away. During this three years I stopped any activity, cause I am so weak I can not even go up the stairs. At least one doctor discovered a little problem with L carnitine, so these days I am not sleeping all days cause I am taking pills (or other forms of it). Rheuma, arthitisis, MS, lupus and other classics are ruled out. I do not know what to do. I do not want to take pain meds, cause my stomach is not so strong. Summary: chronic pain (limbs, fingers,), problems with sleeping, weakness, and I almost forget my almost falling cause my knees and hips are lazy to hold me or whatever PS: please if you have any tips please help me PSS: does anyone have symptom which I can only describe as if my hands do not know what they are doing (I just sometimes miss thing I would like to catch/ hold even if I am looking at it)?

I went to a new physician today, an internal medicine doctor. I only had one 10 mg Pred left until another doctor appt in 1 week. I felt I needed to at least get some more Pred since what I have been reading has me a little spooked if I stopped cold turkey after 50 days. While I felt he listened to me, I dont think he heard me. He somewhat agrees with me that it could be PMR, but he thinks I should have had no pain after taking a dose of 40 mg for 5 days. I have taken 2 separate 20 day regimens starting with 40mg, 30 mg, 20 mg, 10 mg. It appears to me my pain and stiffness symptoms decreased with the 40 and 30 mg doses. With the 20 and 10 mg doses, the pain and stiffness increased. I argued that perhaps if I took 40 mg for a longer duration maybe the pain would have decreased. Long story short, he gave me a 30 day script for 20 mg a day. He also is trying to fast track me to see a rheumatologist so will see what happens. While I was happy to see he was at least aware of PMR and GCA, he said it usually lasts a year or so and if its PMR the Pred should take the pain away. I tried to explain to him how the pain never goes away completely, talked to him how emotional I have become and asked about doing blood tests. From what I have been reading I think I should have follow up blood work, but he did not order any. He ordered Alendorate (generic for Fosomax) to help with bone density. So my question to all of you, when you take the Pred, does all of your pain go away? I guess, I am at his mercy to try the 20 mg. He also thought it was maybe rotator cuff on left side since both sides are affected, but my left is worse. I dont know how that explains my butt, hip pain though. Any thoughts? Follow Report"

Ill give some of back my story, up until I got extremely sick in October 2014, I was completely healthy and what I considered normal. I rarely went to the Doctor for anything, rarely got sick and I was always on the go. Im a 32 year old female, married with 2 kids. In October 2014 I came down with some sort of virus. I was extremely sick for about a week. Within 2 days of feeling better I started having pins and needles only on my left side in my arm, hand, leg and foot; my left leg also started falling asleep. I just thought all that was weird and went on with my life, not seeing a dr or anything. Starting in January of 2015, my symptoms started getting worse. I was walking through a parking lot when I lost complete feeling of my left leg and fell. It lasted about 30 mins or so before I started getting feeling again. By this time my pins and needles were staying constantly, the numbness was becoming more frequent, and now my left side was extremely weak. After visiting my primary she confirmed the weakness, ran a bunch of lab work and referred me to a neurologist in my area. Fast forward to December 2015, I had 2 mris, completed physical therapy and been seen by 2 neurologists, both of which told me they didnt want to spend the time to help figure anything out. My pins and needles had now migrated to the right side, and my face; I lose complete feeling in my left and right legs, more on the left, as well as in my left hand; My bladder started giving me issues retaining and releasing; I frequently become so extremely tired I cant get out of bed for days, sleeping the entire time; my balance is so out of whack that there are days Im walking and I look like Im drunk because I cant walk well; started having memory issues, as well as word finding issues. Because of the random dead leg, and balance issues, I fall frequently. So I decided to come to Mayo Clinic. They have done numerous tests and blood work. I have had a full spinal and brain MRI, EMG (x2), spinal tap, skin biopsy, audiology testing, balance testing, ARS, QSTAT, BAER, VER, SSER, Nystagmography Tests, Tilt table testing, dynamic posturography tests, urology testing, and Im sure some others I cant think of right now and all have come back clear except a few small issues, but dont offer any insight to my issues. I came back positive for small fiber neuropathy, I failed all six stages of my balance testings but because I didnt need assistance the dr said he wont consider it failed and nothing was done, they found mild bilateral hearing loss, and my tilt table came back slightly abnormal. Ive seen consultative med, hematology, neurology, urology, integrative medicine, and psychiatry. No one can figure out whats going on but my life has changed so much that I need to figure out whats going on so I can either treat it or figure out how to deal with it. I have a hard time staying awake, my balance is completely off, I randomly lose feeling in places and fall, Im weak on my left side and have issues standing for long. I was going to school full time and had a 3.85 GPA until this now its dropped to a 2.75. I cant keep up with anything and I dont know how Im going to work when I cant tell when there will be days I cant wake up or get up. Or when My balance is so unstable I cant walk with out help. I was referred to neuromuscular and saw the Dr this morning. He said I wont treat anything until we know more, which is fine because I want to know more. But told me to have a great day and didnt tell me what to do next or where to go from here. He just said send me a message of it gets worse. I dont have any other appointments or outlook on what to do now. Im not out seeking, looking for, or even asking for medications. I just want to figure out some sort of normal. I dont know how Im supposed to help support my family or work of I cant even do anything. But not knowing I dont have many options, cant get medical help or anything. Im so frustrated and feel like everyones brushed me off. What I wouldnt give to just feel normal again or at least have an answer.

I have been suffering for some chronic health issues since June and am being evaluated for a variety of possible conditions, including Sjogren's Syndrome. One abnormal (at least I think it is, but maybe not) symptom I've noticed is I will experience strong body odor from my armpits, without any sweating. This can happen when I'm just sitting on the couch watching TV. Since Sjogren's affects your exocrine system, I was just curious if this was a possible symptom  having body odor without sweat. I haven't found anything with a Google Search, but it seems to make logical sense to me so I was curious. Some other Sjogren's questions I have  Anyone diagnosed despite a negative SSA/SSB panel? If so, how? Does anyone have any advice/knowledge on differentiating between Sjogren's Syndrome and serious dry mouth/eyes/skin from medication?

I have what we call ""mono flare ups"" and my immune system is very weak. I am hospitalized at least once a year and can't fight things like a cold or strep without complications.

My GI issues stopped in mid 2017 when I began a vegetarian but have since returned in early 2018. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia last year as a ""stepping stone"" towards getting more support and another diagnosis. It started with widespread pain in the majority of the tender points, extreme fatigue, and migraines. I had three referrals to a rheumatologist (two from an internist/PCP and neurologist) that were denied because of the fibromyalgia diagnosis. My new internist/PCP (my previously one left the practice unfortunately) changed my diagnosis after I had a bad flare up that appeared to stem from a bad sun burn while on vacation. I developed severe GI issues (worse than my previous issues), constant migraines, extreme pain in the muscles and joints, unexplained fevers that come and go, and a butterfly rash. My internists/PCPs (the previous and current), physical therapist, and several other health professionals in my life felt lupus was very likely the diagnosis. I finally get into a rheumatologist who dismissed the majority of my symptoms and health history. He met with me for less than 10 minutes and told me that unless my bloodwork comes back positive/abnormal, he would not be able to help me. He stated that the bloodwork would rule out all autoimmune diagnoses and I should see a immunologist or accept that I just have fibromyalgia. I told him I'm fine with fibromyalgia diagnosis but given that I get sick constantly and am running mystery fevers, I feel that something else is going on. I specifically asked if being sick/having poor immune system and fevers is associated with fibromyalgia (which I already know it isn't) and he said no and promptly left the room.

I'm worried because I can't seem to get a provider who will treat me as if I am not a typical patient who presents issues typically. I'm also really disgruntled because I'm skeptical that bloodwork would really rule out the 80-100 autoimmune disorders. Has anyone had any luck getting answers/diagnoses without bloodwork confirming the diagnoses? Has anyone had similar situations? I've been told by previous providers that I'm ""too complex"" to treat so they recommend me going to the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins, etc. for testing and answers.

I can think of no better way to get some honest opinions and suggestions. This morning my daughter introduced me to juicing. We had a discussion about juicing over breakfast when I was talking about tapering off of prednisone and looking for natural ways to reduce inflammation. Besides PMR I also have osteopenia and am supposed to take 1200 mg calcium daily which presents some output challenges for me. We stopped by the grocery store on the way back to her house and picked up all the ingredients to make some ginger juice for inflammation (2 large oranges and some ginger root) and red cabbage juice to help with the constipation (2 heads of red cabbage, 3 apples, 2 oranges, 1 lime, and small bag of carrots). Into the juicer they went! She poured the juice into 18 oz glass containers for me to take home and keep in the refrigerator. What have I learned so far? Well, when I got home I poured about 4 oz of the red cabbage juice into a glass and topped it off with about 1 oz or more of ginger juice. I learned not to use so much of the ginger juice in my drink as it kind of has a zingy feeling on the tongue and throat. The red cabbage juice tastes a lot better than I thought  better than my breakfast smoothie. My plan was actually to use a little of both in my breakfast smoothie and reduce the amount of fruit but add the greens (kale, spinach, arugula, etc..) into a blender with the juice. Questions for anyone willing to share:  Has juicing helped you?  What tips or favorite recipes can you share? and how do they help? Looking forwarding to hearing from you!

The possibilities in the mix right now are drug-induced lupus; lupus; psoriatic arthritis and reactive arthritis. I have a mildly positive ANA (1:160), a strong-positive for histone antibodies, and a positive for chromatin antibodies. My symptoms have mostly been myalgia and arthralgia, with some swelling of entire fingers and toes, mild serositis (chest pain), mild Reynauds and before I was treated, extreme fatigue and malaise. There is no history of autoimmune disorders in my family, save for a cousin of my moms who has rheumatoid arthritis. For what its worth, Im in my mid-40s and am white. I stopped taking the possible offending medication (zonisamide) about two months ago, and slightly prior to that, got started on methotrexate. My symptoms have significantly reduced since then, but I still have some pain and stiffness in my fingers from time to time, as well as on one side of my jaw. Ive also been having nerve pain on the top of my head, but that may be unrelated.

However, I also feel a little worried that maybe we havent correctly identified the medication thats triggering all of this.

In particular, Im taking gabapentin, and wonder about that, given that its in a category (anti-seizure medications) known to trigger reactions in people.

477,C0002726,Amyloidosis,C0683369,Clouded consciousness,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/rare-disease-day-and-involvement/,Rare Disease Day and Involvement,"Today I received the latest message from NORD.Gov. It speaks of today being International Rare Disease Day. The point is to recognize that there are many diseases or disorders which are built into the lives of less than 200,000 Americans, or less than one in 100,000 or so around the world. I don't know the exact definition of ""rare"" here. Part of the confusion around Amyloidosis is that there is actually no consensus definition of the disease name, but NORD seems to estimate that about 3,000 persons are diagnosed each year.

Doctors seem to do what they can to protect the disease from modern information and technology.

477,C0678236,Rare Diseases,C0683369,Clouded consciousness,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/rare-disease-day-and-involvement/,Rare Disease Day and Involvement,"Today I received the latest message from NORD.Gov. It speaks of today being International Rare Disease Day. The point is to recognize that there are many diseases or disorders which are built into the lives of less than 200,000 Americans, or less than one in 100,000 or so around the world. I don't know the exact definition of ""rare"" here. Part of the confusion around Amyloidosis is that there is actually no consensus definition of the disease name, but NORD seems to estimate that about 3,000 persons are diagnosed each year.

My apologies that this post is so long. I have been suffering from abdominal pain on and off since May 2017. It initially followed what I thought was a bout of food poisoning, as my partner also had it. The pain follows eating and was initially right in the area between my ribs. The pain came on about 20 minutes after I ate and pretty much lasted until the food had gone through my stomach about an hour and a half later. My stomach gurgled as the last of the food went through and the pain was gone. If I didnt eat I had no stomach pain. Initially the pain was sporadic, and didnt occur all the time, however, towards the end of last year, it was all the time, was worse if I ate more and the intensity of the pain had increased. I have had two endoscopies which have not found anything and a colonoscopy which found some inflammation. My doctor called this reactive ulcerative colitis and it was deemed non-chronic. He gave me some Mesavant, and I noticed a slight improvement in my stomach pain, however, the pain came back at the same intensity a short time later. In October, I became increasingly breathless and went to my doctor who ordered a d-dimer test. The numbers came back elevated and I had a CT scan which found severe bilateral pulmonary embolisms. I was admitted to hospital for 5 days and put on Clexane injections for a few days, until I was switched to Apixaban tablets. Whilst I was on Clexane I again noticed an improvement, but the pain came back on Apixaban. My GP and specialists thought this was a coincidence. They couldnt find a cause for the PE, and I had a lot of blood work done. The first haematologist I saw, believed it was related to the ulcerative colitis, but my gastroenterologist said that it wasnt actual ulcerative colitis and was only reactive colitis. After telling the haematologist about the abdominal pain, he ordered a CT scan which came back clear, with no issues. I got out of the hospital and about a week later I experienced the worst stomach pain I have felt. I went back to the ER worried that something terrible had happened. I was in there for a week on strong pain killers, but they couldnt work out what was going on. Whilst I was in there, I had a vascular surgeon look at my case, he pressed my stomach, looked at my blood work and concluded it wasnt vascular. I think at this stage, my inflammation markers had decreased. I had another haematologist look at my case and she did some blood work, and again said I had minimal inflammation and said there was no cause that she could find for the PE. During this stay, I had a number of ultrasounds, an MRA and X-Rays. They ruled out gallstones and liver disease. The only thing they possibly found was an issue with my Median Arcuate Ligament and they suggested it could be MALS. I had another ultrasound, where I had to breathe in and out and they couldnt find any evidence of an issue with blood flow to my bowel. I went to a surgeon and he said I wouldnt be a candidate for surgery to snip the ligament as there wasnt an issue with blood flow. He did, however, say that a celiac plexus nerve block may be of use. I was given a temporary test injection of steroids twice and found some relief, but again, the pain came back fairly quickly. I was also given Glyceral trinitrate to see if this helped as it might point to a vascular issue. I tried this however, at this point, my pain was quite bad and I couldnt tell whether it worked. I also had a test for gastroparesis and my stomach emptied quicker than usual, however, my gastroenterologist said there is no pathology associated with this. At this stage, the relationship with my gastroenterologist had deteriorated after he questioned my use of painkillers, the only thing that was helping, and also questioned whether I have issues with avoiding work!!! I went back to my GP and she said that we could try a short course of steroids as a test as vasculitis had been raised as a possibility. I took the prednisolone (50mg) for 5 days and it was like magic! There was at least a 50% decrease in my pain and I was able to have some semblance of a life for the first time in months. I started to taper off the steroids, however crashed an couldnt get out of bed for two days at the start of this year. I went back to hospital where the haematologist said my iron was low and the lack of energy was most likely due to this and a steroid crash. She ordered some blood tests, my inflammation markers were low, my white blood cell count was high-ish, but she said this was probably due to the steroids. She couldnt find anything so took me off the steroids. She made mention of a rheumatologist, but said that she knew what they would say and this didnt eventuate. At this stage she basically said there wasnt much she was going to do. I was devastated. Since this, to cut a very long story short, I am on 15mg of prednisolone. I am not on painkillers and the pain is generally well managed. However, there are times after I eat that I am uncomfortable. My heart beats fairly fast and I feel like I need to rest. I am loathe to go back on painkillers and tried the glyceral trinitrate spray again today, which seemed to help a little. In the past I also found that nifedipine also helped, although temporarily. Im just at a place where I am really struggling to eat because I am so fearful of the discomfort and that the pain might come back. So any help or advice would be appreciated!

I have had two endoscopies which have not found anything and a colonoscopy which found some inflammation. My doctor called this reactive ulcerative colitis and it was deemed non-chronic. He gave me some Mesavant, and I noticed a slight improvement in my stomach pain, however, the pain came back at the same intensity a short time later. In October, I became increasingly breathless and went to my doctor who ordered a d-dimer test. The numbers came back elevated and I had a CT scan which found severe bilateral pulmonary embolisms. I was admitted to hospital for 5 days and put on Clexane injections for a few days, until I was switched to Apixaban tablets. Whilst I was on Clexane I again noticed an improvement, but the pain came back on Apixaban. My GP and specialists thought this was a coincidence. They couldnt find a cause for the PE, and I had a lot of blood work done. The first haematologist I saw, believed it was related to the ulcerative colitis, but my gastroenterologist said that it wasnt actual ulcerative colitis and was only reactive colitis. After telling the haematologist about the abdominal pain, he ordered a CT scan which came back clear, with no issues. I got out of the hospital and about a week later I experienced the worst stomach pain I have felt. I went back to the ER worried that something terrible had happened. I was in there for a week on strong pain killers, but they couldnt work out what was going on. Whilst I was in there, I had a vascular surgeon look at my case, he pressed my stomach, looked at my blood work and concluded it wasnt vascular. I think at this stage, my inflammation markers had decreased. I had another haematologist look at my case and she did some blood work, and again said I had minimal inflammation and said there was no cause that she could find for the PE. During this stay, I had a number of ultrasounds, an MRA and X-Rays. They ruled out gallstones and liver disease. The only thing they possibly found was an issue with my Median Arcuate Ligament and they suggested it could be MALS. I had another ultrasound, where I had to breathe in and out and they couldnt find any evidence of an issue with blood flow to my bowel. I went to a surgeon and he said I wouldnt be a candidate for surgery to snip the ligament as there wasnt an issue with blood flow. He did, however, say that a celiac plexus nerve block may be of use. I was given a temporary test injection of steroids twice and found some relief, but again, the pain came back fairly quickly. I was also given Glyceral trinitrate to see if this helped as it might point to a vascular issue. I tried this however, at this point, my pain was quite bad and I couldnt tell whether it worked. I also had a test for gastroparesis and my stomach emptied quicker than usual, however, my gastroenterologist said there is no pathology associated with this. At this stage, the relationship with my gastroenterologist had deteriorated after he questioned my use of painkillers, the only thing that was helping, and also questioned whether I have issues with avoiding work!!! I went back to my GP and she said that we could try a short course of steroids as a test as vasculitis had been raised as a possibility. I took the prednisolone (50mg) for 5 days and it was like magic! There was at least a 50% decrease in my pain and I was able to have some semblance of a life for the first time in months. I started to taper off the steroids, however crashed an couldnt get out of bed for two days at the start of this year. I went back to hospital where the haematologist said my iron was low and the lack of energy was most likely due to this and a steroid crash. She ordered some blood tests, my inflammation markers were low, my white blood cell count was high-ish, but she said this was probably due to the steroids. She couldnt find anything so took me off the steroids. She made mention of a rheumatologist, but said that she knew what they would say and this didnt eventuate. At this stage she basically said there wasnt much she was going to do. I was devastated. Since this, to cut a very long story short, I am on 15mg of prednisolone. I am not on painkillers and the pain is generally well managed. However, there are times after I eat that I am uncomfortable. My heart beats fairly fast and I feel like I need to rest. I am loathe to go back on painkillers and tried the glyceral trinitrate spray again today, which seemed to help a little. In the past I also found that nifedipine also helped, although temporarily. Im just at a place where I am really struggling to eat because I am so fearful of the discomfort and that the pain might come back. So any help or advice would be appreciated!

Sorry Im ranting :0) Heres the deal About 10 years ago this all started with chronic sinus infections when I moved back to Florida from New Mexico.

I had septum surgery and remained on antibiotics and steroids for most of that 5 year period, I was never off these medications for more than 2 weeks max. Finally, I self diagnosed a fungal infection that I read about that people can get in their sinuses and took a brief round of Diflucan. That was the silver bullet for that issue, but during that time period I developed incredible fatigue and weight loss, I thought I was going to die. But, I figured it was due to the over use of antibiotics, so since 2011 Ive being countering with probiotics and a pretty substantial amount of vitamin supplements. I wouldnt call it Megadosing but quit a bit, I take a multi, extra 1000mg of C and a Zinc/Magnesium/Calcium. I also take a half of a Zyrtec once in the morning and once in the evening. Also, this might be significant. I was prescribed an awful drug called Effexor XR back in the late 90s for anxiety. I thought the side effects (which are substantial) might be contributing to my condition with the sinus infections so a began to wean off about 2009 and was off completely by 2013. Again, this is a terrible medication with horrendous side effects, especially when getting off, so the fact that I was on this stuff for so long might be an important factor. I do also take St. Johns Wart now because I was having severe panic attacks while coming off of the Effexor. So anyway, I did marginally better from about 2013 till about a couple years ago. I didnt feel great, but I was for the most part functional and felt like I was managing my symptoms and felt optimistic that I was on the mend. But, as I mentioned I started having panic attacks a few years ago, sever ones that put me in the hospital twice. My blood went cold, my hands and feet went freezing and then went numb, Id have a resting heart rate of about 220. these were terrifying, and they happened constantly though out the day. I was also having indigestion, so I had an endoscopy and it revealed that I had a bleeding ulcer, which the doctor thought might be contributing to the panic attacks. So, now Im managing my symptoms with Colonzopan, not much now, I was taking a lot but the panic attacks have subsided drasticlly so Im taking about .5 ml a day, mostly at night to help me sleep, and pantoprazole for the stomach, which Im trying to get off, Ive been on it for over a year. Ok, so thats the last 2 years or so, this is where Im at as of today. Every night my heart races at bed time which is when I take the Colonzopan. Im constantly bloated and belching, even with the Colonzopan I never get a full night sleep, averaging about 4 hours. Im up and down with all kinds of strange sensations, trouble breathing, hot/cold, stomach pains and nausea, panic attacks, racing heart, and other things that I cant even really describe. I urinate constantly, like every half hour. Ive stopped sweating all together, no matter how hot I am, even though Im usually not, Im usually freezing cold, but my skin feels really hot.

I wouldnt call it Megadosing but quit a bit, I take a multi, extra 1000mg of C and a Zinc/Magnesium/Calcium. I also take a half of a Zyrtec once in the morning and once in the evening. Also, this might be significant. I was prescribed an awful drug called Effexor XR back in the late 90s for anxiety. I thought the side effects (which are substantial) might be contributing to my condition with the sinus infections so a began to wean off about 2009 and was off completely by 2013. Again, this is a terrible medication with horrendous side effects, especially when getting off, so the fact that I was on this stuff for so long might be an important factor. I do also take St. Johns Wart now because I was having severe panic attacks while coming off of the Effexor. So anyway, I did marginally better from about 2013 till about a couple years ago. I didnt feel great, but I was for the most part functional and felt like I was managing my symptoms and felt optimistic that I was on the mend. But, as I mentioned I started having panic attacks a few years ago, sever ones that put me in the hospital twice. My blood went cold, my hands and feet went freezing and then went numb, Id have a resting heart rate of about 220. these were terrifying, and they happened constantly though out the day. I was also having indigestion, so I had an endoscopy and it revealed that I had a bleeding ulcer, which the doctor thought might be contributing to the panic attacks. So, now Im managing my symptoms with Colonzopan, not much now, I was taking a lot but the panic attacks have subsided drasticlly so Im taking about .5 ml a day, mostly at night to help me sleep, and pantoprazole for the stomach, which Im trying to get off, Ive been on it for over a year. Ok, so thats the last 2 years or so, this is where Im at as of today. Every night my heart races at bed time which is when I take the Colonzopan. Im constantly bloated and belching, even with the Colonzopan I never get a full night sleep, averaging about 4 hours. Im up and down with all kinds of strange sensations, trouble breathing, hot/cold, stomach pains and nausea, panic attacks, racing heart, and other things that I cant even really describe. I urinate constantly, like every half hour. Ive stopped sweating all together, no matter how hot I am, even though Im usually not, Im usually freezing cold, but my skin feels really hot. If you feel where I was laying down on the bed after I get up its like there was a heating pad there. Im obviously exhausted all day, I feel like Im going to throw up and I feel like Im going to collapse at any moment, Im dizzy, my eyes are beat red all day. Its amazing I havent been fired because they probably think Im smoking weed. My left front side hurts constantly, right about at the bottom of my rib cage. My stomach constantly hurts and I can basically only eat oatmeal, even that gives me uncontrollable loud belching. I usually feel the worst in the mornings and evenings, after lunch I usually feel a little better, but still not well, I just dont feel like Im going to pass out in the afternoon, usually. I have my not as bad days and my worse days. Anyway, Ive scoured the internet and asked all my various doctors and specialists about every possibility and know one seems to have any answers. I dont know if anyone will actually read this, I know theres a lot of these sorts of dialogues on the internet and I sure didnt get anywhere by asking for help from Dr. Hyman.

I posted earlier about hypokalemic periodic paralysis for my mom. A Neuromusclar Specialist in TX (Dr. Trivedi) says does not have it. Since then she has developed more symptoms. She still ""loses movement"" from her neck down but it she said this time it feels like her arms and legs are just too heavy to lift. She is completely exhausted and the littlest things wears her out (shower, bathroom) Some days she can walk with a cane, some days she has to use a Walker or a wheelchair. It seems like every day is different. She also has high blood pressure spikes ranging from (180-200/100-110) and heart rate spikes (100-125 bpm.) Shes had multiple tests done, MRIs, (cervical,thoracic and lumbar) CT scans, blood tests, chemical stress tests, thyroid function tests, 24 hour urine tests, and just recently had an EMG and a skin Biopsy does that did say she is positive for ""Small fiber polyneuropathy"". Some days she gets up to walk and can't take the first step, because her legs start to tremble, and she gets very shaky She says it's like her feet are glued to the floor. Then once she starts going, she either walks good, or walks very slow and shuffles. Sometimes sitting up her whole body starts to shake.. But all of her tests come out normal. Does anyone else have these symptoms? Can small fiber polyneuropathy cause all of this or do you think there is an underlying cause? Thank you. Liked by John, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

When we talked he was so honest. He asked me at first how do you want me to help you? Then he explained l really can't help.you with your autoimmune encephalitis/encephalopathy. He said l haven't been to training for this so this is not my speciality. I told him l understand l was just following up with you after my hospital admission..So we talked and the question l always wanted answered since had the liver disease if it was the same. He told me yes because the brain disease affect the liver if it get to that point and vice versa. He said not to many doctors don't know what to do or how to help the patient so he said you will have to liver with it. Which l refuse to believe. God has brought me out of a lot of problems with this illness and l know he will do the same. And when l went to see him l got dizzy and couldn't walk to get into the office. Thank God someone was going into the office. He said to me l thought you had drop your keys because l wasn't all the way down on the ground so after 4yrs since l was having ammonia issues a doctor finally gives you the information you thought you knew but all the doctors you went to couldn't tell you.

Then in the last three months my ammonia levels were elevated. I was taken off my lactulose and then put on it again. So the last reading was 58 and it was supposed to be no higher then 51. So my hematologist gives me another med with the lactulose. Zifaxan okay. The first evening everything was fine the next morning l took one and it was a disaster. I threw up couldnt get out of bed to go to the bathroom. I had to call my daughter. I continue to throw up. I never in my whole life threw up that much. I began throwing up bile.The next day l was so weak l could do hardly nothing. On Monday l went to my rheumatologist and l checked in and then had to fill out paperwork. As soon as l took it back l fell and l have a boot on from a fractured ankle. I was so embarrassed. The nurses helped me my mouth was bleeding. Now l was doing okay up until that point. My husband call my liver doctor and he tell us to come to the hospital. That wasnt what l wanted to do but my husband insisted because I was still throwing up and he thought it was my ammonia levels. Everything came back normal but they wanted me to be admitted. I told the er doctor l wanted to go home but she insisted and my husband wanted me to be checked out. Now she said my ammonia level was 22. 2 days l needed help just to go to the restroom. Then they ran a EEG it came back normal so the neurologist who l wanted to have nothing to do with but since l seen him last had to see him and the liver doctor both said everything checked out normal. Now they gave me Keppra IV and as soon as the nurse started as l felt it going through my body l felt my chest burning. Then my hands started to tremor. I tried to call the nurse but dropped the call light. I tried to press the call light on the bed but my hands were shaking so much l couldnt do it. Then l finally got a hold of the nurse now l dont know if it was a seizure or allergic reaction because my head began shaking and then l dont remember what happened next but when l woke up l was alright. Then the next day they gave me something and l was trying to text my daughter to bring me something for breakfast and l couldnt text her. When she came to bring me my breakfast she said l couldnt understand what you were texting me. So l had to call my husband to tell her and he said my speech was slurred. So we were all frustrated with the doctors because they kept saying everything was fine. I kept asking them about my ammonia levels and it was always normal. Just to find out the only checked it twice. Once before l was the admitted and again when l was discharged. I called my gastroenterologist at the mayo clinic because he said if this happens again come back to see him. Easy said then done 11hr driv ed but now l know its worth it. So we told him what happened and he said to ask the doctor to run a test because one of the shunts in my liver is leaking blood slowly so he wasnt very concerned right then to replace that shunt. So he told us they might not do it because l had gotten a second opinion and the mayo clinic found something. Now looking at my records the diagnoses that the mayo doctors ruled out l all of a sudden got it again. And now depression, and anxiety. And diagnoses l never knew l had now its TIA, a trophy and chronic microangiopathy and the mayo doctor ruled that out, frontotemporal degeneration after the l had a PET at the mayo clinic the results normal. A 4hr memory test at the mayo clinic and it was normal. My memory is absolutely fine and then they put neurological/behavioral symptoms. Oh and the doctor at the mayo clinic put possible autoimmune encephalitis they said on some sheets l had previous encephalitis and then ? encephalitis. I was diagnosed with encephalitis since 1997 at the hospital l worked for and yes at the beginning l had issues because I came of my medicine and also l was given so many meds when l was admitted to the hospital in 2014 thats when l had problems with my liver. Never had any problems with my liver nor nobody in my family. Then on my records they said l fell at my orthopedic instead of my rheumatologist. I had physical therapy come and it was a she and they said he. The doctors discharged me and then they said patient and family insisted to be discharged. Then when l showed the nurse how l was texting she tells me yes thats one of the symptoms. Then l am allergic to aspirin. I have been for years since about 2005 and you shouldnt take it if you have liver disease and what does the doctor tell the nurse, it okay for her to take it. I told her l bruise when l take aspirin and sure enough l had bruises. Thank God l have pictures of that. So all and all l just thank God for his grace because if not l probably be dead. So l am glad my gastroenterologist at the mayo clinic can see mr so if l need to have my shunt replaced l dont have to have it done here. Follow Report"

Then in the last three months my ammonia levels were elevated. I was taken off my lactulose and then put on it again. So the last reading was 58 and it was supposed to be no higher then 51. So my hematologist gives me another med with the lactulose. Zifaxan okay. The first evening everything was fine the next morning l took one and it was a disaster. I threw up couldnt get out of bed to go to the bathroom. I had to call my daughter. I continue to throw up. I never in my whole life threw up that much. I began throwing up bile.The next day l was so weak l could do hardly nothing. On Monday l went to my rheumatologist and l checked in and then had to fill out paperwork. As soon as l took it back l fell and l have a boot on from a fractured ankle. I was so embarrassed. The nurses helped me my mouth was bleeding. Now l was doing okay up until that point. My husband call my liver doctor and he tell us to come to the hospital. That wasnt what l wanted to do but my husband insisted because I was still throwing up and he thought it was my ammonia levels. Everything came back normal but they wanted me to be admitted. I told the er doctor l wanted to go home but she insisted and my husband wanted me to be checked out. Now she said my ammonia level was 22. 2 days l needed help just to go to the restroom. Then they ran a EEG it came back normal so the neurologist who l wanted to have nothing to do with but since l seen him last had to see him and the liver doctor both said everything checked out normal. Now they gave me Keppra IV and as soon as the nurse started as l felt it going through my body l felt my chest burning. Then my hands started to tremor. I tried to call the nurse but dropped the call light. I tried to press the call light on the bed but my hands were shaking so much l couldnt do it. Then l finally got a hold of the nurse now l dont know if it was a seizure or allergic reaction because my head began shaking and then l dont remember what happened next but when l woke up l was alright. Then the next day they gave me something and l was trying to text my daughter to bring me something for breakfast and l couldnt text her. When she came to bring me my breakfast she said l couldnt understand what you were texting me. So l had to call my husband to tell her and he said my speech was slurred. So we were all frustrated with the doctors because they kept saying everything was fine. I kept asking them about my ammonia levels and it was always normal. Just to find out the only checked it twice. Once before l was the admitted and again when l was discharged. I called my gastroenterologist at the mayo clinic because he said if this happens again come back to see him. Easy said then done 11hr driv ed but now l know its worth it. So we told him what happened and he said to ask the doctor to run a test because one of the shunts in my liver is leaking blood slowly so he wasnt very concerned right then to replace that shunt. So he told us they might not do it because l had gotten a second opinion and the mayo clinic found something. Now looking at my records the diagnoses that the mayo doctors ruled out l all of a sudden got it again. And now depression, and anxiety. And diagnoses l never knew l had now its TIA, a trophy and chronic microangiopathy and the mayo doctor ruled that out, frontotemporal degeneration after the l had a PET at the mayo clinic the results normal. A 4hr memory test at the mayo clinic and it was normal. My memory is absolutely fine and then they put neurological/behavioral symptoms. Oh and the doctor at the mayo clinic put possible autoimmune encephalitis they said on some sheets l had previous encephalitis and then ? encephalitis. I was diagnosed with encephalitis since 1997 at the hospital l worked for and yes at the beginning l had issues because I came of my medicine and also l was given so many meds when l was admitted to the hospital in 2014 thats when l had problems with my liver. Never had any problems with my liver nor nobody in my family. Then on my records they said l fell at my orthopedic instead of my rheumatologist.

I use unscented dove and Eurcerin lotion and it was working then I came of lactulose whi c have I was told I didnt need but thats for toxins and constipation. I take bathes twice a week and showers the other 5 days a week. Which l know might be to often but since I had autoimmune disease I just have to do this routine. I was given cream and that doesnt.help. And some doctors would say you are under stress but when you itch alright you would be under stress. Whats a person to do?

I thought I had Celiac disease but because I really don't like going to the doctors I avoided getting a for sure diagnosis and went gluten free. It's definitely helped with a lot of my symptoms. I got a blood test a few months ago for my doctor. My platelet count was extremely low as well as my iron and b12. She told me it looked like something autoimmune but I didn't know what that meant and she didn't press me to see other doctors about it. She also mentioned something seemed strange with my bone marrow. I didn't think anything of it. I thought the vitamins she suggested were all I needed. Well in the past couple months I've been in more pain than usual. Sharp chest pains, stiff and painful joints and I ache everyday. I've also had a persistent low grade fever. I get sharp pains in my hands too. I feel super weak and fatigued daily which I've always had bouts of but for awhile being gluten free helped. I can't keep up with my boyfriend when we go on walks anymore. My pain keeps me up at night. I have a few other symptoms but these are the most frustrating ones. Does anyone have any idea what this could be? I set up a doctors appointment but it'll be another month till they can see me. Liked by Gail, Alumna Mentor, lioness, joanelle77 Follow Report"

A couple years pass with this happening on and off, with aching joints now in my toes(and one toe going numb). I finally get a GP and he says its your b12 and sends me for a blood test which comes back fine. Then he sends me to check my vitamin D, my B6, my cholesterol, b12 again, iron, b12. Over the next year and a half he sent me for the same blood tests on a basis of every two months with NO deficiencies showing up. What DOES show up is high white blood cell levels indicating Im sick. One of these times I did end up having the flu. So he just assumes I have the flu all the time. Eventually, I noticed this pain has moved into my hands, and I get trigger finger in my right thumb, and left pinky. They stay like that for extended periods, the pain that started years ago continuing symmetrically. Then in 2015 I get TERRIBLE aching in my sacroiliac joints after an illness. I assumed the illness would pass and Id be fine. The illnss passed but the terrible joint pain never went away. I keep going to the doctor and he keeps sending me for b12 again. Now Im getting shooting sharp contractures in my ligaments in my legs that lock my legs up similarly to my fingers. A second doctor thought I had MS. No dice there. I dont match the fibro points and dont have muscle pain. No dice there.

Doctor just tells me its b12, sends me for more b12 teststhey come back fine(im even a bit high in all of these). So I seek a second opinion from a new GP who palpates my joints and says its probably RA and when I ask for a referral to a rheumatologist he refuses. Tells me to take a high dose of ibuprofenup to 3800mg just to get out of bed and walk to the door. He tells me to take photos and come back if it gets worse. Which I do.

Some time later, I notice Im getting low grade fevers, mouth sores that precede these flares(usually when the weather becomes cold/damp or hot/wet/humid. Rain) . At this point my joints are swelling up hot and red, and so hot I get heat rashes. Im so worn out and worn down I need a rollator, and sometimes a wheelchair for things like grocery shopping. Doctor just tells me its b12, sends me for more b12 teststhey come back fine(im even a bit high in all of these). So I seek a second opinion from a new GP who palpates my joints and says its probably RA and when I ask for a referral to a rheumatologist he refuses. Tells me to take a high dose of ibuprofenup to 3800mg just to get out of bed and walk to the door. He tells me to take photos and come back if it gets worse. Which I do. And he says, go to the hospital. So I go to the hospital. There, the ER doc asks me questions about my eyes(theyre hot and itchy), mouth sores, achey joints morning stiffnesssends me for Xrays which come back fineand puts me on a high dose of prednisone60 mg a day for two weeks. Finally for the first time in 3 and a hallf years I can walk again. My doctor saysits b12. I cant get anyone to refer me to a rheumatologist..so I reach out to the AS Society and they tell me my case is extremely concerning and to contact this list of doctors which I do. and I am only given a list of social workers at a drug clinic(what). So at this point, I now have what I think is the start of visible deformities and no treatment, and the NSAIDs are tearing up my already sensitive gut. I need to know Im not crazy and what I should do from here. I have yet another GP appt tomorrow and I am bringing in the photos which I will link below. Tell me what you think. The doctors here are telling me Im seronegative, and too young and I had one tell me this was a male disease(since it looked like ankylosing spondylitis). They say the medication is too serious. Come back if it gets worse(I come back and get sent home again without new labs(I stopped going to that GP)). Now that Im seeing a permanent change in my body and joints, I am worrying that they arent catching it in time and I am becoming more and more disabled. Follow Report"

One of these times I did end up having the flu. So he just assumes I have the flu all the time. Eventually, I noticed this pain has moved into my hands, and I get trigger finger in my right thumb, and left pinky. They stay like that for extended periods, the pain that started years ago continuing symmetrically. Then in 2015 I get TERRIBLE aching in my sacroiliac joints after an illness. I assumed the illness would pass and Id be fine. The illnss passed but the terrible joint pain never went away. I keep going to the doctor and he keeps sending me for b12 again. Now Im getting shooting sharp contractures in my ligaments in my legs that lock my legs up similarly to my fingers. A second doctor thought I had MS. No dice there. I dont match the fibro points and dont have muscle pain. No dice there. Some time later, I notice Im getting low grade fevers, mouth sores that precede these flares(usually when the weather becomes cold/damp or hot/wet/humid. Rain) . At this point my joints are swelling up hot and red, and so hot I get heat rashes. Im so worn out and worn down I need a rollator, and sometimes a wheelchair for things like grocery shopping. Doctor just tells me its b12, sends me for more b12 teststhey come back fine(im even a bit high in all of these). So I seek a second opinion from a new GP who palpates my joints and says its probably RA and when I ask for a referral to a rheumatologist he refuses. Tells me to take a high dose of ibuprofenup to 3800mg just to get out of bed and walk to the door. He tells me to take photos and come back if it gets worse. Which I do. And he says, go to the hospital. So I go to the hospital. There, the ER doc asks me questions about my eyes(theyre hot and itchy), mouth sores, achey joints morning stiffnesssends me for Xrays which come back fineand puts me on a high dose of prednisone60 mg a day for two weeks. Finally for the first time in 3 and a hallf years I can walk again. My doctor saysits b12. I cant get anyone to refer me to a rheumatologist..so I reach out to the AS Society and they tell me my case is extremely concerning and to contact this list of doctors which I do. and I am only given a list of social workers at a drug clinic(what). So at this point, I now have what I think is the start of visible deformities and no treatment, and the NSAIDs are tearing up my already sensitive gut. I need to know Im not crazy and what I should do from here. I have yet another GP appt tomorrow and I am bringing in the photos which I will link below. Tell me what you think. The doctors here are telling me Im seronegative, and too young and I had one tell me this was a male disease(since it looked like ankylosing spondylitis). They say the medication is too serious. Come back if it gets worse(I come back and get sent home again without new labs(I stopped going to that GP)). Now that Im seeing a permanent change in my body and joints, I am worrying that they arent catching it in time and I am becoming more and more disabled. Follow Report"

He will be totally fine, then either at night or when he wakes up in the morning , he is exhausted, very fatigued, will develop a headache, some joint pain, not as hungry but does eat and some digestional issues. Hard to concentrate. Basically lies on couch and watches tv. This thing lasts 4 to 5 days and after that he feels totally normal again. He is a kid who is home every day after school. He is not overtired. It is different. Its not Lyme, mono, blood counts are good etc. We are currently working with a pediatric rhumotologist at a very good hospital.

In fact, it was absolute agony tapering off, even slower than most do. Fast-forward again. A couple of months ago I had lab work done with my PCP which showed elevated ANA.

In fact, it was absolute agony tapering off, even slower than most do. Fast-forward again. A couple of months ago I had lab work done with my PCP which showed elevated ANA. ANA 1:640 Homogenous pattern. Another doctor repeated the labs and found the ANA to be the same, DRVVT was high, and showing Anti-Histone antibodies. That doctor said I have drug-induced Lupus and added that it's the Nexium I was on. He pretty much left it at that (was a note via their patient portal system) and didn't tell me what to expect, etc. He only said stop the Nexium, which I did.

I went online looking for information as to what ""DILE"" was exactly, and what I found confused me further.

The symptoms I have are not new but ones I've been dealing with for a few years.. only now worse. My liver specialist suspected something else was going on due to symptoms and the elevated Aldolase, which eventually went back into normal range after being on Prednisone a few weeks. My Ophthalmologist strongly suspects Sjogren's (a specialty he treats) due to my Schirmer's test having results of 1 and 2. I read about ""Seronegative Lupus,"" but I'm not sure I know what that is exactly or if it's my situation. All I know is I have a lot of horrible symptoms and can't even work now, or stand long enough to do dishes, etc. As an aside, I'm told I have Erythromelalgia which is very painful.

Losing hope.,"Hello everyone, Sorry for the long post, but I need help! Since July I have been so sick. Before I became sick, I was a healthy and active 24 year old woman who worked out in the gym everyday was a full time college student and worked part time. It all started with me becoming extremely weak, and every time I would stand up I would become very dizzy and my heart would race. I also was very nauseated, would break out into sweats, had body aches and sharp pains that felt like pins and needles sticking me all over. I thought maybe it was my blood sugar so I started to eat more before I went to the gym. When I was at work one day I felt like I was going to faint even though I had ate. I went to the ER and the doctor done a ton of blood work, CT scan of my head, EKG, and a chest x ray. Every thing came back normal except a little bacteria in my urine. The doctor said I was orthostatic because of my heart rate going up every time I would stand up so he gave me a couple bags of IV fluid and sent me home with an antibiotic. I thought my symptoms was due to the UTI, but I was wrong. I went to my family doctor and he done more blood work to check for other things like Lymes disease and mono. He also ordered an echo of my heart and for me to wear a heart monitor for a month. The echo and blood work came back clear, except it showed I had active mono. This would be the 3rd time Ive had mono in my life. Thinking thats why I was feeling this way I was relieved. I continued to wear the heart monitor over the month of August. My symptoms just kept getting worse. I went back to the ER again cause my heart rate was 150 and I couldnt even sleep. They done more blood work and tests, including an abdominal CT scan to make sure my spleen and liver wasnt enlarged due to mono. Everything came back clear. They gave me a coupe bags of IV fluid and some Ativan to help me sleep and sent me home. My symptoms only became worse. I couldnt sleep for days, my heart rate was going up to 200 bpm. My whole body was in so much pain and I began to have burning sensations. After my skin stopped burning, my whole body went numb. It started with my legs going numb and worked its way up my body. I also couldnt taste, smell, or see good. I hardly could put any weight on my legs. I literally had to hold to the walls to even get to the bathroom because I couldnt hardly walk. I thought I was going to die. My body felt like it was shutting down. I couldnt even eat because I was so nauseated. My doctor done more blood work to check for autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. He also checked my cortisol levels. Which all was normal. He ordered an MRI of my brain, and it came back normal. Gradually my sense of feeling, smelling, and taste came back. I still cant feel things like I used to. Nothing tastes the same either. Smells make me nauseated, even if its good smells. My personality has even changed. I cant hardly remember things anymore, concentrate or focus. I went from being a happy, social, and smart young person to someone who has so much anger over everything, and hates to be around people.I also have muscle twitches everywhere. My hands and fingers have constant tremors and even my tongue tremors when stuck out. I feel horrible and weak all the time that I cant hardly get out of the bed. My hair is also thinning really bad.

I may be in the wrong area of this group but I just dont know where to begin because my symptoms cover a multitude of areas. I have just about given up on the medical profession and am trying to at least get an answer or pointed in the right direction. They all say the same thing  not sure whats going on exactly, but it could be XYZ so heres some medicine to help. Nobody seems to be the right Dr to put everything together. Its getting very old Symptoms are: ** Blood work almost always shows extremely high sed rate, Thyroid Peroxidase, C Reactive. Tested for every disease under the sun and all negative (many more than once) ** Extreme sporadic joint pain  it travels, NEVER in the same spot, NEVER any swelling or redness at all, ongoing, over a year now, flares up in different locations in my body at different times. Burning and tingling sensations. Will wake me at night. Pain brings tears to my eyes. Nothing I take relieves it. **Double vision  regular basis, both eyes, ongoing 3 years (side by side double) **Spasming eye/seizures  sporadically throughout the day, right eye, ongoing 3 years **Significant ringing in the ears  regular basis, both ears, ongoing 3 years now ** hearing loss  minor, high frequency mostly **Fullness in the ear  regular basis, both ears, ongoing, 8 months now  (ear specialist said no fluid detected in the ear so not an infection, based on testing and other visits, not Menieres disease, attempted 3 Eply maneuvers, all unsuccessful) ** extreme vertigo  regular basis, ongoing 8 months now, on medication to help, when I am off the medication I throw up daily and walk into things. ** Weakness and fatigue moreso than the past ** tripping and falling occasionally (my poor bloody knees) ** severe random chest pain last year like I couldnt breathe . Went on for almost a week. Nothing showed up on any testing. Then it went away ** Bladder/incontinence issues  started about 9 months ago ** Sleep apnea  about a year now, occasionally Testing has included multiple blood draws. Everything they can think to test me for  all negative. The only things that strike out as odd are the high auto immune tests results Had an MRI on my brain and spine  brain showed multiple lesions, spine did not have any Had a spinal tap as well  results appear negative, but thats me deciphering the online write up.

The doctors dont really know and its so aggravating when you try to tell them and your family even sees it. Its been along journey but you try to be strong. And l had no problem in the last few months. Its a shame when people who have seen you fall or cant walk sometimes and you have to be helped even to the car and they always ask you are you alright and thats good. But your a person who doesnt want to be always seen that their is a health issue and the doctors you go to either see you as mental or your depressed or have anxiety. And maybe are depressed because of their mistrust of their patient. And l have told my general practice plenty of times about your problem just not to believe. And it caused you to have your cal torn a d 3 root canals from falling and encephalitis to just be told you had a 104 temp and told you had the flu and not being admitted to the hospital. And several times unconscious because you said your head hurts and to have headaches for days. And then have so many neurologist who think you want attention and you have worked for years and when you are sick you still come to work. And then told you that you were an exceptional employee and was told by Vic rehab when your trying to get a job. And went to college for 7 years and get a 2yr degree and the Lord didnt lett you give up and your director of the program say because of your disability you wont he able to work. And patients you worked with would cry or cant understand your finish with your clinical. And then the last 2 different neurologist one who said didnt l tell you why your coming l told you everything is alright and you were trying to get off medications and the other say if you go to the ma mayo clinic you will get the same diagnoses l told you because l am correct. And thats ego because he thinks he could have made a mistake and find out when he told you that you were ment and find out they misdiagnosed you. Then to have to go to the Mayo Clinic for thev4th time just to be told the liver procedure they did was incorrect and you were to be seen often to make sure everything is wrong with one shunt and have to have the procedure done for a second time. And now to think you dont have to have your lifeline anymore because your not falling. And then after doing home improvement and having fun because it was like the good old days and be able to talk to your neighbors and walk your dogs. And after 2yrs of driving you were released to go back and your memory was like before you started before you started with the beginning with your illness. To today when you were working with your husband and then to get dinner and your husband knows something is wrong and your talking slow to when you try to walk to the door and cant.. And if you tell your doctor he would say the same thing your depressed and want attention. Then you try to go to your bed and cant pet the dogs because they know something is wrong. And you get a package and cant open it because your hand wont stay still. And you cant turn over in your bed.and your nauseated. Just to want to tell your doctor whats going on but not being believed again. And l forgot to say to your husband have to walk you inside your house because he knows you fall because it has happened so many times before. And then after so many month not wearing your lifeline you have to wear it again because you might fall when your husband go to work or you try to go to the mail box. Because this has happened before and you dont want your neighbors to call th Dr. Because when you get there the psychiatrist comes in and ask you did you want to commit suicide. And now you are afraid to go to the hospital because you will be vomited to the mental hospital before because you where given medications you are allergic too. And you tell the nurses and doctors that a med they give you has an ingredient that you are allergic too. And doctors and nurses are so careful what they give you because they cant believe how many meds you are allergic too. Because when you were only allergic to 1 for years and now you are allergic to 13 or more because of them. And now you mistrust doctors or the ones you go to doesnt want to handle your case because you have been through to much or theres to many misdiagnosed or they dont know whats to do. So where0 do you go or their so many diagnoses it can be and they know one doctor have diagnosed you and they dont want to say anything otherwise when they know the diagnoses is wrong because of code of ethics instead of the patient deserve the best care. So when there are very few doctors who know about autoimmune encephalitis disease onlyv2 at the Mayo Clinic and you already been to one and she doesnt specialize in that and she says everything is normal and you have read a lot about the disease and the patients that all test are normal then you are right away given psychotic meds and turn over to a psychiatristor put in a mental hospital. And these same things has happened to others. So now l have not much trust in doctors in my state because their is only one doctor is suppose to be trained in autoimmune encephalitis disease and her reviews are horrible and you went to one neurologist at the Mayo Clinic and dontvthink you can go to another because this has happened before so now l have to travel to Duke hospital if l want to be treated and this isnt easy and very costly and you can lose everything you worked for just to get help so l know their are many who have gone through the same thing because thats the world we live in so thats why you have to keep praying because doctors are only human and dont want to say l just dont know. And when you treat one person its not the same way for the other. And instead of of having patients go through so much and their bills are climbing just try and help and if you cant send them to someone who might know about their medical.condition instead of causing the patient so much headache and so much mistrust Follow Report

On some days, I feel that she is getting better (though its difficult to measure, and the more deeply-rooted issues appear to still be), on others Im concerned that her state may be affecting her endocrine system and could affect her neurological health and thus bodys ability to self-heal and her mental health and hence her willingness to self-heal. She has had a number of problems with recurrent infections (throat, constant phlegm etc.) throughout her life as well as sensitivities to a variety of foods as well as environmental factors  cant drink cold liquids, seems to have a strong response to sunshine (nb oddly this is not just light, she is fine indoors and with artifical lighting, it only seems to be a problem outdoors and is a more recent development, last year or so). She is unable to work and increasingly rarely goes outside, but Im fairly certain that due to the presence of infected phlegm and certain other concrete symptoms (a feeling of heaviness like stones on her chest and occasionally on her sinuses) that the problem is not neurological in origin, although some symptoms may be the result of consequent neurological issues. She has numbness down side of her body sometimes, and a lot of trouble sleeping (she wakes up frequently at night to pee, each time she passes a lot of urine so it doesnt seem to be anxiety-related). The problem is that she is now very reluctant to travel to the doctors because a) she finds it very tiring b) she believes their actions/misdiagnoses in the past have made her situation worse c) she thinks they are only treating the superfices and not the root cause, and I think she has a strong case for this. When she suffered from acne some time ago (about 5 years), she was on a course of antibiotics that made her temporarily feel better (and helped clear the acne up), but then got much worse soon after. I imagine this could be something to do with not being advised to take the right probiotics, or a badly managed regime generally (I dont know the details). Her fairly reasonable interpretation is that she essentially nuked (or imbalanced) her gut fauna leading to a whole host of other problems including infections and subsequent anxiety. Trips to the doctor resulted in her being put on antidepressants (sertraline, cant remember the initial dosage but I believe it was less than 100mg), which helped her enough to just about be able to work (which seems to be the main aim of antidepressants) but led to her feeling like she was in a kind of artificial bubble. The positive feelings did not feel real, and meanwhile the other problems suggestive of infection worsened. Doctors, apparently, could never find signs of infection though. She weaned herself off antidepressants over a course of about 6 months, slightly reducing the dose at regular intervals until she hit 0 around 18 months ago. About 6 months prior (around the same time she tried cutting down) she had begun a Candida diet too, as a number of tests had suggested she had overgrowth. I was skeptical of a lot of these tests (as I still am to a lesser degree) but thought it was worth trying with a pinch of salt as Id also become rather skeptical of and disillusioned with mainstream medicine, or at least that I had experienced (in addition to the above, I had been prescribed treatments for migraines and anxiety which turned out to be manageable purely by introducing a more restricted diet). A few months later (approximately a year to the day) her period stopped, which may have been because her weight was quite low, or could have been because of stress. A lot of the controversial buzz theories  adrenal fatigue etc.  came into diagnosis, and why not? We had yet to find a convincing theory elsewhere, even if this one was ambiguous  at least the treatment seemed to be largely dietary. Regarding the periods, she was referred to a gynaecologist who organised a few tests and bone scans. The latter found that her bone density was slightly low, the former found that she had low estrogen and so was prescribed Femoston Conti. She has not taken these for two reasons a) she does not feel her system is strong enough (and hence is afraid of a negative reaction, which is perfectly understandable given her hypersensitivity, even if it might not be the right decision objectively) b) she believes that the treatment isnt missing the root of the issue. We have another gynaecologist appointment in January where well be able to discuss this in greater depth (the one in May seemed to serve the dual purpose of being instruction to two trainee doctors, thus we didnt really feel able to make our points and enter into discussion as wed have liked to). The last six months or so have been relatively quiet and its difficult to tell whether shes making any improvement based on her diet regime (pretty much a paleo/FODMAPs with certain irritants excluding), at least no new symptoms have emerged. To summarise the main current symptoms (in approximate order of severity as I see it): * Insomnia  or, rather, broken sleep due to the need to urinate large amounts relatively frequently resulting in around 4 or 5 hours actual sleep in 8 or 9 hours bedtime. * Weight loss  She had dropped from around 52kg to around 45kg over the past 15 months or so (the degree drop in itself isnt worrying, but her present BMI is  late teens). * Constipation  she eats quite a healthy amount (no sugars though) as she doesnt want to lose any more weight. This, it seems to me coupled with the general sluggishness and malabsorption of her system, might lead to her being backed up, and she often eats despite having no appetite. She reports that she feels irritable/depressed often, and feels much better when she managed to offload cargo, leading her to feel that toxins are causing her to feel in such a way, though this may be rather naive/simplistic (though my skeptical position works both ways). * Sensitivity to smells  notably cleaning products and foods with antibacterial properties (onion, garlic, spices etc.)  certain foods, and sunshine. * Difficulty breathing  at times she struggles to get full breaths in, especially when/after eating. * Mood problems  she often feels very down and can become anxious (though not acutely), or argumentative (more acutely) as a consequence of the above symptoms. This is compounded by a sense of hopelessness that she might ever recover. * General aches and pains  particularly in her back. * Excessive mucous creation  especially in the morning, she often has to hack up phlegm. It is interesting to note that her acne has almost completely cleared up since she started her diet, and other issues which were more severe in the past seem less so now, though its important to recognise that shes also cut out a number of the known irritants. Ill finish by adding that she has done a number of tests through a range of providers from those supposedly less reputable (Cambridge Nutrition) to those who are slightly more reputable (Cyrex, Genova, Acumen), at least among those who give credence to any of such services. The tests which she has taken include: * Cyrex Array 12  pathogen associated immunity screening, which suggests that she has excessive (though not necessarily to the point of acute infection) numbers of acinobacter, strepococcus mutans, citrullinated EBV, klebsiella, and babesia + ehrlichia + bartonella (or presumably just one of these?). We only got the results of this test last week, so were still processing what exactly it means. * DNA adducts  notably some type of benzyl/benzoate and parabens, which might explain the sensitivity to chemicals (and subsequent moodiness)? * IgG tests  I realise the validity of these is still under question, but she has nonetheless taken them and they do generally match with her personal feeling of what she has problems with (with a couple of oddities), and also seem to have slightly improved in the 2017 result compared to the 2016 one. Particularly re the pathogen test, it might be of use to know that she grew up on a farm (relevant assuming obviously that our hypothesis about the infections largely stemming from the antibiotic treatment is incorrect) and did not always receive cutting edge medical treatment for e.g. being bitten by a stray cat when she was young, and also lived in a house which had damp problems with people who had/have their own health problems (some of her fathers are very similar, in fact). There are more tests (and were planning to take Cyrexs Array 5  autoimmune issues), but I realise Im writing a plea for help, not a book, so Ill stop there. Obviously my concern is that I want to help her get better, and thus am seeking open-minded advice of a holistic nature, at the risk of coming across a bit alternative (my point is that consideration of the whole situation is important, rather than narrowing in lazily on certain details, as weve felt people have in the past). Any advice on a direction to take, preferably accompanied by a convincing-yet-sympathetic argument (a difficult ask, admittedly), would be much appreciated. I realise that some of the narrative we have constructed may be contradictory (i.e. potential origins suggested at different times), but Im just trying to be as objective and open-minded as possible.

She has had a number of problems with recurrent infections (throat, constant phlegm etc.) throughout her life as well as sensitivities to a variety of foods as well as environmental factors  cant drink cold liquids, seems to have a strong response to sunshine (nb oddly this is not just light, she is fine indoors and with artifical lighting, it only seems to be a problem outdoors and is a more recent development, last year or so). She is unable to work and increasingly rarely goes outside, but Im fairly certain that due to the presence of infected phlegm and certain other concrete symptoms (a feeling of heaviness like stones on her chest and occasionally on her sinuses) that the problem is not neurological in origin, although some symptoms may be the result of consequent neurological issues. She has numbness down side of her body sometimes, and a lot of trouble sleeping (she wakes up frequently at night to pee, each time she passes a lot of urine so it doesnt seem to be anxiety-related). The problem is that she is now very reluctant to travel to the doctors because a) she finds it very tiring b) she believes their actions/misdiagnoses in the past have made her situation worse c) she thinks they are only treating the superfices and not the root cause, and I think she has a strong case for this. When she suffered from acne some time ago (about 5 years), she was on a course of antibiotics that made her temporarily feel better (and helped clear the acne up), but then got much worse soon after. I imagine this could be something to do with not being advised to take the right probiotics, or a badly managed regime generally (I dont know the details). Her fairly reasonable interpretation is that she essentially nuked (or imbalanced) her gut fauna leading to a whole host of other problems including infections and subsequent anxiety. Trips to the doctor resulted in her being put on antidepressants (sertraline, cant remember the initial dosage but I believe it was less than 100mg), which helped her enough to just about be able to work (which seems to be the main aim of antidepressants) but led to her feeling like she was in a kind of artificial bubble. The positive feelings did not feel real, and meanwhile the other problems suggestive of infection worsened. Doctors, apparently, could never find signs of infection though. She weaned herself off antidepressants over a course of about 6 months, slightly reducing the dose at regular intervals until she hit 0 around 18 months ago. About 6 months prior (around the same time she tried cutting down) she had begun a Candida diet too, as a number of tests had suggested she had overgrowth. I was skeptical of a lot of these tests (as I still am to a lesser degree) but thought it was worth trying with a pinch of salt as Id also become rather skeptical of and disillusioned with mainstream medicine, or at least that I had experienced (in addition to the above, I had been prescribed treatments for migraines and anxiety which turned out to be manageable purely by introducing a more restricted diet). A few months later (approximately a year to the day) her period stopped, which may have been because her weight was quite low, or could have been because of stress. A lot of the controversial buzz theories  adrenal fatigue etc.  came into diagnosis, and why not? We had yet to find a convincing theory elsewhere, even if this one was ambiguous  at least the treatment seemed to be largely dietary. Regarding the periods, she was referred to a gynaecologist who organised a few tests and bone scans. The latter found that her bone density was slightly low, the former found that she had low estrogen and so was prescribed Femoston Conti. She has not taken these for two reasons a) she does not feel her system is strong enough (and hence is afraid of a negative reaction, which is perfectly understandable given her hypersensitivity, even if it might not be the right decision objectively) b) she believes that the treatment isnt missing the root of the issue. We have another gynaecologist appointment in January where well be able to discuss this in greater depth (the one in May seemed to serve the dual purpose of being instruction to two trainee doctors, thus we didnt really feel able to make our points and enter into discussion as wed have liked to). The last six months or so have been relatively quiet and its difficult to tell whether shes making any improvement based on her diet regime (pretty much a paleo/FODMAPs with certain irritants excluding), at least no new symptoms have emerged. To summarise the main current symptoms (in approximate order of severity as I see it): * Insomnia  or, rather, broken sleep due to the need to urinate large amounts relatively frequently resulting in around 4 or 5 hours actual sleep in 8 or 9 hours bedtime. * Weight loss  She had dropped from around 52kg to around 45kg over the past 15 months or so (the degree drop in itself isnt worrying, but her present BMI is  late teens). * Constipation  she eats quite a healthy amount (no sugars though) as she doesnt want to lose any more weight. This, it seems to me coupled with the general sluggishness and malabsorption of her system, might lead to her being backed up, and she often eats despite having no appetite. She reports that she feels irritable/depressed often, and feels much better when she managed to offload cargo, leading her to feel that toxins are causing her to feel in such a way, though this may be rather naive/simplistic (though my skeptical position works both ways). * Sensitivity to smells  notably cleaning products and foods with antibacterial properties (onion, garlic, spices etc.)  certain foods, and sunshine. * Difficulty breathing  at times she struggles to get full breaths in, especially when/after eating. * Mood problems  she often feels very down and can become anxious (though not acutely), or argumentative (more acutely) as a consequence of the above symptoms. This is compounded by a sense of hopelessness that she might ever recover. * General aches and pains  particularly in her back. * Excessive mucous creation  especially in the morning, she often has to hack up phlegm. It is interesting to note that her acne has almost completely cleared up since she started her diet, and other issues which were more severe in the past seem less so now, though its important to recognise that shes also cut out a number of the known irritants. Ill finish by adding that she has done a number of tests through a range of providers from those supposedly less reputable (Cambridge Nutrition) to those who are slightly more reputable (Cyrex, Genova, Acumen), at least among those who give credence to any of such services. The tests which she has taken include: * Cyrex Array 12  pathogen associated immunity screening, which suggests that she has excessive (though not necessarily to the point of acute infection) numbers of acinobacter, strepococcus mutans, citrullinated EBV, klebsiella, and babesia + ehrlichia + bartonella (or presumably just one of these?). We only got the results of this test last week, so were still processing what exactly it means. * DNA adducts  notably some type of benzyl/benzoate and parabens, which might explain the sensitivity to chemicals (and subsequent moodiness)? * IgG tests  I realise the validity of these is still under question, but she has nonetheless taken them and they do generally match with her personal feeling of what she has problems with (with a couple of oddities), and also seem to have slightly improved in the 2017 result compared to the 2016 one. Particularly re the pathogen test, it might be of use to know that she grew up on a farm (relevant assuming obviously that our hypothesis about the infections largely stemming from the antibiotic treatment is incorrect) and did not always receive cutting edge medical treatment for e.g. being bitten by a stray cat when she was young, and also lived in a house which had damp problems with people who had/have their own health problems (some of her fathers are very similar, in fact). There are more tests (and were planning to take Cyrexs Array 5  autoimmune issues), but I realise Im writing a plea for help, not a book, so Ill stop there. Obviously my concern is that I want to help her get better, and thus am seeking open-minded advice of a holistic nature, at the risk of coming across a bit alternative (my point is that consideration of the whole situation is important, rather than narrowing in lazily on certain details, as weve felt people have in the past). Any advice on a direction to take, preferably accompanied by a convincing-yet-sympathetic argument (a difficult ask, admittedly), would be much appreciated. I realise that some of the narrative we have constructed may be contradictory (i.e. potential origins suggested at different times), but Im just trying to be as objective and open-minded as possible.

To summarise the main current symptoms (in approximate order of severity as I see it): * Insomnia  or, rather, broken sleep due to the need to urinate large amounts relatively frequently resulting in around 4 or 5 hours actual sleep in 8 or 9 hours bedtime. * Weight loss  She had dropped from around 52kg to around 45kg over the past 15 months or so (the degree drop in itself isnt worrying, but her present BMI is  late teens). * Constipation  she eats quite a healthy amount (no sugars though) as she doesnt want to lose any more weight. This, it seems to me coupled with the general sluggishness and malabsorption of her system, might lead to her being backed up, and she often eats despite having no appetite. She reports that she feels irritable/depressed often, and feels much better when she managed to offload cargo, leading her to feel that toxins are causing her to feel in such a way, though this may be rather naive/simplistic (though my skeptical position works both ways). * Sensitivity to smells  notably cleaning products and foods with antibacterial properties (onion, garlic, spices etc.)  certain foods, and sunshine. * Difficulty breathing  at times she struggles to get full breaths in, especially when/after eating. * Mood problems  she often feels very down and can become anxious (though not acutely), or argumentative (more acutely) as a consequence of the above symptoms. This is compounded by a sense of hopelessness that she might ever recover. * General aches and pains  particularly in her back. * Excessive mucous creation  especially in the morning, she often has to hack up phlegm. It is interesting to note that her acne has almost completely cleared up since she started her diet, and other issues which were more severe in the past seem less so now, though its important to recognise that shes also cut out a number of the known irritants. Ill finish by adding that she has done a number of tests through a range of providers from those supposedly less reputable (Cambridge Nutrition) to those who are slightly more reputable (Cyrex, Genova, Acumen), at least among those who give credence to any of such services. The tests which she has taken include: * Cyrex Array 12  pathogen associated immunity screening, which suggests that she has excessive (though not necessarily to the point of acute infection) numbers of acinobacter, strepococcus mutans, citrullinated EBV, klebsiella, and babesia + ehrlichia + bartonella (or presumably just one of these?). We only got the results of this test last week, so were still processing what exactly it means. * DNA adducts  notably some type of benzyl/benzoate and parabens, which might explain the sensitivity to chemicals (and subsequent moodiness)? * IgG tests  I realise the validity of these is still under question, but she has nonetheless taken them and they do generally match with her personal feeling of what she has problems with (with a couple of oddities), and also seem to have slightly improved in the 2017 result compared to the 2016 one. Particularly re the pathogen test, it might be of use to know that she grew up on a farm (relevant assuming obviously that our hypothesis about the infections largely stemming from the antibiotic treatment is incorrect) and did not always receive cutting edge medical treatment for e.g. being bitten by a stray cat when she was young, and also lived in a house which had damp problems with people who had/have their own health problems (some of her fathers are very similar, in fact). There are more tests (and were planning to take Cyrexs Array 5  autoimmune issues), but I realise Im writing a plea for help, not a book, so Ill stop there. Obviously my concern is that I want to help her get better, and thus am seeking open-minded advice of a holistic nature, at the risk of coming across a bit alternative (my point is that consideration of the whole situation is important, rather than narrowing in lazily on certain details, as weve felt people have in the past). Any advice on a direction to take, preferably accompanied by a convincing-yet-sympathetic argument (a difficult ask, admittedly), would be much appreciated. I realise that some of the narrative we have constructed may be contradictory (i.e. potential origins suggested at different times), but Im just trying to be as objective and open-minded as possible.

On some days, I feel that she is getting better (though its difficult to measure, and the more deeply-rooted issues appear to still be), on others Im concerned that her state may be affecting her endocrine system and could affect her neurological health and thus bodys ability to self-heal and her mental health and hence her willingness to self-heal. She has had a number of problems with recurrent infections (throat, constant phlegm etc.) throughout her life as well as sensitivities to a variety of foods as well as environmental factors  cant drink cold liquids, seems to have a strong response to sunshine (nb oddly this is not just light, she is fine indoors and with artifical lighting, it only seems to be a problem outdoors and is a more recent development, last year or so). She is unable to work and increasingly rarely goes outside, but Im fairly certain that due to the presence of infected phlegm and certain other concrete symptoms (a feeling of heaviness like stones on her chest and occasionally on her sinuses) that the problem is not neurological in origin, although some symptoms may be the result of consequent neurological issues. She has numbness down side of her body sometimes, and a lot of trouble sleeping (she wakes up frequently at night to pee, each time she passes a lot of urine so it doesnt seem to be anxiety-related). The problem is that she is now very reluctant to travel to the doctors because a) she finds it very tiring b) she believes their actions/misdiagnoses in the past have made her situation worse c) she thinks they are only treating the superfices and not the root cause, and I think she has a strong case for this. When she suffered from acne some time ago (about 5 years), she was on a course of antibiotics that made her temporarily feel better (and helped clear the acne up), but then got much worse soon after. I imagine this could be something to do with not being advised to take the right probiotics, or a badly managed regime generally (I dont know the details). Her fairly reasonable interpretation is that she essentially nuked (or imbalanced) her gut fauna leading to a whole host of other problems including infections and subsequent anxiety. Trips to the doctor resulted in her being put on antidepressants (sertraline, cant remember the initial dosage but I believe it was less than 100mg), which helped her enough to just about be able to work (which seems to be the main aim of antidepressants) but led to her feeling like she was in a kind of artificial bubble. The positive feelings did not feel real, and meanwhile the other problems suggestive of infection worsened. Doctors, apparently, could never find signs of infection though. She weaned herself off antidepressants over a course of about 6 months, slightly reducing the dose at regular intervals until she hit 0 around 18 months ago. About 6 months prior (around the same time she tried cutting down) she had begun a Candida diet too, as a number of tests had suggested she had overgrowth. I was skeptical of a lot of these tests (as I still am to a lesser degree) but thought it was worth trying with a pinch of salt as Id also become rather skeptical of and disillusioned with mainstream medicine, or at least that I had experienced (in addition to the above, I had been prescribed treatments for migraines and anxiety which turned out to be manageable purely by introducing a more restricted diet). A few months later (approximately a year to the day) her period stopped, which may have been because her weight was quite low, or could have been because of stress. A lot of the controversial buzz theories  adrenal fatigue etc.  came into diagnosis, and why not? We had yet to find a convincing theory elsewhere, even if this one was ambiguous  at least the treatment seemed to be largely dietary. Regarding the periods, she was referred to a gynaecologist who organised a few tests and bone scans. The latter found that her bone density was slightly low, the former found that she had low estrogen and so was prescribed Femoston Conti. She has not taken these for two reasons a) she does not feel her system is strong enough (and hence is afraid of a negative reaction, which is perfectly understandable given her hypersensitivity, even if it might not be the right decision objectively) b) she believes that the treatment isnt missing the root of the issue.

Testing included liver biopsy, CT abdomen, body scan, MRI of brain, lumbar puncture, echo cardiogram, EGD, colonoscopy, repetitive antibiotics, daily lab work, including testing for ebstein barr and lyme disease. Reports show that she has an elevated ANA, and they also sent her labs to a different state for a specialized autoimmune testing, in which we havent received results. All tests in hospital were negative for any infections, and just show her elevations in regards to her autoimmune disorder. The physicians also evaluated specifically her previous wreck which left a fractured lumbar and broken tooth, along with a cervical surgery she had 20 years ago, just to rule out infection that never healed. The rheumatologist that saw her in hospital brings up the concern that she was misdiagnosed with Behcets and feels the Remicade infusion may have caused some unnecessary additional autoimmune disease, on top of the primary one. Which leaves her with an undiagnosis currently. She was finally diagnosed with Fever of Unknown Origin, and released from the hospital after 22 days of admission and daily testing, with directions to take doxycycline po, ibuprofen/tylenol interchangeably with increase in fluids and follow up appointments with internal medicine, rheumatologist, and hepatologist. Within the last 3 days of non-hospitalization, she has spiked fevers in the 102s daily, with tylenol/ibuprofen around the clock. She battles fatigue, fever, weight loss (30 ish lbs), nausea, vomiting, weakness, migraines, total body pain. My father is setting up her with a holistic physician as a last ditch effort for some relief. Yet, as a emergency nurse, I know the symptoms she has warrants an emergency visit, yet she was released with all necessary testing negative, with the exception of elevated labs in regards to her autoimmune disorder. Although fever of unknown origin may be a true diagnosis, I feel like there is possibly something that we are missing. Can anyone recommend what steps/testing/physician/clinic we should consider next? Any traveling needed is absolutely an option, as we will travel worldwide to figure this out for her to live a normalized life. Liked by John, Volunteer Mentor, taterjoy Follow Report"
548,C0023890,Liver Cirrhosis,C0013604,Edema,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/complex-health-issues/,Complex Health issues,"My son was born with transposition of the greater arteries among other heart defects, 33 years ago. He had a banding procedure at birth to slow the blood going into his heart and they patched a hole in his heart. At the age of 4, he was old enough to have a major heart surgery performed called a Modified Fontan. His heart basically works with 2 chambers. He did well until he was 18 and had Afib. He has had a pacemaker since 18 and is on his second one about to get another. He will some day need a heart transplant. As he got older he started getting really bad episodes of gout in his toes, ankles, and knees. He has been told he has arthritis in his back. He has had other problems along the way such as a hernia, dead bone in his knee, teeth implants etc. Last year he had a terrible case of MRSA. He was hospitalized and it took 3-4 tries to get the right drug cocktail to take out this MRSA. They sent him home on IV meds. A week later he stopped getting better and got put back in the hospital for another round of different drugs and sent home again on IV meds, which, thankfully, this time worked. When he was in the hospital with MRSA, they did a CT scan on him (he cannot have an MRI due to his pacemaker), they found a spot on his kidney and said it might be cancer but it was very small and they wanted him to recover from the MRSA. Six months post MRSA, he had 2 biopsies done on his kidney (the first was inconclusive). The second came back as cancer. He just had surgery which froze the cancer and surrounding area. The reason they chose to freeze it is because he is on Xaralto, a blood thinner for his heart. He came home from surgery and his stomach was quite swollen so after 24 hours they told us to come back into ER. We came back to the hospital and they did another CT scan to make sure there was no internal bleeding. They determined the swelling was normal and they were not concerned. During this visit, they noticed his eyes were yellow so they did a bilirubin test which was at a 6, very high. They said that they looked at other bilirubin tests done on him in the past and it always trended high, like around 3 and they figured that the stress from the surgery caused it to jump but they wanted to keep him for observation and run another bilirubin test the next day and see if it dropped. The next day they drew blood and ran more tests on it including bilirubin and hepatitis. They also did a CT scan of his liver and spleen. The results of the blood test were that his bilirubin dropped to 4.9. The CT scan showed some noduality or cirrhosis of the liver and an enlarged spleen. They questioned him about how much he drank and told him to stop drinking. For the record, he is not a big drinker but yes, he does drink. They indicated that the first thing to look at was if the pressure in his heart was off and thus affecting his liver. So he needs to make a cardiology appointment. He also has an appointment with a gastroentomologist (sorry about the spelling). He cannot see the gastro dr for 3 months. While he was in the hospital, I asked the urologist if there was a link between the mrsa, the gout and the kidney cancer. She said she did not know but didnt think so.. that was her answer. She said she would look into it. I asked her why he was not seeing a kidney doctor (nephrologist). She said it was because they work with the function of the kidney and his kidneys are working fine. I disagreed and said they are not working fine because in my mind 1. he just had cancer removed from one and 2. his reoccurring viscious gout episodes. Gout is uric acid  produced by your kidneys  that your body does not get rid of properly. Believe it or not, the urologist came back into the room and said she googled the relationship between gout, kidney function and kidney cancer and couldnt find anything that related them. So I am posting this in the autoimmune section, the heart section and the cancer section of this forum as I have no idea where to start to try and help my son. I have concerns that Xarelto is causing problems, or maybe the Sotalol or Valsartan he takes for his heart. He had a rheumatologist to handle the gout but after the mrsa it was rampant in his body and the steroids, allopurinol and other drugs he normally got from his rheumatologist he could not get without being seen and appointments for a rheumatologist are months out so he ended up in urgent care to get the steroids he needed to calm the gout down. I would like all his doctors to talk to one another and try to learn what is causing all this to happen in his body. I would like his doctors to explain why these things are not related in a logical way. I would like his doctors to take an interest in him and his unique situation and care enough to investigate it further. Ironically my son was a big fan of the show House. He could really use a doctor like that right now. Is there any guidance I can get from this forum? Follow Report"

He looked over my past blood results and examined me. While he did agree with the fibromylagia diagnosis from my second opinion. He said my positive ana was low (1:160 homogeneous) so it could be a false positive. He was also surprised that no one has repeated the blood test. We both agree that it would be better to have fibro instead of an inflammatory issue. Obviously not having anything at all would be great. He does want me to retake the ana and some other labs. He did mention a blood test that takes about 2 weeks to get answers but it further studies the blood work to see if it in inflammatory at all. He was very personable and explained everything to me in a way that no other doctor has so far. I am patiently awaiting the blood test results. He also said that my tonsils are huge. He feels that might be a cause of my exhaustion and maybe even some of the pain. He said lack of sleep makes pain worse. Has anyone ever heard of this? Follow Report

I wish to learn from others experiences if something similar as my symptoms experienced and what to do here on. I am 39, asian, usually careless, smoker who has not had a PCP untill last year. Since early last year, I have been having fevers every 6-8 weeks that were 4-5 days long, usually 99-101, with some late nights as high as 104F. Fevers usually were triggered if consumed chilly cold drinks/coffee/beer etc. Towards end I get painful throat. I have had no other symptoms at all. No headache, cough, abdominal pain, any other pain at all. I have seen couple PCPs since then and each one wrote some bloodwork where everything looked ok.No thyroid. One said high WBC count. But they have been unable to tell why this happens.Since this year started, frequency has gone up to once every 2-3 weeks and even when no fever by thermometer, I feel warm inside with bodyache.Not sure what to do other than finding yet another doc. I wish I knew what specialist to see other than a fever doctor?? Liked by John, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

They wanted me to see a GI for my shunts, which is hepatic fisular portal vein. And when l walk l get so tired and hurting for trying. So you would think they would aspirate some of the fluids to have some relief. I really think its ascities but who would think you would have to be the doctor. I have gained 6lbs in one month. So before l can go back to the Mayo Clinic will be in Nov and to see a new liver doctor mines recommended.it is also Nov. Where can you actually go to get some relief.

I began to think about Job how he went through and God brought him through better than before. There was something just not right. I just couldnt believe all those diagnoses. I was unconscious so many times. I was falling a lot and l was told it was only syncope and that was true but why? I tore my cal from all those falls. And when l was admitted in the hospital in 2014, l never had any of these diagnoses before. Oh an l forgot encephalitis, autoimmune encephalitis, encephalopathy. I never even heard of all these diagnoses. So in 2014. I was on antidepressants and thats what they thought l was allergic too. But it was the goodness of God that I am off of that. Now when l was in the hospital l was only allergic to codeine now l cant even count how many drugs l am allergic too. When l see the doctors they are afraid to give medicines. Then l guess l wasnt getting any better on the hospital so they wanted to put me in a nursing home. But God didnt allow that to happen l got better. So then my new neurologist said l had conversion disorder. That was the last straw. So deep down inside it just didnt sound right or felt right that l had all these problems. So l went to the Mayo clinic and my internal medicine doctor looked at all my records and she said you really been through it. She said you dont have biplor or schizophrenia. She said l worked with patients who had mental illness and your not one of them. Well that was the beginning of the blessing. She set me up with all the doctors that l needed to confirm the diagnoses. Before they couldnt draw blood it was with such difficulty from so much scare tissue. The phlebotomist was able to get 19 values of blood in one stick. Then l had to see the neurologist. She said l have been a neurologist for along time. But l said in my mind not as long as God. So she told me if everything comes back normal, l will have to send you to behavioral therapy. Well everything came back normal but my Ana was still high. So they wanted me to have a PET test for dementia. And that came back normal. She was going to send me to see psychiatrist lone saw two. The last on was a Bahavorial psychiatrist. She cancelled that appointment. When l saw the cardiologist. I didnt have those problems. He told me you have high blood pressure that uncontrolled but it in controlled now. Then l was diagnoses previously for dyephesia, firbromuscular , false. Seizures? No dementia, no me, no Parkinson disease, COPD. So the other 3 appointments she cancelled. She told d me you were misdiagnosed. Praise God. She said you had encephalitis and in 2014 they said it was autoimmune encephalitis, encephalopathy?. Yes l do have elevated ammonia, asthma instead of COPD and when l asked how l got the elevated ammonia. My previous gasterentogist said it was from medicine l was taking for all these years. Now that just me not everyone else so definitely dont think that for you. So the vascular doctor said one of the shunt are open and they did the procedure wrong. Isnt that something so when l was falling and losing consciousness, hallucinating, and not acting like myself. And they said the problem was the elevated ammonia because that can happen and it can sometimes your levels can fluctuate so now that one shunt that open we have to fix it.

I asked my Dr. about pain medication, she sent me to the Rheumatologist, who had an XRay of my back done, and I have bone spurs on all my lower vertebra. I wonder if anyone else in this discussion group has experienced bone spurs, and what might have helped. I take a lot of meds to sleep, but I dont have anything for pain.

I was in intensive care unit and they were giving me alot of meds because they didnt know what was happening. I was unconscious and combative and l was told had seizures and convulsions. So l thought when l came home my skin was dry and l was scratching because of that, so thats was why l was going to the dermatologist and also the soap and lotions l was using. So she gave me a ointment and she had me to change my soap.So after that l changed lotions because my skin was so dry. Now l have been using eurserin for a few years and l still have no problem with dryness. But now l notice these scratches. When l went to the doctor l was going to show him but l stayed with him for along time letting him know about what was going on with my health since going to the mayo clinic. I told him l had an autoimmune disease which he should have known about but he didnt. I cant figure it out when you see one doctor and they said we will make sure he gets the information and your doctor doesnt or maybe lm the only one with that problem. So l wanted to know if anyone else had scratches all over? And is that part of an autoimmune disease? Or maybe l am having another allergic reaction to some med. So if anyone can help me with that question l would definitley appreciate that because l cant drive yet and dont want to go to the hospital. I am well known at these hospitals and when l am right about a diagnoses right away l am stressed or depressed and then they notify you sometimes and they have to call in a med. They even cant keep all your allergies when you tell them. So now your insurance has to get involved especially when they told you what meds you shouldnt take and your doctor said you can that was old. Yesterday l even called my pharmacy about a refill and accidently called the same pharmacy in another state. I didnt even talk to anyone but right away they said their was a recall on a medicine and it was a recent recall and notify your pharmasist and when you call the pharmacy and tell them the information they said we didnt get any information on any new recalls.

I looked in my throat with a mirror and was shocked at what I sawit was blood red and had white patches and large ares covered in white. It was on the roof of my mouth and I thought it was also in my chest and maybe even my stomach (which is a pouch because of my RnY gastric bypass surgery). I had actually gone to the doctor on Friday because of my throat hurting so bad. She didnt do anything and said it was a virus. It was much worse on Saturday. The ER doctor said he thought it was a fungal infection and, again he didnt treat it. However, he did take a swab to see what would grow and gave me a drink with belladonna, mylanta, and something else in it. That gave me a lot of temporary relief from the pain. He ordered Amoxicillan in case I also have strep throat. Im not taking it until I see my doctor because I think that could make the fungus worse. The ER doctor said the treatment for esophageal thrush is very specific and he didnt want to start me on something that my Internist doctor would have to change. Ill see my Internist doctor tomorrow. I had never heard of this problem before. Ive been reading about it now. I would like to hear from anyone who has had this and what things to avoid in medicines, food, etc. I want to understand how I got this so I never get it again! It is so painful and I feel awful.

I have a lot of the symptoms, but truly feel if I lost weight, these symptoms may go away. Symptoms include dizziness, visual disturbances like black spots or blurriness, itchy legs and scalp, terrible leg and foot cramps at night, hands cramp, painful hands and feet, difficulty walking, and not to mention the terrible fatigue. I am a nurse in management, and I can not walk after 8 pm. I have to hold to furniture and my feet feel extremely painful to walk. I have spasms actually different areas of my body, and I have audible sounds that I am not sure are imaginary or real. I have often thought I was just too stressed by my job, depressed, or just doing too much. But physically, I feel exhausted all the time. When I get out of a car or go to stand up after sitting for a long period of time, I cant walk. I stand there a few minutes then move my legs, which feel extremely large and nonfunctional, before I can walk. I have to take little breaks between tasks, just to be able to perform even simple tasks. What can I expect in the next months to come? Should I retire and be able to take care of myself?

I was in college at the time and I struggled to eat but would force myself to as best I could but steadily got worse and ended up catching a series of unknown viral infections several months later (perhaps from being so worn down). I moved home after graduating from college because I was so sick and ended up being diagnosed with mono. Because I was positive for EBV, I was told there was not much I could do but wait it out. I got progressively more and more fatigued (as expected) but after a year my energy level had not returned and I began experiencing a constellation of other symptoms. I started having a range of digestive problems and had a number of tests done that revealed little in the way of diagnosis. Since then, I have developed a number of other issues: brain fog, difficulty speaking at times, more problems with swallowing, mouth ulcers, full body tremors, mood swings, loss of sensation in my limbs, poor circulation and worsening of my Raynauds phenomenon (which I have had for several years), cloudy urinethe list goes on. Some tests I have had that did NOT reveal any issues: endoscopy, colonoscopy, celiac serologies, many cbc and metabolic panels (always normal aside from when I had acute viral infections two years ago), gastric emptying test, abdominal ct scan, tests for Lyme/HIV/STDs/other infectious diseases, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth test, C reactive protein, urinalysis (turbid urine but no evidence of anything off aside from the cloudiness), and some other miscellaneous lab work. So far, the only tests that have come back abnormal are: esophageal manometry test (shows I have dysmotility of my esophagus), very low ferritin levels (which used to be normal at the start of things), reduced sweating from autonomic testing and signs of peripheral neuropathy (though I am waiting for results of small fiber neuropathy biopsy which takes some time), low complement c4 levels at 11mg/dL (but normal c3 and two negative ANA tests six months apart). My doctors have thrown dozens of medications at me along the way to try to manage the symptoms but I admit Im resistant to this strategy as I have historically reacted poorly to medication (and they bring their own side effects). Currently I am taking 20mg of Prozac (I had been on Celexa but did not respond well to it and had constant panic attacks) with no improvement. I take 300mg of Zantac once a day (I took Prilosec for nearly a year at the suggestion of my gastroenterologist before researching some more and realizing this was not a great thing to be on in the long term, especially if it was not helping). I also take a mens once a day multivitamin, fish oil supplement, a gentle iron supplement that is vegetable based (again at recommendation of doctor, though this seems like a way of covering up the problem that my ferritin is low rather than identifying the cause). I lift weights recreationally at home about 4 days a week and do yoga usually once a week; unfortunately I struggle to incorporate cardio into my routine now because I get so worn out afterwards that I end up sleeping for hours/days. When I try to get up and go on walks, I feel very distant and depersonalized like I am behind a screen which is a very scary sensation. I sleep extremely long hours and often need naps throughout the day, and cannot work (this is hard for me because I am a young guy and worked very hard in school; my quality of life has been reduced to almost nothing). My vitals are generally good at the doctor: bp fluctuates somewhat but never in dangerous territory, resting heartrate usually in the high 60s/low 70s, no fevers since the mono three years ago. I realize this is a lot of information but I wanted to be thorough. It has been such a long and upsetting journey for me  to work your hardest but feel like you are in constant discomfort and exhausted. My doctors right now seem to think theres something going on, we just dont know what and the intervals between appointments can be months. There are days when I am so miserable I just want to go to the emergency room, but I have done that before and they dont do any tests aside from the basics and then discharge me with no way of coping. I also am putting such a financial burden on my family with the costs of my healthcare. I have had to learn to advocate for myself throughout this process, to let people know that even though they dont see anything wrong in the easy tests that I FEEL horrible. It took two years of people saying it was just anxiety when I said I was having trouble swallowing before someone ran a manometry test and found there were some functional issues. So I end up having to research on my own and try to get my doctors to look into things when they want to just sent me out the door with medications. I was wondering if my symptoms could be something autoimmune? I feel very strongly that my symptoms are consistent with things like systemic scleroderma (raynauds, esophageal dysmotility, low c4 complement) or even multiple sclerosis (with the tremors and visual changes, EBV history, etc.). But no one will order an MRI of my head. And the ANA was negative so no one wants to look further into collagen vascular diseases. My neurologist seems to think I have damage to my autonomic nervous system, which is also very scary (reduced sweating function, constantly dilated pupils). Does ANYONE have an idea or hopeful comment that could help me? I know my anxiety is out of control but after three years of misery and a downward trajectory, can you blame me for worrying? I just want to get better but it seems all the things I am likely to have are lifelong and I dont want to live this way anymore.

I am male, 23 years old, 59 roughly 150lb. Three years ago, I became extremely fatigued and had difficulty swallowing for no reason that my doctors could identify. I was in college at the time and I struggled to eat but would force myself to as best I could but steadily got worse and ended up catching a series of unknown viral infections several months later (perhaps from being so worn down). I moved home after graduating from college because I was so sick and ended up being diagnosed with mono. Because I was positive for EBV, I was told there was not much I could do but wait it out. I got progressively more and more fatigued (as expected) but after a year my energy level had not returned and I began experiencing a constellation of other symptoms. I started having a range of digestive problems and had a number of tests done that revealed little in the way of diagnosis. Since then, I have developed a number of other issues: brain fog, difficulty speaking at times, more problems with swallowing, mouth ulcers, full body tremors, mood swings, loss of sensation in my limbs, poor circulation and worsening of my Raynauds phenomenon (which I have had for several years), cloudy urinethe list goes on. Some tests I have had that did NOT reveal any issues: endoscopy, colonoscopy, celiac serologies, many cbc and metabolic panels (always normal aside from when I had acute viral infections two years ago), gastric emptying test, abdominal ct scan, tests for Lyme/HIV/STDs/other infectious diseases, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth test, C reactive protein, urinalysis (turbid urine but no evidence of anything off aside from the cloudiness), and some other miscellaneous lab work. So far, the only tests that have come back abnormal are: esophageal manometry test (shows I have dysmotility of my esophagus), very low ferritin levels (which used to be normal at the start of things), reduced sweating from autonomic testing and signs of peripheral neuropathy (though I am waiting for results of small fiber neuropathy biopsy which takes some time), low complement c4 levels at 11mg/dL (but normal c3 and two negative ANA tests six months apart). My doctors have thrown dozens of medications at me along the way to try to manage the symptoms but I admit Im resistant to this strategy as I have historically reacted poorly to medication (and they bring their own side effects). Currently I am taking 20mg of Prozac (I had been on Celexa but did not respond well to it and had constant panic attacks) with no improvement. I take 300mg of Zantac once a day (I took Prilosec for nearly a year at the suggestion of my gastroenterologist before researching some more and realizing this was not a great thing to be on in the long term, especially if it was not helping). I also take a mens once a day multivitamin, fish oil supplement, a gentle iron supplement that is vegetable based (again at recommendation of doctor, though this seems like a way of covering up the problem that my ferritin is low rather than identifying the cause). I lift weights recreationally at home about 4 days a week and do yoga usually once a week; unfortunately I struggle to incorporate cardio into my routine now because I get so worn out afterwards that I end up sleeping for hours/days. When I try to get up and go on walks, I feel very distant and depersonalized like I am behind a screen which is a very scary sensation. I sleep extremely long hours and often need naps throughout the day, and cannot work (this is hard for me because I am a young guy and worked very hard in school; my quality of life has been reduced to almost nothing). My vitals are generally good at the doctor: bp fluctuates somewhat but never in dangerous territory, resting heartrate usually in the high 60s/low 70s, no fevers since the mono three years ago. I realize this is a lot of information but I wanted to be thorough. It has been such a long and upsetting journey for me  to work your hardest but feel like you are in constant discomfort and exhausted. My doctors right now seem to think theres something going on, we just dont know what and the intervals between appointments can be months. There are days when I am so miserable I just want to go to the emergency room, but I have done that before and they dont do any tests aside from the basics and then discharge me with no way of coping. I also am putting such a financial burden on my family with the costs of my healthcare. I have had to learn to advocate for myself throughout this process, to let people know that even though they dont see anything wrong in the easy tests that I FEEL horrible. It took two years of people saying it was just anxiety when I said I was having trouble swallowing before someone ran a manometry test and found there were some functional issues. So I end up having to research on my own and try to get my doctors to look into things when they want to just sent me out the door with medications. I was wondering if my symptoms could be something autoimmune? I feel very strongly that my symptoms are consistent with things like systemic scleroderma (raynauds, esophageal dysmotility, low c4 complement) or even multiple sclerosis (with the tremors and visual changes, EBV history, etc.). But no one will order an MRI of my head. And the ANA was negative so no one wants to look further into collagen vascular diseases. My neurologist seems to think I have damage to my autonomic nervous system, which is also very scary (reduced sweating function, constantly dilated pupils). Does ANYONE have an idea or hopeful comment that could help me? I know my anxiety is out of control but after three years of misery and a downward trajectory, can you blame me for worrying? I just want to get better but it seems all the things I am likely to have are lifelong and I dont want to live this way anymore.

But no one will order an MRI of my head. And the ANA was negative so no one wants to look further into collagen vascular diseases. My neurologist seems to think I have damage to my autonomic nervous system, which is also very scary (reduced sweating function, constantly dilated pupils). Does ANYONE have an idea or hopeful comment that could help me? I know my anxiety is out of control but after three years of misery and a downward trajectory, can you blame me for worrying? I just want to get better but it seems all the things I am likely to have are lifelong and I dont want to live this way anymore.

I am male, 23 years old, 59 roughly 150lb. Three years ago, I became extremely fatigued and had difficulty swallowing for no reason that my doctors could identify. I was in college at the time and I struggled to eat but would force myself to as best I could but steadily got worse and ended up catching a series of unknown viral infections several months later (perhaps from being so worn down). I moved home after graduating from college because I was so sick and ended up being diagnosed with mono. Because I was positive for EBV, I was told there was not much I could do but wait it out. I got progressively more and more fatigued (as expected) but after a year my energy level had not returned and I began experiencing a constellation of other symptoms. I started having a range of digestive problems and had a number of tests done that revealed little in the way of diagnosis. Since then, I have developed a number of other issues: brain fog, difficulty speaking at times, more problems with swallowing, mouth ulcers, full body tremors, mood swings, loss of sensation in my limbs, poor circulation and worsening of my Raynauds phenomenon (which I have had for several years), cloudy urinethe list goes on. Some tests I have had that did NOT reveal any issues: endoscopy, colonoscopy, celiac serologies, many cbc and metabolic panels (always normal aside from when I had acute viral infections two years ago), gastric emptying test, abdominal ct scan, tests for Lyme/HIV/STDs/other infectious diseases, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth test, C reactive protein, urinalysis (turbid urine but no evidence of anything off aside from the cloudiness), and some other miscellaneous lab work. So far, the only tests that have come back abnormal are: esophageal manometry test (shows I have dysmotility of my esophagus), very low ferritin levels (which used to be normal at the start of things), reduced sweating from autonomic testing and signs of peripheral neuropathy (though I am waiting for results of small fiber neuropathy biopsy which takes some time), low complement c4 levels at 11mg/dL (but normal c3 and two negative ANA tests six months apart). My doctors have thrown dozens of medications at me along the way to try to manage the symptoms but I admit Im resistant to this strategy as I have historically reacted poorly to medication (and they bring their own side effects). Currently I am taking 20mg of Prozac (I had been on Celexa but did not respond well to it and had constant panic attacks) with no improvement. I take 300mg of Zantac once a day (I took Prilosec for nearly a year at the suggestion of my gastroenterologist before researching some more and realizing this was not a great thing to be on in the long term, especially if it was not helping). I also take a mens once a day multivitamin, fish oil supplement, a gentle iron supplement that is vegetable based (again at recommendation of doctor, though this seems like a way of covering up the problem that my ferritin is low rather than identifying the cause). I lift weights recreationally at home about 4 days a week and do yoga usually once a week; unfortunately I struggle to incorporate cardio into my routine now because I get so worn out afterwards that I end up sleeping for hours/days. When I try to get up and go on walks, I feel very distant and depersonalized like I am behind a screen which is a very scary sensation. I sleep extremely long hours and often need naps throughout the day, and cannot work (this is hard for me because I am a young guy and worked very hard in school; my quality of life has been reduced to almost nothing). My vitals are generally good at the doctor: bp fluctuates somewhat but never in dangerous territory, resting heartrate usually in the high 60s/low 70s, no fevers since the mono three years ago. I realize this is a lot of information but I wanted to be thorough. It has been such a long and upsetting journey for me  to work your hardest but feel like you are in constant discomfort and exhausted. My doctors right now seem to think theres something going on, we just dont know what and the intervals between appointments can be months. There are days when I am so miserable I just want to go to the emergency room, but I have done that before and they dont do any tests aside from the basics and then discharge me with no way of coping. I also am putting such a financial burden on my family with the costs of my healthcare. I have had to learn to advocate for myself throughout this process, to let people know that even though they dont see anything wrong in the easy tests that I FEEL horrible. It took two years of people saying it was just anxiety when I said I was having trouble swallowing before someone ran a manometry test and found there were some functional issues.

After 8 years of dealing with multiple drugs, I can walk very little and now use a wheelchair when I have to go anywhere, which is seldom. Biologics blow up my knees like balloons. They never really made me any better, only worse, and I am pretty much in constant pain. I feel as if my life has been taken away from me. After being treated by the same doctor for 7 years, I finally let him go. It was one of the hardest things I have ever done and even after a year, it is still very painful to me. I finally decided I had to go to Mayo and they are still working on something that can actually help rather than hurt me. I still have other specialists to see.

How often do you get them? What triggers them? Mine seem to come after any stressful event- doesnt have to be too serious, but one that might work me up.

I woke up one morning and could not get out of bed as I cannot move my legs or left arm. I am only 18 yrs old. I went to the hospital, and was admitted for a week, but only to discharged by the hospital, with no diagnosis except that I still have Psoriasiss as well as Psoriatic Arthritis, which started at age 13 yrs of age. Several weeks go by and Im getting worse, I have red raised nodules on the shins of my legs below my knees. Im back in a different hospital and they put warm towels on my legs. They took pictures of my legs for a medical book. My legs are warm to the touch and very painful. The doctors are baffled and send me home again with no diagnosis. After being home for a few weeks with horrific pain, Im finally carried in by my father and again admitted to a different hospital. The doctors tell my parents that they think there may be fluid in my ankles because they are swollen and red and that I will never walk again. But thank God there was no fluid. I spent a week in the hospital only to have them discharge me with a diagnosis of Sarcoidosis and Erythema Nodosum. They thought it could have also been Polio or Rheumatic fever and so I spent the next 9 months in a wheelchair, because I just couldnt walk. So, I cant walk, I have Psoriasiss, Sarcoidosis, and Erythema Nodosum, and I was receiving several steroid injections in my ankles and taking liquid painkillers just to be able to stand. After almost a almost year it seemed to have just gone away. Its now May in the year of 1995. I have given birth to my second son by C-section. During this 3-day experience the symptoms that I had was severe tremors and headache. The nurse said it was normal after a C-section. I didnt agree, as these tremors were involuntary and uncontrollable. They gave me Ativan to control the tremors. Finally, my husband and I left the hospital and took our baby home. Two nights later after being at home, I had to go back to the E.R. as I had a severe headache and my blood pressure was up. The doctors gave me a CT and a shot of Demerol, and sent me home. They said I was fine. I knew I was not. The very next day, I literally woke up feeling like I only had a head in the bed!! I could not feel my body parts especially from the neck down to my toes and I had no control of their movements. I was numb from the neck down and unable to walk without assistance. Today, I have learned that what I had experienced has a name, PROPRIOCEPTION, another major symptom of MS. At this point my speech started to slur. My husband drove me back to the hospital. By the time I entered the emergency room, I had no vision, I was blind and within hours, and I felt as if I were paralyzed. I could not respond to any of the doctors commands. I simply did not know how to respond. Yet I could hear every word they spoke. After being admitted for weeks and after undergoing many, many tests and having had Nitroglycerin put under my tongue every few hours, the only diagnosis that I received was that I had Post Partum Psychosis and that I needed to see a Psychiatrist. I remember a Neurologist checking my balance before I was discharged, and because I had a slight responding reflex, he said I was fine, yet I still could not see or walk correctly. I had no perception of time or space or even where I was. I could not drive a car, as I didnt know how? I relied on my husband for everything that had to do with thinking. As time went by my vision finally did come back as tunnel and mirror like vision. My doctor prescribed 1mg of Ativan 3x a day as it calmed the tremors that had overcome my body. I listened to my Doctors recommendations and saw a Psychiatrist and he had performed a Neuropsychological evaluation. It was my Psychiatrist who said I had every symptom of Multiple Sclerosis and suggested that I see an MS specialist. So I made an appointment to see an MS specialist who finally diagnosed me with Multiple Sclerosis. He was upset that it took so long for me to get a diagnosis. He said it showed that I had MS on all different MRIs. He also said I had a host of other autoimmune related diseases as well. In June of 2001, I had to undergo speech and cognitive therapy for almost 3 years and I had to be detoxed from the medication called Ativan that I was now addicted too for the tremors and was now shutting down my digestive system. I was taking up to 18 mg a day of Ativan because of a MISDIAGNOSIS. After countless doctor visits and unnecessary surgeries and spending thousands of dollars in co-pays it took almost 30 years to get a proper diagnosis. One doctor wrote a letter to my Psychiatrist that he had spent over an hour counseling me on my symptoms and complaints. Others said it was all in my head. Since my diagnosis of MS, I have also been diagnosed with ITP (Immune Thrombocytopenia Perpura) as well as Lupus, Sjogrens, Uveitis and Optic Neuritis. I feel that telling my story may benefit others who maybe experiencing or already has experienced this same kind of situation. Im also telling my story so that I may one day save someones life.

I woke up one morning and could not get out of bed as I cannot move my legs or left arm. I am only 18 yrs old. I went to the hospital, and was admitted for a week, but only to discharged by the hospital, with no diagnosis except that I still have Psoriasiss as well as Psoriatic Arthritis, which started at age 13 yrs of age. Several weeks go by and Im getting worse, I have red raised nodules on the shins of my legs below my knees. Im back in a different hospital and they put warm towels on my legs. They took pictures of my legs for a medical book. My legs are warm to the touch and very painful. The doctors are baffled and send me home again with no diagnosis. After being home for a few weeks with horrific pain, Im finally carried in by my father and again admitted to a different hospital. The doctors tell my parents that they think there may be fluid in my ankles because they are swollen and red and that I will never walk again. But thank God there was no fluid. I spent a week in the hospital only to have them discharge me with a diagnosis of Sarcoidosis and Erythema Nodosum. They thought it could have also been Polio or Rheumatic fever and so I spent the next 9 months in a wheelchair, because I just couldnt walk. So, I cant walk, I have Psoriasiss, Sarcoidosis, and Erythema Nodosum, and I was receiving several steroid injections in my ankles and taking liquid painkillers just to be able to stand. After almost a almost year it seemed to have just gone away. Its now May in the year of 1995. I have given birth to my second son by C-section. During this 3-day experience the symptoms that I had was severe tremors and headache. The nurse said it was normal after a C-section. I didnt agree, as these tremors were involuntary and uncontrollable. They gave me Ativan to control the tremors. Finally, my husband and I left the hospital and took our baby home. Two nights later after being at home, I had to go back to the E.R. as I had a severe headache and my blood pressure was up. The doctors gave me a CT and a shot of Demerol, and sent me home. They said I was fine. I knew I was not. The very next day, I literally woke up feeling like I only had a head in the bed!! I could not feel my body parts especially from the neck down to my toes and I had no control of their movements. I was numb from the neck down and unable to walk without assistance. Today, I have learned that what I had experienced has a name, PROPRIOCEPTION, another major symptom of MS. At this point my speech started to slur. My husband drove me back to the hospital. By the time I entered the emergency room, I had no vision, I was blind and within hours, and I felt as if I were paralyzed. I could not respond to any of the doctors commands. I simply did not know how to respond. Yet I could hear every word they spoke. After being admitted for weeks and after undergoing many, many tests and having had Nitroglycerin put under my tongue every few hours, the only diagnosis that I received was that I had Post Partum Psychosis and that I needed to see a Psychiatrist. I remember a Neurologist checking my balance before I was discharged, and because I had a slight responding reflex, he said I was fine, yet I still could not see or walk correctly. I had no perception of time or space or even where I was. I could not drive a car, as I didnt know how? I relied on my husband for everything that had to do with thinking. As time went by my vision finally did come back as tunnel and mirror like vision. My doctor prescribed 1mg of Ativan 3x a day as it calmed the tremors that had overcome my body. I listened to my Doctors recommendations and saw a Psychiatrist and he had performed a Neuropsychological evaluation. It was my Psychiatrist who said I had every symptom of Multiple Sclerosis and suggested that I see an MS specialist. So I made an appointment to see an MS specialist who finally diagnosed me with Multiple Sclerosis. He was upset that it took so long for me to get a diagnosis. He said it showed that I had MS on all different MRIs. He also said I had a host of other autoimmune related diseases as well. In June of 2001, I had to undergo speech and cognitive therapy for almost 3 years and I had to be detoxed from the medication called Ativan that I was now addicted too for the tremors and was now shutting down my digestive system. I was taking up to 18 mg a day of Ativan because of a MISDIAGNOSIS. After countless doctor visits and unnecessary surgeries and spending thousands of dollars in co-pays it took almost 30 years to get a proper diagnosis. One doctor wrote a letter to my Psychiatrist that he had spent over an hour counseling me on my symptoms and complaints. Others said it was all in my head. Since my diagnosis of MS, I have also been diagnosed with ITP (Immune Thrombocytopenia Perpura) as well as Lupus, Sjogrens, Uveitis and Optic Neuritis. I feel that telling my story may benefit others who maybe experiencing or already has experienced this same kind of situation. Im also telling my story so that I may one day save someones life. Today, I have become a self educated and volunteer leader for a nonprofit organization called American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association at http://www.aarda.org. I now have a support group in the local Detroit area with meetings held once a month, March thru November. My autoimmune support group is the first in the nation, as we bring education, research and support, to the growing public and to the healthcare system on over 100 autoimmune related diseases. Because you as a consumer pay for good Health Insurance, you should also get the correct diagnosis when seeing a health professional. It is your right.

I woke up one morning and could not get out of bed as I cannot move my legs or left arm. I am only 18 yrs old. I went to the hospital, and was admitted for a week, but only to discharged by the hospital, with no diagnosis except that I still have Psoriasiss as well as Psoriatic Arthritis, which started at age 13 yrs of age. Several weeks go by and Im getting worse, I have red raised nodules on the shins of my legs below my knees. Im back in a different hospital and they put warm towels on my legs. They took pictures of my legs for a medical book. My legs are warm to the touch and very painful. The doctors are baffled and send me home again with no diagnosis. After being home for a few weeks with horrific pain, Im finally carried in by my father and again admitted to a different hospital. The doctors tell my parents that they think there may be fluid in my ankles because they are swollen and red and that I will never walk again. But thank God there was no fluid. I spent a week in the hospital only to have them discharge me with a diagnosis of Sarcoidosis and Erythema Nodosum. They thought it could have also been Polio or Rheumatic fever and so I spent the next 9 months in a wheelchair, because I just couldnt walk. So, I cant walk, I have Psoriasiss, Sarcoidosis, and Erythema Nodosum, and I was receiving several steroid injections in my ankles and taking liquid painkillers just to be able to stand. After almost a almost year it seemed to have just gone away. Its now May in the year of 1995. I have given birth to my second son by C-section. During this 3-day experience the symptoms that I had was severe tremors and headache. The nurse said it was normal after a C-section. I didnt agree, as these tremors were involuntary and uncontrollable. They gave me Ativan to control the tremors. Finally, my husband and I left the hospital and took our baby home. Two nights later after being at home, I had to go back to the E.R. as I had a severe headache and my blood pressure was up. The doctors gave me a CT and a shot of Demerol, and sent me home. They said I was fine. I knew I was not. The very next day, I literally woke up feeling like I only had a head in the bed!! I could not feel my body parts especially from the neck down to my toes and I had no control of their movements. I was numb from the neck down and unable to walk without assistance. Today, I have learned that what I had experienced has a name, PROPRIOCEPTION, another major symptom of MS. At this point my speech started to slur. My husband drove me back to the hospital. By the time I entered the emergency room, I had no vision, I was blind and within hours, and I felt as if I were paralyzed. I could not respond to any of the doctors commands. I simply did not know how to respond. Yet I could hear every word they spoke. After being admitted for weeks and after undergoing many, many tests and having had Nitroglycerin put under my tongue every few hours, the only diagnosis that I received was that I had Post Partum Psychosis and that I needed to see a Psychiatrist. I remember a Neurologist checking my balance before I was discharged, and because I had a slight responding reflex, he said I was fine, yet I still could not see or walk correctly. I had no perception of time or space or even where I was. I could not drive a car, as I didnt know how? I relied on my husband for everything that had to do with thinking. As time went by my vision finally did come back as tunnel and mirror like vision. My doctor prescribed 1mg of Ativan 3x a day as it calmed the tremors that had overcome my body. I listened to my Doctors recommendations and saw a Psychiatrist and he had performed a Neuropsychological evaluation. It was my Psychiatrist who said I had every symptom of Multiple Sclerosis and suggested that I see an MS specialist. So I made an appointment to see an MS specialist who finally diagnosed me with Multiple Sclerosis. He was upset that it took so long for me to get a diagnosis. He said it showed that I had MS on all different MRIs. He also said I had a host of other autoimmune related diseases as well. In June of 2001, I had to undergo speech and cognitive therapy for almost 3 years and I had to be detoxed from the medication called Ativan that I was now addicted too for the tremors and was now shutting down my digestive system. I was taking up to 18 mg a day of Ativan because of a MISDIAGNOSIS. After countless doctor visits and unnecessary surgeries and spending thousands of dollars in co-pays it took almost 30 years to get a proper diagnosis. One doctor wrote a letter to my Psychiatrist that he had spent over an hour counseling me on my symptoms and complaints. Others said it was all in my head. Since my diagnosis of MS, I have also been diagnosed with ITP (Immune Thrombocytopenia Perpura) as well as Lupus, Sjogrens, Uveitis and Optic Neuritis. I feel that telling my story may benefit others who maybe experiencing or already has experienced this same kind of situation. Im also telling my story so that I may one day save someones life. Today, I have become a self educated and volunteer leader for a nonprofit organization called American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association at http://www.aarda.org. I now have a support group in the local Detroit area with meetings held once a month, March thru November. My autoimmune support group is the first in the nation, as we bring education, research and support, to the growing public and to the healthcare system on over 100 autoimmune related diseases. Because you as a consumer pay for good Health Insurance, you should also get the correct diagnosis when seeing a health professional. It is your right.

It is not easy to treat and reason for discussion on this board with anyone who has it. Personally, Ive probably had a thyroid/adrenal issue for a long time, but standard labs never uncovered. After a very stressful period in my life, I developed either anxiety disorder or adrenal fatigue, eventually leading to recent diagnosis of Hashimotos (auto-immune disorder: antibodies attacking thyroid). My symptoms are fatigue, anxiety that leads to depression, hoarse voice, sore thyroid, high anitbody reading. Id like to know where folks have found any kind of relief or any educational material they want to share. Ive gotten a recent publication, Hope for Hashimotos by Haskell, that I suggest anyone with Hashis read. Hope this will spark a dialogue. Aloha from Hawaii Liked by JeanneM, CathyF Follow Report"

Immediately after her repair of L1 by kyphoplasty she was up and using a walker and sitting in a chair. Everything at that point seemed to be progressing smoothly until she leaned over and felt a sharp pain in her lower back on Oct 5, 2019. The source of this new pain has never been verified although we were admitted to an ED for the pain and they discovered through blood testing that she had MM. Very sorry to take so long with this story but it is relevant to my concern. We were transferred to the closest cancer clinic where her oncologist/hematologist found an orange sized plastocytoma on her right hip which we believe was the source of the pain on Oct 5th. Since this time she has received 3 rounds, 9 total treatments of bortezemib, Cytoxin and dexamethasone. In addition to the treatments she has had awful painful sores on both ends due to the cytoxin (I'm told) and after that she contracted painful shingles that won't resolve. With all she's been through despite having some success treating the MM her quality of life is not good, especially considering she still is bed bound essentially for the past 7 months. Now her legs are not capable of supporting her body per our physical therapist. My biggest question now is should we allow her to focus on her mobility and gain strength by reducing or changing her chemo regimen? We've already been told she's too weak for a SCT which means she will continue with chemo I guess indefinitely.

I had never heard of this rare disease and the NP at Mayo Rochester who called with results said she had had to look it up and she gave me some basic information. I soon learned much about this blood disorder of myeloid cell origin which affects only 1 or 2 adults per million population. It is more commonly a pediatric disease, although still rare. It can cause lesions on skin, bones, lungs, liver, or spleen. It can also cause problems with the central nervous system. After a PET scan and other tests and imaging, it appears that mine is skin only. I did test positive for an acquired mutation of the BRAF gene that is found in up to 60% of patients with the disease. I have tried numerous topical treatments, including several strong steroidal ointments and cream, ointment to rev up my immune system and even nitrogen mustard in gel form. Although some helped, all topical treatments eventually, or very quickly caused worse skin irritation that the original lesions. Brachytherapy to affected skin in the groin area caused painful burns. For the last 5 months, I have been taking Hydrea, 500mg and then 1000mg per day. This has resulted in the best response yet. I still seem to have flare ups and then subsiding of the skins, but much less severe. In June, 2019, a bone marrow biopsy was performed after blood labs had shown low platelet counts and high monocytes over a period of time. I was diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML 0). This is another rare disease that is a myeloid disorder. My best hope is for a slow progression of this leukemia, since current treatments only treat symptoms. There are possible treatments being studied, but not yet available.

My best hope is for a slow progression of this leukemia, since current treatments only treat symptoms. There are possible treatments being studied, but not yet available. Having any rare disease is frustrating since there is often very little money available for research because so few would benefit. It is also difficult to find providers who are knowledgeable about diseases so rarely seen! Any others have any experience with these disorders? Follow Report"

For weeks after I have felt fatigued and had multiple swollen lymph nodes in my neck. I have felt weird pain areas around my spleen and groin on and off that will come and go for days or weeks at a time the one symptom that has stayed constant is the lymph nodes. They arent huge but are noticeable. One is very hard to the touch and they dont hurt. I had mono once two years ago and I have had EBV bloodwork done twice and both times the bloodwork was indicative of past infection and no active infection. Been to three different docs who say its mono or an unknown virus but Im worried it could be something worse. Follow Report

It was then that my foot and leg started swelling and I could not feel anything nor could I move them. I was freezing cold and my hemoglobin went down to 4. My blood pressure kept dropping then going up slightly then dropping again and so they could not give me any pain meds at all. I was screaming in pain. I yelled at the Dr. to just cut my leg off. I yelled at him to just put me in a coma if they could not give me any pain meds. Little did I know that he had left the cath lab twice to tell my husband that i might need to have my entire left leg amputated!! They called a vascular specialist in to see if she could find a new vein in my arms for what, I am not sure, maybe anesthesia. She used ultrasound on my arms but could not find a vein. All of them had collapsed. at one point i was just holding my hands on my face and sobbing and suddenly realized that I had no tears at all. I was that dehydrated and still in terrible pain. finally my blood pressure elevated enough that one of his team membersran over and injected anesthesia into a port. Then my cardiologist inserted two stents and good blood flow started up. I woke up back in my hospital room with my cardiologist fishing around the bed for my left foot. I could feel his finger on the arch of my foot. It felt hot. Everyone round (his team members) smiled.

I have found substantial information about the treatment plans after diagnosis, criteria for diagnosis but not the protocol for referral to a specialist. I learned that CLL is typically found as a result of a workup for another health issue or wellness visit. My main question is after the first blood test that showed elevated levels how long did it take for your provider to refer you to a specialist? Did your provider repeat the test before referral? If so, how much time elapsed between first results and repeat testing? Finally, if you didnt get a referral after the first test did you feel that time was wasted? I understand that CLL is mostly not fast acting and treatment is delayed until significant symptoms, so some period of delay is likely not something to be concerned about. My story: My CBC done by my primary care doc in mid-december reported elevated absolute lymphocytes (4400/ul), WBCs (11,300/ul) and alkaline phosphatase (122 IU/L). CBC is done every 6 months because of long term medication use with possible liver effects. This is the first time there were any unusual anomalies. For about 2 months prior to the blood test I was recovering from oral surgery complication that removed a failed dental implant, bone graft and oral pain from a titanium film that was removed a week before the blood test. I experience significant fatigue and intermittent shortness of breath that I did not mention to PCP at last appointment since Ive always felt tired consistent with other health issues, my weight and denial. The lab provides patients with access to results after the doctor reviews them. After consulting Dr. Google (extensive research) I called primary care and asked if doctor saw results, if I should come in before my scheduled appointment 6 months away, etc. The gatekeeper said that if Dr. Was concerned the nurse would have called. The nurse hasnt called. Being a former caregiver and advocate for my late husband who experienced too many missteps in early diagnosis of several disorders I am on heightened alert when I read lab reports that indicate out of normal range results. And for some reason I am more hesitant to be the dogged advocate for myself than for others. Your experiences would help me put things in perspective and/or motivate me to get past the gatekeeper and see my doctor before my next scheduled appointment in 6 months.

I was wondering if anyone here could help me. I think I may have Hodgkin's Lymphoma and am getting pretty scared. My symptoms seem to fit exactly and I always feel horrible. I have visably swollen lymph nodes in my right arm pit, right groin area and can feel swollen glands in my neck. This has all been happening on and off for years and I am now to the point where I constantly have an infection somewhere and am always falling asleep from the fatigue and pain. I just really need someone to talk to that understands what I am going through. Liked by Jackie, Alumna Mentor Follow Report"

If you can, please do help me out For the last 70 days, the least physically demanding tasks make me short of breath and cause my heart-rate to spike, before this illness I was easily able to do intense exercises. Here is my first post, submitted 13 days after my illness: reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/8jbr06/for_13_days_the_least_physically_demanding_tasks/ **Please briefly go over the post above if you would like to see the symptoms I had during the initial phase of my illness in detail. Age: 21  Height: 511  Weight: Now, 150 lb . before illness: 170 lb  Gender: Male And now here is the update after 70 days, I will try my best to summarize what is going on, because it is scaring me to my core, and if youre a hematologist (or know one), please do help me out here. Let me give you the main blood-work first, which I believe is most significant. There is a declining trend in my platelet count. It was measured 6 seperate times at the exact same lab. On 2018 May 08, my results were 348 . The reference range is 155  372. On 2018 May 18, my results were 314 . On 2018 Jun 08, my results were 311 . On 2018 Jun 13, my results were 303 . On 2018 Jun 17, my results were 304 . On 2018 Jun 30, my results were 268. The platelet trend is fully summarized in this line graph: i.imgur.com/yPCpP06.jpg Here is my MEAN PLATELET VOLUME (reference range is 4  14 fL) from the 6 dates, May 08  June 30, starting from May 08: 7.6/7.9/7.8/8.1/8.0/7.9. Since I cannot write all of my blood results due to the word limit, I will simply give line graph pictures and main trends. I got my blood work done on 6 dates: May 8, 18. And June 8, 13, 17, 30. Use these for reference. My white blood cells were high until June 13, they were 10.7 x 10*9/L. After, they are 8.5 x 10*9/L (avg) for the past 2 weeks. Summary of WBC: i.imgur.com/rB8WaIz.png For my WBC, first the neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes were high. Then, only my neutrophils and monocytes were high. My basophils were always 0. And my lymphocytes have always been normal, around 2. Here is my HEMOGLOBIN from the 6 dates, May 08  June 30, starting from May 08: 153/151/149/148/153/147. My HEMATOCRIT (reference range is 0.39  0.49 L/L) from the 6 dates, May 08  June 30 has been 0.47 or 0.46. Here is my RED BLOOD CELL COUNT from the 6 dates, May 08  June 30, starting from May 08: 5.2/5.2/5.3/5.2/5.3/5.1. It came back as 5.1, lowests its been, on June 30. My ESR sed rate is normal tested on June 30, at 9 mm/hr. My TSH is normal, and my LDH level is normal at 156 u/L. My calcium was 2.4, then went up to 2.5, and is decreased to 2.3 now. My PROTEIN ELECTROPHORESIS came back normal with no apparent monoclonal band seen. I had a very normal abdomen ultrasound, except for my left kidney size, which was 9*4.3*4.5cm. I also 2 palpable lymph nodes which I got a ultrasound for, the results came back as: Mildly enlarged lymph nodes with mostly benign features likely reactive, with thin cortical mantles. To me this lymph nodes are non-painful and hard. There measurements are 14*9.1*3.6mm, and 10.1*9.3*3.4 mm. They did a monospot on May 15, which came back positive. However, I requested a EBV test and that has came back 100% non-reactive, meaning I 100% did NOT have mono, and had a false-positive for the monospot. My symptoms as of now are constant fatigue, and I always feel like I cannot get a full breath in, and cannot properly yawn. I also have pain in my chest, like the muscle and bone area. I always been having green urine, and loose floating stools. And I wake up in the middle of night to urinate, atleast 2 times everynight, and I am more thristy. I am also seeing visible black-ish blood vessels in my palms and fingers, which I never saw before in my life. My urine is coming green, but from a urine analysis is was normal (no protein, blood, bilirubin etc). Only specific gravity was somewhat low. Also, I had no immature grans in my blood, and NRBC is 0. My AST/ALT are low at 16/18. My potassium is normal but on the lower side. My bicarbonate, chloride, creatinine are normal. MDRD GFR is >120 mL. My bilirubin/albumin/AMYLASE/ INR=normal. My ALKALINE PHOS was a little high at start, but since is high-normal. My blood-pressure is also high, at 140/80.. but lately its been coming back more normal for the past couple weeks I have not had a blood smear yet. I am really afraid I have some type of leukemia as my b12 is very high, and my platelets are droping. Along with my other symptoms, but I dont know. Please do help me **Reminder, if you want to see my symptoms during the begining of my illness in detail, please go to this post I made back on May 17: reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/8jbr06/for_13_days_the_least_physically_demanding_tasks/ I know I am writing alot of info, and I am so grateful beyond words if youre able to help me in this time.

We have exhausted all traditional treatment efforts; chemotherapy and radiation are no longer an option for us. We are looking into holistic healing routes. I realize this is not necessarily the appropriate forum, but I am desperate to find help. My question for anyone who reads this is if youve found any supplements or natural healing remedies that have had an effect on your cancer, whether it be CNS Lymphoma or otherwise? I have also noticed the link between the Epstein-Barr Virus and Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, and wondering if anyone had ANY information as far as that connection goes, or if your doctor tested for the presence of EBV or any auto-immune diseases when you were diagnosed with cancer?

After 3 years of having symptoms from CT Scan which the radiologists said were possible indolent processes, I finally went around my physician to an oncologist who wanted to wait and see since my bloodtests were good. Finally after a number of CT scans and one PET scan and continued waiting, I pulled rank and went to a surgeon who removed a suspect lymph node, diagnosing follicular lymphoma. Very tough surgery and I was hospitalized for a week. A follow up bone marrow aspiration showed ~25% cancerous cells by volume, putting me at stage IV. I am now on a rituxan series and my blood still looks good, no signs of anemia. Only parameter out of normal range is RWV (red cell width variance) which is low. Heres my question: Over the past 3 years I have experienced constant and at times severe fatigue and severe muscular leg pain in specific spots that dont move around. Also my legs jerk, especially at night (restless leg?). I have fallen once already. XRAYS and back CT scans look good. Current medical opinion is that the fatigue and pains are probably not related to my cancer. Can anyone share any similar experience and the final diagnosis?

Doctor says his blood levels are getting low enough that I have to make a decision (his Dad is deceased so this one is all mine). If I do nothing, they give him three years to live. And they probably wont be good years as he will be susceptible to most anything, including more cancer of a different nature. Im not sure what I should do for my boy. I love him, he loves his life and everyone that knows him loves him because thats just his nature  he just loves everybody. If I dont try the chemo, Ill feel like I killed my own son without trying if he dies. Yet taking him for these horrendous IV poisons just doesnt make sense to me either. I dont know what to do. Help!

I seem to have trouble controlling them when I stand or walk. Feel like I walk on outside of or sides of feet. Now both feet stiff and both legs feel like there is a vice being tighten down on them.

More than 50 million Americans suffer from arthritis and it is the No. 1 cause of disability in the country. Arthritis can be painful and debilitating, preventing many who have it from being active or doing the things they once enjoyed. The changes in physical capabilities can also have an effect on mental health as well. If you have arthritis, what sort of activities have you had to give up and how has that affected you?

Im a 52 year old Female living in Seattle Wa. Last Sept I had a THR which was going well at first but at 3 weeks I dislocated it. E.R. popped it back in and 2 weeks later it dislocated again. I had to wait until the second week of Dec. for the revision. Because On Dec 5th I had breast cancer surgery. (when it rains, it pours) and Dec 12th I had the revision. Dec 19th I had a fever of 104 and went to the ER. They sent me to the hospital where I had the hip surgery and 12 hours later was told I had an infection and that the hip needed to come out. They put in a spacer and a new piece in my femur and told me when the infection was gone that they would put in a new THR. I was in the hospital the week of Christmas and had to do the IV infusions for 7weeks. I lived alone except for a 1 1/2 y.o. boxer dog who I had rescued between dislocations. I already have severe depression and anxiety along with PTSD so this whole ordeal was more than I could handle. My surgeon (I found out later) was a huge ass who didnt give a crap about me (or anyone who wasnt him) and lied to me about several things, including trying to convince me that I could live a normal life with the temporary hip. I knew that was impossible because the pain from the spacer was horrible and later found out that the pain was caused by the spacer shifting because he didnt use enough cement to hold it in place. I wanted a new surgeon and had to fight with his office to get someone else to replace the hip. I met with the new surgeon (who is great) the day they were pulling out the PICC line and we talked about the following month of checking my blood and my hip fluid before proceeding with the new hip.The PICC line came out and 6 days later I was back at the ER septic and close to death because the staph infection wasnt gone. The next time I saw my new surgeon he was leaning over me in the ER saying  Im sorry but I have to remove the whole thing and after that youre done. He cut me open and I had a pus pocket the size of a football that exploded when he cut me. I spent another week in the hospital and had another 7 weeks of the PICC line and IV infusions. I spoke to the surgeon while still in the hospital and he said he could attempt a 2 stage surgery when the staph was gone. I opted out. I felt that 4 surgeries was way too much for me (5 if you count cancer). I had to move from where I was living in 30 days and am currently renting a room 50 miles from Seattle where I know no one. I still have the dog (shes the only reason I made it this far). and with the rent in Seattle going through the roof, I cant even afford a room for rent so Im trying to find a live-in caregiver position that I could trade for rent. Its been a really long year and Im still trying to comprehend the fact that Ill never be the same. I was living on a horse farm before the surgery, trading work for an apt. on the farm. I loved it more than I ever thought and was hoping to get this hip done and find another farm to live on. That will never happen now because I cant risk being knocked over. I had a house cleaning business (no employees, just me) for 25 years and I cant do that anymore either. Im going crazy with boredom and dont know what to do with myself. Im still on painkillers twice daily and to keep the pain somewhat at bay cant drive too much or stand, sit, walk or lay down for too long. I would love to hear from people who are also living without a hip to share thoughts or ideas about a common situation. No one I have spoken to, including surgeons, physical therapists and the like knows anyone living without a hip. My friend found this site for me. Please reach out to me. I think it would help me to know Im not the only one. Thank you, Robin Liked by lynzze, hiplessgranny, nohip2020 Follow Report"

Cleaned out a lot of arthritis behind knee cap, snipped torn meniscus on the inside of the knee, and also had stem cells inserted in two areas to regrow cartilage. About a month post surgery I started having foot pain, roving at first, then settled in the area of the inner side upper part of the foot (not the arch, although sometimes that bone hurts). The foot actually hurt more than the knee. Have been doing some PT and stretching of the foot and the pain isn't as intense, but it's gone back to roving and I limp more because of the foot than the knee. What could be the cause of this foot pain after arthroscopic knee surgery? Thank you for any insight you can provide. Liked by Teresa, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

So, now I don't know what my next step should be. My PT is wonderful, but he is not a swimmer. We are just trying different options each time I swim. Saturday, I used the waist belt just to try something different with the breast stroke; it was a fun new toy!

After searching through discussion groups, I couldn't find any posts that specifically discussed experiences with rhabdomyolysis. I am hoping to connect with anyone who has had a similar experience. Long story short, June 2018, I went by ambulance to the ER as my entire body was cramped up and in severe pain. I was diagnosed with rhabdo with a CK peaking at 6,000. While that is considered ""mild"", it doesn't consider the effects. I spent 5 days in the hospital undergoing every test possible: blood, CT, ENT, X-rays, etc. My phosphorus was undetectable. I was pumped with fluids. My leg muscles, specifically my calves had completely atrophied and I could not walk. I needed nurse support to get out of bed. The doctors called me a ""medical mystery"" since I did not get rhabdo a typical way (exertional, crush, etc.). Since I had a significant cough for two weeks prior, they settled on it being virally induced. Diagnosis by elimination. I did PT and OT for 2 days in the hospital working with a walker. At home I used a walker for a few weeks until I could get my feet and legs in the position to walk. Then I used a cane. I had in-home PT and OT throughout that summer and did PT at a clinic for 5 months, dismissed to do PT on my own at my gym. I regained my ability to walk independently, but a year and 2 months later I am still dealing with chronic pain in my calves, low stamina and endurance, chronic fatigue, difficulty walking any long distance or on terrain that is not flat. I started seeing a musculoskeletal specialist who diagnosed me with fibromyalgia. I've been on gabapentin and cyclobenzprine (Flexeril) since February and the doctor is convinced I will recover with this treatment, but now I'm not convincedI have really plateaued. This has caused me to take a leave of absence from work and affects my life profoundly. If you have also suffered from rhabdo and the physical effects sustained from it, I would love to chat more. I'm looking for answers as I want to recover as completely as possible. Thanks! Follow Report"

My thumb muscle is atrophied, and the index and middle fingers never grew to full size (I was 8 at the time of the fracture). I have read that the longer one waits, the less likely that surgery will be successful. Any ideas on probability of success? Would you do it or not? Already had EMG/NCV, and have referral to hand surgeon, for consult. Test results are worse that those of 5 years ago. I have functioned successfully this long in this condition. . . . but, part of me feels cheated. Back story: severe break of elbow. Immediately complained of numbness in hand. Was put in traction for a few weeks. The pin pinched the median nerve between the bone. Five months later, had surgery to retrieve nerve from bone. Six months later, still no feeling. Within the next six months, changed doctor, and he said I was good to go. No physical therapy. No nerve testing back then, other than the tinel (?) test. Has anyone had surgery after real long term carpal tunnel? Did it work? What is the worst that could happen? Follow Report"

As well as I received shooting pain from the parts on my spine the sticks out the most. The pain comes mainly while sitting in car about 20mins into being in the car. And hard seats with hard backs, most of the time my back again hard things always creates a bad pain. So I brought it up to my doctor and I was wanting to know the ways of knowing if an adult has spineobifea. Let me add I have ask two others (nurse,docotor) they had me bend and they felt down both side of my spine and told me I did not. The pain then continued so I felt to asking my main doctor and he did the same, had me bend over and felt down both side of spine then informed me I did have it. That my spine created an s formation then straight. Then proceeded to say he needed to check another way as well. (Im going to add the entire time it was only me(female) and my doctor(male) in room. So he had me come to the patent bed and ask me to bend over and pull down my pants n panties n informed me it was another way of checking. Then he put gloves on and stuck one finger in my vagina and one finger in my butt at once felt around and then 2 mins after removed them and then reinforced his statement of me having spineobifea. Then stated we will discuss it more at future visit. I want to know if this is a correct why of checking. Also would like to know if legally he is about to do that with only me and himself in room with door shut and the office being close by the time I had left the building. He had me there 2hrs past his office closing. Im going too add that he runs his own practice and it partans a respitionist and a biling assistant but other then that just himself. Please help me know what is correct and incorrect and if theres anything that should be done. I felt it was weird and no one else knows what to tell me about how diagnosis things.
