The worst side effect I had was hot flashes, but I was undergoing radiation and it was a particularly hot summer here. My Dr took me off it for two weeks and I restarted it in September. I have had very few problems. The first time I had BC, I took tamoxifen and I think that bothered me more. I was anticipating problems this time. The hot flashes are goneI never had them before in my life! I have random aches and pains. One joint in my foot seems to be tender, but it is something I can easily live with. One thing I did notice was the hair thinning. I had it with the tamoxifen and now with this. It really bothered me, but has anyone else had their hair start to grow back? I had searched the internet for a natural substance to help hair growth and found castor oil. Needless to say, I was skeptical. I put it on a cotton ball and dab it lightly on the areas by my temples and my natural hair part and my hairline by my forehead. It is an easy fix if it is a fix. Recently I have noticed new hair growth in the temple areas and in my hair part. It is about an inch + long. It is not as if my hair has suddenly thickened up a lot, but there is a difference. I am not sure if I am just getting used to the medicine or if the castor oil has any effect, but there is a difference. For me, there is an improvement, so I just wanted to let you know that there may be hope for improvement for other people. Liked by Christine Huyber Follow Report"

After about 4 months on Anastrozole I started breaking out in hives and severe itching. That can be a rare side effect of Anastrozole. My doctor had me stop the Anastrozole for several days and the hives and itching went away and I was fine again. My doctor then switched my meds to Tomoxifin. Ive been on that for about 3 weeks and again I have severe itching and hives. Last night I woke up miserable with hives again, they subsided after a few hours. I have no idea if this itching problem is related to my cancer meds. or not, but its driving me crazy. This is the craziest problem Ive had and a very strange side effect.

Surgery went extremely well and felt back to normal within days with very little pain.

I take supplements to help the hot flashes and I can honestly say since I started taking the magnesium and the gabapentin (sp) they seem to be letting up.

Since my last treatment my hair really hasnt come back, no eyebrows, my eyelashes look horrible as well as my fingernails and toenails. The meds they have me on have created such bad hot flashes that at time I cannot breath. I sweat so bad that Ive had to put baby bed pads under my sheets and on top as well. I was takin Anastrozole, at first. This caused such joint pain in my knees that I was having trouble walking. I now take Letrozole, this has cause trigger finger, my fingers curl during the night, I have to wear finger splints, a small consolation compared to the pain I was having before, however, this is has made my hot flashes worse, I never had flashes like this when I went through menopause. I am now in constant pain, more like a flu feeling, very tired, no energy. I dread getting out of bed because I have so much trouble, then it takes me a good 30 to 60 mins. for me to get going. My hands hurt as well as every muscle in my body. I take supplements to help the hot flashes and I can honestly say since I started taking the magnesium and the gabapentin (sp) they seem to be letting up. I also have carpal tunnel in both hands along with bad arthritis which in itself has caused a lot of problems. I also have edema in my legs and feet along with lymphedema in my right arm and hand. I have had two separate surgeries for reconstruction, after the first attempt, the side of my body that I had the radiation on broke open, had to pack it for 3 or 4 mos., then I had surgery to close it up. I had a bilateral latissimus and the opposite side of my body the tissue died. I had to pack it for another 4 mos. This last surgery they got it closed up, I go up on April 1, to have the stitches taken out and well plan on the next step, putting the expanders in. I pray that goes well. Im tired of this, Im depressed over it all, I no longer even look like the person I was. The meds have made me gain so much weight that I cannot fit in any clothes expect sweats or something stretchy. I cant find shoes to fit me because of the edema that I have (it lasts for months at a time). While I was on Chemo I had no edema problems, I had them for years, I never got a cold, never got sick, nothing. I know its a bad drug but in some ways I could actually wear my clothes and shoes. No I never lost weight while I was on chemo, my dr. told me most breast cancer women do no lose, they gain. Well I have definitely gained. I retired in April of 2015, its as good think because I would not be working much. They probably would have asked me to leave. There is no way that I could get up and be at work on time because of the issues I have getting out of bed and moving. Has anyone else experienced this? I know that I have not done a lot, but then again I could not do a lot.

I go to clinic I am checked in. I am asked in passing how I feel. Mostly I just say I am OK. Its all routine. I saw my doctor he examined me we discussed the plan of action for my scans blood work. When a cancer patient is asked a how they feel often its medical. How do you physicallyfeel. Now that I am a routine patient at my cancer center no one stops to ask how I am emotionally. Dont get me wrong there are people you can talk to. I feel things become so routine and some days I feel less emotionally fit than others. I never like going to the cancer center it stresses me. I am better about it but it is still a source of depression  and anxiety for me. When I feel this way I need routine. On my most recent visit I was given an wrist band to wear. I felt branded. Not only do I have to hold on to the appointment reminder disc now I am given an wrist band. It bothered me. So if you are a patient you can easily be identified by the disc and now and a wrist band. That my sound nit picky but I notice everything. If it bothers me it must bother other people as well. What would be good would be a place for patients, all patients, just patients to check in. Ask us how we are today. Ask how we are coping. Ask care givers who bring in patients how they are coping. They should have therapy dogs on patrol. I love dogs and I know that would comfort me. It would take away some of the anxiety I feel each time I go to the cancer center. I am still new to my cancer. Its been 6 months since my cancer diagnosis perhaps that is why I experience so much anxiety. I havent accepted  my cancer. It isnt OK I have it. I am working through this. Asking me how I am is a loaded question. Physically I am OK. Emotionally on some days I can be a bit of a wreck. The mortality aspect for me is a source of great distress at times. I realize I need to have perspective. Take one day at a time. Some days I could use a hug because even though I am adult it is scary to go to the cancer center and some days the child in me is more on the surface than the adult me. So I need to reel in the child and let the adult take hold. Someone suggested mantras. I use one when I feel I need it. I tell myself it will be OK. Its just a visit its just blood work it will be OK. That helps. I believe all cancer patients have PTSD to some extent. I know I have it. This experience has traumatized me. Feeling sick, having symptoms, the diagnosis, the surgery, the recovery, the appointments, the blood work, the scans, the exams, the probing, going back to work, trying to regain normalcy, realizing there is a new normal, learning to live life the best you can. It is a bit much. It does get better and has gotten better. So when I am asked how I am doing it is a complex question and the answer on some days is convoluted. At work people always ask how I am no one knows about my cancer because that is my busy but people know I was sick. I answer I am OK and move on because the question for me is complex. I would like to respond  are you asking how I am physically or emotionally?. No one has time for that. It takes too long. My close friend asked me how I was and she and asked, how are you really?. In this instant and mostly impersonal world I am learning how the simple things, the unspoken words, the touch or hug, are often the most impacting. Cancer is teaching me to pay attention to what is around me, next to me, near by. Life is so precious dont waste it. How are you feeling today? How are you really? Do you need a hug? Are you feeling sad today? Is there something I can do for you right now? Liked by Colleen Young, Connect Director, Scott, Volunteer Mentor, Dee, Nancy, Volunteer Mentor ... see all Follow Report"

Has anyone had this experience, and are there any alternatives? After my MRI, I am wiped out and experience nausea the rest of the day. I seriously dread my MRI. I just completed year three of remission, so I still have two more years to experience this. Follow Report"

I have been feeling OK as of late. Physically I almost feel like me before the cancer. Emotionally I realize that things are now changed forever. In October ,which is here, I will meet my new oncologist. He will order scans and blood work so the cycle of surveillance begins for me. I was told that for the next 2 years I would have scans and blood work. Hopefully my cancer will not return but it just may. There is no way to tell how things will go. I was told that due to my tumor size I am at higher risk for recurrence. I will hope for the best. Many of you have already traveled the cancer trail some are just beginning the journey. Where ever you are with your cancer there is always hope. There may be pain and discomfort but we must fight to beat the beast that is cancer. I want to think of scans as positive in hopes of quelling my anxiety scanxiety. I have scan anxiety right now. A sense of dread intertwined with fear of the unknown. I dont like the drive to the cancer center it tends to fill me with much stress. I dont like checking in for appointments, the same questions asked, the same answers given. I am a cancer patient at a cancer center and that doesnt sit well with me. I have an ID card with my name on it reminding me I am a member of a new club I never thought I would be be a part of! Faces are becoming familiar at the cancer center. At this point of my journey, I feel no comfort in the newfamiliar. It feels very foreign and not part of me. Its been 4 months that is not very long since the cancer  officially invaded my life. Yet in many ways it feels like an eternity. So much has happened in those 4 months. I am grateful that my panic stage is over. I do feel less anxious in general. I am grateful for this site and for everyone who has given me insightful advise and direction. I find it most helpful! I feel supported which is very much appreciated. We all need to feel support! There are so many of us out there! There is strength in numbers!

Once at my new job, I learned how ill equipped I was being a new hire after cancer. My life had been turned upside down. I was meeting my new oncologist, having scans and tests and trying to learn a new job. My new hours didnt agree with my new life after cancer because nothing was as it once was. My boss told me I wasnt performing as expected. No, I was not. I had so much on my plate! My former self without cancer would have been fine learning new tasks but the new me after cancer was a different person. So here I am confronting a new reality. You have a cancer diagnosis and lets face it the company cares but not that much. You still have to do your job and do it well even when you feel sick or have another scan coming up or have a suspicious test result or other unaccounted for lump or mass or symptom that worries you. You are running scared for your life, you need your job because you need your health insurance. People may wonder why you may be a bit slow to learn.

I was told it was a very slow progressing hormone receptor negative cancer that Id had for years. After lumpectomy, chemo, and radiation I had no evidence of cancer for almost 10 years. But was diagnosed again in January 2011 with stage 2 breast cancer in the other breast. This time a hormone receptor positive type. After surgery and remaining on Arimidex for 5 years, In Sept 2016, I was told the cancer had metastasized to my thoracic spine and two ribs. Im told this is connnected to my BRCA1 gene mutation and is the most agggressive breast cancer there is and all that could be offered is palliative care and hope for 3 more years avg. So more chemo which was much harder on me this time, and some radiation. I developed a lung toxicity in my left lung and ended up in the hospital, in and out out of ICU three times, for almost 3 weeks. I couldnt go home so Ive been in assisted living on oxygen full time since July. The left lung was too damaged to get it back to normal but I did surprise all the doctors by actually pulling out of the respiratory failure and making it more than a couple months. So were in the new year now, 2018, and Im still here in the assisted living. Doing pretty well except for the endless debilitating fatigue. Im on hospice and they do an excellent job with pain control and nausea so far. I count my blessings every day for the extra years I was given to see the youngest of my four kids graduate, get married and has 3 little ones now. Im sure Ive seen all my 18 grandchildren. Well, maybe theres another possible one in the future, my son and his wife are still discussing having one morelol And Ive seen 5 great grandchildren, Im sure there will be many more. Ive also been blessed with all of their love and support. Im just wondering if anyone else has stopped all treatments like I have. I did have one more radiation treatment in November and was sick from it for about 6 weeks. Ive decided its not worth being so sick when I could be having fun visits with children and grandchildren. The cancer is just taking its course now and it seems I can feel it slowly taking over. New bone pains, new aches, sleeping longer and longer, more growths or tumors I can feel under the skin. I just dont know what to expect, its kind of scary. Im not afraid of death, I just hope and pray the pain stays under control and I can go peacefully in my sleep. We dont always get what we want but I hope I do this time.Anyone else in my shoes? Liked by Scott, Volunteer Mentor, stoneypath, metalneck Follow Report"

Here is Deborah Boyces Essay: Everyone knows of someone whose lifes been changed by a cancer diagnosis. Its estimated one in three people will contract cancer in their lifetime. Over the years, Ive helped many family members and friends battle a variety of cancers. With each journey, Id think about their choices and the choices I would make if I were in their situation. Then, my world turned upside down. Everything I thought I would or would not do vaporized into a tsunami of uncertainty as I began frantically researching options, trying to figure out what I was going to do. I was desperate for reliable information and support and wasnt sure where to turn. Only one thing was certain. I wanted to enroll in a clinical trial. Why? If I was going to undergo extensive treatments, I wanted to make sure my experiences counted. I wanted the medical community to be one person closer to finding the best means of beating this insidious disease to help future cancer patients. I also wanted to get the best medical treatment available. The dramatic advancements in cancer treatments are a direct result of individuals choosing to participate in clinical trials. People diagnosed with cancer today are getting more targeted and more effective treatment therapies, living longer, and enjoying a higher quality of life thanks to the cancer patients who enroll in clinical trials each year. After interviewing several oncologists, I found one who could enroll me in clinical trials through the Toledo Community Oncology Program (TCOP). The treatments I received were the same as those I could have received had I traveled to a major cancer clinic, but I didnt have to leave home! Im participating in my 5th clinical trial now, and because of my experiences, Ive become a passionate advocate and supporter of cancer research, patient support and access to information. For seven years Ive served on TCOPs Institutional Review Board as a community member, reviewing clinical trial protocols and consent forms to ensure participants are clearly informed and understand all of the treatment options available to them. Ive chaired TCOPs patient advocacy committee and made numerous presentations to share my experiences and dispel popular myths about clinical trials. People mistakenly believe clinical trials are a choice of last resort. Or, think their medical care would be compromised and that they would be treated like a guinea pig. Nothing could be further from the truth. The clinical trials TCOP offers provide the best standard of care treatments available. Each participant is closely monitored to ensure the best medical care possible is delivered. And, if participants are receiving the investigational treatment, and its proven to be effective, those participants are among the first to benefit from what could be deemed the best new standard of care treatment! I also work to improve the quality of life and care for those touched by cancer and the mental health issues illness can bring to the lives of those living with, or at risk of developing, disease. While working for WBGU-PBS, I launched an ambitious outreach campaign to raise awareness of the need for clinical trial research and cancer education, prevention and early detection. As project manager, I worked to create and build local and national partnerships, develop and distribute public affairs television programs, print and video materials, media campaigns, special events and a support website with inspirational video testimonials by cancer survivors. This Building A Living Legacy of Hope cancer awareness campaign earned a 2009 Community Impact Award For Engagement from The Corporation for Public Television. Being able to participate in Mayos incredible professional development opportunity would allow me to share my experiences and insights as both a patient and caregiver, and as a patient advocate and health educator. While Ive had Facebook and Twitter accounts since 2009, Id been mostly a lurker until I joined the ranks of the unemployed in January. Social media is now my lifeline. The weeks activities would enable me to build my healthcare knowledge base, network, and learn how to strategically integrate a variety of social media to continue building this Living Legacy of Hope for patients and caregivers. This scholarship opportunity could turn my beloved avocation into a much-needed new vocation! Liked by Laurel Kelly, dboyce, natewilhelm, tobysinger@hotmail.com ... see all Follow Report"

Here is Liza Bernsteins Essay: In early 1994, when I was newly diagnosed with my First Breast Cancer, I was initiated as an ePatient via a pre-internet social network  people connecting with phones. My oncologist put me in touch with a former patient and encouraged me to ask her about her story of surviving cancer. Im certain she knew that this woman would not only inspire me, but share tips and connect me to resources that would help me on my way which, of course, she did. Thats how I discovered Harold Benjamins book From Victim to Victor, and the then quasi revolutionary concept of Patient Active. This approach, which my oncologist and her former patient modeled, clicked for me, and thus began my ePatient journey. In October 2005, when I began the recovery process from my Second breast cancer, I joined a support group moderated by both my radiation oncologist and an oncology social worker. I discovered the power of sharing stories and information in a safe setting and found much solace in my ability to help and inspire people by just being there as a 2x survivor. In December 2010, when I was recovering from 18 months of chemotherapy and surgery for my Third breast cancer, I followed my curiosity about new research at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, explored their website, and found the events Twitter hashtag: #sabcs. I read and read the feed until I saw a statement that intrigued me, at which point I jumped in and asked a question. Next thing I knew a real person from a real, top-notch cancer center took the time to answer me, and my first (of what has now become many) real Twitter conversation about health care began. Heres that seminal tweet (Im @itsthebunk): danafarber: @itsthebunk 1) Fear/denial; some women feel they dont want to know. 2) The recent guideline changes make things less clear-cut. #sabcs 12/09/2010 Those three crucial experiences plus many more are what led me to become an informal patient advocate. I cant tell you how many cancer patients Ive helped since 1994. Its been an ad-hoc process thats come about organically. Someone refers a friend. someone asks a question in a support group my oncologist asks if I dont mind talking to a new patient Ive been through it all  each of my cancers were primaries; each was caught early and treated aggressively  and learned so much. While utterly disrupting my life, each episode has also been an opportunity for growth. Ive refined my knowledge, learned new things  coping methods, how to really heal, for example  and developed my own tricks of the trade. Im deeply passionate about helping others become well-informed, engaged patients because I know one simple thing: getting a serious disease is horrible, BUT you have choices for dealing with it. If you can become a partner in your own care, your journey will be less difficult, you will be able to find grace and come to peace with agonizing decisions, you will meet some amazing people on the way, and you will discover how much inner strength you never knew you had. Now, I use Social Media. Im connecting with people on a larger scale, loving every second of it and want to do more of it. Maybe even make a living doing it. Every week, I look forward to both the #hcsm (Health Care Social Media) and #bcsm (Breast Cancer Social Media) chats on Twitter. If I had the means to attend this Mayo Clinic summit I would have signed up when I heard about it! Im requesting a scholarship because while my health is much better since my most recent cancer battle, Im still in the process of getting back on my feet financially and professionally. Ive worked in the field of Interactive Media since 1991, primarily as a freelancer, and am seeking to combine my life and work experience to help improve peoples day-to-day experiences of illness and interactions with their medical teams. Im interested in using both social media and mobile applications to this end, and want to keep learning as much about it as possible. There are ideas Id like to discuss with experts and peers, such as: how to engage more patients and train them to use social media to improve their health and interactions with their doctors; how to use social media to help regular patients become ePatients; social media literacy. I want to meet people similarly passionate about all of this as well as innovation in health care in general, and to share my insights. I know I have a lot to give and would be honored to be able to.

I go to clinic I am checked in. I am asked in passing how I feel. Mostly I just say I am OK. Its all routine. I saw my doctor he examined me we discussed the plan of action for my scans blood work. When a cancer patient is asked a how they feel often its medical. How do you physicallyfeel. Now that I am a routine patient at my cancer center no one stops to ask how I am emotionally. Dont get me wrong there are people you can talk to. I feel things become so routine and some days I feel less emotionally fit than others. I never like going to the cancer center it stresses me. I am better about it but it is still a source of depression  and anxiety for me. When I feel this way I need routine. On my most recent visit I was given an wrist band to wear. I felt branded. Not only do I have to hold on to the appointment reminder disc now I am given an wrist band. It bothered me. So if you are a patient you can easily be identified by the disc and now and a wrist band. That my sound nit picky but I notice everything. If it bothers me it must bother other people as well. What would be good would be a place for patients, all patients, just patients to check in. Ask us how we are today. Ask how we are coping. Ask care givers who bring in patients how they are coping. They should have therapy dogs on patrol. I love dogs and I know that would comfort me. It would take away some of the anxiety I feel each time I go to the cancer center. I am still new to my cancer. Its been 6 months since my cancer diagnosis perhaps that is why I experience so much anxiety. I havent accepted  my cancer. It isnt OK I have it. I am working through this. Asking me how I am is a loaded question. Physically I am OK. Emotionally on some days I can be a bit of a wreck. The mortality aspect for me is a source of great distress at times. I realize I need to have perspective. Take one day at a time. Some days I could use a hug because even though I am adult it is scary to go to the cancer center and some days the child in me is more on the surface than the adult me. So I need to reel in the child and let the adult take hold. Someone suggested mantras. I use one when I feel I need it. I tell myself it will be OK. Its just a visit its just blood work it will be OK. That helps. I believe all cancer patients have PTSD to some extent. I know I have it. This experience has traumatized me. Feeling sick, having symptoms, the diagnosis, the surgery, the recovery, the appointments, the blood work, the scans, the exams, the probing, going back to work, trying to regain normalcy, realizing there is a new normal, learning to live life the best you can. It is a bit much. It does get better and has gotten better. So when I am asked how I am doing it is a complex question and the answer on some days is convoluted. At work people always ask how I am no one knows about my cancer because that is my busy but people know I was sick. I answer I am OK and move on because the question for me is complex. I would like to respond  are you asking how I am physically or emotionally?. No one has time for that. It takes too long. My close friend asked me how I was and she and asked, how are you really?. In this instant and mostly impersonal world I am learning how the simple things, the unspoken words, the touch or hug, are often the most impacting. Cancer is teaching me to pay attention to what is around me, next to me, near by. Life is so precious dont waste it. How are you feeling today? How are you really? Do you need a hug? Are you feeling sad today? Is there something I can do for you right now? Liked by Colleen Young, Connect Director, Scott, Volunteer Mentor, Dee, Nancy, Volunteer Mentor ... see all Follow Report"

Even if Im not in treatment right now I really have to pay attention because if I over eat I feel more short of breath and very uncomfortable. An article this morning showed up in my in-box on just this topic. What timing! Its written by Jessica Iannotta. She goes into more detail but essentially her main point is to plan ahead- to make sure that your dietary needs are met. This means that if you go to someones home for a party or dinner bring what you need to eat if you have a restricted diet. If you arent feeling well but need to eat then try and eat something that is colorful! Its most likely tastier than plane looking food. When I was going through chemo I craved spicier food. It didnt bother my stomach and made it so that I could taste something. But your story might be the opposite. Also if you need to eat before taking your medicine it doesnt mean eating a full meal. A couple of crackers might just be enough. And take heed if you need a certain type of food to take with your medicines, or avoid with them. I know that this might seem a bit daunting but if you are well enough to visit than do try and get out to be with family and friends if this is something that you want. If you cant drive than ask someone to take you and bring you home if need be. If you stay home then make sure that your pantry is well stocked and perhaps someone can make up some meals that all you have to do is heat up or defrost. Above all have a safe and protected holiday and may next year be a better one! Liked by Colleen Young, Connect Director, Nancy, Volunteer Mentor, Becky, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

I have been feeling OK as of late. Physically I almost feel like me before the cancer. Emotionally I realize that things are now changed forever. In October ,which is here, I will meet my new oncologist. He will order scans and blood work so the cycle of surveillance begins for me. I was told that for the next 2 years I would have scans and blood work. Hopefully my cancer will not return but it just may. There is no way to tell how things will go. I was told that due to my tumor size I am at higher risk for recurrence. I will hope for the best. Many of you have already traveled the cancer trail some are just beginning the journey.

Anxiety, for me started at the time of diagnosis, Large B Cell Lymphoma, the initial shock of that knowledge was the trigger. It is not that it occupied every minute of the day, with everything else that accompanies cancer treatment, there was more than enough happening to occupy the hours. I also recognized that the triggers changed as I moved along the path of cancer care and treatment. Anxiety also led to some wakefulness which led to fatigue, other common side effects. Some of the triggers of anxiety for me were: How early do we need to leave the house to make it to the appointment on time. Will I have any side effects from this session? Are the sounds of the IV pumps during chemotherapy going to bother me today? (interestingly, those pumps made me very anxious almost all the time.) To combat anxiety, I took the following actions to lessen this symptom of cancer: Exercise, when I had the energy I walked out of doors, outdoor distractions helped to focus my mind on what I was doing in the present. I meditated and used apps such as Calm to take my mind off the stresses. When I could, I took advantage of a counselor who coached me to discuss how I was feeling about things.

How do I get it?,"I know that I have been confused as to what palliative care means until my oncologist recently used it in reference to me me! I said, Whoa, hold your horses am I dying or near the end, I have plans? All of my life I have known it to be in reference to dying patients, keeping them comfortable and pain free. Boy was I wrong!The goal of palliative care is to help people with serious illnesses feel better. It prevents or treats symptoms and side effects of disease and treatment. Palliative care also treats emotional, social, practical, and spiritual problems that illnesses can bring up. When the person feels better in these areas, they have an improved quality of life.Palliative care can be given at the same time as treatments meant to cure or treat the disease. Palliative care may be given when the illness is diagnosed, throughout treatment, during follow-up, and at the end of life.https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000536.htmI am blessed to have such an excellent oncologist. Dr. Jennifer Temel is an expert in palliative care and uses it with her patients along with other doctors caring for that patient. Palliative care needs to begin at diagnosis and follow you through your illness- from hang nail to manicure. (http://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/jennifer-s-temel-md/) So with out further blathering please read what she has to say because she says it perfectly.https://www.ascopost.com/archive/meetings/2015-palliative-care-in-oncology-symposium/jennifer-s-temel-mds-expert-perspective-palliative-care-in-2015/(By the way, its true- the camera does add 10 lbs on!)My palliative care has been excellent since the very beginning. After surgery I have had every pain and discomfort tended to, medicines or suggestions given to me, explanations made as clear as they could on the day that I asked. I think of palliative care as having a new mommy. This is the video that Dr. Temel refers to at the end of her talk. https://www.ascopost.com/archive/meetings/2015-palliative-care-in-oncology-symposium/vicki-jackson-md-mph-on-effective-care-integration-and-the-comanagement-model/ What have your Palliative care experiences been like?

My husband was diagnosed with Stage 4 colorectal cancer just shy of 2 years ago. It was unexpected in his otherwise healthy life, and we were told he likely had 6-12 months left. The experience of 4 missed diagnosis, travel from Florida to Houston for verification and initial treatment, referraly to Mayo's Jax office, relocating to be closer to treatment (still 3 hours away), maintaining and then modifying my work to be a remote contributor, losing my 14 year old dog, assisting my new college age son to relocate to Kansas City. it's been a wild ride. He has reacted incredibly well from chemo that is now given orally every other week. I see the impact on him (dizzyness, less mental acuity, numbness, frequent urination, numbness in his feet, etc.) but he has an amazingly positive attitude and faith in God that has kept him going. I guess my faith isn't quite so intense and I find myself sometimes ""fine"" and sometimes with this increasing level of angst, frustration, anger that all this has happened. This is a second mariage for me after raising my son alone, and we were just starting to settle into a nice life. Clearly not everything is ""fair"" in life, but on some days I hae a hard time embracing that. His children are not with us and not terribly supportive anyway (one is a teen, so that's normal; the other should be an adult at 33 but really isnt). My son has been a positive support for me, but he's starting his own life as he should. My husband is loving, kind, eager to please and until this pandemic did most of our food sohpping and cooking. How awesome is that when you work!! He'd even love to have sex (at age 73) with regularity, and yet between menopause issue (age 61), I have little to no interest. Plus, I have read that the chemo isn't good for the partner (not sure if that's true or not). We have so much to be thankful for  we are able to manage his treatments from home with just periodic scans since they say he cancer is greatly reduced; we have a comfortable home and lifestyle thanks to my job; our extended families are loving, although not near by. Yet somehow, I still feel like some days I can barely breath or lighten my heart. I know it's not his fault but I find myself resentful of how this has happened and feel terrible for it. Maybe I need a kick in the pants along with my morning walks, but it would be nice to hear how other caregivers move through these types of feelings. Thanks for letting me vent..

We were both at our end. We fought the good fight for a very long time knowing there was no cure. It is going to take awhile to change speeds and join the world around me. I am working on recovering my health and beginning to take care of long ignored business matters. I am grateful for the opportunity to caregive my husband and I will always be amazed at how exhausting, sad, frustrating, rewarding and painful caregiving was for me. I could not have done it without the chat groups of other caregivers sharing so honestly about their journey and their many tips on how to do various processes at home. God bless each of you.

Those dental inserts used dentists to keep the mouth open is not available at all. Those dental sponges is certainly not recommended for oral hygiene.

It will be 6 years on valentines day. About a year later it metastasized to both lungs. There are a lot of small modules in both lungs. He had a lung biopsy done and confirmed it is colon cancer. He has taken all of the chemos and immunotherapy for colon cancer.He has worked pretty much everyday except for surgeries or chemo days. It has taken me a long time but, I get it now. He works to keep busy and keep his mind off it.He takes care of all his own needs. So I dont really feel I deserve the title of caregiver. But yet, here I am feeling lonely, depressed, and sad most of the time. The last 2 weeks I went through a really dark time. I might mention that during these 6 years I lost my mom, dad and in February my youngest brother died suddenly of a massive heart attack.No matter what I say or do it is wrong. He likes a food one week, so I buy it again and suddenly he doesnt really like it. Nothing I cook is right. Nothing I say is right. Nothing I do is right in his eyes. I act silly with the grandkids and he shakes his head in disapproval.I realize he is sick, and not feeling well. I try to remember that he is just taking it out on me cause Im the closest one to him.All of my family lives in different states. I work full time, take a yoga class once a week and ride my stationary bike at least 45 minutes 4 days a week. Last summer I broke the tibula and fibula off in my right ankle. Had emergency surgery and still not 100%. Im 62 so maybe its as good as its going to get.Wow seems sort of selfish when I re read this. Mostly about me.I notice in the past several weeks he seems to be breathing harder. He finally admitted he gets out of breath easy and has heart palpitations.I want to know what to watch for next. I know everyone is different and there is no set answer. But is this something he can overcome? When I ask the dr he said we always hope to cure.Wow sorry so long.

Suggestions?,"<p>Its only been about two months since my Mom fell and broke her shoulder. The problems started 4 days later when her hand and elbow became contracted and she became fearful of standing, walking, being pushed in a wheelchair, riding in the car, scared of the dark. She is scare of everything. All of a sudden shes lonely, she wants me to sit in her room all night. She calls me all the time starting 30 minutes after I put her to bed. Are you awake, when she asks if Im awake she doesnt wand anything just wants to know. What time is it, she has a clock a inches away. Is it morning? Can I get up 2, 3, 4, 5, 6am Im thirsty, hungry, uncomfortable, adjust my pillow, open the window/door, Im hot/cold. When I walk with her she screams out SLOW DOWN, YOUR GOING TO FAST we are stopped, not moving at all or Im falling or Im going to fall. It NEVER stops, NEVER. My Dad was paralyzed from the neck down and was more independent and he had total confidence in me. My Mom doesnt trust me at all. She was independent prior to the fall and now shes totally dependent on me for everything. Under the best of circumstances I seldom sleep. Im often up for days. Good thing I guess. But I cant keep this up. I dont know how to get her to trust me. I dont mind doing everything that needs doing, well cooking and cleaning isnt at the top of the list but I keep us alive and the house hasnt been condemned. So I suppose my question is, is she being reasonable?<br />Thanks,<br />Jake</p> Liked by Scott, Volunteer Mentor, Becky, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

This past week I really got to thinking about all us caregivers here as I had a set of unusual triggers hit me, as the kids say these days right in the feels. Im wondering if other caregivers, present and past, get effected by triggers as I do? First was when our daughter was admitted to the hospital for a serious illness. Other than for visiting in a hospital I hadnt been in the working areas since I had been caring for my wife. As I drove the hour from our home to the hospital to be with our daughter I was overcome with not only my worry for her, but by a crush of emotions as I was overwhelmed by memories of the times I had to be in this crisis mode with my wife. When I arrived I got hit with another trigger as our daughter was in the same hospital where my wife got her first diagnosis of her brain cancer. Walking through those same front doors, I actually had to sit and cry in the lobby before I went back into the ER. In short order she was transferred to the ICU. I had not been in an ICU since my wife spent days in the NICU at Mayo. The noises, IVs, rush of nursing, regular monitoring, the feelings of fear, etc. triggered wave upon wave of emotion and memories. Thankfully our daughters condition did improve and she was able to return home and is well on the mend. Then the next kind of crazy trigger hit. Before getting ill our daughter had arranged to adopt a rescue Lab. She couldnt go to pick up her dog so I made the trek and agreed to keep her for the week until she could join us. Her name is Stella and I was slammed again. Shaking, ribs sticking out, sores on her body, and then the intermediary said to me you better be a good caregiver, she needs a lot of TLC. Just him using that word sent me into a spin again. Stella is improving and a truly sweet dog, then another wave. This is the time of year I have a lot of trigger events in quick succession. This was the time of year my wife suffered incredibly in her final days. Its also when we celebrate and remember her birthday, our anniversary, and then the day of her passing. I know my emotions are far more raw and release easier in life. Heck, I even cried watching EndGame with our grandsons!

He has been fastidious about his health, diet and exercise for many years, so this diagnosis has been shocking. Although he had concerns about bleeding hemmoroids, multiple doctors missed it, and several belittled his concerns. Eventually, a colonoscopy, followed by a PET scan revealed the diagnosis about 7 weeks ago. Since then, we have been to a local cancer center, MD Anderson and Mayo. While MD Anderson said it is not curable, Mayo tells us that this is a marathon  not a sprint, and provides hope with a variety of strategies. I struggle between despair and anger. I feel like I stepped into somebody elses nightmare, only to learn that its mine. Im sad for my husband, for the loss of our future plans and the life ahead of us. My husband has a great attitude  better than mine. His faith is growing stronger in God, and Im trying to find that too.

They put a blood pressure monitor on my son's arm and told me to walk around for six hours. So we walked all around Rochester and visited the art center, public library, and ate a greasy hamburger in a famous place. Then we dropped blood pressure cuff in box and we left. Then we came back for diagnosis of hypertension and my son started meds. That was two years ago. Now we are coming back. I have no idea what will happen with ophthalmology.

This report opens this way ""According to this study, eight in ten Americans say that caregiving is the ""new normal"" in American families. Forty million Americans are currently caregivers  almost as many as the number of Americans holding student debt. These caregivers are providing assistance to nearly 50 million adults receiving care."" WOW! 40 million of us are nonprofessional caregivers and we are caring for some 50 million of our family and friends. We are hardly a cottage industry that is for sure! It continues with more staggering numbers. Family members provide more than 95% of nonprofessional care for older adults who do not live in nursing facilities. In total family caregivers provide 37 BILLION hours of care annually! Caregivers looking after family or friends log three times as many hours per year than professional caregivers. The estimated value of our caregiving is roughly $500 billion a year  this is 3 TIMES GREATER than Medicaid's expenditures for professional long-term care! Plus they estimate 7 in 10 Americans turning 65 today will need care for prolonged periods in their lives. They also point out care is expensive! A full time home health aide costs, on average, $46,000 a year while a semi-private room in a nursing home runs $82,000 a year! Like I said staggering! Not surprising to any of us caregivers the report states ""Forty-three percent of our respondents said that the biggest negative surprise of caregiving was how much care and care-related expenses cost."" There is much more of interest in this report and I will post more as I slice and dice it! Strength, Courage, and Peace!

One was my brother-in-law who had a liver transplant 4 years ago. Another was my massage therapist who said stress is starting to affect my health and that she has noticed that my personality has changed since my husband's diagnosis. It's been suggested that I get away for a couple days, so I'm debating about going too my sister's house. What's making me nervous about it is the fact that my husband's MELD is up to 30, so ""the call"" could come anytime now. (His brother transplanted at a 31.) I would have a plan in place of what to do if the call did happen to come while I'm gone. I also wouldn't go if my husband isn't comfortable with it. I just really need a break. Would I be out of line if I go? Thank you, JoDee Liked by Scott, Volunteer Mentor Follow Report"

The day came, as I knew it would, when I needed care myself. After having odd symptoms for a couple of months I contacted my Mayo Clinic primary care physician. Tests were ordered and they showed a dark spot on my tummy. A surgery appointment was made for me. As it turned out, I had stage one uterine cancer and needed a hysterectomy. Who would care for my husband? Again, I contacted my husbands primary care physician, and she referred me to a social worker. My husband had just been hospitalized for pneumonia and was very weak. The social worker arranged for rehabilitation at a local facility. He has made progress and is coming home tomorrow. I write for The Caregiver Space website and am working on an article about being a caregiver when you need care yourself. If you havent thought about this, I encourage you to do so, and prepare for the possibility. Like the Scouts, caregivers need to be prepared.

I recently finished an interview on the value and values of Connect and that has me thinking back to why I first came to Connect and what it was I hoped to find here. I came to Mayo Connect to fight my feelings of isolation and the terrors of caregiving. I remember thinking at that time I must be the only person experiencing all I was trying to manage. So I reached out and looked for something online for caregivers since the only time I had to myself was usually around 2 in the morning. Connect to the rescue! As you all know, caregiving changes each of us in a variety of ways. In my opinion no one can be a caregiver and not be changed by the vastness of what we experience, learn, stumble upon, and most of all accomplish as we refocus our lives towards our treasured patients. While I will most likely never get to the point that some folks say in articles I read that 'caregiving was the best time of my life', I can say caregiving for me was more like that famous (at least famous to a grizzled old guy like me) Clint Eastwood movie. I lived ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"". Many of us caregivers are thrown into our role with little to no warning, with no employee manual, no job description or pay, and precarious support structures. As we wade deeper into caregiving we are often confronted with feelings of helplessness, loneliness, inadequacy, short fused, and with many mixed emotions as the realities of our new job become more and more evident. In my case one of the other feelings I had to carry, try to work though, and eventually simply accept was the fact those I anticipated or hoped would be at the ready to support my wife and I in her time of illness were not to be found in my new world  and I do believe caregiving is a world all its own! I have been helped in this part of my journey by the fact my father was an alcoholic and I went though portions of his treatment program multiple times, attended AA meetings, and still to this day, decades later, attend Al-Anon. While I know the 12 Steps are not for everyone, I found myself using them to help me manage my life as a caregiver. I am still working through Step Nine. I still find myself wishing there were more places, as Mayo Connect is, willing to allow the real voices to be heard of those who are in the great majority of caregivers and not just giving voice to the stories of the .01% who have employers who pay them full pay while a caregiver, offer full benefits on leave, or have unlimited wallets allowing them to provide support to their loved ones, which most of us mere mortals can never ever hope to no matter how much we wish we could. I also believe, as a caregiver, how I am processing the grief I am living over the loss of my wife differently than many non-caregiving folks process grief. (Terrible sentence, but I hope you get the idea.) Plus certain aspects of it continue to come into my life, such as our adult daughter just now finding her voice to discuss with me some of her deeper anxieties, doubts, and pains over the loss of her mom. One thing she did tell me was she was forever grateful I spoke with her about signing HIPPA forms with her mom so she was able to speak directly with her mom's medical professionals during her long war with brain cancer. It was an uncomfortable, dicey conversation, but she just made it all worth the discomfort of the time. I've gone on far too long, but those of you here who know me also know I love to write and share about caregiving.

I've gone on far too long, but those of you here who know me also know I love to write and share about caregiving. Again I hope this finds you all managing as well as can be hoped for and I will close with one of my favorite quotes, which is still taped above my desk. From Mary Anne Radmacher it says: ""Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow"". I'd love to hear how each of you are getting along at this time! Strength, Courage, and Peace to all! Liked by Colleen Young, Connect Director, Jamie Olson Follow Report"

She was admitted after 4 calls to local law enforcement that were a result of her own hallucinations. After stabilizing medications, and a transfer to a more advanced psych unit the second week, she was stable but hostile. She submitted a 72 hour release form against medical advise, and quite honestly I think they were glad to be rid of her as she was disruptive in the unit. They released her with 8 prescriptions and no instructions for myself or my 86 year old dad. Because she is an adult, and she lives alone, privacy laws do not allow us access to her diagnosis, medication instructions, etc. She has now isolated herself due to the spirits as well as hallucinations that she is being watched by people outside with binoculars and is refusing to take her meds or seek medical attention. I live 30 miles from her, have a career, a husband, and truly a life that I love. Obviously, since I am her only sibling and my pop is independent, but elderly and he is a widow, it seems I am the one to take charge of the situation. But that of itself is a challenge. My dad has always rolled with what has always been a demanding sister, he has enabled her every whim for many many years. I expect that her mental illness has been progressing for some time, but has escalated to what it is now. Basically she is terrified and he is in denial due to the shame of mental illness. I can see it clearly, but am not sure where to go from here. She has a history of brain injury and stroke and has been on disability for 16 years. She is refusing MRI. She seems to be constantly reaching to the past and delusional about who is living, dead, and the whos who of the many people she has driven out of her life over the years. Even to the point that she believes an ex husband, who none of us have seen in 20 years and since remarried, is coming to reunite with her. That is just one of the many impossible delusions she has. Anyone else encounter a similar situation? Am I destined to get an attorney and have her committed? Ive not been able to find a peer sibling support group locally in central Ohio. Thats why I landed here in hopes of finding some answers. Thank you for listening and for any support you can give by sharing similar experiences and results.

Maybe fishing, visit to local park, take in a movie,whatever suits their needs to get some relief from the depression, if only for a few hours. Perhaps its the constant pain, feeling exhausted, worrying about bathroom availability, being on oxygen, weight gain/loss, needing wheelchair, or scooter.I would like to hear from others how they are able to help motivate their patient or loved one to enjoy some of the life they still have.No one knows when the lord will call so we need to take advantage of the remaining time. How do YOU help with motivation? What activity can YOU suggest that may encourage someone to do something to make the day more enjoyable than staying home? I know there must be some patients as well as some caregivers that could use time away from home. Liked by Colleen Young, Connect Director, John, Volunteer Mentor, jodeej Follow Report"

I have been caring for my husband since 2014. He was given a short life expectancy in 2015 and surpassed the date. Physically he has his ups and downs and mentally, is where the greatest challenge for me lies. He has become very self absorbed, angry and bitter at the world for the most part. I have organised counselling on going since 2014 and hes on anti depressants. I am his life coach at times, among the other carer duties. I find myself so drained, mentally and emotionally and that is what is taking its toll on me physically. Family are not nearby and when they come to visit, they stay the night causing more work for me. Although this morning , I stood up for myself and spoke my truth. His brother is coming to visit for a few nights. I said cook for yourselves and clean up after yourselves, now that you are feeling better, you can do that. He is on a new chemo, right off the trails and has energy for about 4 hours a day. He gets treatment once every 3 weeks, On the week he gets treatment, I spend a lot of energy caring for him, the following week he feels better and wants to go do things, which is great. Although, not with me. I can understand we need time apart, for sure. But it has developed into a cycle of Being a Carer only. To get him to do things around the house leads to an argument. I am grateful to have a counsellor from the Cancer Council but its the day to day living that is very difficult. His cancer flares up randomly, just when i start to apply for a part time job somewhere, something happens at home. I hope the medical community understands all the ramifications that come with living with cancer, with long term terminal illness. As a carer, I have never been more tired daily, in my life. I thought the first few weeks after childbirth were the most exhausted Ive ever been but this doesnt compare. Its hard to find joy or any happiness with him. I look for it with my friends and family , when I do have contact. You see, we live in the country about 3 hours from a major city. The house is going up for sale, next week, (more work for me), so we can move back to the city and closer to his family. Thank you for giving me a place to say whats going on.

I found my wife and myself connecting on a very different, and in hindsight I now say, unique level. Rather than being strained by caregiving, our love flourished and deepened. We had been married for 27 years before her diagnosis and were having a fairly unremarkable life together. Two jobs, two kids, two dogs, two extended families (which gave us both love and fits at times), etc. Then we discovered we were to actually be given two lives together. Wed lived the for better and in health portions of our vows. Now we were to embark on a new life where we would work on the for worse and in sickness segments. As every caregiver here knows, the day your patient and you hear the words of your diagnosis lives change. In our case that change would be a forever change. During my caregiving I learned many new skills, tactics, and strategies, but what I didnt expect to encounter was the deepening of the connection my patient and I had. After all, after 27 years of being together, we both felt we pretty much had our love and feelings for each other figured out. But we didnt. This deepening of our connection certainly didnt make caregiving a bed of roses, nor easy, but it was nonetheless amazing to me. It was also the underpinning that gave me the strength to rise to the often overwhelming demands of caregiving each day, day after day. For the last five years of my wifes life she was totally dependent on me. Even when our children were at their youngest, I had never had anyone so totally and completely dependent on me for every aspect of their life. When our children had been tiny there had always been a partner to help, parents, grandparents, friends, etc. who offered to lend a hand in the tough times. But I was to find this not to be with caregiving. My wife needed food, clothing, medicines, routine, bathing, exercise, communications, medical care, patient advocacy, and much more. That was all on me. The new level of connection didnt dawn on me right away. Rather it was one day when I was banging around the laundry room. Not particularly happy having to wash another, and unexpected, set of bed linens, nightgowns, etc. while I also had a meal to prepare, a house that was a mess, a boss who was angry I had caregiving duties encroaching in my life, and more. I knew I banged the wash machine lid down harder than I should have when in the silence after I could hear my wife quietly weeping in her bed. Between her sobs I heard her say Damn me! Damn me! I should be doing this for Scott. I stood around the corner frozen by those words. There she was bedridden, fighting brain cancer, and she was mad at herself because I had her laundry to do. I mumbled to myself no, honey. You should be mad at me for acting like a spoiled brat! I steeled myself, walked into our room, sat on the edge of the bed, and held her hand. I have no idea how long we held each other and cried. After some length of time we realized we were each saying the same thing through our tears I am sorry! That day my view of caregiving changed. We both agreed neither of us had chosen our roles, certainly didnt like them better than our previous lives, nor did we have any option but to accept them. I sat alone later that night in silent darkness of our living room and it was then I came to embrace my role as caregiver. Every aspect of her life now depended on me.

The other day I was in the grocery store and noted an item with the words guilt free in its name. With a smile I said to myself I wish there had been a guilt free version of caregiving! During the 14 years of my being my best halfs fulltime caregiver there was one thing ever present in my life besides the needs of my wife. It was guilt. Unfortunately guilt and caregiving often go hand-in-hand. It was always there. I am sure many of you caregivers reading this have experienced this as well. There is the guilt from not having enough time. There is never, ever enough time in a day to meet all the needs thrust upon a caregiver. There is the guilt from not knowing what you should actually be doing at times. As I have said often, caregiving was the toughest job I ever took  and there was no employee manual nor training. It was just jump in and just try not to drown! There is the guilt from exhaustion. Many nights I felt overwhelming guilt when I would take five on the sofa only to wake hours later with the house lights ablaze, the dirty dishes still in the sink, untouched laundry piles, and remembering I had never had the two minutes it takes to get the mail. There is the guilt from the conflicting demands of caregiving and work. The needs of my wide were paramount to me. My boss at my job felt her demands were of more importance. The conflict was unavoidable as was the intense guilt this produced. There is guilt laid on you by others  some unintentional, some not. I know much of the guilt others laid on me was unintentional when they were simply trying to make me feel better. However, every time someone told me to take care of yourself, but offered no help to do so, the guilt set in. Then there were the intentional comments from those who knew little to nothing about our situation, but felt entitled to chime in and tell me I was doing something the wrong way. There is guilt from noticing, day and night, the piles of laundry, dust bunnies skittering across the floor, gathering dust, and the backroom jammed with those things you dont have the time to put anywhere else. Out of sight out of mind was my pattern! There is the guilt from not having the skills to do all needed by your patient. The big and the small. In the small category I always felt guilty I could never brush my wifes hair well enough to get it into as smooth a ponytail as she could in the old days. In the large category I always felt guilty that I was continually far too clumsy when changing her pads, bedclothes, and linens. There is the guilt from the anger that creeps into your thoughts. Exhaustion, pressure, and sadness often lead to feelings of anger. There is the guilt from the unmet needs of others, which you are forced to lay by the wayside. In my case it was not being able to give our children and grandchildren the amount of time and attention they deserved from their dad and grandfather. My defense against this guilt was a mantra of saying to myself Courage does not always roar. Sometimes it is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying I will try again tomorrow.

490,C0265514,Dermatofibrosis lenticularis disseminata,"C0015672, C0030193, C0392674","Fatigue, Pain, Exhaustion",https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/insights-into-caregiving/,Insights into Caregiving,"Hello to caregivers everywhere! I hope this finds you having as good a day as possible and your burdens not too heavy today. My name is Scott and as some of you already know I was the primary caregiver for my wife during her 14+ year battle with brain cancer. We were married for 41 years and she was 49 when first diagnosed. During the first 8 years of her battle I was employed as well as being her primary caregiver. Due to a new boss who sought only employees who will give 100% to their job with no distractions for the next 5 years I was unemployed and 24/7 fulltime caregiver. For her last 14 months, my wife chose in-home hospice care, during which time I continued to be her 24/7 primary caregiver with some critical support from a terrific hospice team. As you can see, as a caregiver I am what I like to refer to as well-seasoned. It sounds a lot better than tired, battle weary, beat-up, etc. So I go with well-seasoned. I still miss my wife terribly. The adjustment has been challenging for me to manage at times and so far it isnt getting any better. I believe there is not any new normal as so many tell me to go and find, but simply that my life is now just plain different and always will be. This said, I have been spending some time thinking back on the demands and realities of my years as a caregiver. As I say to our children, I call this the good, the bad, and the blurry. The good because it taught me several valuable lessons; the bad as there were far too many truly terrible experiences; and the blurry since much of those years were spent sleep deprived, exhausted, and at sixes and sevens. As I also say to our children caregiving is the only job I ever accepted where there was no employee manual nor training program offered. Just jump in the middle of the ocean and try not to drown! As I look back Ive decided Id like share a few of what I have come to see, in hindsight, as critical aspects of caregiving, how I managed them, and what, if any tricks I learned in the process. I share them here for any other caregiver who wants them. It is often said advice is worth what you pay for it so since this is free you can take it or leave it. No hard feelings as I write this hopefully to not only help others, but as a personal catharsis as well. I offer my insights over the coming days in no particular order. Insight #1: Ghosting The Urban Dictionary defines ghosting as follows: The act of suddenly ceasing all communication with someone. While usually confined to the dating scene, this can occur with equal frequency in caregiving. It meshes nicely with Dr. Martin Luther Kings famous quote In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends. I am a people person. Extroverted, open, and social so this aspect of caregiving was not only difficult for me to manage, but also difficult for me to understand. Plus those who ghosted on us ran the gamut from family to friends and from neighbors to colleagues. I dont pretend to understand why people ghost, but I wish I had been prepared for this aspect of the life of a caregiver and her/his patient. It would have saved my wife and me a lot of heartache and sadness. It still makes me scratch my head in wonder how friends of more than 40 years have yet to even acknowledge my wifes death. Equally how family can decide to visit our home only once in 14 years. How so many forget that the phone, texting, US mail, email, etc. operate in two directions! As I have thought about it I believe a portion of those who ghosted on us did so due to the fact my wifes brain cancer affected her personality. I find it common for people who exhibit less than normal mental capacities to be ignored, shunned, or isolated. Safer and easier to simply wall them off from your life I guess. I also believe a portion of those ghosting do so because it is easier to have a painful thing in our world be out of sight and out of mind. Things, and especially people, are easier to deal with in our minds if we simply choose to ignore them. Rather than reaching out it is more comfortable to accept an internally made-up reason for ones inaction. These days I realize, more than ever, those few people in our lives who made the conscious decision to not ghost on us did so by making a serious effort on their part to stay in our lives at a very difficult time. I am truly thankful to each and every one of them! Their continued connection with us often made the difference between another hellish day and one which contained for us a ray of light and a sliver of hope. A note that makes a caregiver or their patient smile is worth its weight in something far more precious than just gold! I am enjoying taking time now to be certain I continue to let each of these folks know of the importance they had in our lives and continue to have in mine. My father-in-law frequently opined if you can count your friends on one hand you are lucky. He was so very, very right. Peace and strength to every caregiver!

Anyone who is, or has been, a caregiver knows the following: Caregiving aint for wimps! It takes everything a caregiver has and on some days it demands more than we have. But just like the Energizer Bunny, caregivers do their best to keep on going, and going, and going, and.. In my fourteen years as a primary caregiver I have learned to try and be levelheaded in my daily efforts. However, no matter how well-meaning they might be, when someone utters one of the following phrases to me the words drill into my ears and cause me craziness. It then takes me more than a few moments to defuse my reaction and lower my blood pressure. So in the interest of keeping a modicum of peace in the world of caregivers, I offer these statements, which in my humble estimation should never leave anyones lips within earshot of a caregiver. 1) You are a saint. The hell we are! We know better than anyone we are not. We have our moments when our patience is drawn too thin, when we overreact, we hurt more than usual, are sleep deprived, or simply cannot manage all the demands that are coming at us at the same time. 2) You need to take care of yourself. Guess what? Every primary caregiver knows this, especially since after you are a saint it is the phrase we hear more often than any other. The catch is that when you are taking care of someone else fulltime how is it that magically we can put all that on hold and go take care of ourselves? You want caregivers to take care of themselves, then prepare to offer more than just these words. 3) You need to take some time for yourself. This one is particularly rich. Time for yourself when you barely have time to go to the bathroom, take a shower, get the clothes washed, the bed changed, the meals prepared, the dishes washed, the bills paid? Think about itchief cook, bottle washer, and caregiver. 4) I wish there was something I could do to help. Caregiving is extremely isolating. Sure, a caregiver is with their patient 24/7, but that is far different than any semblance of normal social interactions. No matter where you are, no matter how far away you are, there ARE things you can do. They dont need to be big either. Small works just fine. You can reach out with a letter, an email, a call, or a card. You can send a flower, a photo, a joke, a book you like, a clipping from the newspaper, have a pizza delivered. Even the tiniest of tokens says I am thinking of you and I want to help ease your burden. 5) How do you do it? Ill let you in on a caregiving secret here. There is NO magic pill, potion, or system for how any caregiver manages. How we do it is the same way a juggler keeps 10 balls in the air. We do it the same way a house of cards is built, and we, more than anyone, understand that caregiving is exactly thata house of cards. One small change and the whole system can crash. Half the time it seems like we are doing it with smoke and mirrors, but at least it gets done. 6) You should get some help. Great. Thanks. Think that has never crossed a caregivers mind? Let me look back and try and remember whether the last time I thought of this one was before or after the now ex-relief caregiver never bothered to show up for her shift; or before or after the one I had to fire who then burglarized and vandalized our home? Perhaps it was before or after the one who emotionally abused my wife. By the way, are you offering help or just providing me with a platitude? Oh, and speaking of platitudes 7) God doesnt give us more than we can handle. Dont ever, and I mean NOT EVER, speak this misquotation of supposed Scripture to a caregiver. First, you could go look it up, but surprise! Its not anywhere in the Bible. The closest you will come is most likely Corinthians 10:613 and that doesnt say what you may think it does either. So please, please, please! Do every caregiver in the world a huge favor and banish this erroneous statement that, as far as I can tell, only serves to make the one who utters it feel better. 8) Youll get your crown in heaven. See #1 and caregivers are not in this for any stinkin crown now or after we are dead, thank you! 9) How are you doing? This one is OK, but please only say it in private. I cannot tell you how often I was asked this question in front of the person I was caring for. What is a caregiver supposed to say in response? Right in front of the person you are caring for are you expecting something like gee, I am burning out, exhausted, at my wits end, in pain myself, depressed, etc.? 10) You need to find some time to relax. See all of the above and then dont say it again, please. Liked by Colleen Young, Connect Director, 121861, John, Volunteer Mentor, Teresa, Volunteer Mentor ... see all Follow Report"

Now not so much. Ive been on a few chat rooms where there have been stage IV CRC patients that are living longer than 3 years and hearing those stories seems to be the only thing that is giving him hope right now. Is there anyone out there who has been living with it for long periods of time, or who have had huge luck with chemo especially with liver metastasis? Id LOVE to hear your story!

I hope today, a new weekend, and a new month, brings some goodness to each caregiver everywhere! I send you my best regards and wishes today and everyday. I have been struggling lately with my grief and the loss of my wife. While I am keeping busy, visiting with family and friends, getting out, and trying to establish what my new normal will be in life, I continue to struggle with not only our familys loss, but also one nagging thought. I am wondering if anyone else has confronted this issue. It is this: Everything I read on grief and loss gave me two distinct impressions. One was that there were stages of grief and loss, like steps. Most even called them the stages of grief. Second was that the end of life would be like some movie, book, etc. You know, friends gathered around, smiling, calm, peaceful, angels strumming harps, etc. Well, in my case, and I admit I may be different than most, which is why I bring this up, neither of those two things were true. First neither my wife, children, nor I proceeded through those stages of grief. My wife hit on one and stayed there for years. My children (grown) and grandchildren are not processing grief in those supposed steps either. And for me they were basically unrecognizable. Loss continues for the three of us to be overwhelming at times and the triggers are usually small events, but powerful in their ability to effect new equilibrium. On the issue of loss, I am having a great deal of difficulty getting past the horror of my wifes last two months of life. Her physical pain was controlled, but that was all. My sleep pattern is still a wreck (I was on a 2-hour med regimen for her for her last three months), I am plagued with nightmares about her last months, and how she looked to me and would beg frequently for me to fix it when I could not. I had always been the one to take on her battles and help as best I could until those last days, when it was beyond anyones control. It did not help that we were constantly barraged with (I am sure well-meaning) folks who would tell us over and over either it will end peacefully or that I would welcome her passing. No, it didnt end well and no I dont welcome her passing as I know she would have given anything for even one more minute with us. Grief and loss seem to be more personalized and difficult than anyone actually writes about. Reality might bite, but it beats mythology for caregivers. At least I think so. I would have preferred to be better prepared for reality than the wishful thinking and one-size-fits-all pontificating offered as what to expect. Thanks for listening and Im interested to know if this is just our experiences or perhaps a bit more common than not.

But, I am looking for experiences of other spouses of family members of people who suffer from this disorder to know how it manifested.

A doctor with the V.A. recently told me we should file a claim related to Agent Orange. What? He's already rated 100% for PTSD. Back in the '80's the V.A. did send him tubes of an ineffective cream for Agent Orange problems on his feet which were deemed to have been caused by working on an airstrip in Vietnam for 13 months. No meaningful testing to pinpoint the nature of the trouble has ever been ordered  either by V.A. or the 'outside' (non V.A.) doctors I first sought help from back in 1997 for what later proved to be early signs of ""SOMETHING"" However that may be his cognitive difficulties were pretty severe by 2015, he hasn't known how to so much as get a glass of water in over a year. Mobility problems have greatly intensified in the last year. Still ambulatory if careful, but subject to 'locking up' and falling over if tired. One leg drags a little and often trips him up. Not able to manage a walker. About this time last year he started kicking and pummeling me in his sleep. He didn't wake up or remember these episodes. Quit sleeping with him for a while, after about two months this phenomenon ceased and I was able to return to the marital bed. I started assisting him at the toilet about 9 months ago. He was still seeking the toilet then but was prone to sitting down next to the toilet  FALL RISK  and always made a mess of the paperwork following b.m. He hadn't washed his hands on his own in a while. He wanted my eyes on him at all times, demanding attention every three to seven minutes (I timed it with the chess clock) interruptions averaged thirty seconds if I tried to read a book. 14 to 18 hours a day. Katy bar the door if I didn't go to bed when he did. In August hubby began experiencing mostly night time episodes of hostility and aggression, verbal and physical. Frequency and intensity increased over time and daytime bouts were often followed by non-stop pacing for up to an hour. Diversions and other tactics recommended in caregiver training videos worked infrequentlyless and less as things rolled along. Most effective way to break his train of thought was to get out of his sight, often he would return to bed and go to sleep. While I sat banished to the living room musing about beds and peaceful sleep. No support network to speak of. Family and friends disabled themselves or died off or melted away over the last three years. V.A. doctors and social workers have told me Fear Not  Help Is On the Way at least 7 times in the last four months. Some promised home aides + occasional respite care, expect a call from them soon, some promised palliative care, expect a call from them soon. What's palliative care? They'll explain it when they call yousoon. Didn't happen. When I described my difficulties and asked his dr. about medications to mitigate the aggression he replied that this was neurologist's job4 hour drive, 90 days for appointment. A digestive problem hubby had developed led to a month of very loose stools every 3 or 4 hours around the clock. I called dr.'s office with concerns about effects of constant diahhrea and sleepless nights forever  shouldn't the prescribed medication be changed or adjusted? The Care Team nurse said she'd put in a consult for the G.I. doc. at Regional, expect a call from her soon. Didn't happen. Very same G.I. doc who had told me previously to expect a call from palliative care soon. Didn't happen. (4th one to say Help Is On The Way) I stopped the stomach medicine on my own and the squirts ceased. Hubby's tummy doing ok now but too late. Between the sleepless nights and constant squirts hubby not feeling well and mean as a snake. I'm not at my best either. Chasing me away from the toilet most of the time. I had installed safeties to prevent his falling next to the toilet but now he sometimes forgot to lower his drawers, or open toilet lid if I had forgotten to. The post-rage pacing now included the bonus of lavish distribution of feces every few days. When this happened hubby would consent to a bath, otherwise he often declined. Remember the aforementioned paperwork problem? Dirty drawers and hands, infrequent bathing. The other day I had just finished cleaning most of a mess up and giving him a bath which he said he enjoyed very much. All going well until he threw another toilet fit, following me around yelling and forbade me to change the bedsheets. I lost it and started yelling back at him for the first time. When I came up for air and looked at him his whole body was shuddering, he was white as a sheet, eyes as big as silver dollars. I will never live that down. It was past time to get off the boat. I went outside for phone receptioncall the V.A.find out where can I take him? Hubby came out screaming at me. I sat in the truck on hold for 16 minutes 32 seconds while hubby floundered around the truck hammering on the windows and yelling at me to get out of his life. The phone dropped reception. So much for that. After a while he wound down, and I invited him to go for a ride. About the only activity he enjoys anymore. For the first time in well over a year he did not ask 'where are we going' every 5 minutes  didn't ask once on the 2+hour trip to Regional. Every few minutes he stroked my arm and said 'you hate me don't you?' I tried to reassure him..No I don't, I'm just tired. Between stroking my arm and asking the question he pressed his head against me. This went on for the whole trip  how's that for continuity of thought process? When we arrived he recognized the place. The look of pain and betrayal on his face was awful. Softly ""You planned this didn't you?"" but he went in with me and stood by while I asked the E.R. receptionist how to go about placing him in care. She condescendingly explained that this is not the place or way. E.R. would NOT take him. I must go through his Primary Care dr. and he would take care of it. I said that dr. hadn't taken care of much so far, if I should run away leaving hubby in the waiting room would they throw him out in the street? She said no, but CPP would be called in and I would very likely face criminal abandonment charges. I replied that if he won't use the toilet and won't take a bath does that not constitute neglect? Also subject to criminal charges? All this in polite tones as if we were simply discussing a civilized subject. I said ""Dr. and others have been telling me Help Is On The Way for months but nothing has happened."" She checked her screen and no doubt saw our recent dr. visit, and said 'there is no call in for services.' Now her eyes dropped and she looked flustered. 'Does he have a medical problem for which the E.R. dr. could admit him to hospital? She's sure that dr. could find a way. No, no health problem that I know of that could be construed as an emergency. A social worker is on call. Maybe she can do something. Hubby and I are escorted to exam room in back where we sit for an hour or so. The social worker arrives, probably having been told nothing more than that I had rolled in threatening to abandon my husband of thirty-something years. She promotes the Primary Care Doctor theory to me, I explain that several people including dr have been telling me for months that Help Is On The Way. Now she's frowning at me. 'Who told you that?' I tell her. And about the person here at Regional who, back in Nov., pulled strings to get us in to Primary Care a month or more earlier than appointment in order to get the Help Is On The Way wagon rolling faster. The receptionist has checked, there never was a call in for the Help Wagon, they ain't going to do nothing. She needs grounds for 'unsafe conditions' before she can do anything. Am I likely to hurt him? No, he's aggressive one, I'm afraid he'll fall while chasing me. Hygiene problems. Potential for illness. She decides to sign an 'Order To Detain"" whatever that is. Have dr. give hubby something soothing as he's getting restless wanting to go home. There's an outside geriatric psych ward specializing in finding proper meds for aggressive behaviours in dementia patients. Average stay 3  5 days, sometimes as long as 10. Meanwhile she herself will put in a call for services to get ready for hubby's homecoming. Home aides, respite period every two weeks. Expect the call soon, Monday at the latest. She goes away, not having offered me her card or copies of the relevant paperwork. No Help Wagon call camechalk up another Didn't Happen. When Nurse brought in the soothing shot she explained that some people were just relaxed by it, others might get a little sleepy. She rejoined the gaggle of nurses holding a gabfest at the nurses' station. After a while hubby decided to move from the chair to the bed. About 18 inches. Rising with more difficulty than usual he turned to the bed and froze. He sank towards the floor but I got a knee under his butt and prevented a fall. I couldn't shift him. Totally limp with my knee pinning him against the bed. I yelled 'HEY' at the nurses whooping it up at the station 20 feet away. One of them looked at me but didn't move. Again 'HEY' now a couple of them looked and saw the position I was in. Did I need help? 'YES' Four or five of them came and slid hubby onto the bed, which was raised to an almost sitting position. None of them spoke. They went away. Hubby was propped crookedly against the backrest, his head lolling to one side. He could move his eyes but that was it. Tugging on his shoulders I straightened him on the bed so his neck wouldn't be so bent. What the hell did they give him? He's a 73 year old man with an undiagnosed dementiaor SOMETHING. After a while Nurse returns to check hubby's blood pressure, affix a heart monitor. She went away. Hubby's eyes turn towards me and he whispers ""You planned this. You hate me."" No baby I don't. I raised the bed's safety rail and rushed out into the night. It was midnight. I cried all the way home. The people at the psych unit seem reluctant to answer my questions when I call next day. On Sunday I made the 2 hour drive to visit. When they brought hubby into the room he was walking hunched over, head nearly level with waist. He was pale as a bedsheet, eyes the size of silver dollars. He backpedaled as far as the aide assisting him allowed and asked me ""Are you going to hit me?"" no. The aide said he would fetch the nurse to answer my questions. Didn't happen. Hubby sat twisting and pulling at one of his fingers as one does when removing a tight ring. He was pulling and twisting hard, the finger bent to an alarming degree. 'I'm trying to get this off' he explained when I asked. 'Please stop. You might hurt your finger' He changed to a different finger, twisting and pulling. 'Who are those two guys?' he asked while indicating an empty corner of the room. I said I didn't know them. These behaviours continued for a while. Suddenly he sat quiet, looked at me and said 'I like it here. At first I hated it but I'm getting used to it. Now I like it here. Really I hate it.' The look in his eyes was the most lucid I've seen in years. 'How's your boyfriend? he asked. 'No boyfriend, only you' I said softly (NEVER ARGUE WITH THEM!) He didn't contest the point, just gave me a dirty look and turned away. An aide appeared in the doorway asking if everything was all right. I didn't take to her demeanor. She went away. Hubby said that he and this aide didn't like each other. I wondered if she was the one on the phone who had expressed resentment at having to clean up one of hubby's toileting mishaps. There was a little more talk. Some coherent, some not. Am I to believe that someone in the facility named Bobby thumps on him? Is staff to believe that I thump on hubby? I found no marks upon him aside from an impressive blood bruise from a labs stick (blood draw) maybe gone awry. Two staffers have told me over the phone that they'd had trouble obtaining lab samples. Another scoffed and said that she'd heard nothing about difficulties. I know that hubby has trouble holding still when handled and I don't hold the ugly bruise against them. Finally speak to one who's willing to discuss the case in more detail. So far as my extremely limited understanding of such matters permits I think the blood values she emphasizes are pertinent to the meds they are trying. I made phone inquiries every day for a while even though the staffers seemed not to like it. A couple bordered on outright hostility. 6 were contacted average call time 6 minutes. I'm not really interested in attitudes or what their opinion of me might be. I found out what I wanted to know. Information sharing between caregivers appears to be excellent. I've seen very unfortunate things happen to patients in hospital settings when staffers aren't all on the same page. I won't go see hubby again unless dr. calls and says I should. I expect this to coincide with the freezing over of hell. It was obvious that hubby is scared of me and didn't want the visit. Surely they didn't MAKE him attend. Having spent years attempting to shield him from stressful situations I will not induce anxiety in him now. I don't know if I'll ever see him again. I knew that institution time was nigh but never imagined it come about like this. I think he could have enjoyed a better quality of life for a little longer if the system charged with his well-being had performed better. Was it typical V.A. dysfunctionor was it (as some of my acquaintances maintain) deliberately done to save government money? I'm confused and feel I've been duped by the system, face a penurious old age or worse, and feel an overwhelming grief and guilt for falling down at the eleventh hour.

These behaviours continued for a while. Suddenly he sat quiet, looked at me and said 'I like it here. At first I hated it but I'm getting used to it. Now I like it here. Really I hate it.' The look in his eyes was the most lucid I've seen in years. 'How's your boyfriend? he asked. 'No boyfriend, only you' I said softly (NEVER ARGUE WITH THEM!) He didn't contest the point, just gave me a dirty look and turned away. An aide appeared in the doorway asking if everything was all right. I didn't take to her demeanor. She went away. Hubby said that he and this aide didn't like each other. I wondered if she was the one on the phone who had expressed resentment at having to clean up one of hubby's toileting mishaps. There was a little more talk. Some coherent, some not. Am I to believe that someone in the facility named Bobby thumps on him? Is staff to believe that I thump on hubby? I found no marks upon him aside from an impressive blood bruise from a labs stick (blood draw) maybe gone awry. Two staffers have told me over the phone that they'd had trouble obtaining lab samples. Another scoffed and said that she'd heard nothing about difficulties. I know that hubby has trouble holding still when handled and I don't hold the ugly bruise against them. Finally speak to one who's willing to discuss the case in more detail. So far as my extremely limited understanding of such matters permits I think the blood values she emphasizes are pertinent to the meds they are trying. I made phone inquiries every day for a while even though the staffers seemed not to like it. A couple bordered on outright hostility. 6 were contacted average call time 6 minutes. I'm not really interested in attitudes or what their opinion of me might be. I found out what I wanted to know. Information sharing between caregivers appears to be excellent. I've seen very unfortunate things happen to patients in hospital settings when staffers aren't all on the same page. I won't go see hubby again unless dr. calls and says I should. I expect this to coincide with the freezing over of hell. It was obvious that hubby is scared of me and didn't want the visit. Surely they didn't MAKE him attend. Having spent years attempting to shield him from stressful situations I will not induce anxiety in him now. I don't know if I'll ever see him again. I knew that institution time was nigh but never imagined it come about like this. I think he could have enjoyed a better quality of life for a little longer if the system charged with his well-being had performed better. Was it typical V.A. dysfunctionor was it (as some of my acquaintances maintain) deliberately done to save government money? I'm confused and feel I've been duped by the system, face a penurious old age or worse, and feel an overwhelming grief and guilt for falling down at the eleventh hour.

A doctor with the V.A. recently told me we should file a claim related to Agent Orange. What? He's already rated 100% for PTSD. Back in the '80's the V.A. did send him tubes of an ineffective cream for Agent Orange problems on his feet which were deemed to have been caused by working on an airstrip in Vietnam for 13 months. No meaningful testing to pinpoint the nature of the trouble has ever been ordered  either by V.A. or the 'outside' (non V.A.) doctors I first sought help from back in 1997 for what later proved to be early signs of ""SOMETHING"" However that may be his cognitive difficulties were pretty severe by 2015, he hasn't known how to so much as get a glass of water in over a year. Mobility problems have greatly intensified in the last year. Still ambulatory if careful, but subject to 'locking up' and falling over if tired. One leg drags a little and often trips him up. Not able to manage a walker. About this time last year he started kicking and pummeling me in his sleep. He didn't wake up or remember these episodes. Quit sleeping with him for a while, after about two months this phenomenon ceased and I was able to return to the marital bed. I started assisting him at the toilet about 9 months ago. He was still seeking the toilet then but was prone to sitting down next to the toilet  FALL RISK  and always made a mess of the paperwork following b.m. He hadn't washed his hands on his own in a while. He wanted my eyes on him at all times, demanding attention every three to seven minutes (I timed it with the chess clock) interruptions averaged thirty seconds if I tried to read a book. 14 to 18 hours a day. Katy bar the door if I didn't go to bed when he did. In August hubby began experiencing mostly night time episodes of hostility and aggression, verbal and physical. Frequency and intensity increased over time and daytime bouts were often followed by non-stop pacing for up to an hour. Diversions and other tactics recommended in caregiver training videos worked infrequentlyless and less as things rolled along. Most effective way to break his train of thought was to get out of his sight, often he would return to bed and go to sleep. While I sat banished to the living room musing about beds and peaceful sleep. No support network to speak of. Family and friends disabled themselves or died off or melted away over the last three years. V.A. doctors and social workers have told me Fear Not  Help Is On the Way at least 7 times in the last four months. Some promised home aides + occasional respite care, expect a call from them soon, some promised palliative care, expect a call from them soon. What's palliative care? They'll explain it when they call yousoon. Didn't happen. When I described my difficulties and asked his dr. about medications to mitigate the aggression he replied that this was neurologist's job4 hour drive, 90 days for appointment. A digestive problem hubby had developed led to a month of very loose stools every 3 or 4 hours around the clock. I called dr.'s office with concerns about effects of constant diahhrea and sleepless nights forever  shouldn't the prescribed medication be changed or adjusted? The Care Team nurse said she'd put in a consult for the G.I. doc. at Regional, expect a call from her soon. Didn't happen. Very same G.I. doc who had told me previously to expect a call from palliative care soon. Didn't happen. (4th one to say Help Is On The Way) I stopped the stomach medicine on my own and the squirts ceased. Hubby's tummy doing ok now but too late. Between the sleepless nights and constant squirts hubby not feeling well and mean as a snake. I'm not at my best either. Chasing me away from the toilet most of the time. I had installed safeties to prevent his falling next to the toilet but now he sometimes forgot to lower his drawers, or open toilet lid if I had forgotten to. The post-rage pacing now included the bonus of lavish distribution of feces every few days. When this happened hubby would consent to a bath, otherwise he often declined. Remember the aforementioned paperwork problem? Dirty drawers and hands, infrequent bathing. The other day I had just finished cleaning most of a mess up and giving him a bath which he said he enjoyed very much. All going well until he threw another toilet fit, following me around yelling and forbade me to change the bedsheets. I lost it and started yelling back at him for the first time. When I came up for air and looked at him his whole body was shuddering, he was white as a sheet, eyes as big as silver dollars. I will never live that down. It was past time to get off the boat. I went outside for phone receptioncall the V.A.find out where can I take him? Hubby came out screaming at me. I sat in the truck on hold for 16 minutes 32 seconds while hubby floundered around the truck hammering on the windows and yelling at me to get out of his life. The phone dropped reception. So much for that. After a while he wound down, and I invited him to go for a ride. About the only activity he enjoys anymore. For the first time in well over a year he did not ask 'where are we going' every 5 minutes  didn't ask once on the 2+hour trip to Regional. Every few minutes he stroked my arm and said 'you hate me don't you?' I tried to reassure him..No I don't, I'm just tired. Between stroking my arm and asking the question he pressed his head against me. This went on for the whole trip  how's that for continuity of thought process? When we arrived he recognized the place. The look of pain and betrayal on his face was awful. Softly ""You planned this didn't you?"" but he went in with me and stood by while I asked the E.R. receptionist how to go about placing him in care. She condescendingly explained that this is not the place or way. E.R. would NOT take him. I must go through his Primary Care dr. and he would take care of it. I said that dr. hadn't taken care of much so far, if I should run away leaving hubby in the waiting room would they throw him out in the street? She said no, but CPP would be called in and I would very likely face criminal abandonment charges. I replied that if he won't use the toilet and won't take a bath does that not constitute neglect? Also subject to criminal charges? All this in polite tones as if we were simply discussing a civilized subject. I said ""Dr. and others have been telling me Help Is On The Way for months but nothing has happened."" She checked her screen and no doubt saw our recent dr. visit, and said 'there is no call in for services.' Now her eyes dropped and she looked flustered. 'Does he have a medical problem for which the E.R. dr. could admit him to hospital? She's sure that dr. could find a way. No, no health problem that I know of that could be construed as an emergency. A social worker is on call. Maybe she can do something. Hubby and I are escorted to exam room in back where we sit for an hour or so. The social worker arrives, probably having been told nothing more than that I had rolled in threatening to abandon my husband of thirty-something years. She promotes the Primary Care Doctor theory to me, I explain that several people including dr have been telling me for months that Help Is On The Way. Now she's frowning at me. 'Who told you that?' I tell her. And about the person here at Regional who, back in Nov., pulled strings to get us in to Primary Care a month or more earlier than appointment in order to get the Help Is On The Way wagon rolling faster. The receptionist has checked, there never was a call in for the Help Wagon, they ain't going to do nothing. She needs grounds for 'unsafe conditions' before she can do anything. Am I likely to hurt him? No, he's aggressive one, I'm afraid he'll fall while chasing me. Hygiene problems. Potential for illness. She decides to sign an 'Order To Detain"" whatever that is. Have dr. give hubby something soothing as he's getting restless wanting to go home. There's an outside geriatric psych ward specializing in finding proper meds for aggressive behaviours in dementia patients. Average stay 3  5 days, sometimes as long as 10. Meanwhile she herself will put in a call for services to get ready for hubby's homecoming. Home aides, respite period every two weeks. Expect the call soon, Monday at the latest. She goes away, not having offered me her card or copies of the relevant paperwork. No Help Wagon call camechalk up another Didn't Happen. When Nurse brought in the soothing shot she explained that some people were just relaxed by it, others might get a little sleepy. She rejoined the gaggle of nurses holding a gabfest at the nurses' station. After a while hubby decided to move from the chair to the bed. About 18 inches. Rising with more difficulty than usual he turned to the bed and froze. He sank towards the floor but I got a knee under his butt and prevented a fall. I couldn't shift him. Totally limp with my knee pinning him against the bed. I yelled 'HEY' at the nurses whooping it up at the station 20 feet away. One of them looked at me but didn't move. Again 'HEY' now a couple of them looked and saw the position I was in. Did I need help? 'YES' Four or five of them came and slid hubby onto the bed, which was raised to an almost sitting position. None of them spoke. They went away. Hubby was propped crookedly against the backrest, his head lolling to one side. He could move his eyes but that was it. Tugging on his shoulders I straightened him on the bed so his neck wouldn't be so bent. What the hell did they give him? He's a 73 year old man with an undiagnosed dementiaor SOMETHING. After a while Nurse returns to check hubby's blood pressure, affix a heart monitor. She went away. Hubby's eyes turn towards me and he whispers ""You planned this. You hate me."" No baby I don't. I raised the bed's safety rail and rushed out into the night. It was midnight. I cried all the way home. The people at the psych unit seem reluctant to answer my questions when I call next day. On Sunday I made the 2 hour drive to visit. When they brought hubby into the room he was walking hunched over, head nearly level with waist. He was pale as a bedsheet, eyes the size of silver dollars. He backpedaled as far as the aide assisting him allowed and asked me ""Are you going to hit me?"" no. The aide said he would fetch the nurse to answer my questions. Didn't happen. Hubby sat twisting and pulling at one of his fingers as one does when removing a tight ring. He was pulling and twisting hard, the finger bent to an alarming degree. 'I'm trying to get this off' he explained when I asked. 'Please stop. You might hurt your finger' He changed to a different finger, twisting and pulling. 'Who are those two guys?' he asked while indicating an empty corner of the room. I said I didn't know them.

I am grateful for the opportunity to caregive my husband and I will always be amazed at how exhausting, sad, frustrating, rewarding and painful caregiving was for me.

Other than for visiting in a hospital I hadnt been in the working areas since I had been caring for my wife. As I drove the hour from our home to the hospital to be with our daughter I was overcome with not only my worry for her, but by a crush of emotions as I was overwhelmed by memories of the times I had to be in this crisis mode with my wife. When I arrived I got hit with another trigger as our daughter was in the same hospital where my wife got her first diagnosis of her brain cancer. Walking through those same front doors, I actually had to sit and cry in the lobby before I went back into the ER. In short order she was transferred to the ICU. I had not been in an ICU since my wife spent days in the NICU at Mayo. The noises, IVs, rush of nursing, regular monitoring, the feelings of fear, etc. triggered wave upon wave of emotion and memories. Thankfully our daughters condition did improve and she was able to return home and is well on the mend. Then the next kind of crazy trigger hit. Before getting ill our daughter had arranged to adopt a rescue Lab. She couldnt go to pick up her dog so I made the trek and agreed to keep her for the week until she could join us. Her name is Stella and I was slammed again. Shaking, ribs sticking out, sores on her body, and then the intermediary said to me you better be a good caregiver, she needs a lot of TLC. Just him using that word sent me into a spin again. Stella is improving and a truly sweet dog, then another wave. This is the time of year I have a lot of trigger events in quick succession. This was the time of year my wife suffered incredibly in her final days. Its also when we celebrate and remember her birthday, our anniversary, and then the day of her passing. I know my emotions are far more raw and release easier in life. Heck, I even cried watching EndGame with our grandsons! But this time of year, when I am hit with trigger, upon trigger, upon trigger, I am a bigger emotional mess than usual. Id appreciate hearing how you, as caregivers, deal with your triggers?

This past week I really got to thinking about all us caregivers here as I had a set of unusual triggers hit me, as the kids say these days right in the feels.

Her name is Terezinha. She is married and she is mother of 4, for whom she dedicated her life in while she worked hard in a Career in the Brazilian Education Department of SP State. Besides that, she gave a strong contribution to the Community, leading Social Programs like Parents Education about fertility control and family planning (Billings Method). She used to be focused on healthy habits, such as being physically active (yoga), eating a well-balanced diet, never drinking alcohol neither smoking, and visiting doctors regularly. She is not diabetic, her blood pressure usually is low. Cholesterol LDL had been more than 100 mg/dL and triglycerides more than 150 mg/dL, thats the reason she had been taking statin for a long period of her adult life. She had some pains in hands and feet joints.Her parents also had neurological problems in the past, and both was diagnosed as Alzheimers disease, around 1970~1995. In addition, 2 of her 15 siblings was diagnosed with neurological problems. Around the year of 2013, when she was at 64 years-old, she had some falls on the street; she was drowsy while driving; and she had difficulty with sleep management. At this time, we started to watch her behavior full time, and it was the first time we asked her to avoid driving, and she didnt accept it. In the MRI of 2013, it was reported white matter damages, compatible with leukoencephalopathy microangiopatic supratentorial. The doctor prescribed aspirin and statin. She retired in 2015. In 2016, she had a serious fall, heating her head and having a brain bleeding, which was well treated by a neurologist (this fall didnt cause any instant change in her brain function). But considering the white matter damages, we started to be concerned about dementia, and trying avoid this. The doctor prescribed a cocktail of medicines in order to prevent strokes and dementia, with the following drugs/suplements:Resveratrol, Velija (Duloxetin Hydrochloride), Clopidogrel Bisulfate, Vytorin (Ezetimibe and Sinvastatin), Donepezil (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, 5mg), Losartana 25mg (antihypertensive) and Glucosamine. In february of 2017, she took a NOTCH3 testing to investigate the hypothesis of leukoencephalopathy (Cadasil), and the result was negative. Then, the doctor changed a little bit the prescription to:Resveratrol, Vitamin D, Velija (Duloxetin Hydrochloride), Omega3, Clopidogrel Bisulfate, Rosuvastatin (5mg), Losartana 25mg (antihypertensive), Donepezil (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, 10mg), Bromopride (to help the body accept the dose increasing for donepezil), and Glucosamine. In the second semester of 2017, her memory loss got worst significantly, and we cannot leave her by herself anymore. She had another fall heating her knee. We visited the neurologist again, new brain exams, and then, he diagnosed it as Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA). This is her current diagnosis, in which I dont believe 100%, because as far Ive been finding out other CAA diagnosed people, they are much better with their brain function than my mom.So, the doctor proposed a trial to do a immunosuppression, with 40% of chances to recover her brain function, by stopping auto-immune inflammation. We tried it, and it didnt work. Actually, it was the worst phase of her memory loss progression, instantly she lost much of her communication ability and memory. In addition, we had to go to emergency care in the hospital, and she received another diagnosis: fungal meningitis, due to the immunosuppression made, she was hospitalized for 1 month, in January of 2018. She was cured from meningitis. But her brain function never came back to normal. She started need to use diapers full time. She didnt accept pills anymore, only liquid medicines. After all these inefficient trying, we gave up of traditional medicines, and stopped it. In this phase, we had to modify the lifestyle of our family to adjust with this new reality, in order to take care of her. It was a tough phase for us, we learned a lot about caregiving, resilience, and love. In this moment, we also took an (expensive) genetic exam, but honestly I still didnt understand the results, neither her doctor helped us enough about that. We also tried acupuncture, for 4 weeks: no improvement. After 4 months of homecare, she become to be aggressive. Then we decided to get help from a caregiver homecare institution. Also, we accepted to try Depakene (Valproic Acid) to control the aggressiveness. It worked and she has been taking Depakene until nowadays (we reduced the dose by half a few months ago).Also, we found some supplements to allow her sleep well at night, which is a sedative compound of passiflora, mulungu, valerian and chamomile. Also, sometimes we give Miosan (Cyclobenzaprine) to muscle relaxation for sleep. The most recent critical issue was a convulsion, in May 2019. It was 1 day treated in the hospital. This quick event occurred just after she had took a vaccine for the common cold. In conclusion, for the moment, my feeling is: if we havent tried so many preventive strong medicines, maybe her cognition would be so much better than it is now, considering the fact that after we stopped strong medicines (e.g. donepezil), her cognitive declining got slowed. So, for those ones who have mild cognitive impairment, Id not recommend the use of Statin, Donepezil, neither Duloxetin. Immunosuppression neither.

This quick event occurred just after she had took a vaccine for the common cold. In conclusion, for the moment, my feeling is: if we havent tried so many preventive strong medicines, maybe her cognition would be so much better than it is now, considering the fact that after we stopped strong medicines (e.g. donepezil), her cognitive declining got slowed. So, for those ones who have mild cognitive impairment, Id not recommend the use of Statin, Donepezil, neither Duloxetin. Immunosuppression neither.

Her name is Terezinha. She is married and she is mother of 4, for whom she dedicated her life in while she worked hard in a Career in the Brazilian Education Department of SP State. Besides that, she gave a strong contribution to the Community, leading Social Programs like Parents Education about fertility control and family planning (Billings Method). She used to be focused on healthy habits, such as being physically active (yoga), eating a well-balanced diet, never drinking alcohol neither smoking, and visiting doctors regularly. She is not diabetic, her blood pressure usually is low. Cholesterol LDL had been more than 100 mg/dL and triglycerides more than 150 mg/dL, thats the reason she had been taking statin for a long period of her adult life. She had some pains in hands and feet joints.Her parents also had neurological problems in the past, and both was diagnosed as Alzheimers disease, around 1970~1995. In addition, 2 of her 15 siblings was diagnosed with neurological problems. Around the year of 2013, when she was at 64 years-old, she had some falls on the street; she was drowsy while driving; and she had difficulty with sleep management. At this time, we started to watch her behavior full time, and it was the first time we asked her to avoid driving, and she didnt accept it. In the MRI of 2013, it was reported white matter damages, compatible with leukoencephalopathy microangiopatic supratentorial. The doctor prescribed aspirin and statin. She retired in 2015. In 2016, she had a serious fall, heating her head and having a brain bleeding, which was well treated by a neurologist (this fall didnt cause any instant change in her brain function). But considering the white matter damages, we started to be concerned about dementia, and trying avoid this. The doctor prescribed a cocktail of medicines in order to prevent strokes and dementia, with the following drugs/suplements:Resveratrol, Velija (Duloxetin Hydrochloride), Clopidogrel Bisulfate, Vytorin (Ezetimibe and Sinvastatin), Donepezil (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, 5mg), Losartana 25mg (antihypertensive) and Glucosamine. In february of 2017, she took a NOTCH3 testing to investigate the hypothesis of leukoencephalopathy (Cadasil), and the result was negative. Then, the doctor changed a little bit the prescription to:Resveratrol, Vitamin D, Velija (Duloxetin Hydrochloride), Omega3, Clopidogrel Bisulfate, Rosuvastatin (5mg), Losartana 25mg (antihypertensive), Donepezil (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, 10mg), Bromopride (to help the body accept the dose increasing for donepezil), and Glucosamine. In the second semester of 2017, her memory loss got worst significantly, and we cannot leave her by herself anymore. She had another fall heating her knee. We visited the neurologist again, new brain exams, and then, he diagnosed it as Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA). This is her current diagnosis, in which I dont believe 100%, because as far Ive been finding out other CAA diagnosed people, they are much better with their brain function than my mom.So, the doctor proposed a trial to do a immunosuppression, with 40% of chances to recover her brain function, by stopping auto-immune inflammation. We tried it, and it didnt work. Actually, it was the worst phase of her memory loss progression, instantly she lost much of her communication ability and memory. In addition, we had to go to emergency care in the hospital, and she received another diagnosis: fungal meningitis, due to the immunosuppression made, she was hospitalized for 1 month, in January of 2018. She was cured from meningitis. But her brain function never came back to normal. She started need to use diapers full time. She didnt accept pills anymore, only liquid medicines. After all these inefficient trying, we gave up of traditional medicines, and stopped it. In this phase, we had to modify the lifestyle of our family to adjust with this new reality, in order to take care of her. It was a tough phase for us, we learned a lot about caregiving, resilience, and love. In this moment, we also took an (expensive) genetic exam, but honestly I still didnt understand the results, neither her doctor helped us enough about that. We also tried acupuncture, for 4 weeks: no improvement. After 4 months of homecare, she become to be aggressive. Then we decided to get help from a caregiver homecare institution. Also, we accepted to try Depakene (Valproic Acid) to control the aggressiveness. It worked and she has been taking Depakene until nowadays (we reduced the dose by half a few months ago).Also, we found some supplements to allow her sleep well at night, which is a sedative compound of passiflora, mulungu, valerian and chamomile.

Her name is Terezinha. She is married and she is mother of 4, for whom she dedicated her life in while she worked hard in a Career in the Brazilian Education Department of SP State. Besides that, she gave a strong contribution to the Community, leading Social Programs like Parents Education about fertility control and family planning (Billings Method). She used to be focused on healthy habits, such as being physically active (yoga), eating a well-balanced diet, never drinking alcohol neither smoking, and visiting doctors regularly. She is not diabetic, her blood pressure usually is low. Cholesterol LDL had been more than 100 mg/dL and triglycerides more than 150 mg/dL, thats the reason she had been taking statin for a long period of her adult life. She had some pains in hands and feet joints.Her parents also had neurological problems in the past, and both was diagnosed as Alzheimers disease, around 1970~1995. In addition, 2 of her 15 siblings was diagnosed with neurological problems. Around the year of 2013, when she was at 64 years-old, she had some falls on the street; she was drowsy while driving; and she had difficulty with sleep management. At this time, we started to watch her behavior full time, and it was the first time we asked her to avoid driving, and she didnt accept it. In the MRI of 2013, it was reported white matter damages, compatible with leukoencephalopathy microangiopatic supratentorial. The doctor prescribed aspirin and statin. She retired in 2015. In 2016, she had a serious fall, heating her head and having a brain bleeding, which was well treated by a neurologist (this fall didnt cause any instant change in her brain function). But considering the white matter damages, we started to be concerned about dementia, and trying avoid this. The doctor prescribed a cocktail of medicines in order to prevent strokes and dementia, with the following drugs/suplements:Resveratrol, Velija (Duloxetin Hydrochloride), Clopidogrel Bisulfate, Vytorin (Ezetimibe and Sinvastatin), Donepezil (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, 5mg), Losartana 25mg (antihypertensive) and Glucosamine. In february of 2017, she took a NOTCH3 testing to investigate the hypothesis of leukoencephalopathy (Cadasil), and the result was negative. Then, the doctor changed a little bit the prescription to:Resveratrol, Vitamin D, Velija (Duloxetin Hydrochloride), Omega3, Clopidogrel Bisulfate, Rosuvastatin (5mg), Losartana 25mg (antihypertensive), Donepezil (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, 10mg), Bromopride (to help the body accept the dose increasing for donepezil), and Glucosamine. In the second semester of 2017, her memory loss got worst significantly, and we cannot leave her by herself anymore. She had another fall heating her knee. We visited the neurologist again, new brain exams, and then, he diagnosed it as Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA). This is her current diagnosis, in which I dont believe 100%, because as far Ive been finding out other CAA diagnosed people, they are much better with their brain function than my mom.So, the doctor proposed a trial to do a immunosuppression, with 40% of chances to recover her brain function, by stopping auto-immune inflammation. We tried it, and it didnt work. Actually, it was the worst phase of her memory loss progression, instantly she lost much of her communication ability and memory. In addition, we had to go to emergency care in the hospital, and she received another diagnosis: fungal meningitis, due to the immunosuppression made, she was hospitalized for 1 month, in January of 2018. She was cured from meningitis. But her brain function never came back to normal. She started need to use diapers full time. She didnt accept pills anymore, only liquid medicines. After all these inefficient trying, we gave up of traditional medicines, and stopped it. In this phase, we had to modify the lifestyle of our family to adjust with this new reality, in order to take care of her. It was a tough phase for us, we learned a lot about caregiving, resilience, and love. In this moment, we also took an (expensive) genetic exam, but honestly I still didnt understand the results, neither her doctor helped us enough about that. We also tried acupuncture, for 4 weeks: no improvement. After 4 months of homecare, she become to be aggressive. Then we decided to get help from a caregiver homecare institution. Also, we accepted to try Depakene (Valproic Acid) to control the aggressiveness. It worked and she has been taking Depakene until nowadays (we reduced the dose by half a few months ago).Also, we found some supplements to allow her sleep well at night, which is a sedative compound of passiflora, mulungu, valerian and chamomile. Also, sometimes we give Miosan (Cyclobenzaprine) to muscle relaxation for sleep. The most recent critical issue was a convulsion, in May 2019. It was 1 day treated in the hospital. This quick event occurred just after she had took a vaccine for the common cold. In conclusion, for the moment, my feeling is: if we havent tried so many preventive strong medicines, maybe her cognition would be so much better than it is now, considering the fact that after we stopped strong medicines (e.g. donepezil), her cognitive declining got slowed. So, for those ones who have mild cognitive impairment, Id not recommend the use of Statin, Donepezil, neither Duloxetin. Immunosuppression neither.

She just turned 72. After 4 months in a Hospital she was finally placed in a Long-Term Care Facility (for memory impaired), a lock-up where she has been for just over 3 months. She does not remember me, calls me Mommy or Barb her sister. Occasionally she remembers my name. She shuffles when she walks. She has poor eyesight now. She needs help with bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, basically everything. She cannot form a complete sentence but does come out with words once in a while that I know and understand, mostly though she tries to talk but the words just dont come out as intelligible words. So shes here yet shes not here. She has no joy, no laughter, no memories to share with me or anyone, and Im not sure if she can feel anything, emotionally or physically. My visits are arduous because we cannot have a conversation. I cant tell her things, share anything with her. She is constantly agitated, anxious , and I fear she is lonely, bored and scared. And there is nothing I can do to assuage her feelings if in fact that is the case. I come home feeling depressed, lonely too. I dont know what future (time here) she has. Nor do I know how to plan my own future. I am 73, reasonably healthy. I have guilt feelings all the time. I feel sorry for her, and me. I watch her in the home and she just behaves as if no one cares, I guess because to her no one does. Or she is just living in her own little world. To me her life is empty and meaningless. I am at a loss. I feel as if my life is on constant hold, frozen in this daily warp of dementia. Liked by Scott, Volunteer Mentor, John, Volunteer Mentor, cmael, margockim ... see all Follow Report"

The day came, as I knew it would, when I needed care myself. After having odd symptoms for a couple of months I contacted my Mayo Clinic primary care physician. Tests were ordered and they showed a dark spot on my tummy. A surgery appointment was made for me. As it turned out, I had stage one uterine cancer and needed a hysterectomy. Who would care for my husband? Again, I contacted my husbands primary care physician, and she referred me to a social worker. My husband had just been hospitalized for pneumonia and was very weak. The social worker arranged for rehabilitation at a local facility. He has made progress and is coming home tomorrow. I write for The Caregiver Space website and am working on an article about being a caregiver when you need care yourself. If you havent thought about this, I encourage you to do so, and prepare for the possibility. Like the Scouts, caregivers need to be prepared.

Maybe fishing, visit to local park, take in a movie,whatever suits their needs to get some relief from the depression, if only for a few hours. Perhaps its the constant pain, feeling exhausted, worrying about bathroom availability, being on oxygen, weight gain/loss, needing wheelchair, or scooter.I would like to hear from others how they are able to help motivate their patient or loved one to enjoy some of the life they still have.No one knows when the lord will call so we need to take advantage of the remaining time. How do YOU help with motivation? What activity can YOU suggest that may encourage someone to do something to make the day more enjoyable than staying home? I know there must be some patients as well as some caregivers that could use time away from home. Liked by Colleen Young, Connect Director, John, Volunteer Mentor, jodeej Follow Report"

The sweating occurs mainly on the right side of his body. We have searched for medical reasons this may be occurring but our doctors have found nothing. He was diagnosed with dementia three years ago. As you can imagine, waking up every 2-3 hours sleep is not sufficient for him (or me, his spouse/care giver) to become rested. As his dementia has progressed, caring for the sweating has gotten more complex and confusing. Im curious if others have had this experience and/or have suggestions  either medical or environmental..

Wed lived the for better and in health portions of our vows. Now we were to embark on a new life where we would work on the for worse and in sickness segments. As every caregiver here knows, the day your patient and you hear the words of your diagnosis lives change. In our case that change would be a forever change.

After all, after 27 years of being together, we both felt we pretty much had our love and feelings for each other figured out. But we didnt. This deepening of our connection certainly didnt make caregiving a bed of roses, nor easy, but it was nonetheless amazing to me. It was also the underpinning that gave me the strength to rise to the often overwhelming demands of caregiving each day, day after day. For the last five years of my wifes life she was totally dependent on me. Even when our children were at their youngest, I had never had anyone so totally and completely dependent on me for every aspect of their life. When our children had been tiny there had always been a partner to help, parents, grandparents, friends, etc. who offered to lend a hand in the tough times. But I was to find this not to be with caregiving. My wife needed food, clothing, medicines, routine, bathing, exercise, communications, medical care, patient advocacy, and much more. That was all on me. The new level of connection didnt dawn on me right away. Rather it was one day when I was banging around the laundry room. Not particularly happy having to wash another, and unexpected, set of bed linens, nightgowns, etc. while I also had a meal to prepare, a house that was a mess, a boss who was angry I had caregiving duties encroaching in my life, and more. I knew I banged the wash machine lid down harder than I should have when in the silence after I could hear my wife quietly weeping in her bed. Between her sobs I heard her say Damn me! Damn me! I should be doing this for Scott. I stood around the corner frozen by those words. There she was bedridden, fighting brain cancer, and she was mad at herself because I had her laundry to do. I mumbled to myself no, honey. You should be mad at me for acting like a spoiled brat! I steeled myself, walked into our room, sat on the edge of the bed, and held her hand. I have no idea how long we held each other and cried. After some length of time we realized we were each saying the same thing through our tears I am sorry! That day my view of caregiving changed. We both agreed neither of us had chosen our roles, certainly didnt like them better than our previous lives, nor did we have any option but to accept them. I sat alone later that night in silent darkness of our living room and it was then I came to embrace my role as caregiver. Every aspect of her life now depended on me. I had no alternative but to repay that need and her love by accepting my new role with as much grace as I could manage each hour of each day  one day at a time. Over the years many people have asked me how I could have done what I did as a caregiver. My answer has always been the same Love makes you do crazy things! Peace and strength to every caregiver!

That was all on me. The new level of connection didnt dawn on me right away. Rather it was one day when I was banging around the laundry room. Not particularly happy having to wash another, and unexpected, set of bed linens, nightgowns, etc. while I also had a meal to prepare, a house that was a mess, a boss who was angry I had caregiving duties encroaching in my life, and more. I knew I banged the wash machine lid down harder than I should have when in the silence after I could hear my wife quietly weeping in her bed. Between her sobs I heard her say Damn me! Damn me! I should be doing this for Scott. I stood around the corner frozen by those words. There she was bedridden, fighting brain cancer, and she was mad at herself because I had her laundry to do. I mumbled to myself no, honey. You should be mad at me for acting like a spoiled brat! I steeled myself, walked into our room, sat on the edge of the bed, and held her hand. I have no idea how long we held each other and cried. After some length of time we realized we were each saying the same thing through our tears I am sorry! That day my view of caregiving changed. We both agreed neither of us had chosen our roles, certainly didnt like them better than our previous lives, nor did we have any option but to accept them. I sat alone later that night in silent darkness of our living room and it was then I came to embrace my role as caregiver. Every aspect of her life now depended on me. I had no alternative but to repay that need and her love by accepting my new role with as much grace as I could manage each hour of each day  one day at a time. Over the years many people have asked me how I could have done what I did as a caregiver. My answer has always been the same Love makes you do crazy things! Peace and strength to every caregiver!

There is the guilt from the conflicting demands of caregiving and work. The needs of my wide were paramount to me. My boss at my job felt her demands were of more importance. The conflict was unavoidable as was the intense guilt this produced. There is guilt laid on you by others  some unintentional, some not.

595,C0265514,Dermatofibrosis lenticularis disseminata,"C0015672, C0030193, C0392674","Fatigue, Pain, Exhaustion",https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/insights-into-caregiving/,Insights into Caregiving,"Hello to caregivers everywhere! I hope this finds you having as good a day as possible and your burdens not too heavy today. My name is Scott and as some of you already know I was the primary caregiver for my wife during her 14+ year battle with brain cancer. We were married for 41 years and she was 49 when first diagnosed. During the first 8 years of her battle I was employed as well as being her primary caregiver. Due to a new boss who sought only employees who will give 100% to their job with no distractions for the next 5 years I was unemployed and 24/7 fulltime caregiver. For her last 14 months, my wife chose in-home hospice care, during which time I continued to be her 24/7 primary caregiver with some critical support from a terrific hospice team. As you can see, as a caregiver I am what I like to refer to as well-seasoned. It sounds a lot better than tired, battle weary, beat-up, etc. So I go with well-seasoned. I still miss my wife terribly. The adjustment has been challenging for me to manage at times and so far it isnt getting any better. I believe there is not any new normal as so many tell me to go and find, but simply that my life is now just plain different and always will be. This said, I have been spending some time thinking back on the demands and realities of my years as a caregiver. As I say to our children, I call this the good, the bad, and the blurry. The good because it taught me several valuable lessons; the bad as there were far too many truly terrible experiences; and the blurry since much of those years were spent sleep deprived, exhausted, and at sixes and sevens. As I also say to our children caregiving is the only job I ever accepted where there was no employee manual nor training program offered. Just jump in the middle of the ocean and try not to drown! As I look back Ive decided Id like share a few of what I have come to see, in hindsight, as critical aspects of caregiving, how I managed them, and what, if any tricks I learned in the process. I share them here for any other caregiver who wants them. It is often said advice is worth what you pay for it so since this is free you can take it or leave it. No hard feelings as I write this hopefully to not only help others, but as a personal catharsis as well. I offer my insights over the coming days in no particular order. Insight #1: Ghosting The Urban Dictionary defines ghosting as follows: The act of suddenly ceasing all communication with someone. While usually confined to the dating scene, this can occur with equal frequency in caregiving. It meshes nicely with Dr. Martin Luther Kings famous quote In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends. I am a people person. Extroverted, open, and social so this aspect of caregiving was not only difficult for me to manage, but also difficult for me to understand. Plus those who ghosted on us ran the gamut from family to friends and from neighbors to colleagues. I dont pretend to understand why people ghost, but I wish I had been prepared for this aspect of the life of a caregiver and her/his patient. It would have saved my wife and me a lot of heartache and sadness. It still makes me scratch my head in wonder how friends of more than 40 years have yet to even acknowledge my wifes death. Equally how family can decide to visit our home only once in 14 years. How so many forget that the phone, texting, US mail, email, etc. operate in two directions! As I have thought about it I believe a portion of those who ghosted on us did so due to the fact my wifes brain cancer affected her personality. I find it common for people who exhibit less than normal mental capacities to be ignored, shunned, or isolated. Safer and easier to simply wall them off from your life I guess. I also believe a portion of those ghosting do so because it is easier to have a painful thing in our world be out of sight and out of mind. Things, and especially people, are easier to deal with in our minds if we simply choose to ignore them. Rather than reaching out it is more comfortable to accept an internally made-up reason for ones inaction. These days I realize, more than ever, those few people in our lives who made the conscious decision to not ghost on us did so by making a serious effort on their part to stay in our lives at a very difficult time. I am truly thankful to each and every one of them! Their continued connection with us often made the difference between another hellish day and one which contained for us a ray of light and a sliver of hope. A note that makes a caregiver or their patient smile is worth its weight in something far more precious than just gold! I am enjoying taking time now to be certain I continue to let each of these folks know of the importance they had in our lives and continue to have in mine. My father-in-law frequently opined if you can count your friends on one hand you are lucky. He was so very, very right. Peace and strength to every caregiver!

Anyone who is, or has been, a caregiver knows the following: Caregiving aint for wimps! It takes everything a caregiver has and on some days it demands more than we have. But just like the Energizer Bunny, caregivers do their best to keep on going, and going, and going, and.. In my fourteen years as a primary caregiver I have learned to try and be levelheaded in my daily efforts. However, no matter how well-meaning they might be, when someone utters one of the following phrases to me the words drill into my ears and cause me craziness. It then takes me more than a few moments to defuse my reaction and lower my blood pressure. So in the interest of keeping a modicum of peace in the world of caregivers, I offer these statements, which in my humble estimation should never leave anyones lips within earshot of a caregiver. 1) You are a saint. The hell we are! We know better than anyone we are not. We have our moments when our patience is drawn too thin, when we overreact, we hurt more than usual, are sleep deprived, or simply cannot manage all the demands that are coming at us at the same time. 2) You need to take care of yourself. Guess what? Every primary caregiver knows this, especially since after you are a saint it is the phrase we hear more often than any other. The catch is that when you are taking care of someone else fulltime how is it that magically we can put all that on hold and go take care of ourselves? You want caregivers to take care of themselves, then prepare to offer more than just these words. 3) You need to take some time for yourself. This one is particularly rich. Time for yourself when you barely have time to go to the bathroom, take a shower, get the clothes washed, the bed changed, the meals prepared, the dishes washed, the bills paid? Think about itchief cook, bottle washer, and caregiver. 4) I wish there was something I could do to help. Caregiving is extremely isolating. Sure, a caregiver is with their patient 24/7, but that is far different than any semblance of normal social interactions. No matter where you are, no matter how far away you are, there ARE things you can do. They dont need to be big either. Small works just fine. You can reach out with a letter, an email, a call, or a card. You can send a flower, a photo, a joke, a book you like, a clipping from the newspaper, have a pizza delivered. Even the tiniest of tokens says I am thinking of you and I want to help ease your burden. 5) How do you do it? Ill let you in on a caregiving secret here. There is NO magic pill, potion, or system for how any caregiver manages. How we do it is the same way a juggler keeps 10 balls in the air. We do it the same way a house of cards is built, and we, more than anyone, understand that caregiving is exactly thata house of cards. One small change and the whole system can crash. Half the time it seems like we are doing it with smoke and mirrors, but at least it gets done. 6) You should get some help. Great. Thanks. Think that has never crossed a caregivers mind? Let me look back and try and remember whether the last time I thought of this one was before or after the now ex-relief caregiver never bothered to show up for her shift; or before or after the one I had to fire who then burglarized and vandalized our home? Perhaps it was before or after the one who emotionally abused my wife. By the way, are you offering help or just providing me with a platitude? Oh, and speaking of platitudes 7) God doesnt give us more than we can handle. Dont ever, and I mean NOT EVER, speak this misquotation of supposed Scripture to a caregiver. First, you could go look it up, but surprise! Its not anywhere in the Bible. The closest you will come is most likely Corinthians 10:613 and that doesnt say what you may think it does either. So please, please, please! Do every caregiver in the world a huge favor and banish this erroneous statement that, as far as I can tell, only serves to make the one who utters it feel better. 8) Youll get your crown in heaven. See #1 and caregivers are not in this for any stinkin crown now or after we are dead, thank you! 9) How are you doing? This one is OK, but please only say it in private. I cannot tell you how often I was asked this question in front of the person I was caring for. What is a caregiver supposed to say in response? Right in front of the person you are caring for are you expecting something like gee, I am burning out, exhausted, at my wits end, in pain myself, depressed, etc.? 10) You need to find some time to relax. See all of the above and then dont say it again, please. Liked by Colleen Young, Connect Director, 121861, John, Volunteer Mentor, Teresa, Volunteer Mentor ... see all Follow Report"

Let me look back and try and remember whether the last time I thought of this one was before or after the now ex-relief caregiver never bothered to show up for her shift; or before or after the one I had to fire who then burglarized and vandalized our home? Perhaps it was before or after the one who emotionally abused my wife. By the way, are you offering help or just providing me with a platitude? Oh, and speaking of platitudes 7) God doesnt give us more than we can handle. Dont ever, and I mean NOT EVER, speak this misquotation of supposed Scripture to a caregiver. First, you could go look it up, but surprise! Its not anywhere in the Bible. The closest you will come is most likely Corinthians 10:613 and that doesnt say what you may think it does either. So please, please, please! Do every caregiver in the world a huge favor and banish this erroneous statement that, as far as I can tell, only serves to make the one who utters it feel better. 8) Youll get your crown in heaven. See #1 and caregivers are not in this for any stinkin crown now or after we are dead, thank you! 9) How are you doing? This one is OK, but please only say it in private. I cannot tell you how often I was asked this question in front of the person I was caring for. What is a caregiver supposed to say in response? Right in front of the person you are caring for are you expecting something like gee, I am burning out, exhausted, at my wits end, in pain myself, depressed, etc.? 10) You need to find some time to relax. See all of the above and then dont say it again, please. Liked by Colleen Young, Connect Director, 121861, John, Volunteer Mentor, Teresa, Volunteer Mentor ... see all Follow Report"

A week ago, he was prescribed sertraline for the anxiety/agitation/hyperactivity. Everything seemed fine until the day before yesterday, when he started to seem very drowsy. He was more difficult to wake, needed more sleep, and even when I moved him at night, no matter how I placed him, his breathing was labored and he stopped breathing often.

Anyway, this morning he had two grand mal seizures in the early morning hours, two hours apart. That has never happened before. So, no more sertraline. He had recently been prescribed anti-seizure medication  levetiracetam, but I have not yet started him on it because it, too, can cause drowsiness and more confusion.

I hope today, a new weekend, and a new month, brings some goodness to each caregiver everywhere! I send you my best regards and wishes today and everyday. I have been struggling lately with my grief and the loss of my wife. While I am keeping busy, visiting with family and friends, getting out, and trying to establish what my new normal will be in life, I continue to struggle with not only our familys loss, but also one nagging thought. I am wondering if anyone else has confronted this issue. It is this: Everything I read on grief and loss gave me two distinct impressions. One was that there were stages of grief and loss, like steps. Most even called them the stages of grief. Second was that the end of life would be like some movie, book, etc. You know, friends gathered around, smiling, calm, peaceful, angels strumming harps, etc. Well, in my case, and I admit I may be different than most, which is why I bring this up, neither of those two things were true. First neither my wife, children, nor I proceeded through those stages of grief. My wife hit on one and stayed there for years. My children (grown) and grandchildren are not processing grief in those supposed steps either. And for me they were basically unrecognizable. Loss continues for the three of us to be overwhelming at times and the triggers are usually small events, but powerful in their ability to effect new equilibrium. On the issue of loss, I am having a great deal of difficulty getting past the horror of my wifes last two months of life. Her physical pain was controlled, but that was all. My sleep pattern is still a wreck (I was on a 2-hour med regimen for her for her last three months), I am plagued with nightmares about her last months, and how she looked to me and would beg frequently for me to fix it when I could not. I had always been the one to take on her battles and help as best I could until those last days, when it was beyond anyones control. It did not help that we were constantly barraged with (I am sure well-meaning) folks who would tell us over and over either it will end peacefully or that I would welcome her passing. No, it didnt end well and no I dont welcome her passing as I know she would have given anything for even one more minute with us. Grief and loss seem to be more personalized and difficult than anyone actually writes about. Reality might bite, but it beats mythology for caregivers. At least I think so. I would have preferred to be better prepared for reality than the wishful thinking and one-size-fits-all pontificating offered as what to expect. Thanks for listening and Im interested to know if this is just our experiences or perhaps a bit more common than not.

He has been given a vague diagnosis of a nerve injury or myofascial pain. He had a nerve block injection in July which was not successful, however the lidocaine injection that preceded it did relieve his pain for about 30 minutes. He has a rigorous physio therapy and psychology regime, and though his coping and function have improved he has had no relief of pain. He is vomiting daily from pain and only managing 1-2 hours of school daily (with a huge effort). He has been able to be very active, but needs to regulate the intensity of activity as deep breathing increases his pain. There seems to be some connection with the diaphragm/psoas.

I have commented on here before but Ive never started a post. I have been told that I have fibromyalgia for a long time, I also have had a number of accidents with many broken bones and surgeries to put things back together. All of this has resulted in chronic pain, most of it is down my head/back/pelvis/spine and legs. In an effort to try to see more my doctor did a lumbar and pelvic MRI last week. Turns out I have a cyst on my spine called a perineural or Tarlov cyst. Its basically assistant starts at the nerve root and herniates out filling with spinal fluid. I guess theres like a leak from your spine to this cyst but the system itself is made up of nerves. Its the best of my understanding at this point. Mine is at the S2 location, and can cause pain from your back down your bottom and down your legs and includes some pretty severe headaches because its upsetting the pressure of the spinal fluid around the brain. Again this is the best of my understanding of what Ive been told. It certainly explains a lot of my symptoms that have been contributed to fibromyalgia and broken bones.

I have commented on here before but Ive never started a post. I have been told that I have fibromyalgia for a long time, I also have had a number of accidents with many broken bones and surgeries to put things back together. All of this has resulted in chronic pain, most of it is down my head/back/pelvis/spine and legs. In an effort to try to see more my doctor did a lumbar and pelvic MRI last week. Turns out I have a cyst on my spine called a perineural or Tarlov cyst. Its basically assistant starts at the nerve root and herniates out filling with spinal fluid. I guess theres like a leak from your spine to this cyst but the system itself is made up of nerves. Its the best of my understanding at this point. Mine is at the S2 location, and can cause pain from your back down your bottom and down your legs and includes some pretty severe headaches because its upsetting the pressure of the spinal fluid around the brain. Again this is the best of my understanding of what Ive been told. It certainly explains a lot of my symptoms that have been contributed to fibromyalgia and broken bones. Again theyre not really sure what causes them but they think trauma in that area could be a contributor. I just wondered if anyone else had heard of this or experienced it.

Exhausting. I'm very stifled in this body which carries through to my life and overall well being. I'm bored and lonelyit's isolating when you have difficulty being a part of normal civilization due to various health conditions. I desperately want to be what I used to besomeone who could physically accomplish the simplest of tasks, partake in normal family functions like a dinner or a small birthday party. Im so frustrated by hurting 24/7and deeply mourn the loss of what I used to be. I work desperately to keep myself focused on what I CAN do verses what I can't but, when I repeatedly get shot down by my diseases amd diagnoses, disappointment is inevitable. I know I've come to the right place others here share my struggles. Thank you for letting me fall back on you. Today I'm just at my wits end.

I am on short-term disability now with no option to return to my job of 29 years. I would love to see discussion of this type of headaches on the board! I also wanted to post this in case anyone who reads this may be suffereing from this type of headache. To be classified at NDPH, the headaches must have been continual for at least a 3 month period- no time at all headache free. They say that 80% of people with these headaches can tell you the exact time they began. Have you been give a lot of different medications and none of them phased your pain? It seems like a lot of doctors dont know anything about this headache. Both my GP and my first neuro were clueless. They may need you to educate them. Follow Report"

I am hopeful that someone here with similar symptoms can recommend to me some additional testing that would help to identify the problem. Any advice would be greatly appreciated because this is really becoming unbearable for me. I am a female, 30 years of age with no prior serious medical issues. My pain started near the end of October, 2018. I hadnt been doing anything out of the ordinary but one evening I started to feel internal pain deep inside my back starting from my lower spine (sacrum) downward to my tailbone, and spreading deep in my buttocks (primarily the left one). My buttocks in general is extremely sensitive. Physically pushing up on my buttocks causes the pain to increase greatly, and even just a light touch to the skin when i lay on the side and i touch over the skin I feel a pins and needles sensation and almost like a burning feeling. In the beginning the pain would only disappear when I would lay down (on my back or side) in bed. It was impossible for me to sit straight on a chair due to the stabbing pain that I feel internally. I felt like I needed to keep my body straight all time, feeling the need to put a hand on something to help keep myself standing straight to avoid the pain. I cant wear tight pants or anything that puts pressure on my buttocks. Even underwear is an issue. In addition to the pain I have some other symptoms as well. I have begun to feel very weak, tired, and my muscles, bones, and joints hurt. It is becoming harder to use my hands and my arms feel heavy. My fingers feels clumsy and its hard to keep things in my hands. Its becoming more difficult to walk normal because of the pain and I feel like I am losing coordination of my body. I feel thirsty all the time, and I have a tingling sensation as well as shaking in both feet. They are also always cold. All of this is having an effect on my sleep and it is hard for me to get comfortable in bed. While at the beginning the pain in my lower back / buttocks was intermittent, now it is constant. When I sleep I feel like there is something pulsing inside me. Any touch to my skin triggers a sharp pain in my left buttock. My stool has changed as well  sometimes it is extremely dry and hard, while other times it is normal. I recently has a mucus discharge from my rectum as well, but this was a one time occurence. When I need to use the washroom the pain is greater. Finally, this past month my menstruation came 5 days earlier than normal and has never stopped for 3 weeks now, although there is less blood than my usual cycle. I have been to see about 10 different doctors now and have been through a multitude of tests as follows:  Ultrasound of abdomen  doctor said she thought she saw a perianal abscess and recommended an MRI to confirm  Pelvis MRI  nothing observed out of the ordinary  Cocco-femoral and sacrum MRI  nothing observed out of the ordinary  Lumbar MRI  nothing observed out of the ordinary  Several blood tests  blood is normal except for slightly high cholesterol  Rectosigmoidoscopy  Normal  No sign of hemorrhoids, no visual issues with my anus  Normal blood pressure, normal heart rate  Gynecologist exam  Told me the menstruation issue is not related and can sometimes happen due to a hormone irregularity The symptoms seem to me like this is a problem with my nerves or some sort of infection in my intestines but the MRIs and other tests dont show any inflammation there. The doctors are telling me that based on the test results and scans that I am just fine, but I am most certainly not.

I am hopeful that someone here with similar symptoms can recommend to me some additional testing that would help to identify the problem. Any advice would be greatly appreciated because this is really becoming unbearable for me. I am a female, 30 years of age with no prior serious medical issues. My pain started near the end of October, 2018. I hadnt been doing anything out of the ordinary but one evening I started to feel internal pain deep inside my back starting from my lower spine (sacrum) downward to my tailbone, and spreading deep in my buttocks (primarily the left one). My buttocks in general is extremely sensitive. Physically pushing up on my buttocks causes the pain to increase greatly, and even just a light touch to the skin when i lay on the side and i touch over the skin I feel a pins and needles sensation and almost like a burning feeling. In the beginning the pain would only disappear when I would lay down (on my back or side) in bed. It was impossible for me to sit straight on a chair due to the stabbing pain that I feel internally. I felt like I needed to keep my body straight all time, feeling the need to put a hand on something to help keep myself standing straight to avoid the pain. I cant wear tight pants or anything that puts pressure on my buttocks. Even underwear is an issue. In addition to the pain I have some other symptoms as well. I have begun to feel very weak, tired, and my muscles, bones, and joints hurt. It is becoming harder to use my hands and my arms feel heavy. My fingers feels clumsy and its hard to keep things in my hands. Its becoming more difficult to walk normal because of the pain and I feel like I am losing coordination of my body. I feel thirsty all the time, and I have a tingling sensation as well as shaking in both feet. They are also always cold. All of this is having an effect on my sleep and it is hard for me to get comfortable in bed. While at the beginning the pain in my lower back / buttocks was intermittent, now it is constant. When I sleep I feel like there is something pulsing inside me. Any touch to my skin triggers a sharp pain in my left buttock. My stool has changed as well  sometimes it is extremely dry and hard, while other times it is normal. I recently has a mucus discharge from my rectum as well, but this was a one time occurence. When I need to use the washroom the pain is greater. Finally, this past month my menstruation came 5 days earlier than normal and has never stopped for 3 weeks now, although there is less blood than my usual cycle. I have been to see about 10 different doctors now and have been through a multitude of tests as follows:  Ultrasound of abdomen  doctor said she thought she saw a perianal abscess and recommended an MRI to confirm  Pelvis MRI  nothing observed out of the ordinary  Cocco-femoral and sacrum MRI  nothing observed out of the ordinary  Lumbar MRI  nothing observed out of the ordinary  Several blood tests  blood is normal except for slightly high cholesterol  Rectosigmoidoscopy  Normal  No sign of hemorrhoids, no visual issues with my anus  Normal blood pressure, normal heart rate  Gynecologist exam  Told me the menstruation issue is not related and can sometimes happen due to a hormone irregularity The symptoms seem to me like this is a problem with my nerves or some sort of infection in my intestines but the MRIs and other tests dont show any inflammation there. The doctors are telling me that based on the test results and scans that I am just fine, but I am most certainly not. Does anyone here have a similar problem as me and if so can you please let me know what tests you did so that I can request my doctor to have them done? I really need to solve this  it is really becoming unbearable. Thank you so much for your help. Liked by mrector Follow Report"
